<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2013 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Holly Krieger is "Arithmetic and Geometry in Algebraic Dynamics." The host institution for the fellowship is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Bjorn Poonen.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcome of NSF award DMS-1303770 was substantial addition to the mathematical literature on the arithmetic of dynamical systems, using interdisciplinary approaches combining complex dynamics, algebraic geometry, and number theory.  In joint work supported by the award, the first complete case of the dynamical Andr&eacute;-Oort conjecture was proved.  This is a conjecture relating the geometry of a collection of complex dynamical systems to the dynamical properties of the members of the family which falls under the general mathematical umbrella of the theory of unlikely intersections, a field of significant current progress and interest in pure mathematics.  The collaboration that led to this work was made possible by the travel funding and teaching reduction provided by the NSF award, and produced two papers published in high-quality journals.  Additionally, the collaborative group established has continued to be productive beyond the tenure of the award, and is making further progress on new problems of the arithmetic of families of dynamical systems.  This work provides a bridge between the fields of complex dynamics and number theory that is proving to be fruitful for both fields.  The travel permitted by the award also led to an outreach connection with the very popular YouTube channel Numberphile, which provides videos accessible to the public on interesting mathematics as described by mathematicians.
