<AbstractNarration>This project will concern the investigation of controlled reactions of directed incident electron beams with fundamental gaseous atoms and diatomic molecules. The laboratory at Cal State Fullerton will investigate details of the scattering process involving excitation of strong transitions in these targets specifically to look at how spin and orbital angular momentum is imparted by the incident directed electrons onto the target atoms/molecules. The targets chosen are the rare gases (neon, argon, krypton and xenon) and the molecules are hydrogen and nitrogen which have different electron-nuclear couplings. The research also aims to look at the ionization of the atomic targets. The thrust of this is to investigate the basic collision quantum physics that describes such processes. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this work is its involvement in state of the art research of many US undergraduate students at Cal State Fullerton in the laboratory. They then have a significantly increased chance to go onto PhD programs (mostly nationally, but in one case internationally). The research training also provided skills needed for working in industry or in other laboratories. These students get to do frontline research and benefit from collaborating with each other and faculty. It also provides collaborative research between Cal State Fullerton and several other theoretical and experimental collision physics programs, both nationally and internationally. The success of this group with data that tests collision models such as (most recently) the R-matrix B-spline was especially highlighted in the keynote talk at the last American Physical Society- Gaseous Electronics Conference at Salt Lake City. Such type of data is useful for industrial, plasma and astrophysical applications.</AbstractNarration>

We collaborate at an international level with quantum mechanical modelers from USA, Brazil, Australia and UK.  In the last few years, we have made significant progress in the lab:  (i) We have developed a new time-of-flight electron spectrometer for measuring accurate scattering rates from our experiment, which will be used to calibrate such rates from conventional electron spectrometers. This is a unique CSUF design and the only one of its kind in the world today. It has taken us 4 years to bulid the whole system, i.e. the vacuum chamber, magnetic shielding, pulsed electron gun and time-of-flight detector. We are about to submit a paper on electron scattering from molecular hydrogen which puts to rest a long standing problem in the dissciation of molecular hydrogen by low energy electrons, and this data will be used in plasma modeling and planetary atmospheres' modeling.  (ii) Our conventional high resolution spectrometer can detect very slow electrons and we have used it to look at elastic scattering of electrons from bio-molecules and published about 10 papers in this area.  (iii) We have a general purpose electron spectrometer which is being modified to measure ionization of electrons from neon and xenon, as a test of recent quantum mechanical models.  As CSUF is an undergraduate institution, our laboratory involves undergraduate/Masters studens only and they mentored in the lab to do hands on research.
