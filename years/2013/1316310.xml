<AbstractNarration>The exchange of heat and chemical species between the surface and interior of the Earth are controlled by plate tectonics.  Specifically, the Earth?s plates are recycled back into the mantle at subduction zones, where one tectonic plate is forced beneath another.  During subduction some of the material from the descending plate is returned to surface forming the Earth?s crust.  Much of this transport occurs via melting of the subducted material and subsequent volcanism at the surface, however, buoyant material can also return to the surface via solid-state flow in ?diapirs?.  The goal of this project is to study the rise of these buoyant diapirs using a combination of laboratory experiments and numerical models.  We will use these models to ascertain where and when diapirs form and to determine the relationship between diapir characteristics (volume/buoyancy) and ascent paths from the descending slab to the surface.  Because buoyant diapirs will have different chemical signatures than the melts generated directly from the subducting plate, understanding the efficiency of this process is critical for determining chemical evolution of the Earth.  This project will also support the education of a PhD student and a post-doctoral research fellow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While many previous studies have investigated mantle flow driven by the subducting slab, relatively few have focused on the ascent of buoyant material from the slab back to the surface.  In this project we will characterize the 3 stages of diapir evolution: formation stage, rise stage, and arrival stage, and determine how each is influenced by the plate-driven mantle wedge flow field.  The laboratory experiments will be used to model the pathways and interaction of ascending diapirs in three dimensions as a function of specific aspects of the plate-driven flow field, including slab rollback, along-strike variations in slab geometry (e.g., slab edges, gaps, changes in dip), and deformation of the overriding plate.  Diapirs will be initiated assuming different buoyancy sources including a point source, line source, and sheet of buoyant material on the surface of the down-going slab.  We expect that diapir ascent paths will be strongly influenced by diapir volume (buoyancy) flux and the pattern of flow in the mantle wedge?potentially resulting in large horizontal net transport of buoyant slab-derived material to the surface.  High-resolution numerical models will then be used to study melting and melt-matrix interaction within the spectrum of ascending diapirs based upon density contrast, diapir size, path shape and transit time.  Such models are important for characterizing chemical differentiation within diapirs.  Combining the laboratory experiments with the numerical models, we will be able to place important new constraints on how chemical signals can be transported from the slab to the surface in subduction zones.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[         The central theme of this project is to advance our understanding of the processes controlling magma generation and transport in subduction zones, one of the primary modes for heat/mass transport from the deep Earth to Earth?s surface.   The 55,000 km long system of subduction zones is responsible for processes that define our surface environment: volcanic output, continental growth, mountain building, faulting, major earthquakes, tsunami generation, composition and mass of the atmosphere and oceans.   Our work produces improved models for the interplay between plate tectonics, mantle circulation and magma delivery back to the surface through constructs called volcanic arcs, or island arcs, which has been a challenging problem for past models due to the extreme range in length scales that must be represented.   These range from the 1000 km length scales of tectonic plates moving through subduction zones and related mantle flow, to length scales of 1 km for buoyant upwellings, called diapirs, that are shed from the topside of downgoing plates.  Modeling tools must also represent the scales by which mantle melt (molten rock) moves relative to the material in the rising diapirs, bringing the total length scale range from 0.001-1000 km, or 6 orders of magnitude.       On this project our team has utilized a multi-model approach, one that combines physical laboratory fluids models with very high resolution numerical/computer models.   A unique aspect of this work is that with our colleagues from Woods Hole (Behn, Zhang), the combination of laboratory geodynamical models and numerical models covers the required, extreme range in scales.  We develop laboratory models of subduction, background mantle flow and diapirs that utilize a real fluid, capable of simulating processes over essentially an infinite range in length scales. However, lab models cannot represent melt migration.    For this we utilize very high resolution numerical models of small scale heat and chemical transport within diapirs, where the evolution of diapirs on their rise within the mantle are prescribed from the lab models.   The suite of lab geodynamical subduction models are the first ones to represent three-dimensional, time-evolving (or 4-D) circulation of the mantle wedge that include various real world aspects of these systems: a) different modes of plate sinking (constant dip angle, rollback steepening), b) the influence of gaps or tears in the sinking plate and c) the influence of high or low viscosity residuum material, or what is left behind in the wedge after melt/magma extraction has occurred.  Results underscore the importance of including real-world plate motions and moving from 2-D to 4-D representations of subduction zone processes.  For each style of background mantle flow, an extensive suite of models on subduction-diapir interactions in the mantle wedge have been completed.  One particularly interesting outcome is that often used schematic representations of vertical magma ascent in subduction zones is found to be nearly impossible to produce in the 4D models.  Instead, magma expressed through the system of subduction zone volcanoes is far more likely to have followed a complex, circuitous path from deep mantle source to its eruption into the light of day.  A number of factors are shown to influence how deeper magma presents itself at the surface.  The common, and often neglected paddle-like mode of subduction, the so-called rollback motion of sinking lithopshere, produces the most pronounced deflections of diapirs between source and surfacing locations.   An unexpected result is that this simple interaction of rollback flow with diapirs can explain linear, age progressive volcanic tracks observed in regions like the Cascades Convergent Margin and the Western USA (e.g. the High Lava Plains and the Snake River Plain).   The presence of a gap or window in the sinking plate can also lead to severely distorted diapir pathways and timelines, that need ot be considered in building interpretations for surface geologic data sets.   Finally, lab models reveal a new mode for interactions between diapirs that can greatly effect rise rates, rise paths, surfacing locations and geochemical interpretations.    The complexity of connecting the magma at a specific volcano to the deeper source region of that magma, highlighted so clearly in the lab models, has been incorporated into teaching units.  Students are asked to place passive tracers deep within the 4D subduction/viscous fluid flow models of convergent margins, in locations that allow them to surface beneath a hypothetical volcano.  Through this fun activity students rapidly develop an intuition for 4D subduction flows, and a realization for how unlikely the simple schematic diagrams used in most textbooks are for representing actual transport pathways.  The physical, hands-on subduction lab models developed on this project have been effective at engaging students in geodynamics. Future goals include making the subduction lab models more accessible to a range of university and high school classes using web-based, remote learning technologies.
