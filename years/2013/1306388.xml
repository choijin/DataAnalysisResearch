<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), Professor Gary Eiceman at New Mexico State University and his group will explore and develop enhanced capabilities in chemical measurements using ion mobility spectrometry (IMS).  Increases in specificity of a chemical identification of substances through IMS will be introduced using orthogonality provided by ion transformations in a tandem differential IMS analyzer.  Ions which are mobility selected in a first mobility analyzer and passed into a reactive zone, are subsequently reacted or fragmented using molecule selective pathways before entering a second mobility analyzer.  Orthogonality can be added through changes in strong electric fields and studies will disclose quantitatively the effect of field strength and ion structure on dissociation or fragmentation reactions.  Investigations will focus, for selected pharmaceutical substances and pesticides, on the stability and mobility of clusters formed between sample-derived ions and specific reagent gases.  The influence on ion chemistry and chemical orthogonality of temperature, moisture, and vapor concentrations in air at ambient pressure will be explored and assessed for specificity of chemical measurements toward a next generation of IMS instruments.  Ion mobility spectrometry is central to military preparedness and commercial aviation security with emerging impact in clinical diagnostics and industrial process control.  Impacts of these studies should include the education of a new generation of students in gas phase ion-molecule chemistry at ambient pressure and should provide new capabilities for specific measurement challenges within industry and government.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ion mobility spectrometry is a method for chemical measurements with importance historically in defense and security establishments and with value recently in human metabolomics for clinical diagnoses and medical research.  These measurements can provide the detection of ultra-trace amounts of organic compounds and tentative identification of substances.  In this award, principles were explored and technology developed to enable new and refined capabilities in mobility spectrometry where molecules are processed as gas phase ions sequentially within multiple mobility analyzers at ambient pressure in purified air or nitrogen as shown in Figure 1.  Sequential handling of these ions permitted enhancements over conventional mobility measurements through incorporation of chemical principles, or properties of compounds, along with the physical methods of mobility determination.  Consequently, measurements of substances could be made using small tandem mobility analyzers (Figure 2) with previously unattained selectivity and response times in milliseconds.  A new measurement concept of dual stage ion filtering was introduced in this project and is shown in Figure 3.  Advances in measurements were demonstrated by introducing another layer of specificity through chemical transformation of ions in a middle stage between mobility analyzers.  An example includes the high speed determination of pesticide organophosphorous compounds with high specificity of detection following conversion of the sample ion to a new species described in Figure 4.  The foundations for previously unattainable capability to identify chemicals by ion mobility spectrometry, as shown in Figure 5, were established through discoveries on the fragmentation of organic compounds, as gas ions at ambient pressure, in strong electric fields.  Fragmentation yields chemical class information about a substance and, when introduced between stages of a sequential mobility analyzer, should significantly alter the importance and practice of ion mobility measurements internationally.  Immediate impacts have occurred with five graduate students who completed dissertations or research experiences at the graduate level and two undergraduate students, often with three postdoctoral fellows as associates.  Students have developed proficiency in gas-ion reaction chemistry at ambient pressure, electronics, and modern instrumentation measurements, participating in laboratory research and scientific discovery.  Developments of technology and new understandings in measurement science have impacted communities of measurement scientists and engineers through dissemination in four journal articles, four manuscripts, and seventeen presentations at conferences both national and international.  Results from these investigations have been incorporated already in plans and efforts of one instrument manufacturer of mobility spectrometers and initiated collaborations with research groups in two European universities.
