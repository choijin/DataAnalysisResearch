<AbstractNarration>1353018&lt;br/&gt;Weiland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this EAGER proposal, they will conduct initial experiments to study neural plasticity in both blind humans with retinal implants and in animal models of retinal degeneration. They expect that these initial experiments will establish the experimental techniques and data analysis methods needed to conduct important, ground-breaking studies on the basic neuroscience underlying sight restoration. The objectives are:  1: Assess cortical representations of electrical retinal stimulations delivered via the Argus II retinal prosthesis; 2: Assess cortical plasticity associated with retinal prosthesis use; and 3: Measure neural plasticity in an animal model of retinal degeneration using chronic stimulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of these objectives will demonstrate feasibility of a set of core techniques that are foundational and transformative for advancing the development of retinal prostheses and the understanding of cortical plasticity in implant recipients.</AbstractNarration>
