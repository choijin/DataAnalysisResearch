<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the California Academy of Sciences (CAS), located in San Francisco, CA, will support the training of 8 undergraduate students for 8 weeks during the summers of 2014-2018. During the program, students will work with CAS scientists on research projects on biodiversity. Given the abundant resources of the museum, it can support research projects on the systematics, phylogenetics, and biogeography of a diverse range of organisms including extinct human ancestors, spiders, turtles, birds, fish, ants, marine invertebrates, and plants. By conducting an independent research project, students will be trained in a range of research techniques. Depending on the nature of the particular project, students may gain experience with light and scanning electron microscopy, molecular phylogenetics, and/or next-generation sequencing technologies. In addition, students will receive lectures on systematic biology, take educational tours of the facility, and participate in community-building activities. Students will also learn about the ethics of collections-based science, responsible conduct of research in a museum setting, appropriate data collection and archiving, and informed attitudes towards preserving the world's biodiversity. Furthermore, students will develop oral communication skills through the process of preparing a presentation of their research findings, which are highlighted in a symposium at the end of the program. In conjunction with educators, CAS has developed program assessment tools that provide feedback on every aspect of the program and will also employ the common assessment tool for BIO REU Sites. Interested students are encouraged to contact prospective mentors before applying since shared interests between the mentor and student are a key component of the application process. Letters of recommendation, a statement of interest, and academic performance are also used in the selection process. The program places particular emphasis on attracting students from groups that are under-represented in the sciences.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CAS REU program hopes to foster in its participants a long-term interest in science by promoting scientific engagement that extends beyond the program's end.  Specifically, student participants will be encouraged to present their research at domestic and international scientific conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://research.calacademy.org/opportunities/ssi, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Rich Mooi at ssi-bi@calacademy.org).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intellectual Merit:</p> <p>What is biodiversity? Where is it found? How is it studied? How can it be preserved? These are questions firmly in the wheelhouse of a natural history museum. The California Academy of Sciences is one of the top global centers for the study of biodiversity. It houses not only foremost scientists, but both living and preserved research collections. These provide material for studies of form, fossils, and DNA from life forms across the span of Earth's environments, from our own backyards to greatest depths of the sea.</p> <p>"Systematics" is the focused study of biodiversity, working hard to answer questions like those above. Blending our scientific expertise with the nascent interests of undergraduates in our program, the Summer Systematics Institute (SSI) enriches our career ladder experience. Most importantly, we introduce students from across the U.S. to multi-faceted, essential approaches towards understanding biodiversity, aiming to preserve it in the face of many challenges to natural environments, global and local.</p> <p>The SSI is designed to take full advantage of our expertise, and our unparalleled collections. The latter are held in perpetual trust for all future generations of scientists, whether just starting, as our REU students are, on the road towards a career in this fascinating and rewarding field, or deep into a lifetime of biodiversity discovery.</p> <p>Broader Impacts:</p> <p>For the past five years of the SSI, 40 students, well over half of which came from groups under-represented in science or from backgrounds and institutions that did not have research opportunities in their curricula, learned about everything from disease-causing microbes (never more relevant than now) to prehistoric environmental change, to the extreme diversity of ants, sea urchins, and sea slugs. During our 8-week program and beyond, they learned and applied a wide range of developments in computer analysis, DNA sequencing, and techniques for imaging and analyzing plants, animals, and even viruses. They worked one-on-one with top experts in their fields on novel research projects advancing knowledge of the process of evolution, as well as patterns revealed in a tree of life for their groups of organisms -- patterns crucial to questions about the vast landscape of life on our planet. Students acquired "tools of the trade" in systematics, worked next to a student biological illustrator, and presented their results in highly organized, compelling presentations to their peers and to international conference audiences, where they also won top awards for their work.</p> <p>Using a synthesis of seminars, lab studies, and mentoring of original research projects, the SSI brought to these students' eyes a view of career opportunities and indeed a passion for research that changed them forever towards considering a life in science. Many are now pursuing graduate degrees in biodiversity studies, some of them with Academy researchers, closing a loop designed to produce the next generation of scientists.</p> <p>Here are some facts and figures about our program from 2014 to 2019. All 40 students participating in the SSI during the 5 years covered by the REU grant were from outside the Academy, and 39 different universities and 9 community colleges were represented from 18 different states and one country (Croatia). Among the home institutions of the students, 63% lacked a doctoral program in biology.</p> <p>Over the 5-year span of the SSI, 78% of the students were female, and 68% were from groups under-represented in the sciences: 43% were of Hispanic background, 8% identified as African American, 13% as native American/Alaskan native, 5% as Pacific Islanders or Hawaiian natives. Of these, 23% were from a community colleges, and 63% were from institutions that do not grant doctorates in biology.</p> <p>In the cumulative pool of nearly 1500 applicants, 48 states, 2 territories, 1 district (and about 10 countries) were represented: CA (509); MA (90); NY (88); WA (61); PA (49); OH (45); IL (43); NC (39); OR (36); NJ (35); FL (32); MD (31); TX (31); MI (29); MN (28); CT (24); CO (24); VA (22); ME (19); IA (17); GA (16); IN (15); MO (14); WI (14); PR (14); VT (10); HI (8); KS (8); KY (8); LA (8); RI (8); AZ (7); NH (5); NM (5); SC (5); TN (5); AL (4); ID (4); NE (4); OK (4); UT (4); AR (3); DC (3); MS (2); MT (2); ND (2); SC (2); SD (2); WV (2); NV (1); GU (1).</p> <p>Among these applicants, 72% were female. About 20% of all applicants identified themselves as being from groups under-represented in the sciences: 13% were of Hispanic origin, 4% Black or African American, 1% native American or Alaskan native, and 1% native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander. Therefore, over the life of the program, we selected a greater percentage of students from each of these groups than was represented in the applicant pool.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/08/2020<br>      Modified by: Rich&nbsp;Mooi</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1358680/1358680_10293665_1586369315184_1CaliforniaAcademyofSciences--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1358680/1358680_10293665_1586369315184_1CaliforniaAcademyofSciences--rgov-800width.jpg" title="California Academy of Sciences"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1358680/1358680_10293665_1586369315184_1CaliforniaAcademyofSciences--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="California Academy of Sciences"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The setting for the Summer Systematics Institute (SSI), the California Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, is home to top researchers and 60 million natural history specimens.</div> <div class="imageCredit">California Academy of Sciences</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rich&nbsp;Mooi</div> <div class="imageTitle">California Academy of Sciences</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1358680/1358680_10293665_1586369885302_2Fieldtriptotidepools--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1358680/1358680_10293665_1586369885302_2Fieldtriptotidepools--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Field trip to tidepools"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1358680/1358680_10293665_1586369885302_2Fieldtriptotidepools--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Field trip to tidepools"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The SSI included local field work and learning opportunities such as hikes and examination of organisms living in tide pools.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rich Mooi</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rich&nbsp;Mooi</div> <div class="imageTitle">Field trip to tidepools</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1358680/1358680_10293665_1586369968372_3Groupactivity--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1358680/1358680_10293665_1586369968372_3Groupactivity--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SSI group activity"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1358680/1358680_10293665_1586369968372_3Groupactivity--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SSI group activity"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Group activities included lectures from scientists, training and laboratory exercises, icebreaker events and group dinners, and other activities.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rich Mooi</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rich&nbsp;Mooi</div> <div class="imageTitle">SSI group activity</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1358680/1358680_10293665_1586370057539_4Presentation--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1358680/1358680_10293665_1586370057539_4Presentation--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SSI presentation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1358680/1358680_10293665_1586370057539_4Presentation--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SSI presentation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">At the end of the SSI, students presented research findings in the form of a talk in front of their peers and all interested Academy staff.
