<AbstractNarration>This EArly Grant for Exploratory Reserach (EAGER) award provides funding for exploration preparation of novel giant magnetoresistance (GMR) magnetic carbon nanocomposites by combining the stability of carbon and strong magnetization of metal nanoparticles, potentially providing promising alternatives to the traditional metal GMR materials. This project will involve the surface functionalization of commercial magnetic nanoparticles and will evaluate the feasibility of the large scale production of carbon nanocomposites. The stabilization, carbonization and graphitization conditions needed to treat these polymer nanocomposites will be determined to allow the large scale manufacturing of GMR magnetic carbon nanocomposites. The feasibility of using graphitic carbon to protect magnetic nanoparticles against oxidation will be tested and process-structure-property relationships will be established.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research will provide novel magnetic carbon nanocomposites for magnetic field sensing, and also will unveil the nature of the electron magneto-transport in these novel GMR materials. This will advance the knowledge required to manufacture next-generation GMR materials and provide transformative sensing nanotechnology. As compared to the easy oxidation of conductive metals, magnetic carbon nanocomposites may potentially be applied in telecoms, electronics, sensors, anode catalysts and the aerospace industry, due to their easy manufacturing, better mechanical properties, high stability in acids, and isotropic properties. They also have potential for device miniaturization and light weight. The success of this EAGER project will provide initial evaluations on these GMR magnetic carbon nanocomposites for magnetic field sensing in harsh environments and make their deployment more attractive to both industrial researchers and academic scientists.</AbstractNarration>

The MR results of the as-received CFs and PANI/CFs with 30 wt% PANI loading at 130 and 290 K were shown in Figure 3. The small negative MR (~ 0.1%) is observed for the as-receive CFs in the vertical direction. However, the positive MR is observed for the PANI/CFs with a 5.0 wt% PANI loading at 290 K.
