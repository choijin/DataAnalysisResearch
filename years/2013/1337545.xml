<AbstractNarration>Technical Descrition:&lt;br/&gt;This award from the National Science Foundation is for the acquisition of an electrospinning system for cutting-edge research in nanofibers.  It will be used by faculty from the Mechanical Engineering, Chemistry, Material Science, and Biology departments at Georgia Southern University in a wide variety of research projects, from generating new avenues for cancer therapeutics, biocompatible nanofibers, lightweight ultra-tough hybrid fibers, multifunctional materials to antimicrobial coatings and compounds with extraordinary thermal, mechanical and biological properties, to name just a few. The acquisition of the electrospinning system will greatly enhance the emerging group of nanotechnology researchers at Georgia Southern University and southeast Georgia.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;This award from the National Science Foundation is for the acquisition of an electrospinning system for cutting-edge research in nanofibers. The  instrument will be an important resource for rural southeast Georgia, strengthening the already existing ties with Armstrong Atlantic University, South University, and Savannah State University, as well as industry, and establishing new partnerships.  Undergraduate and graduate students throughout southeast Georgia will benefit from exposure to research and courses on nanofiber- and nanotechnology that otherwise does not exist in this form in this region, providing hands-on, real-life experiences and preparing them for their careers.  To strengthen the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) pipeline, the PIs will develop a professional development workshop for high school teachers in rural southeast GA sponsored by an industry partner, Solvay Specialty Polymers (Alpharetta, GA).</AbstractNarration>

The instrument has been in the center of nanomaterials and nanostructure research, training and education in Georgia Southern university. Faculties and students across disciplines (Engineering, chemistry and Biology) have used it. Along with Georgia Southern University, faculties, engineers and students from Augusta University, Central Michigan University, Newberry College, SC, University of South Carolina and Solvay Specialty polymers have used the equipment through collaborative research work. A week long summer nanotechnology workshop was conducted using the instrument to provide high school science and math teachers&rsquo; knowledge based and hands on training with nanofibers and nanoscale materials. During the week long training they worked with the NNIN to learn how to introduce concepts of nanoscale into their classrooms within existing curriculum and developed working lesson plans that they could take into their classrooms. Approximately 20 research publication and presentation resulted in the reputed journals and international and regional conferences. A US patent (<strong>Reference No: 10485-007PV1)</strong> has been submitted on cancer drug loaded nanofibers and nanoparticles through the,<strong> </strong>Georgia Southern University Research and Service Foundation Intellectual Property Disclosure. A book chapter &ldquo;Nanoscale Reinforcement of Polymer Textile Fibers,Encyclopedia of Nanoscience an Nanotechnology,Editor- Dr. H.S.
