<AbstractNarration>Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the national challenge of defining and building resilience to hazards that would engage the ?whole nation,? including scientists, governmental agencies at all levels of jurisdiction, private and nonprofit organizations, and communities. To meet this challenge, it is essential to define, design, and demonstrate an interdisciplinary, dynamic process that will transform societal understanding of risk and enable self-organized, collective action to support the resilient management of hazards. This study will identify and model the interactions among physical, engineered, and sociotechnical systems that occur in hazard emergence and response as a complex, adaptive system of systems (CASoS) to enhance resiliency in practice and enable communities to manage the risk of hazards within existing resource and time constraints. It will use the threat of Near-Field Tsunamis (NFTs; i.e., waves generated within 200 miles of shore) in a location prone to this risk, Padang, West Sumatra, Indonesia as a case study to investigate methods of assessing accurately and efficiently the dynamics of NFTs generated by undersea earthquakes or landslides as they impact human communities. This process is an iterative search for information under evolving conditions to inform decisions at multiple levels of action in response to shared risk.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five basic research questions drive this project:&lt;br/&gt;1.What instruments, metrics, media, tools, and technologies are most effective in enabling communities at risk to collect, access, and exchange information about risk?&lt;br/&gt;2.What types of information and what forms of communication contribute most effectively to collective recognition of risk, creating public awareness of a shared threat to safety?&lt;br/&gt;3.To what extent does investment in data collection, analysis, search, and exchange enable more informed decision making in community environments exposed to long-term risk, and reduce the potential for ecological, social, and economic losses from episodic catastrophes?&lt;br/&gt;4.What causal models, based on combined real-time and stored data for social and physical systems, offer alternative strategies for collective action to protect community population, infrastructure, and resources?&lt;br/&gt;5.How can the proposed resilience models, methods and tools for collective action be used to assess accurately and efficiently the dynamics of NFTs generated by undersea earthquakes or landslides and enable collective action to manage the impact of hazards on coastal communities?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will test the following four hypotheses:&lt;br/&gt;1.Computational modeling of complex adaptive relationships under uncertain conditions increases collective understanding of tsunami risk and increases collective problem solving capacity. &lt;br/&gt;2.Multiple patterns of information dissemination regarding risk among community residents increase the efficiency of self-organized collective action.&lt;br/&gt;3.Timely, accurate transmission of tsunami risk increases efficiency in targeting evacuation procedures to diverse community groups and areas with different degrees of exposure.&lt;br/&gt;4.Detecting the temporal rate of seismic motion, or source slowness, discriminates tsunami earthquakes from non-tsunami earthquakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This study envisions communities that learn to assess hazards endemic to the environment and that have the capacity to make collective decisions informed by scientific knowledge, leading to timely, effective risk reduction. Findings from this project will redefine the science of community resilience and enable at-risk communities to create learning environments in which they collectively assess, respond, and recover from extreme events. Models for collective action demonstrated in this project will increase collective problem solving capacity for minimizing losses and maximizing actions for innovative, sustainable risk reduction. The most vulnerable groups in society--women, children, minorities, elderly?will benefit as communities initiate risk reduction measures, and as leaders trained in interdisciplinary skills guide citizens in responsible management of resources and risk assessment. Developing dynamic methods for managing sociotechnical systems will enhance SEES  education. The CASoS prototype, deployed and tested in Indonesia, will benefit the global society.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Five key outcomes were achieved in this final Project Year 6 for Hazard SEES:</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p> <p>1. Hazard SEES successfully validated a prototype network of undersea sensors and cables for early tsunami detection and warning in the Mentawai Sea, Indonesia.&nbsp; The prototype includes three basic components: 1) an undersea node anchored to the ocean floor that includes a bottom pressure sensor for detecting change in the water column due to undersea earthquakes or landslides, a communications sensor, software programs, and batteries to operate the instruments; 2) a cabled receiver located approximately 7 km from shore to receive data transmitted acoustically from the undersea node and relay it to a shore station; and 3) a solar-powered shore station constructed on Siberut Island to receive data from the undersea node and transmit it via satellite to BMKG, the scientific agency in Jakarta that officially issues tsunami warnings. All three components were implemented and the connections among them were tested successfully at sea.&nbsp; The communications process among the three components worked clearly and timely. Yet, the cable laying process fell short approximately 2 km from shore, hindered by use of small ship without the sophisticated equipment and software to monitor carefully the rate of release of the cable in deep water. This gap will be met by splicing an additional 2 km of cable to the existing cable and completing the connection to the shore station for a fully operational, working prototype.</p> <p>2. Successful transmission of data via acoustic communication over a distance of 25 km. under water documented the scientific principle of the thermocline layer of warm equatorial waters that extends the range of sonar communication.&nbsp; This principle had been demonstrated in an underwater experiment in March 2016, but the more complete, rigorous testing of the instruments, software, batteries, and design of the undersea prototype validated this outcome with systematic evidence in Project Year 6. The ocean bottom unit, initially programmed to report data every hour, is reset to report data every day, unless triggered by severe underground shaking that signals disruption of the ocean floor.&nbsp;Validation of the principle of extended sonar communication in an ocean environment represents an innovative, transformative change in the design, policy, and practice of early tsunami detection and warning.</p> <p><strong>Broader Social Impact</strong></p> <p>3. The validated prototype for early detection and acoustic transmission of data will be considered by the relevant scientific and operational agencies of Indonesia for official adoption into the Indonesia Tsunami Early Warning System (INATEWS). This innovative change in early tsunami detection and warning will have a fundamental impact on detection and warning systems developed for coastal hazards. This discovery will enable developing countries like Indonesia to implement early tsunami detection and warning systems that provide reliable early warning of tsunamis at a fraction of the cost of undersea cabled systems.&nbsp; This discovery will have a substantive impact on the design of ocean engineering systems for reduction of coastal hazards and potentially save thousands of lives in coastal cities vulnerable to tsunamis.</p> <p>4. The preparation and submission of a proposal for an edited book,&nbsp;<em>Hazardous Seas: A Sociotechnical Approach to Early Tsunami Detection and Warning</em>, to Island Press, led to a signed book contract to publish the book in 2020. The book will document the design, testing, and deployment of the undersea network conducted in PY6. &nbsp;It will also present the design, models, tests, and evidence from research conducted in Project Years 1-5 to develop a neighborhood network of electronic devices to facilitate interactive communication among community residents in disaster-degraded neighborhoods. The neighborhood network is designed to facilitate interactive communication among local government emergency personnel and local residents to inform evacuation strategies after receiving a tsunami warning. Such a network will have a major impact on local preparedness actions at the neighborhood level which has least access to timely, valid information in urgent tsunami events, resulting in greatest loss of life and property damage.</p> <p>5. The Swiss Re Foundation, Zurich, Switzerland, invited a proposal for partial support of the production costs of the book,&nbsp;<em>Hazardous Seas</em>, and organization of a one-day workshop to introduce the book to policy makers and practicing managers in conjunction with a regional biennial preparedness exercise conducted by the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System (IOTWMS) in 2020. The book is under contract to Island Press, and copies will be distributed to exercise participants from 24 nations that rim the Indian Ocean as an introduction to this innovative method of early tsunami detection and warning. Models, tested designs, and evidence presented in the book will substantially influence disaster preparedness and training programs and contribute to a new science of coastal hazard reduction that integrates concepts and methods from ocean engineering, computer science, seismology, public policy, urban planning, and information sciences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/09/2020<br>      Modified by: Louise&nbsp;K&nbsp;Comfort</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1331463/1331463_10269097_1578601830978_Figure11(3)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1331463/1331463_10269097_1578601830978_Figure11(3)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Tidal image transmitted from remote instrument 25 km away"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1331463/1331463_10269097_1578601830978_Figure11(3)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Tidal image transmitted from remote instrument 25 km away"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Tidal signal transmitted by acoustic modem from remote instrument 25 km away from cable end.
