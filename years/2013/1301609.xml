<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: An Experimental Study of Relativistic, Stochastic Heating of Electrons During the Irradiation of Wavelength-scale Plasmas by a Strong-Laser Field&lt;br/&gt;A renewal proposal from PIs T. Ditmire (University of Texas) and T. Donnelly (Harvey Mudd College)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports a collaboration between Prof. Ditmire at the University of Texas at Austin (UT) and Prof. Donnelly at Harvey Mudd College (HMC), an undergraduate institution. We will investigate mechanisms by which high-intensity laser pulses deposit energy into matter.  While the nature of intense laser interactions with atoms, molecules, and solids has been studied for many years, exactly how intense laser pulses interact with objects that are of a spatial scale comparable to the light's wavelength (less than a millionth of a meter) is largely unexplored.  We will focus a 20 TW laser - a laser with nearly ten times the power of that on the entire US electrical grid - onto wavelength-scale targets and study the resulting electron and ions energies to study the mechanisms by which laser energy is absorbed by the target.   The scientific merit of this work rests in filling this gap in our knowledge of physics, and in developing improved x-ray and neutron sources.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader scientific impacts of this research rest in advancing the understanding of high-intensity laser interactions with a class of targets not previously well explored.  Application of these studies may aid in the development of improved x-ray sources for radiography and time-resolved diffraction, or compact neutron sources for imaging other systems.  The broader educational impact of this work is found in the training that both graduate and undergraduate students will receive.  Our work represents a unique collaboration in which an undergraduate group is directly and critically involved in strong-field-physics research, a field which is prohibitively resource intensive for an undergraduate research program to pursue alone.  The undergraduates funded by this grant will have the opportunity to do research at HMC, travel to UT in the summers to participate in research using equipment they have developed, and travel to conferences to present their work to the scientific community.  Our collaboration will continue to be an effective way to motivate undergraduates to seek advanced degrees in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of our project under this NSF award was to provide direct experimental evidence for stochastic electron heating in the relativistic regime and study its effects on electron and ion ejection during an interaction between intense laser pulses and laser-wavelength-scale targets.  The occurrence of stochastic heating is characterized by a laser intensity scaling of electron energy that differs from that of plasma slabs much larger than a laser wavelength, and also in the  target dimensions that yield the highest-energy heated electrons.  This project was a collaborative effort between the University of Texas at Austin (Prof. Ditmire?s group) and Harvey Mudd College (Prof. Donnelly?s group). We developed target etching and deposition techniques that yielded wire targets and spherical particles of the desired size (0.05 &ndash; 20 &micro;m), a crucial requirement for stochastic heating to occur when interacting with a laser of approximately 1-&micro;m wavelength. We carried out experiments at the laser labs of UT Austin involving undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and staff scientists. We observed highly energetic electrons from intense-laser irradiated 1-&micro;m wire targets which were absent from targets of much larger size. Further experiments will be undertaken to determine the laser intensity scaling and target size dependence of the electron energies and plasma ion energies.   These experiments were the principal material for Dr. Kristina Serrato?s Ph.D. dissertation.  Kristina graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2016.  Another UT graduate student involved in this project, Dr. Samuel Feldman, went on to complete his Ph.D. on high density plasma equations of state and then worked as a laser engineer in private industry.
