<AbstractNarration>Oregon State University is upgrading key components of the campus core network infrastructure, enabling 10-40 Gbps network connections between research units within a Science DMZ, with interconnects via the DYNES network and Internet2 to external research partners such as XSEDE and iPlant. The upgrades include the campus core aggregation switch, two key data centers and six major data generating laboratories and facilities. Monitoring and optimization of overall network services within the upgraded DMZ includes implementation of perfSONAR for on- and off-campus performance monitoring. The DMZ creates a platform capable of integrating into Internet2 and utilizing DYNES and Software Defined Networking for the dynamic establishment of dedicated research network resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The upgrades transform research in a wide diversity of disciplines at Oregon State University (OSU) that generate and analyze massive data sets that are produced, analyzed and disseminated on- and off-campus. The disciplines affected include genomics and computational biology, image processing and recognition, earthquake and ocean wave physics, landscape remote sensing, pharmacy, clinical veterinary medicine, and earth, atmospheric and ocean sciences. OSU is a land grant, sea grant and sun grant institution. The network upgrades enhance its capability for providing solutions to society's problems in agriculture, aquaculture, forestry, fisheries and wildlife management, marine resource management, water quality management, environmental preservation and restoration, and animal and human health. Furthermore, the improved training and education environment that will be created by the upgrades positively impacts the professional development of graduate students, postdoctoral scholars and undergraduate researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Oregon State University (OSU) has completed the work on the estalishment of its high speed research network. The five goals described in the grant proposal have all been successfully accomplished. A 40 Gigabit per second (Gbps) network optimized for bulk data transfers now links key science buildings and data centers at OSU. The project has had significant impacts beyond its technical product, including a more cohesive campus cyberinfrastructure (CI) community, influence on the design of a major refresh of the OSU network and on state-wide shared CI plans, as well as greater engagement by OSU staff in national CI forums.   The dramatically improved network connections will greatly advance progress in the following research areas at Oregon State University.   Genomics and bioinformatics investigations of Plant systematics and evolution, plant biology, Evolutionary genomics in nematodes, Fungal Evolutionary Biology, Fish and snail host-parasite systems, Microbe-Plant Interactions, coral adaptation to climate change, and Plant RNA Metabolism.    Investigation of the role of exposure to chemicals in the environment and the role of such environmental stresses in cancer, heart disease and neurodegeneration at the Environmental Health Sciences Center.   High throughput environmental and developmental research investigations of zebra fish using genomic, metabolomic, biochemical, morphological, physiological, and behavioral assays, at the Sinnhuber Aquatic Research Lab.   Computational reserch into avian ecology in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.    Imaging analysis in Clinical Veterinary Medicine and Animal Research   Use of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging; an advanced 3D mapping technology) to study coastal erosion, volcanic hazards, earthquake hazards, forestry biomass calculations, landslide and slope stability evaluation, flood modeling, soil mapping.   Use of satellite data to study Ecological Change in the Amazon   Use of remote sensing in ecology in forest ecology   Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Tsunami Research Facility (TRF).   The Northwest Alliance for Computational Science &amp; Engineering (NACSE)   Multi-scale Fluid Dynamics Modeling on the XSEDE Resource   Use of high performance computing to study molecular aspects of materials and organic chemistry research.
