<AbstractNarration>Scientific research is increasingly reliant on advanced social and technical infrastructures called cyberinfrastructure (CI). In turn, the cornerstone of scientific cyberinfrastructure is Scientific Cyberinfrastructure Software (SCIS) that enables data collection from digital instruments, analysis of data through the execution of mathematical algorithms, data visualization and sharing of data through standardized file formats and widely accessible databases. Despite the importance of SCIS for data-intensive research, too little is known about how scientists actually use, adopt and develop scientific software. More research is needed to explore how software, software development and software sharing practices are, and can be, community products, resources or practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will examine how scientists develop SCIS as part of their day-to-day research practice through a qualitative, ethnographic study of 6 research groups using observations, semi-structured interviews, and document analysis. The researchers will investigate how decisions about SCIS are made; document, classify and analyze actual practices for using, adopting, developing or sharing software; identify scientists' incentives and disincentives to share software at the local, organizational and community levels; and discern the impacts, intentional and unintentional, that SCIS systems have on scientific data and the scientific research process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding SCIS development and sharing is necessary to ensure continued integrity of datasets shared within and among communities, facilitate the sharing of the tools and practices that are developed using national research funds and most importantly, support a fundamental tenet of scientific research: the open communication of the processes and practices behind published research findings. Furthermore, understanding these practices will support the education and training of our nation's future generations of scientists and engineers. This project will thus benefit domain scientists, SCIS developers, Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Software Engineering (SE) scholars and policy makers by providing conceptual tools that will provide guidance when considering how and when software can be designed and supported to be accessible and useful to the broader research community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research produced new theoretical concepts about how cooperative work arrangements are formed and combined in order to better understand the software work and infrastructure development of data-intensive scientific research groups. Through a multisite qualitative research studying comparing findings across geology, oceanography, medical research, and cosmology this work identified prototypical "coordinative entities" or ways of collaborating that scientists across fields use in order to get research done. Our typology of "coordinative entities" provides a mechanism to better differentiate the situations and types of collaboration that are brought to bear during the different research activities of data collection, data processing, and data analysis. By breaking "scientific collaboration" in to subtypes by function we can better understand the diversity of scientific collaboration and how to support different collaborative situations.  This research also examined scientific software development and infrastructure production. The project?s in-&shy;depth examination of a cosmology research group offers one of the first truly comprehensive examinations of the co-evolution of data &shy;intensive science and high-&shy;precision software development in the context of a complex multinational collaboration. Through this research we offer a novel perspective on the production, use, and work of software in science. Our work questions notions of software as a static product that can be sustained in a straightforward manner and finds that scientific software can be a perpetually mutable instantiation of changing methods that must be iteratively refined as part of the ongoing work of research. This work sheds light on the limits of standardization and software sharing given the sometimes necessarily bespoke and changeable nature of some scientific software.  Our work is not only relevant to the research communities of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Human Computer Interaction, eScience, and Science Studies communities, but it is relevant to all organizationally complex innovation work that relies heavily on data and software.
