<AbstractNarration>In this Cyberlearning: Transforming Education DIP (Development and Implementation) project, the PIs are addressing challenges of knowledge community pedagogy, where students are given a high level of agency and responsibility for developing questions, exchanging and critiquing ideas with peers, and advancing collective understanding. The project addresses four main challenges in supporting such pedagogy: (1) making student ideas visible and accessible, (2) supporting discourse and knowledge building with digital posters and other summative representations, (3) scaffolding complex collaborative inquiry through technology, and (4) supporting a sense of collective epistemology.  Knowledge building is well researched from a conceptual perspective; until now, however, there has not been a concerted effort to develop technological infrastructure that would support its pedagogy well. In a series of design-oriented studies, researchers are working together with veteran teachers to co-design elementary biology curriculum that takes a knowledge community approach, develop the suite of tools, and carry out research investigating ways of sustaining a knowledge community pedagogy over long periods of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholars have argued that the demands of a "knowledge society" require new models of collaborative and inquiry-oriented learning that engage learners in sustained investigations and promote agency and autonomy. Several sophisticated pedagogical approaches have been developed to achieve these goals, but up until now, the technological infrastructure for supporting teachers and students in such approaches has not been at the same level of sophistication as the pedagogical approaches themselves. This proposal aims to narrow that gap through design of a suite of hardware and software tools that supports representing personal and collective knowledge in both private and public forms, tangible and embodied interactions as well as verbal interactions, and the orchestration of activities. The aims are to support student work and meta-cognition, provide to teachers the supports they need to carry out the pedagogies, and to examine the interactions between teacher, students, technology, and pedagogy that lead to sustained agency and community engagement among learners.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>As schools begin to incoporate the broad range of technologies now available in our everyday lives, researchers are using those technologies to design new ways of learning that look very different from the classrooms of the past. In this project, researchers investigated the potential for using the physical space of the classroom as place for students to interact with room-sized simulations, interacting with scientific phenomena through a variety of coordinated technologies. While teachers have long "decorated" their rooms to set the stage for learning activities, technologies now allows us to make those "decorations" come alive, presenting students with dynamic phenomena that respond to their actions. Because they make scientific phenomena accessible in a public and immersive fashion, these "instrumented classrooms" are especially well-suited to multi-week, whole-class investigations of scientific phenomena in which students collaborate to solve problems or answer driving questions.</p> <p><br />In this project, over 400 middle-school students and 10 teachers in Illinois, Massachussets, and Ontario participated in a series of curriculum units using classrooms instrumented to provide simulations in seismology and ecology. The research team developed the software simulating seismographs that responded authentically to "roomquakes" occuring in the classroom, and created dynamic animations of insect behaviors such as foraging and predation, imagined to occupy the walls of the classroom. These simulations, running continuously over multi-week periods, were observed and manipulated by students as they worked together to develop models explaining the mechanics of the phenomena in which they were immersed. In addition to the simulations themselves, the research team developed a range of supporting tools that allowed learners to record their observations, conduct experiments with the simulated phenomena, construct scientific arguments using the evidence that they collected and generated, and work as a scientific community to evaluate those arguments and come to consensus around their models.</p> <p><br />Research around student learning in those units focused on both their understandings of the scientific content and the ways that scientists come to build knowledge as a scientific community. Changes in content understandings?for example, how seismographs allow us to determine the location and magnitude of earthquakes, how clusters of earthquakes are distributed over time and space, or how changes in habitits or in one species' population 'ripple through' the other species in an ecosystem?were measured through pre- and post-tests of specific learning goals based on assessments similar to those found on contemporary standardized tests. Across the studies, students consistently showed significant gains in those understandings. In addition, the research looked at changes over time in the way that students came to those understandings by recording and analyzing their (face-to-face and digital) conversations with one another, their contributions to class discussions, and the physical and digital products that they produced. The research found that students participating in these units changed their conceptions of 'how science works' from an emphasis on 'getting the right answer' to one of incrementally building knowledge through a process of developing evidence-based arguments and evaluating those arguments within a critical scientific community. Teacher, student, and parent response to these units has been overwhelmingly positive, with teachers often citing the appeal to students less engaged by traditional instructional designs. The study demonstrated that this kind of instructional design can be effective in fostering the kinds of outcomes identified in the Next Generation Science Standards as critical both for students who go on to pursue careers in science and non-scientist citizens who need to be able to make life-long judgments about results coming from the scientific community.</p> <p><br />As a result of this project, the supporting simulation, knowledge-building, and infrastructure technologies have reached a state of maturity that they have been adopted as part of regular school curricula by teachers who were involved in the project, as well as teachers previously unconnected with the project, and in one case, as part of undergraduate geoscience course. While scaling this resource to serve large numbers of teachers and students will require additional work in the design of accompanying teacher guides, teacher professional development, and software engineering to support large-scale adoption, this project has advanced progress toward our goal of making these technologies, and the learning opportunities they support, available to all teachers as a public resource accessible through the World Wide Web.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/19/2019<br>      Modified by: Thomas&nbsp;G&nbsp;Moher</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1324977/1324977_10274854_1553022497617_DSCF0234--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1324977/1324977_10274854_1553022497617_DSCF0234--rgov-800width.jpg" title="RoomQuake seismograph"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1324977/1324977_10274854_1553022497617_DSCF0234--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="RoomQuake seismograph"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students interpreting simulated seismograph in RoomQuake to determine distance of an earthquake epicenter</div> <div class="imageCredit">Brenda Lopez</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Thomas&nbsp;G&nbsp;Moher</div> <div class="imageTitle">RoomQuake seismograph</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1324977/1324977_10274854_1553022586453_DSCF0246--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1324977/1324977_10274854_1553022586453_DSCF0246--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Trilateration"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1324977/1324977_10274854_1553022586453_DSCF0246--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Trilateration"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students determining epicenter of simulated earthquake using mathematical trilateration</div> <div class="imageCredit">Brenda Lopez</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Thomas&nbsp;G&nbsp;Moher</div> <div class="imageTitle">Trilateration</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1324977/1324977_10274854_1553023502859_IMG_3176--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1324977/1324977_10274854_1553023502859_IMG_3176--rgov-800width.jpg" title="WallCology"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1324977/1324977_10274854_1553023502859_IMG_3176--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="WallCology"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students investigating simulated ecosystem habitat in the WallCology simulation</div> <div class="imageCredit">Brenda Lopez</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Thomas&nbsp;G&nbsp;Moher</div> <div class="imageTitle">WallCology</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
