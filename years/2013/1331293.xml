<AbstractNarration>To what extent is human cognition (e.g., visual perception, memory, and categorization) augmented by language? Does language only allow us to communicate with more flexibility or does language transform cognition, allowing humans to represent and manipulate information in novel ways? A series of studies previously conducted by this investigator has shown that language has pervasive and surprising effects on a range of abilities, such as learning new categories, using knowledge about familiar categories,  visual memory, and even perception: Hearing a word can literally change what one sees. The proposed studies build on this earlier work by exploring the design features of language that make it an especially useful tool for constructing and manipulating mental representations. The studies use a variety of behavioral paradigms together with noninvasive brain stimulation to explore the behavioral and neural processes involved in the interaction of language, learning new categories, and retrieving information about familiar concepts and categories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed studies are critical not only for understanding the broad issue of language-augmented cognition, but also for the potential to understand applied issues related to linguistic and cognitive development. Hearing less language in early childhood leads not only to negative outcomes in using language to communicate, but appears to extend more broadly to other cognitive abilities. By understanding the mechanisms by which language augments cognition, we will better understand the broad consequences of language disorders, which may inform the development of  effective interventions. The work will also enhance infrastructure for research and education by implementing and disseminating tools for efficient and cost-effective data collection over the web using crowd-sourcing services, which allow for generalizability to broader populations and will allow undergraduates to more easily conduct original research projects.</AbstractNarration>

Its evolution in the human lineage has been compared in importance  to the evolution of DNA because it makes possible a secondary inheritance system---rich, cumulative culture---without which, each generation of humans would, more or less, start from scratch. But what exactly does language do for us? To what extent does "normal" human cognition and perception depend on language? This question was at the heart of the studies supported by this grant.  Over the course of several dozen published papers we have shown that hearing a word can change what people see (for example, hearing a color words can help us distinguish certain colors; hearing a word like "dog" or "gun" can make us faster and more accurate detectors of the categories these words denote. These effects run deep. Our electrophysiological studies show that words affect visual processing as soon as 100 ms from stimulus onset, and can alter processing even before a stimulus appears by creating categorical expectations. The expectations created by language are more potent than those created by other means (such as showing people images or playing them nonverbal sounds).  In other work supported by this grant we have shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (a small current run across people?s scalp) can be used to up or down-regulate automatic labeling of images with the effect that up-regulation causes people to be more categorical in their processing of images (including some suggestive evidence that it can facilitate the learning of simple rules).

These and related studies from our lab show that visual perception is "cognitively penetrable".   Broader impacts of this work have included targeted recruitment of first-generation college students as undergraduate research assistants,  enhanced infrastructure for collecting experimental data online, and educational infrastructure for teaching graduate students how to program and analyze their data to improve reproducibility and replicability of social science.
