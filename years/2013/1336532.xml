<AbstractNarration>CBET 1336532 &lt;br/&gt;Orlando Coronell (PI), Howard Weinberg (co-PI)&lt;br/&gt;The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With increasing stress placed on the quality of drinking water by contamination and demand, alternatives to traditional water sources and treatment need to be evaluated. A promising option for supplementing the drinking water supply is the use of high quality recycled waters produced from the advanced treatment of impaired surface waters or secondary wastewater effluent. Advanced water treatment plants often use high-pressure membranes because they can remove most contaminants in one step through a combination of size exclusion, electrostatic repulsion, and low permeability to contaminants. Zeolite thin film nanocomposites (TFNs) are a new type of high-pressure membrane that can reduce the energy costs of membrane treatment by increasing water permeability without compromising contaminant rejection and in some cases even improving upon it. While the energy saving benefits of TFNs are much greater for the treatment of low salinity waters, there is no evidence in the literature that TFNs have been optimized for these applications nor has their rejection of organic contaminants been evaluated. Accordingly, the objectives of this project are to: (1) optimize zeolite TFNs for water reuse applications, specifically by increasing water permeability and rejection of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), (2) understand how membrane performance is correlated to the physico-chemical properties of membranes, and (3) elucidate the relationship between the physico-chemical properties of contaminants and their rejection efficiency by TFNs. The contaminants that this project will evaluate were selected because of their potential harm to human and ecological health, are of high occurrence in the waters of interest, and are indicators of overall water quality.  The contaminants selected include regulated and unregulated disinfection byproducts, chemicals on the latest contaminant candidate list of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and other CECs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary project will decrease the cost of water reuse through the development and evaluation of more efficient and effective membranes for treatment of low quality water and certain wastewaters. This technology will be beneficial not just in water treatment applications but also in fields using membrane separations such as artificial organs, fuel cells, gas separations, and other industrial separations.  The research and educational activities of this project will also have the following additional broader and societal impacts: (1) enhancement of secondary education through the development and dissemination of scientific educational materials, (2) encouragement of science and engineering career paths through dissemination of interactive educational materials,  and (3) interdisciplinary and collaborative research experience provided to graduate and undergraduate students, including underrepresented groups in chemistry and engineering (women and minorities) through intensive training in the development and application of membranes to protect public health.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Background  Reverse osmosis (RO) is a promising technology capable of supplementing the current drinking water supply by producing high quality recycled water from treated wastewater (i.e., secondary effluent). RO membranes have a thin-film composite (TFC) structure where a top ultrathin "active" layer allows for the preferential passage of water over contaminants, thus effectively producing purified water. TFC membranes can remove contaminants typically found in secondary effluent in a single step via charge repulsion and size exclusion, thereby producing water of high enough quality to drink. A disadvantage to RO filtration is that it is energy intensive and therefore expensive.

These membranes are fabricated the same way as TFCs, but with zeolite nanoparticles imbedded in the top active layer of the membrane.

RO membranes used in water reuse applications are desalination membranes optimized for NaCl removal. However, secondary effluent contains contaminants other than NaCl, such as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs).

Though zeolite TFNs have been studied in desalination applications, little emphasis has been placed on their value in water reuse where the prospective energy savings would be even higher, given the lower salt rejection requirements of secondary effluent and its lower osmotic pressure.     Project Goal  This project set out to optimize thin-film nanocomposite membranes for water reuse applications, advancing the understanding of their physical/chemical properties and how these properties, along with membrane fabrication modifications, relate to TFC/TFN performance.     Project Outcomes  Baseline fabrication procedures for both TFC and TFN membranes were established and optimized to consistently yield NaCl and CEC (i.e. caffeine, carbamazepine, atrazine, atenolol, DEET, and trimethoprim) rejection over 99%. These methods were adapted to produce a variety of TFN membranes with varying performance characteristics, including TFNs with LTA zeolite, ZIF8, or muscovite nanoparticles imbedded in their active layers. These three types of nanoparticles were evaluated because they have varying physical chemical properties that aid in the membrane?s permeability to water. In general, it was found that higher nanoparticle content in TFNs led to greater water permeability and lower contaminant rejection, with the benefit in water permeability increase being greater than the penalty in contaminant rejection decrease. Furthermore, ZIF8 TFN membranes showed higher water permeability than TFCs, and similar permeabilities to their zeolite TFN counterparts.  It was also found that membrane performance could be influenced by changes in the fabrication process of both TFCs and zeolite TFNs.  For example, both TFC and zeolite TFN membranes showed increased water permeability and decreased contaminant rejection with shorter monomer reaction times (5 s vs. 60 s) during active layer casting.
