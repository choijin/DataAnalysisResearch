<AbstractNarration>The goal of this collaborative research project is to develop an advanced materials modeling framework that integrates quantum mechanics into a macroscale continuum mechanics modeling framework for smart materials. The integration of fundamental physics of materials at nanometer scales within a macroscopic material model can have a tremendous impact on understanding the design of materials as well as create the possibility of quantifying parameter sensitivities and uncertainties in the models. To address this latter issue, novel uncertainty quantification methods will be formulated and implemented using advanced computations in a Bayesian statistical framework. The uncertainty quantification will provide probability densities of the macroscale parameters supported by quantum simulations. The deliverables will include homogenized stress, electric field, and energy relations that utilize both the local quantum material relations and probability densities that occur when approximating the model at larger length scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that the fusion of quantum-continuum scale material simulations will have a broad impact on understanding smart materials. These materials are being investigated for and applied in various biomedical, aerospace, automotive, and energy fields due to their unique functionality in solid state structures and devices. The new data analysis and computational techniques are expected to support this challenge to better understand advanced materials. This becomes particularly important in advancing the development of nanomaterials into larger scale structures that cannot be easily simulated directly with quantum models or approximate continuum theories. The results developed through this program will be integrated into engineering mechanics and mathematics courses. The computational methods will also be integrated into outreach programs at each university. Lastly, the results of this program will be introduced into an outreach program at a local museum where K-12 children and their parents learn about various aspects of engineering through monthly hands-on demonstrations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This program broadly focused on employing uncertainty quantification (UQ) and sensitivity analysis (SA) to guide the use of density functional theory (DFT) at the quantum scale to construct and calibrate continuum models for ferroelectric materials.  A overarching objective is to develop mathematical and statistical techniques that can be used to bridge physical scales in a manner that facilitates the analysis and design of materials at quantum or molecular levels to achieve novel capabilities at the system level where they are employed.  The use of uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis as a step toward this goal constitutes broad impact of the program.  Several outcomes contributed to the intellectual merit of the program.  For the field-coupled materials under consideration, information sources often combine differing physics including energy, stress, polarization or twinned domain wall energy.  To accommodate the resulting vector-valued DFT responses, which vary as a function of polarization, it was necessary to develop and implement novel sensitivity algorithms to quantify the relative influence of continuum model parameters.  We also had to significantly extend existing algorithms to accommodate inherent correlation between parameters.   Initial Bayesian inference also indicated that, in some cases, parameters were linearly related, and hence not mutually identifiable, since different linear combinations of parameters yield the same response.  This necessitated the development of linear algebra-based techniques to determine active subspaces of parameters that are influential or identifiable.  A second important component of this task entailed the application of Bayesian inference on active subspaces and subsequent mapping of posterior densities back to the physical space.  The development of active subspace techniques constitutes a widely investigated area for large-scale physical problems so the development of Bayesian inference techniques on active subspaces has the potential for being widely applicable for range of applications.  A final component of the intellectual merit focused on the use of computed continuum energy functions to construct macroscopic homogenized energy models (HEM) for ferroelectric materials including lead zirconate titanate (PZT).  The included the development, implementation, and quantitative validation of a fully coupled 3-D model that quantifies the hysteresis inherent to strains and polarization for PZT.
