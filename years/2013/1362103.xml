<AbstractNarration>The proposed new site of the Laser and Plasma for Advanced Manufacturing (LPAM) I/UCRC at North Carolina State University (NCSU) intends to deepen the understanding of plasma systems and how they interact with their environment, address critical areas such as new source design, validation of predictive models for virtual design, dynamic chemistry control for non-equilibrium processes, and enable advanced diagnostics. These challenges will be addressed by focusing on the basic science behind three critical areas: 1) interaction between plasmas and applied fields, 2) interaction between plasmas and surfaces, and 3) the underlying science that enable advanced diagnostics. This integrated effort will complement the current activities of the Lasers and Plasmas for Advanced Manufacturing I/UCRC and broaden the scope of the center to include a class of plasma systems poised to make substantial contributions to future manufacturing efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low temperature plasma (LTP) science provides a base technology on which many modern industries exist. The NCSU site of LPAM?s  research efforts target expansion of needed application inspired fundamental research in this area to support industry competitiveness. Industries that utilize LTPs for manufacturing are experiencing a shortfall in manpower for the design, development, and operation of these devices. As plasma process expands into new growth industries this demand will increase. By providing an environment that focuses on fundamental understanding of these systems, combined with industry engagement through collaborative research, industry residencies, and co-operative opportunities, we will fill a manpower void and accelerate the growth of low cost, repeatable manufacturing solutions for the domestic high-tech industry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal brought NC State University into the existing IUCRC for Lasers and Plasmas in Advanced Manufacturing.  At the time of entry, NCSU joined the lead institution University of Virginia along with sites Southern Methodist and University of Illinois.  The intellectual productivity of this center engagement was substantial, as three industry board vetted projects including pulsed RF processing, phase lock harmonic drive for plasma control, and study of a novel VHF driven atmospheric plasma reactor were advanced through center engagement.  Industry collaborations were established at NCSU with members Plasmatherm Inc., MKS Instruments, and Advanced Energy Inc, resulting in five refereed journal articles and over a dozen conference presentations delivered primarily by student researchers.  The broad impact outcomes of this center engagement were equally substantial.  It enabled close collaboration with industry scientists on basic science endeavors, broadening the typically application-dominant theme found in industry research.  Two Master's and three PhD students were supported fully or in part through center activities.  One graduate went on to work for one of the member companies full time after graduation.  After 24 months as a center site, NCSU was not able to obtain the necessary fourth industry committment for the site's NSF requirements.  Because of this, NSF pulled NCSU as a site.  NCSU continues to work with the center as a collaborator with the University of Illinois, where former NCSU industry members Plasmatherm and MKS Instruments continue to support center activities carried out at NCSU.
