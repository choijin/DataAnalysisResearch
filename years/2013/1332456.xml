<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to further develop a proprietary rapid supercritical extraction (RSCE) method for aerogel fabrication. Aerogels are unique nanoporous materials with remarkable properties that make them beneficial for a number of applications such as insulating materials, windows, sensors and catalytic converters. However, aerogels are not widely available or widely used due to the complex and expensive methods currently used to produce them. The research team has developed a rapid supercritical extraction (RSCE) technique. The method utilizes a confined mold in an automated hydraulic hot press. The method is advantageous for the following reasons: (a) it can be easily automated; (b) it is relatively fast; (c) it is environmentally friendlier than other methods; (d) it minimizes the use of solvents and (e) it is potentially less expensive than other methods. This I-Corps project plans to determine whether its proprietary RSCE method is ready for application out of the laboratory and to identify any barriers to achieving this transition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aerogels have potential applications in a number of areas that foster sustainability. As thermal insulators in building materials aerogels can be used to improve energy efficiency. Catalytic aerogel materials could eliminate the use of rare precious metals in the cleanup of automotive exhaust. The RSCE method itself provides an environmentally friendlier method for producing aerogels and the method is suitable to scale up and large-scale production of these materials.</AbstractNarration>
