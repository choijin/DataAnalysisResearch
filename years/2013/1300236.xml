<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) collaborative research project is to understand how a systems approach to operations and maintenance can enhance the effectiveness and profitability of wind turbines.  Currently, operation and maintenance concepts and methods are predominantly components-oriented.  This project will show that a system-level approach can yield a better trade-off between risks and costs, thereby optimizing an engineered system for overall economic value.  The team will develop a way to measure a wind turbine system's holistic performance and tracks its decline over time at a system level.  Establishing a system-level metric enables us to actively adjust a turbine's operation and realize a trade-off between near-term power production and system reliability.  It also allows the PIs to weigh cost of maintenance against loss in power efficiency, leading to cost-effective decisions of maintenance.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful development of this new methodology ought to lead to cost-effective operation and maintenance of renewable energy productions, and reduce its overall cost and enhances their marketability (a key to the wind energy's 20percent-by-2030 goal and long-term sustainability).  General Electric, a leading enterprise in wind energy, is a research partner of this project.  GE's direct participation accelerates the application of the resulting methodologies to actual wind energy operational systems.  The collaborative nature of this research and industrial involvement brings industrial perspective to the universities and is training our next-generation workforce in the new energy economy.  The system-level concepts and methodologies, once demonstrated in wind energy applications, can go beyond and be applied to other power production systems, as well as automobile systems, aerospace systems, and marine systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The overarching goal of this collaborative project is to create a novel, system-level framework for the operation and maintenance of wind turbines.  We aim at developing a new methodology that measures a turbine system?s holistic performance and tracks the decline in such performance over time, and concurrently, formulating a value-focused strategy that synergistically devises near-term care and long-term maintenance to maximize the overall turbine output over its lifetime.  Specifically at University of Connecticut, our goals are 1) to establish multi-level modeling of wind turbine system that can facilitate reliability analysis and at the same time be used for active control; 2) to formulate control strategies that can adjust the control action based on the turbine?s current health status; and 3) to provide quantitative mechanistic insights, through real-time fault diagnosis and prognosis, to assist maintenance and repair services.  These goals are pursued in concurrent with those by the collaborative partners at Texas A&amp;M University and General Electric Global Research Center, which collectively lead to a new strategy for operational and maintenance that maximizes the cost-effectiveness of wind turbine systems.  Throughout this project, at University of Connecticut, our major scientific progresses and outcomes include: 1) comprehensive modeling and analysis of benchmark wind turbines at the system-level and at the components level; 2) design, analysis, and validation of a series of control algorithms toward mitigating the mechanical loads encompassing adaptive control, disturbance observer based (DOB) control with internal model principle, robust individual pitch control, and model predictive control; and 3) physics based fault diagnosis and physics-informed data driven fault classification algorithms for wind turbine gearbox and rolling bearing components.  It is demonstrated that the load condition on wind turbine blades can be improved significantly with advanced control design, and fault conditions in wind turbine components can be effectively detected and identified with advanced data analytics.  These outcomes will yield more cost-effective operation and maintenance of wind energy systems.  The outcomes of this research can play a significant role in helping realize the 20%-Wind-Energy-by-2030 goal.  The collaborative nature of this research and industrial involvement provide students a multidisciplinary environment and bring industrial perspective to the universities.
