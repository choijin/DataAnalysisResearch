<AbstractNarration>The proposal aims to provide participant support for about a dozen young US based mathematicians to attend an advanced school/workshop on Random Matrices and Growth Models at the International Center for Theoretical Physics, Trieste, Italy from September 2 till September 13, 2013.  The main topics to be covered at the program are the universality of local distribution of the eigenvalues of large random Hermitian matrices, spectral properties of non-Hermitian random matrices, and recent advances in random growth models and interacting particle systems. The topics of the program have many important applications in statistics, nuclear physics, theoretical computer science, and population biology.  The proposal will allow to attract talented young mathematicians (with emphasis on gender equality and minority participation) to this exciting and rapidly growing area of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information see http://www.ictp.it/scientific-calendar.aspx</AbstractNarration>
