<AbstractNarration>This collaborative research project aims at developing mathematical methods for the analysis/mining of large scale, high dimensional data that arise in engineering/physicochemical computations, and, more importantly, in exploiting these methods and algorithms to accelerate the computations themselves. This type of synergy between data mining and scientific computation has the potential to significantly enhance the way we extract knowledge from large scale modeling and simulation.  The focus of the approach is the discovery a small number of key, intrinsic features of simulations characterized by very large numbers of degrees of freedom - and the exploitation of these key features to systematically design subsequent simulations. Another important feature of the work is the development of algorithms that "translate" between fine scale, detailed, and coarse scale, compact descriptions of the data, as well as algorithms for the fast incorporation of new data/information in previous computational frameworks. Deliverables of the effort will be the algorithms themselves, as well as documented illustrative examples of their application to large scale molecular and agent-based simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will create, document and make available a computational protocol for enhancing large scale scientific computations in the modeling of complex dynamical systems. Example applications include nanoscale self-assembly, such as micelle formation in materials computations, macromolecular foldling, large scale agent-based models of collective motion in ecology and cellular biology, as well as large scale, Partial Differential Equation simulations of engineering problems, like combustion.  The results will be disseminated to allow their use by other researchers. The research will form the basis of cross-disciplinary education of graduate students in engineering and in mathematics, and of undergraduate research projects in these disciplines. It will also underpin the development of course materials in large scale data processing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The discovery of physical laws consistent with empirical observations lies at the heart of (applied) science and engineering. These laws typically take the form of nonlinear differential equations depending on parameters; dynamical systems theory provides, through the appropriate normal forms, an "intrinsic", prototypical characterization of the types of dynamical regimes accessible to a given model. Using an implementation of data-informed geometry learning we directly reconstruct the relevant "normal forms": a quantitative mapping from empirical observations to prototypical realizations of the underlying dynamics. Interestingly, the state variables and the parameters of these realizations are inferred from the empirical observations; without prior knowledge or understanding, they parametrize the dynamics intrinsically, without explicit reference to fundamental physical quantities.  The methods developed in this research open the door to applications in all disciplines  where the underlying science is unknown and needs to be extracted form observations . Our tools have broad applicability beyond the physical sciences, (which we used for  validation) they are being applied in  economics , neurology , brain dynamics etc.  Moreover the ability to extract latent variables which drive the dynamics of observations , permits massive acceleration of hypothesis testing and exploration of high dimensional  configuration spaces for discovery , these tools are being used to understand the massive landscape of protein configurations in biology.  Perhaps the most natural extension of this work lies in the direction of detecting changes in the state or parameter embedding dimensions. Whether distinct (regular perturbations) or joint (singular perturbations), these dimension changes are crucial for successful model reduction. For this purpose, in future work, we will examine the expansion of the high-dimensional data in the joint parameters-state-time space obtained by a product of the inferred representation components. Thus establishing causality and obtaining an intrinsic form of the governing equations of dynamical systems             Last Modified: 01/27/2017       Submitted by: Ronald R Coifman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
