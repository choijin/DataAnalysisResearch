<AbstractNarration>The project is a comprehensive observational and analytical program to examine the dynamics and source waters of the relaxation flows in a coastal upwelling system on the central California coast. Autonomous vehicles, high-frequency radars, moorings, and drifters, will be used to acquire pressure, density, and velocity data relevant to the relaxation flows. The data will be used to determine spatial scales of the flows, cross-shore density structure, cross-shore and alongshore velocity fields, pressure gradients, and the region of contact with the sea floor.  Aspects of the research include:  1) to evaluate the roles of barotropic and baroclinic pressure gradient forcing, 2) to identify regions where ageostrophic flows dominate the cross-shore and alongshore momentum balances, 3) to determine source waters for the relaxation flows, and 4) to examine the inner shelf circulation response to wind relaxations over an extensive coastal region (the northern part of the Southern California Bight) by analyzing extensive regional data sets collected over many years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wind relaxations are common features of coastal upwelling systems worldwide, and have impacts on  alongshore and cross-shore transport of water-borne materials such as larvae, nutrients, terrestrial runoff, and buoyant pollutants like oil. This study will clarify the role of relaxation flows in the recruitment of intertidal and sub-tidal organisms by revealing details of the near-shore flow structure. The observational plan advances capabilities of state-of-the-art autonomous and Lagrangian platforms and sensors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A post-doc and undergraduate students will be trained. Opportunities will be created for marine ecology graduate students to conduct field experiments focused on the ecological consequences of relaxation flows.  This research will build on, and leverage, existing regional ocean observing infrastructure and it will increase the capacity for oceanographic studies at two universities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has had three primary outcomes; one being the a change in traditional thinking about the impact of coastlines on the flow of currents, second is the impact that this information has on other areas of social concern/interest, and finally in developing new integrated tools for examining the ocean.  An important impact on the development of coastal physical oceanography, a principle area of this project, is the clarification of the role wind plays around coastal headlands on regional ocean circulation.  Marine ecologists have advanced the hypothesis that blocking or turning of coastal currents by headlands maintains these bio-geographic boundaries.  Our research indicates that this hypothesis is not supported by observations.  For example, our research shows that flows around the headland of Point Arguello and Point Conception occur frequently.  Therefore, it is difficult to see how the biogeographic boundary at this headland is maintained by circulation patterns alone.   This work has an impact on understanding coastal marine ecology (i.e. fisheries) as it examines the delivery of water masses that carry a wide variety of waterborne material around a coastal headland in a strongly forced upwelling system.  The magnitude and direction (3D) is important for consideration of locations of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in California and elsewhere as the main determinant of connectivity between these preserves is ocean currents.   Another impact of this work is better understanding how oil spills will respond.  The oil spill in May, 2015 moved south because of strong southerly winds.   Had the winds not been present during the spill, the impact predicted by results of this work would have placed the spill significantly farther north to the Central California coast than the wind predictions alone.  Finally, this project aallowed continued development of ocean observing technology.  Developments were made in underwater robotics, through the use of buoyancy-driven gliders, autonomous underrwater vehicles which respond to environmental cues (thus making sampling more efficient), Radar mapping of surface currents,  autonomous surface vehicles and aerial vehicles all for improving observations of the coastal ocean.
