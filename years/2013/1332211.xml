<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided in partial support of an international, interdisciplinary Workshop on Ice Sheet/Ocean/Atmosphere Interactions in Greenland. Core funding of the workshop from U.S. CLIVAR has already been secured. The objective of the workshop is to bring together observationalists, modelers and theoreticians from the oceanographic, glaciological, meteorological and climate communities to discuss the challenges and requirements for improving observations, and process understanding and modeling of this problem. The prospective attendees include U.S. scientists, funded by major US agencies (NASA, NSF, NOAA, DoE, ONR), and international experts, who are studying processes in Greenland, adjacent ice caps, similar Arctic environments (especially Alaskan tidewater glaciers), and surrounding seas (especially Nordic Seas and subpolar North Atlantic). The major meeting outcomes are envisioned to be:&lt;br/&gt;1. Advancement of the science, improved coordination, and synergy of national and international projects.&lt;br/&gt;2. Interaction and network building across disciplines for all and especially students and&lt;br/&gt;early career scientists.&lt;br/&gt;3. A document describing a prioritized set of recommendations to make progress on this urgent and complex interdisciplinary problem, including a plan for a long-term Greenland observing system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ice sheet-ocean-atmosphere interactions in Greenland represent a new research frontier that is critical to understanding the ice sheet?s evolution, its mass balance, and contributions to global sea level rise. Recent observed changes in Greenland show that these processes are important in the context of decadal-to-centennial climate variability - time scales relevant to major infrastructure planning and design.</AbstractNarration>

Amongst those proposed, oceanic forcing has emerged as a leading, plausible mechanism making ice sheet-ocean interactions in Greenland a new research frontier that is critical to understanding the ice sheetÃ†s evolution and its contribution to global sea level rise.   Understanding ice sheet/ocean interactions in Greenland, however, is far from trivial. GreenlandÃ†s largest glaciers terminate in deep, long fjords which are remote, inaccessible, and choked with large icebergs whose calving and drift pose a major challenge to scientists and instrumentation. The records of oceanic changes near the glaciers (or even on the Greenland shelves where the fjords terminate) are almost non-existent, especially from the period preceding the glacier acceleration.

Thus progress on this complex topic requires a cross-disciplinary and multi-faceted approach involving the broad international community working on various aspects of the problem.                A first successful effort in assembling such a community and in making progress on this topic was a workshop held in early June, in Beverly, MA, entitled: Ã¦Understanding the response of GreenlandÃ†s Marine Terminating Glaciers to Oceanic and Atmospheric ForcingÃ†. The workshop brought together approximately 100 oceanographers, glaciologists, atmospheric and climate scientists including observationalists, modelers, and theoreticians, working on all aspects of this problem. A whitepaper initiated by the U.S. CLIVAR Working Group on GReenland Ice Sheet Ocean interactions (GRISO; Straneo et al. 2012) served as background to this workshop.                The workshop was structured around review talks by invited speakers, who lay the foundation for the ensuing discussions, science presentations in the form of brief oral introductions and posters and moderated discussions. The sessions were organized around themes ranging from Ã¦Evidence of glacier variabilityÃ† to Ã¦What can the paleo record teach us?Ã† and ended with a half a day discussion on identifying the prioritized questions. The workshop brought together a large international group of scientists, program managers from NSF and NASA, and the U.S. CLIVAR program director. Many of these different communities met at the workshop for the first time &ndash; underlining the importance of fostering cross-disciplinary exchange through specialized events. The workshop was also particularly successful in engaging junior scientists (including graduate students and scientists within 5 years of receiving their PhD) who made up over one third of the participants, many of them benefiting from travel support. Funding for the workshop was provided by U.S. CLIVAR as well as NSF OPP, and the U.S. CLIVAR and UCAR/JOSS staff were instrumental in organizing the workshop both prior ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
