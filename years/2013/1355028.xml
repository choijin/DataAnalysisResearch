<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to improve our understanding of the evolution and classification of one of the largest groups of plant-feeding insects, the order Lepidoptera, which consists of the butterflies and moths (157,000 described species).  Lepidoptera have major effects on both natural ecosystems and humans. In natural systems they play important roles as herbivores, pollinators and prey for birds and other species. They also include many destructive pests of agriculture, but some species provide a commercially valuable fiber, silk, and caterpillars are important food items in many cultures.  Some species of Lepidoptera are model research species used for discovering basic principles in genetics, physiology, development, ecology and other areas of life sciences. Finally, Lepidoptera such as the monarch butterfly are of central utility in ecosystem assessment, conservation planning, and in educating the public about environmental conservation. An accurate family tree (genealogy) is an essential foundation for understanding the past and potential future evolution of the diversity and traits of Lepidoptera, including those relevant to their pest management, and to predicting the traits of previously-unstudied species. Recent studies using DNA sequence data have made major progress toward figuring out the genealogical relationships among the approximately 125 families into which the Lepidoptera are currently divided. However, some relationships, particularly those within a subgroup of families containing the majority of species, have proven especially difficult to infer. This project will attempt to resolve these problematic aspects of the genealogy using next-generation methods of DNA sequencing, which provide over 100 times as much data per species studied as previous methods. The new results are expected to have applications in many fields, both basic and applied. In addition, the project will help train the next generation of comparative biologists in use of these new DNA sequencing methods, and the results will be incorporated into new educational materials for outreach to K-12 children and the public at large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relationships among most early-diverging lepidopteran lineages, and within nearly all major superfamilies, have been strongly resolved. In the advanced clade Apoditrysia, however, which contains the great majority of lepidopteran species, relationships among superfamilies have only weak support. To resolve relationships among the superfamilies of Apoditrysia, the gene sample will be increased to 2200 kb in a subset of 160 exemplar species via transcriptome RNA-Seq. The resulting phylogeny will be used for an analysis of divergence dates and rates of species diversification across the Lepidoptera that will attempt to identify major factors contributing to their great species richness.  The Leptree project produced about 10,000 kilobases of DNA sequence from ~ 900 species representing 91% of families. To test whether RNA-Seq can solve relationships left uncertain by Leptree, DNA sequence was obtained for 1579 genes (2.2+ mb) from 38 exemplar species representing the major lineages of Apoditrysia. In an initial maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of 741 genes (764 mb) left after removal of all genes showing any suggestion of paralogy, 10 of the 13 groupings on the tree that united two or more superfamilies had bootstrap support over 85%, including 7 with 100% bootstrap support, vs. 0/13 with 14.8 kb only. Thus, the planned expansion of transcriptome sampling seems likely to provide greatly improved phylogeny resolution for the Apoditrysia.  The new results will constitute the capstone for the first-ever comprehensive, robustly supported phylogenetic framework for the study of lepidopteran biology.</AbstractNarration>
