<AbstractNarration>This project is assuring that students complete certificates or AAS degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) related fields; increasing opportunities for women and under-represented students; and enhancing and disseminating the Lean Internship Model within the college and other academic institutions. It is also providing on-site faculty professional development at the nearby NASA Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) and the Navy Surface Combat Systems Center (SCSC) to enhance faculty understanding of aerospace and defense industry education needs. It is building on a successful American Association of Community College (AACC) Mentor Links ReConnect project supported by NSF. The internship program initiated through that effort is being further developed and enhanced into a scalable model using LEAN principles to maximize efficiency and provide the best value and outcomes for students and industry customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary project audiences are students enrolled in AAS degree programs in Electronics Technology; Electronics Technology: Computer Technician Specialization; and Business Technology: Information Systems Technology Specialization. Other eligible programs include Certificate Programs in Computer-Aided Drafting and Design; Electronics; Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning;  Industrial Maintenance Technology; Information Systems Technology; and Welding. The focus is on Career Pathways for STEM programs that provide science and engineering technicians for NASA WFF, Navy SCSSC, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and related aerospace and defense industry support contractors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project is expanding and developing new internship pathways that prepare students for entry-level STEM careers. It is ensuring that local students have the opportunity to improve their technical education and motivating them to successfully complete credentials and obtain technological employment locally and in the broader world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project is advancing knowledge and understanding within community college STEM programs by providing a model that builds industry partnerships and results in student internships and faculty professional development. These academic and industry partnerships are promoting teaching, training, learning, and diversity in the technical workforce and positively impacting the geographically isolated, low-income, and ethnically diverse population area served by the college both academically and economically.</AbstractNarration>
