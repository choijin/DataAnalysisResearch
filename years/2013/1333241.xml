<AbstractNarration>This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) grant provides funding for the investigation of defect formation mechanisms and the development of a defect mitigation approach for the glass-side laser scribing process of multilayer thin-film photovoltaic cells, aiming to better understand the influence of defects on solar cell properties and increase solar cell efficiency. Laser scribing from the glass (substrate) side, based on a micro-explosion mechanism, has led to increased scribe quality.  Defects formed during scribing, however, are not entirely alleviated and keep solar panels from reaching higher efficiencies. The goal of this project is to significantly advance the state of knowledge in the glass-side laser scribing process of multilayer thin film solar cells using a fundamental approach. Via experimental and numerical investigations, defects will be systematically characterized, their formation mechanisms will be elucidated and issues in defect mitigation based on their influence on solar cell electrical properties will be better understood.  The developed predictive capabilities will facilitate both exploration and optimization of scribing processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of this project is expected to lead to substantial enhancement in solar cell applications through reductions in defect formation resulting in reduced production costs and greater competitiveness of solar panels with alternate energy sources. The PI?s strong support from a key industrial partner could lead to rapid implementation of the developed knowledge in commercial solar cell panels with broad societal impact. The acquired fundamental understanding of the laser scribing process will be widely applicable to other absorber and contact layer materials in thin-film solar cells. Both experimental and numerical investigations will also benefit other applications such as the fabrication of LEDs and optical masks which utilize micro-explosion-based laser lift-off processes.</AbstractNarration>
