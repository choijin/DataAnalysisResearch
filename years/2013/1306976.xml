<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This award supports studies of intriguing emergent quantum phases in two-dimensional electron systems. The striking electron liquid phases occur in highest quality semiconductor hetero-structures in large magnetic fields. This research employs measurements of low-lying modes to uncover exciting physics that dictates the emergence of novel electron matter from unique Coulomb interactions in two-dimensions. Here, partially populated higher Landau levels are hosts to remarkable states like the fascinating even- and odd-denominator fractional quantum Hall fluids that occur in the second Landau level. Excitations in charge and/or spin degrees of freedom will be measured by unique resonant inelastic light scattering methods at low temperatures below 50milliKelvin degrees that are achieved in dilution refrigerators. The award will support the PhD dissertation research of a graduate student and enable the participation in these projects of highly qualified undergraduate students. This research should uncover physics of fundamental many-electron interactions that would greatly expand the frontiers of studies of strongly interacting low-dimensional electron systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;When embedded in high magnetic fields electron systems in artificial high quality semiconductor hetero-junctions display intriguing phases that manifest the striking weirdness of quantum mechanics. Of primary interest are the intriguing even- and odd-denominator fractional quantum Hall effect states in the second Landau level. This project is a quest in which measurements of low-lying excitation modes, by advanced light scattering methods at very low temperatures, uncover exciting new electron physics that emanates from quantum interactions in reduced dimensionality semiconductors. Novel low-dimensional electron systems attract broad attention. Progress in understanding their fundamental physics and their materials science advance the state-of-the-art in technologies of contemporary and future electronics and optoelectronics. In fundamental science the research appeals to world-class scientists working on topics of interaction physics that seek answers to questions that are at current frontiers. The project offers opportunities to highly qualified undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdocs interested in participation in research at frontiers of condensed matter science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  We study emergent quantum phases of two-dimensional electron systems in man-made structures built from semiconductor layers of nanoscale thickness that are created with superb perfection and fine atomic control of growth. Studies of electron interaction physics in state-of-the-art semiconductor structures in this project are at expanding frontiers of research in quantum materials.  In high magnetic fields mobile electrons hosted by artificial semiconductor structures populate quantized states called Landau levels. Strong interactions among electrons in Landau levels drive emergence of electron liquid phases of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) that manifest some of more striking electron behavior in quantum materials.  Research in this project is unique in that it relies on measurements of collective excitations modes of the electron quantum phases. The experiments employ advanced light scattering methods at very low temperatures (reaching to below 50millikelvin degrees) created in the group of the PI.  Much of the research by others in this field is carried out by studies of electrical transport   which is subject to impact of edge physics of electrons occupying states at the edge of specimens studied. In contrast, in this project edge state physics is minimized and experiments access and probe fundamental physics of strong electron interactions that drive emergence of FQHE liquids. Experiments are designed to explore predictions of recent theories that advance understanding of fundamental interaction physics in 2D electron systems in quantum materials. A key recent discovery is the finding that FQHE states with roles in physics and applications in quantum computation are robust and overwhelm other competing phases.     Broader Impacts  Studies in this project can be regarded as a quest in which measurements of excitation modes uncover intriguing new physics from strong electron interactions in reduced dimensionality semiconductors. The milestones achieved in this project created experimental methodologies that provide fruitful and surprising insights that are of interest to world-class scientists working on contemporary topics of interaction physics in quantum materials  The project offered opportunities undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral scientists interested in participation in research at frontiers of condensed matter science. Women and minorities are well represented in the group of the PI.  Opportunities for junior scientists are magnified by the links with other scientists at Columbia and at leading national and international institutions. Such research networking ensures that the studies in this project have significant impacts in broad and diverse communities.
