<AbstractNarration>This dissertation research employs an ethnographic method to analyze motivations for individuals? participation in small-scale fisheries. The majority of fisheries in Iceland are managed under a nationwide privatized program where access to the right to fish is limited, and these limitations can negatively impact small-scale fishing operations. This project aims to better understand the opportunities and constraints that varying management schemes have on the cultural dimensions of small-scale fisheries. The economic literature that fisheries privatization is based upon assumes the primary motivation for fishing to be profit maximization. However, research from around the world suggests that a wide range of motivations for engagement in fisheries exists outside profit generation. This research compares individuals engaged in non-privatized small-boat fisheries with those participating in the small-boat privatized fisheries in a two-phase design that uses methods of semi-directed interviewing and the deployment of a questionnaire to gather qualitative and quantitative data. Results will add to new knowledge exploring the effects that the privatization of marine resources has on individuals? abilities to access marine resources. This research will also bring a new perspective to fisheries management in Iceland and abroad by providing a better understanding of the variations of motivations in fisheries and exploring the ways political and social institutions affect how humans organize around resources.</AbstractNarration>

Commercial marine fisheries consist of many different ecological, social, economic, and political factors that can make it complicated to manage them effectively. For example, are there ways to ensure the future of fish resources other than reducing the number of fishermen?

And how do non-economic values such as cultural heritage and family history come into play in fishing livelihoods?</p> <p>Iceland is often hailed as having one of the best-managed fisheries in the world because of its Individual Transferrable Quota (ITQ) system started in the 1980s. ITQs are a percentage of a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) of a certain fish species that fishermen buy and sell depending on the market price. This system is effective in an economic sense because it makes fisheries overall more valuable &ndash; those who cannot afford to keep the quota sell it, and those who run efficient fishing operations buy quota to maintain or grow their fishing business. The problem with the ITQ system in Iceland was that it disproportionately impacted small-boat fishermen and rural communities. Fishing businesses were too small to cover the rising cost of quota, so fishermen lost jobs, the associated fish processing plants closed down, and whole communities began to die. These negative impacts continue to be a major political issue in Iceland, which is why a new non-ITQ summer fishery was started in 2009. This research therefore focused on small-scale fisheries and small coastal communities with the question: how do varying management schemes affect people&rsquo;s participation in small-scale fisheries and opinions of fisheries management?</p> <p>To answer this question, we first learned about the daily life of Icelandic small boat fishermen by using ethnographic methods. We conducted face-to-face interviews on boats and in homes, participated in fishing trips, and worked in fish processing plants. This ethnographic research was focused on eight communities in the Northwest of Iceland, ranging from 72 inhabitants to 2,500. Through interviewing, we learned about individual and community history, experiences in fishing, and attitudes of fisheries management.

Given this complexity, the majority of small-boat fishermen, regardless of fishery type or quota ownership, expressed dissatisfaction with the current privatized ITQ system: they felt alienated from decision-making processes, where large boat owners and scientific advice are given precedence.
