<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to obtain empirical estimates of night-time atomic hydrogen (H) density and vertical flux as a function of altitude from the lower thermosphere into the exosphere based on a coupled analysis of measured H airglow intensity and a sophisticated forward model of radiative transport for spectral line profile analysis.  Knowledge of these parameters is important for understanding the chemical and dynamical coupling between atmospheric regions.   This effort will utilize existing measurements of multi-line H emission at unprecedented precision, acquired from a suite of mature, ground-based, spectroscopic instruments, as well as new data from a novel spectroscopic instrument, which will be tested and deployed as part of this project.  Additional goals of this work are to characterize the dependence of the H distribution on geomagnetic and solar variability and to search for signatures of dynamical populations of exospheric H atoms.  H density profiles are useful for improving empirical atmospheric models and aiding data interpretation and analysis from other observational research techniques, such as neutral atom imaging.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the tenuous uppermost reaches of an atmosphere, often referred to as a corona or exosphere, important interactions take place in which mass, momentum, and energy are exchanged between the atmosphere and its interplanetary environment. What are the processes that drive the development of an exosphere and how do these processes (e.g., exospheric escape) influence the evolution of the atmosphere below? The answers to these questions are almost certain to be found by comparing and assessing planetary and minor body exospheres throughout our solar system and perhaps extrasolar planetary systems as well.   Since the 1970s ground-based spectroscopic studies of geocoronal hydrogen Balmer-alpha "night-glow" have become one of the primary methods to study the terrestrial exosphere. Observations are made throughout the night; the base of the EarthÆs shadow is used as a means to probe of the exosphereÆs altitude structure. Major areas of scientific focus include: (1) high resolution observations of the geocoronal hydrogen Balmer-alpha line profile and its relation to excitation mechanisms, effective temperature, and exospheric physics; (2) retrieval of geocoronal hydrogen parameters such as the hydrogen column abundance and the hydrogen density profile; and (3) long term observations of the geocoronal hydrogen column emission intensity for the investigation of natural variability, such as solar cycle trends.   Employing spectrometers located in Wisconsin and Chile, we have obtained some of the highest precision geocoronal hydrogen Balmer-alpha and -beta line profile and intensity data sets ever obtained, each contributing to the three major areas of geocoronal research outlined above. For example, work preformed with this NSF support has lead to the first detection of a semiannual variation in exospheric effective temperature from ground-based Balmer-alpha datasets.
