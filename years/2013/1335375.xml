<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided to reconstruct the history of hurricane landfalls in southwest Florida over the past five thousand years. The proxy record will be developed from hurricane overwash deposits preserved in backbarrier lagoons and marshes, and correlated with a compilation of climatological, meteorological, and oceanographic data for the region. The chronology of the overwash deposits will be constrained by radiometric dating, and SLOSH model results will facilitate the correlation of overwash deposits with the tropical cyclones that created them. A site-specific hurricane database will be developed for southwest Florida to better understand the characteristics of storms that produce overwash deposits. Results of this research may have implications for coastal planning and management in the region. The project will support an early-career female investigator, and will involve high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has distinguished long term hurricane patterns in SW Florida, specifically seeing an active period of hurricane overwash between 500-1000 years BP, and an inactive period between 500 years to 100 years BP, with the most recent 100 years returning to an active period. This time periods correspond to elevated sea surface temperatures (SSTS) in the main development region of the Atlantic Ocean. Results indicate that MDR SSTs are a key long term driver of hurricane activity. This research employed a multi-site approach. This project provided broad socio economic gains via the maturation in understanding of past hurricane track, frequency, and intensity which may be used later in models, risk assessment, county planning, development, and student and community education. This project allowed undergraduate and graduate students to explore science out of the classroom which broadened their knowledge of research science.

The collaboration of two female scientists through this grant has allowed great professional development: Muller showing Collins the methodology in her field, and Collins showing Muller some different meteorological datasets and connecting Muller with national and international collaborators who she might collaborate with in future. In addition, Muller and Collins have impacted female STEM students, mentoring 5 females undergraduate and graduate students, during the lifetime of the grant.  With Hurricane Irma recently making landfall in Florida as a major hurricane, understanding past activity is a key to gaining insights into our future.
