<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate a new branching point within the complex arsenic biogeochemical cycle referred to as anoxygenic photosynthetic arsenite oxidation.  During this process, bacteria catalyze light-dependent oxidation of arsenite to arsenate. Little is known about the biological basis and environmental significance of arsenite-fueled photosynthesis. There are numerous environments where this process may be occurring such as in terrestrial hot springs, shallow water thermal vents, lake and stream euphotic zones, and crop soils irrigated with arsenite rich ground water, for example in Bangladesh.  Because arsenite is considered a more toxic and hydrologically mobile form of arsenic, the oxidation of arsenite by photosynthetic bacteria could provide an important means for natural attenuation of arsenic toxicity within surface waters impacted by arsenic.  The project aims are to determine the abundance, diversity, and activity of arsenite oxidizing anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria in arsenic rich environments. The central hypothesis is that arsenic-dependent photosynthetic bacteria utilize a 'novel' arsenite oxidase enzyme called ArxA that can also be used to indicate their presence and arsenic-transforming activity in arsenic rich environments.  The hypothesis will be tested by: (i) isolating and characterizing new photosynthetic arsenite oxidizers from arsenic rich environments in various hydro/geothermal features around the Mono Lake, CA area, (ii) measuring photosynthetic arsenite oxidation rates in Big Soda Lake, an arsenic rich lake in Nevada that has a seasonal bloom of photosynthetic purple sulfur bacteria, and (iii) conducting microbial ecology studies in Big Soda Lake aimed at quantifying arsenite oxidase gene (arxA) abundance vs. depth and correlating this data to the arsenic biogeochemistry.  Results from this project will lead to the isolation of new photosynthetic arsenite oxidizing organisms, new methods for quantifying light-dependent arsenite oxidation in environmental samples, and the development of molecular-based tools that target the key genes associated with light-driven arsenite-oxidation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arsenic is mostly a naturally-occurring water pollutant affecting the health of millions of people worldwide.  Increasing our understanding of how arsenic changes and moves in the environment from which humans obtain important resources like water and food has potential implications for the mitigation of risk from this toxic element.  Microbes can play a key role in changing the chemistry of arsenic, which in turn strongly affects arsenic's mobility and toxicity.  This study focuses upon a recently-discovered form of microbial arsenic metabolism, specifically examining photosynthetic bacteria that change arsenite (more toxic form) to arsenate (less toxic form) in anoxic (oxygen-depleted) environments.  Microbial ecology and environmental chemistry studies will be conducted to determine the activities of these photosynthetic arsenic oxidizing bacteria.  The results will provide important insight regarding how these newly identified microbes may impact the complex arsenic biogeochemical cycle.  In addition, understanding arsenite-based anoxygenic photosynthesis (doesn't generate oxygen like standard photosynthesis) may provide insight regarding the evolution of early forms of photosynthesis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Arsenic is a naturally occurring water pollutant affecting the health of millions of people worldwide. Microbes are key players in controlling the toxicity and movement of arsenic in nature as different forms of arsenic are more toxic and mobile in nature.  Arsenic can occur at high levels in groundwater, hypersaline/alkaline lakes, hot springs, rivers and streams for example.  In groundwater environments and hot springs arsenic in the form of arsenite is usually dominant, which also has the greatest toxicity.  In certain environments, arsenite can be biologically converted back into arsenate, the less toxic and biologically available form of arsenic.  In either case, arsenate reduction or arsenite oxidation are conferred by unique arsenic transforming protein complexes that interface with a microbe's ability to generate energy.  This project was aimed at investigating a new form of arsenite oxidation that is carried out by certain anaerobic photosynthetic bacteria.  Microbial ecology and environmental chemistry studies were conducted to determine the activities of photosynthetic arsenic oxidizing bacteria in a model lake environment rich in naturally occurring arsenic.  The results demonstrated that these microbes were in fact active in the light.  During photosynthesis these microbes generated arsenate, the less toxic form of arsenic. A surprising finding was that during the dark another type of microbial group converted arsenate back into arsenite, which was then used in the light by the photosynthetic microbes.  Light-dark cycling of arsenate to arsenite and back could be repeated several times. The end results were the demonstration of the presence of a light-dark cycling of arsenic in a lake environment.  These results open up the possibilities for exploring light-dark cycling in other aquatic environments receiving high inputs of arsenic, such as certain rice paddies in Bangladesh. This work also provided important insight regarding the activities for photosynthetic microbes and how they influence the complex arsenic biogeochemical cycle.  The project also led to the training of PhD students and provided research opportunities for undergraduate students. The project members also mentored the research projects of summer community college students who were part of a STEM diversity program.  Other summer activities included teaching high school students within a four-week lab course in microbiology and environmental toxicology.
