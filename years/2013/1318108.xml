<AbstractNarration>Three distinct projects that study the behavior of finite element methods (FEM) will be considered. The  first project is studying the pollution effects of immersed boundaries in the immersed boundary finite  element method. A sharp error analysis will be given that measures how far one has to be from the  immersed boundary to obtain optimal convergence. The second project will involve adaptive  Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. Contraction properties of weakly penalized DG methods will be  proved. The final project is max-norm stability analysis of inf-sup stable finite element methods for the  Stokes problem. A Fortin projection that is exponentially decaying will be constructed for the lowest-order  Taylor-Hood element in three dimensions. Exponentially decaying projections will be an important tool to  prove max-norm stability estimates.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEM are widely used to simulate a variety of problems in engineering and science. Users of these  methods rely on theoretical results that give them some guarantee of their reliability. The P.I. will use  mathematical analysis to describe the behavior of FEM for three important FE methods. In particular, the  P.I. will mathematically study the behavior of the immeresed boundary FEM which is a method especially  suited for fluid-solid interactions. For example, these methods have been used to simulate blood flow and  animal locomotion, to name a few. The results of this investigation will give users theoretical guidance on  where to put more computational effort which in turn will make their simulations more accurate for  imporant applications.</AbstractNarration>
