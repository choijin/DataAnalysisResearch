<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a working prototype of a handheld detector for trace explosives that is smaller, more sensitive, and has faster response times than any commercially available portable device today. Under NSF Phase I SBIR funding of this project, Vaporsens, Inc. successfully developed new organic nanofiber sensory materials required to achieve these goals. In Phase II, the company will design and optimize the sensor systems, electronic hardware, firmware and algorithm software required to build a handheld detector. The novel nanofiber sensory materials developed by Vaporsens will enable the proposed detector to simultaneously detect all three important categories of explosives with greater sensitivity, due to detection limits in the parts per trillion range. Prototypes will be subjected to third party testing to validate the rapid, sensitive, and selective detection of common explosives. The Phase II project will also permit the design and fabrication of new sensor materials, with the aim of further improving the sensing sensitivity and selectivity of subsequent devices through interface chemistry optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of the project will reduce the impact of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) which are a leading cause of casualties in contemporary warfare. IED use outside of warfare is growing, with over 170 incidents reported in the US alone during the first six months of 2013. As a result, the worldwide annual sales for trace explosives detection equipment has grown to approximately $400 million. However, these technologies are limited in their effectiveness. Swabbing machines require contact; bomb-sniffing dogs are expensive, need to work with the same handler, and have limited endurance; and imaging technologies are only practical in checkpoint settings due to size and expense. In contrast, the small size and high sensitivity of the proposed detector will be used for exacting detection of trace amounts of explosives in nearly any location, without swabbing, and at a cost that meets or exceeds the lowest price of detectors on the market. The commercialized device will be the first of its kind to allow local law enforcement and other public safety officials, border security and the military to "sniff" suspicious bags, vehicles, lockers, and people for dangerous explosive threats with immediate results regardless of their location.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through the NSF SBIR Phase II award funding, Vaporsens developed a handheld detector for vapor-phase chemicals.  The detector features an array of sensors based on organic nanofibers.  Vaporsens? nanofibers are engineered to be selective to certain chemical species and are expected to provide industry-leading selectivity among low-cost sensors.  Furthermore, high sensitivity is a key feature, with the demonstrated ability to detect chemicals down to the parts per trillion level.  Such a high sensitivity is suitable for detecting non-volatile species, such as explosives.  Progress toward a mature, commercially-available handheld detector for explosives was substantially furthered under support from this award.  Specific tasks undertaken include:  Nanofiber Sensor Materials Development:  Developed 67 new nanofiber sensor materials, for a total of 81 unique sensors. Investigated mixed-molecule nanofibers for improved conductivity, which broadens the number of usable nanofibers.   Manufacturing Achievements:  Optimized sensor array for size and production yield. Developed a new fabrication process to enable greater sensor reproducibility.  A major challenge with nanomaterials is device-to-device variation, which the new process reduced from greater than 200% to 10-20%.   This is exceptionally low for these devices. Studied how the amount of nanofibers on a sensor affects sensing performance. Studied the performance of smaller IDE finger and gap size to optimize the IDE design based on our improved coating method, prototype, and data analysis tool. Automated fabrication through collaboration with SMART Microsystems to demonstrate the feasibility of commercial-scale fabrication. Determined efficiency of nanofiber consumption from self-assembly to sensor fabrication. Developed new containers for shipping completed sensor array boards that adequately protect the sensors.   Application Developments:  Tested sensitivity to explosives at the Naval Research Laboratory.  PETN, RDX, and TATP were detected at low concentrations (low parts per trillion for PETN and RDX, low parts per billion for TATP). Tested detection capabilities in the presence of other chemicals (e.g., fuel vapor).  Interference did not impact sensor response. Developed application-specific sensor cards that covered the three major classes of explosives: molecular-nitros (e.g., TNT, RDX, PETN), compound (e.g., ANFO), and peroxides (e.g., TATP).   Hardware Designed and Manufactured:  Designed new detector instrument with a low-noise air pump. Designed electronics to include 16 sensor channels (greater selectivity), self-calibration (ease of use), heater (quicker clear down), and less baseline drift.  Two prototypes were fabricated and tested. Released second revision of electronics for 16-sensor arrays and manufactured 10 units for testing.  The new electronics were less noisy, which led to improved sensitivity.  The pump is also better sealed for a more consistent sampling flow rate.  Several of these units were tested by customers.   Software/Algorithms Developments:  Developed algorithms for baseline correction to improve sensitivity and selectivity. Developed chemometric method for chemical identification and user data analysis tools. Released Data Visualization software, which operates the instrument and provides a real-time graphical representation of the data collected.  The user can interact with this data to zoom, scroll, auto-zero, auto-scale, and analyze (i.e., calculate the signal to noise ratio).   These activities have impacted the fields of chemical sensors, organic semiconductors, and nanomaterials.  Four publications and three invention disclosures resulted from this work.  Advancement of these fields includes:  Discovery of a class of unusually conductive nanofibers, which were roughly six orders of magnitude more conductive than typical materials. Demonstrated ability to detect nonvolatile explosives (PETN and RDX) in the vapor phase, which may enable new security screening capabilities. Studied the impact of different features of the sensors (amount of nanofiber, electrode geometry, surface coating of the electrode) on sensor performance. Developed and demonstrated new electronics capable of reading low-conductivity materials.   In addition to the publications and disclosures, Vaporsens is proud to have trained five students as employees under this award.  Of these five, two graduated and have become full-time employees.  Additionally, one postdoctoral fellow was added to the staff as a NSF/ASEE Small Business Diversity Research Fellow and has since become a full-time employee.

These students developed professional skills and are/were productive members of the Vaporsens team. Through supplementary funding, Vaporsens collaborated with SMART Microsystems, which is part of Lorain County Community College.  Two students from Lorain County Community College were involved.  A graduate student at Penn State University was also involved in the SECO supplement.       Last Modified: 07/16/2018       Submitted by: Douglas W Later]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
