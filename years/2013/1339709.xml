<AbstractNarration>The PI meeting will showcase the NSF Expeditions in Computing program and provide an opportunity for Expeditions PIs and program directors to interact with each other, the NSF, and industry guests. The meeting will last three days and include an overview of existing Expeditions projects, panels on topics of large project management, outreach, and opportunities in additional NSF programs.  The schedule will include ample time for one-on-one interactions including a poster session on the final day. In addition, the meeting will coincide with the CISE advisory board meeting to give the board members a chance to learn more about CISE's flagship program, interact with the research teams, and provide feedback and suggestions to the showcased research projects or the expedition program in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This meeting will highlight the three goals of the Expeditions program: to catalyze far-reaching research explorations motivated by deep scientific questions or hard problems in the computing and information fields, and/or by compelling applications that promise significant societal benefits; to inspire current and future generations of Americans, especially those from under-represented groups, to pursue rewarding careers in computer and information science and engineering; and to stimulate significant research and education outcomes that, through effective knowledge transfer mechanisms, promise scientific, economic and/or other societal benefits.  This is the first Expeditions PI meeting and will also serve to provide direct feedback to the NSF on the success of the Expeditions program as well as suggestions for the future of the program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will provide opportunity for researchers from disparate disciplines to interact and learn new models for conducting and managing large basic research projects.  The meeting will also serve as a venue for connecting with potential industry partners for technology transition. One key aspect of the discussions will be an overview of each team's outreach activities and the benefits and challenges of large, coordinated outreach and education efforts compared to individual efforts. In addition, teams will be encouraged to bring students to the meeting to participate in presentations and discussions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The main goal was to hold a meeting of all Expeditions in Computing teams to share our visions for the program, go over management strategies for large research projects, and provide feedback to the NSF for how the Expeditions program is operating.      The activities involved a meeting of all current (at the time) Expeditions in Computing teams. This included PIs, co-PIs, students/postdocs, and representatives from industry and government. There were various events including presentations and a poster session to highlight the impact of the Expeditions projects.     Teams had the opportunity to interact with representatives from industry - partially with the hope of establishing collaborations with the long-term vision of translation of Expeditions technologies to commercial use.  The discussions between the Expedition PIs, industrial participants, and the NSF CISE leadership at this PI meeting led to the  "Innovation Transition" (lnTrans) program supported by the Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering (CISE) Directorate for project teams completing Expeditions-in Computing projects and for project teams completing 5-year Frontiers projects in the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) programs.  The goal of InTrans is to continue the long-term vision and objectives of the project team, to mature and deploy successful research and innovation results in industries, and to facilitate the transition of the innovations to support from industrial sponsors along with the potential to develop new technologies.  Please see http://www.nsf.gov/cise/ccf/ccf-intrans.jsp for details.          Last Modified: 05/28/2015       Submitted by: Robert Wood]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
