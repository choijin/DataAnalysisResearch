<AbstractNarration>Understanding the response of forests to air pollution is critical as it affects clean water, timber production and carbon storage.  Comparing forests in different parts of the earth will help us understand if the response is uniform or regionally specific.  This project compares forest responses in the temperate deciduous forest in the eastern United States and in eastern China. These two countries have opposite histories and trajectories of air pollution. When the Industrial Revolution began, air pollution in the form of acid deposition increased rapidly in the U.S. and was at high levels until the Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970 when the pollution dropped dramatically. Over the same time period, China has had low levels of air pollution until relatively recently as pollution levels have increased to historic highs. In a preliminary study using tree rings and carbon isotopes, an important isotopic signal was found in Eastern red cedars in the West Virginia that indicated these trees are now recovering from air pollution. This observation, however, is limited to a single species from a single stand of trees.  This project will determine how wide-spread and universal this response is by using additional tree species along a transect stretching across the southern, central, and northern Appalachian region. Similar transects in China will be used to compare the isotopic signatures and growth of trees from similar genera that are currently undergoing opposite patterns of change in acid deposition.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If widespread, results from this study will have important implications for carbon storage and cycling in many northern hemisphere forests, especially those downwind from pollution sources. Understanding such complexities will provide much needed information on the overall vulnerability and resilience of forests to dynamic changes in acidic pollution and atmospheric CO2. To broaden the societal impact of the proposed research, data will be made available to inform policy makers, federal land managers, modelers, and other scientists who may benefit from the results. Activities will be incorporated into effective learning activities for high school students and adults to provide a deeper understanding of the link between effective government policies (such as the Clean Air Act) and the health of forest ecosystems. Further, this project will provide training for graduate students and undergraduates, particularly those from facets of society that are underrepresented in science education and research.</AbstractNarration>

In order to continually refine this important role of forests in earth system models, there is a colossal effort by scientists to more completely understand how forests function, how trees grow, and the environmental factors that either positively or negatively affect tree growth. Tree growth is complex and potentially affected by many environmental factors, such as precipitation, temperature, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>concentration, and acidic deposition. While experiments have examined how numerous environmental factors affect tree growth and forest productivity, the complexity of how all the factors that affect tree growth interact is hard to replicate experimentally. Our research project used increment cores from trees growing naturally in forests for decades and the isotopic signatures of the tree ring wood to provide an annually refined record of tree growth and leaf physiology in order to disentangle the environmental complexity of historical changes in forest productivity. We cored conifer and deciduous hardwood trees in the Appalachian region in 16 forested locations, ranging from the Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee and Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina to the Central Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. We used standard dendrochronological techniques (bootstrapped Pearson&rsquo;s correlations), as well as more complex statistical methods (Kendall&rsquo;s rank correlation and linear mixed effects models), to examine the influence and interactions of environmental parameters on historic tree growth and physiology, as well as the sensitivity by the trees to individual environmental factors. For red spruce, a major conifer species in the Appalachian Mountains, the two most important environmental factors affecting tree growth since 1989 were increases in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>and reductions in acidic sulfur air pollution. Warmer spring temperatures and reductions in N air pollution were also important for red spruce tree growth but to a lesser extent than CO<sub>2</sub>and sulfur air pollution. Growth of red oak and tulip poplar, two major deciduous hardwood species, has also increased in growth since the 1960&rsquo;s despite the trees being in their mature phase of growth, but our results indicate that their growth was more complex than the conifer trees we studied and often interactions of environmental factors on tree growth were observed. For example, growth of red oak was negatively impacted by acidic sulfur air pollution, but more so when summer precipitation was low than when summers were very wet. Nitrogen air pollution had a positive effect on red oak growth acting as a plant fertilizer, but primarily when summer precipitation was high. Nitrogen air pollution also had a positive effect on tulip poplar growth, and this positive effect increased as atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>increased over time. A common theme with our studies of conifer and deciduous hardwood growth in the Appalachian Mountains is that acidic air pollution has a strong effect on tree growth and physiology and that recent increases in tree growth strongly correlate with declines in acidic air pollution since the Clean Air Act was legislated in the 1970&rsquo;s.
