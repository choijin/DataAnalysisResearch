<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the biological and genetic diversity of a recently discovered group of fungi known as Cryptomycota. The group is primarily known only from molecular signatures which have been ubiquitously recovered in the environment using DNA techniques. From what little is known of the group, these fungi appear to be parasitic on other organisms, yet, the precise set of hosts and habitat requirements of Cryptomycota remain mysterious. This research will catalog the diversity of the group and provide novel insights into its morphology, host-range, and environmental function. Individual cells isolated from multiple habitat types in North America will be will be analyzed using state-of-the-art genomics methods and microscopy to put a face and function onto organisms that heretofore have been merely characterized as environmental barcodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cryptomycota apparently make up a large proportion of the diversity of organisms in many habitats, ranging from ponds and soil to the sea. Understanding the function of these organisms and what they parasitize is vital for developing a predictive understanding of food webs and nutrient cycling. Moreover, elucidating what organisms these fungi parasitize could have significant implications for the security of our food supply and the production of biofuels. There may also be implications for human health. The senior personnel will train postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students in modern techniques of mycology, genomics, and bioinformatics. The DNA sequence data generated in this study will be made publicly available through webservers, which will be enriched with educational and research content regarding Cryptomycota.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project examined the diversity of a fungal group known as Cryptomycota. The Cryptomycota is a recently described phylum of fungi that is known primarily from environmental DNA sequences that suggest the group is ubiquitous in aquatic, terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The few visualized or described species are all endoparasites of fungi, amoebae, slime molds, and small animals. These fungi are related to a group of parasites, known as Microsporidia, which are also endoparasitic, primarily on animal hosts, and possess some of the most reduced features of all eukaryotes, such as tiny genomes and lack of mitochondria. Overall, we lack a clear understanding of the diversity, habitat preferences, and function of this group of fungi. The goals of this project were to use and develop molecular methods to better characterize the Cryptomycota and explore its biodiversity. The project was a collaboration between the University of Michigan, the University of California, and the Joint Genome Institute (DOE). A major outcome to emerge from the project was the development of methods for sequencing the genomes of individual cells of fungi (single cell genomics). This pipeline is able to go from water sample to annotated genome of individual cells in the sample. Our team showed that these data could readily be used to grow the fungal tree of life by developing the techniques on 8 test species and then using the method to produce six single cell genomes from environmental samples. A second goal was to generate new data on the diversity of the group by probing environmental DNA with next generation sequencing methods. We found that the diversity of Cryptomycota was high across soil, freshwater, and marine samples, but that aquatic and marine sediments were particularly rich in diversity. Our efforts to find Cryptomycota in host-associated habitats, such as aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, were unsuccessful. This may mean that these fungi are more often associated with other eukaryotic microbes such as protozoa. A final research outcome of this project was the genome sequencing of three additional Cryptomycota taxa: <em>Paramicrosporidium saccamoebae</em> (a parasite that resides in the nucleus of amoebae), <em>Rozella rhizoclosmatii</em> (a parasite of an aquatic fungus known as a chytrid), and<em> Rozella multimorpha</em> (a parasite of the water mold <em>Pythium</em>). The latter two species were formally described new species that were part of this project. The genomic data for these species solidified the relationship of Cryptomycota and Microsporidia and showed evidence that the various lineages of Cryptomycota were undergoing independent losses from a diverse ancestor rather than a steady reduction over time. The data from this project will help the community characterize the diversity and function of DNA samples collected from diverse habitats. We are working on generating a revised ribosomal RNA sequence classifier that improves the ability to identify sequences. This project supported research and training of 2 postdoctoral fellows and 5 undergraduates. The project also facilitated the development of 13 scientific articles, 8 of which are published and dozens of research presentations at scientific meetings.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/04/2018<br>      Modified by: Timothy&nbsp;James</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
