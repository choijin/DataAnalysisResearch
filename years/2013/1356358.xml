<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the study of environmental change and solutions to the consequences of these changes to society. The program is built on a collaborative interdisciplinary research history at the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL) and the newly established Department of Ecosystem Science and Sustainability (ESS) within the Warner College of Natural Resources. Degree options in the department include a BS in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability and a BS in Watershed Science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;NREL and ESS have developed a mature and productive community of scholars who are committed to undergraduate education and experienced in mentoring low income students and students underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Through the education initiatives at the university, there is a recruitment pipeline from partner high schools. What has been missing is a concerted effort to connect the recruitment pipeline and retention activities operated through the student affairs side of campus directly to the research community. This project is making these connections by having researchers work with the student affairs staff to attract and prepare prospective students while they are still in high school. Scholarship recipients are participating in three university programs: 1) the Summer Bridge Program for recent HS graduates, 2) the university Key Freshmen Learning Communities that include students taking common courses and living in the same dormitory, coupled with courses and seminars that foster professional development and bridge science-to-societal issues, and 3) the BS degree programs in the Department of Ecosystem Science and Sustainability that stress content knowledge through coursework, research and internships, and opportunities to communicate findings at professional conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six program goals are to: (1) recruit and retain 4 cohorts from 23 partner high schools resulting in a total of 57 lower and upper classmen students over 4 years, from low-income backgrounds, into the BS programs in either Ecosystem Science and Sustainability or Watershed Science; (2) provide the scholars with a multi-year educational experience that includes courses, seminars, research and internship opportunities, and career advising. (3) create a scholarly environment that supports academic success and promotes research skills and intellectual development; (4) provide an environment in which scholars explore environmental questions and discuss solutions to environmental challenges; (5) create a professional development environment that addresses the personal and social needs of the scholars to enable them to pursue a career in ecology or in an ecosystem or watershed science-related field; and (6) institutionalize key elements of the program to sustain it after NSF funding is completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;Students are being exposed to relevant questions such as: a) climate variability and biological diversity; b) state-of-the-art field and laboratory approaches, instrumentation, and techniques that include molecular techniques, stable isotopes, and modeling; c) essential professional skills (e.g., analytical, writing and presentation); and d) multiple career options and the pathways through which the students can achieve them (e.g., academia, government, and the private sector). The greatest impact comes from the efforts to connect the recruitment pipeline and support networks operated through the student affairs side of campus directly to the curricula and scholarship practiced by the academic affairs side of campus.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Colorado State University Pathways S-STEM program was based on a philosophy of inclusive excellence designed to recruit, retain and graduate students from under-represented (UREP) groups into the BS in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability or BS in Watershed Science, or in related STEM degree programs. The initiative had seven program, student-centered, and institutional goals. Program goals (Goals 1-2) were aimed at recruiting, retaining, and offering educational, research, and internship opportunities and stipends to students over five years from UREP groups in STEM. Student-centered goals (Goals 3-5) were aimed at increasing student knowledge, research skills and communication skills, and providing them with an understanding of how to pursue a career in related fields.&nbsp; Institutional goals (Goals 6-7) were designed to reform recruitment practices, to increase diversity, and achievement of under-served students. <em>Program Goals</em> - <strong>Goal 1</strong>: Recruit and retain 4 cohorts resulting in 24 lower classman students and upper classman over 4 years from low-income backgrounds into the BS in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability or BS in Watershed Science from regional high schools. <strong>Goal 2</strong>: Provide the students with a multi-year educational experience that includes courses, seminars, research and internship opportunities, and career advising. <em>Student-Centered Goals</em> - <strong>Goal 3</strong>: Create a scholarly environment to promote research skills and intellectual development. <strong>Goal 4</strong>: Provide an environment in which S-STEM Scholars explore environmental questions and discuss solutions to society&rsquo;s environmental challenges. <strong>Goal 5</strong>: Provide a professional development environment that addresses the personal and social needs of the S-STEM scholars to enable them to pursue a career in an ecosystem or watershed science-related field. <em>Institutional Goal</em> - <strong>Goal 6</strong>: Bridge facets of university strength that are currently weakly connected for UREP groups: research and instruction (i.e., academic affairs) with recruitment and retention (i.e., student affairs); improving this connection will increase the recruitment and retention of low-income students in environment-related disciplines. <strong>Goal 7</strong>:&nbsp; Institutionalize key elements of the program to sustain the program after NSF funding is completed.</p> <p>The initiative succeeded in meeting or exceeding its goals.

Twenty one students (62%) graduated, 10 students (29%) &nbsp;are continuing their degree programs in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability, Watershed Science, or a STEM-major, 4 students (12%) changed majors to a non-STEM major and 3 students (9%) withdrew from the University. Hence, the program retained or graduated 91% of its fellows.&nbsp; Of the 21 students that graduated, 7 are pursued graduate degrees, 10 are employed in STEM positions and 3 work in non-STEM fields. The program implemented a statewide recruitment plan for fellows that included current CSU students, students from 10 CSU Alliance Partnership High Schools, and Colorado high schools with high needs. Members of the project team visited each of our CSU Alliance partner schools to meet with teachers, career advising staff, students and parents. The program initiated a summer enrichment program for rising HS students that involved S-STEM fellows as peer-mentors. This component is now self-sustaining, and has been expanded to include all five departments in the Warner College of Natural Resources. The program established a partnership with the CSU Bridge Scholars Summer Program to recruit students from high needs and under-represented backgrounds with an early start during the summer between HS graduation and the Fall semester at CSU.
