<AbstractNarration>Computer simulation plays a central role in helping us understand, predict, and engineer the physical and chemical properties of technological materials systems such as semiconductor devices, photovoltaic systems, chemical reactions and catalytic behavior. Despite significant progress in performing realistic simulations in full microscopic detail, some problems are currently out of reach: two examples are the modeling of electronic devices with multiple functional parts based on new materials such as novel low power computer switches that would revolutionize the Information Technology industry, and the photovoltaic activity of complex interfaces between polymers and inorganic nanostructures that would enhance US energy self-reliance.  The research program of this collaborative software institute aims to create an open and effective scientific software package that can make efficient use of cutting-edge high performance computers (HPC) to solve challenging problems involving the physics and chemistry of materials.  By having such software available, this software initiative will have multiple broad impacts.  First, the community of materials scientists will be able to study next-generation problems in materials physics and chemistry, and computer science advances that enable the software will be demonstrated and made accessible for both communities which will help cross-fertilize further such collaborative efforts.  Second, the capability of simulating and engineering more complex materials systems and technological devices could play a role in helping the US continue is competitive edge in science, technology, and education. Third, through training of young scientists, direct outreach to the broader scientific community through workshops and conferences, and educational programs ranging from secondary to graduate levels, the power, importance, and capabilities of computational modeling, materials science, and computer science methodologies that enable the science will be communicated to a broad audience.  Finally, by enabling the refinement of existing materials systems as well as discovery of new materials systems, the resulting scientific advances can help broadly impact society via technological improvements: in terms of the two examples provided above, (a) the successful design of new electronic device paradigms helps significantly advance the digital revolution by permitting the introduction of smaller, more efficient, and more capable electronic circuits and information processing systems, and (b) successful creation of inexpensive, easy-to-fabricate, and durable photovoltaic materials and devices can lead to cleaner forms of energy production while reducing reliance on fossil fuels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical goal is to greatly enhance the open software tool OPENATOM to advance discovery in nanoscience and technology. OPENATOM will be delivered as a open, robust and validated software package capable of utilizing HPC architectures efficiently to describe the electronic structure of complex materials systems from first principles.  In terms of describing electronic ground-states, OPENATOM will be enhanced by features such as improved configurational sampling methods, hybrid density functionals, and incorporation of fast super-soft pseudopotential techniques. In addition, the team will incorporate the many-body GW-BSE approach for electronic excitations that permits accurate computation of electronic energy levels, optical absorption and emission, and luminescence.  Ultimately, such an extensible software framework will permit accurate electronic structure computations to employ effectively future HPC platforms with 10,000,000 cores.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Computer simulations play a central role in helping understand,predict, and engineer the physical and chemical properties oftechnological materials systems such as semiconductor devices,photovoltaic systems, chemical reactions and catalytic behavior.  Thisproject was focused on developing new computational algorithms andassociated software systems, within the open-source software toolOpenAtom, to help the community of computational researchers studynext-generation complex materials systems.  OpenAtom is a softwarethat simulates the behavior of electrons in materials or molecules bynumerically solving the fundamental quantum mechanical equationsgoverning the behavior of the electrons.  Knowledge of the behavior ofelectrons in a material allows one to describe a wide variety ofproperties including the nature of the chemical bonds holding amaterial together and thus its strength, plasticity, etc.; itselectrical conductivity; its possible magnetic behaviors; or how itinteracts with light and other forms of energy.   Overall, the improvements to OpenAtom in terms of methodology andalgorithms fell into three categories: (1) methods that permitimproved sampling of the various atomic-scale arrangements visited bya materials system as its atoms and electrons evolve theirconfigurations dynamically in time, (2) efficient implementation ofmethods that described the interactions of atomic nuclei and electronsin computationally efficient ways that permit much larger simulationsto be performed using the same computational hardware, and (3)incorporation of methods into OpenAtom that allow it to describeaccurately the behavior and dynamics of electrons when energeticallyexcited, e.g., by interacting with light (light absorption, emission,and luminescence).  The enhancements to OpenAtom in terms ofcomputational prowess involved implementation of methodologies usingadvanced software systems that permit OpenAtom to efficiently utilizelarge supercomputers.  Tests and benchmarks showed that OpenAtom canrun on the largest of U.S. supercomputers while efficiently usinghundreds of thousands of computer processors in parallel.  This wasapplicable to both the dynamical sampling of configurations as well asthe description of electronic excitations.   This project also helped train undergraduate and graduate students aswell as postdoctoral researchers at two different universities inclose collaboration with researchers in industry.  The mentoringhelped this younger generation of researchers learn about materialssimulations, electronic behavior, different methods of simulation,software implementation, and parallel computation and associatedsupercomputing architectures.  In addition, they gained valuableskills in presenting their work to a broad audience, writing technicalreports and journal publications, and working in a broad andsuccessful collaboration across multiple intellectual disciplines.
