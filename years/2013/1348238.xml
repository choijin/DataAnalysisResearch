<AbstractNarration>Despite past efforts, a number of fundamental aspects of initial ice crystal formation (termed "nucleation") in clouds remain uncertain.  Previous experiments have produced scattered results partly because the nucleation mode was not well controlled and the methods used introduced artifacts.  These investigators plan to eliminate such problems by developing a new two-capillary instrument in which a single crystal nucleates and grows at the tip of an ultra-thin pure-silica glass capillary within a small growth chamber that can be isolated from the vapor source.  The presence of two well-separated crystals held under identical isothermal conditions will allow precise observation of the deposition and sublimation processes.  Advantages of this approach over previous methods (e.g., diffusion chambers, substrate chambers, and electrodynamic balances) include greater control over the thermodynamic conditions and the ability to characterize potential crystal-crystal and crystal-substrate interactions.  Experiments in the new twin-capillary chamber will be made for a range of air pressures and temperatures, including conditions relevant to cirrus formation, as well as for multiple nucleation modes.  By nucleating the initial crystal in different ways, these investigators expect to determine how much of the previously observed scatter in crystal habits arose from variations in nucleation mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research rests on development of more precise, artifact-free data describing crystal shape ("habit") development and deposition coefficient functions as a function of environmental conditions.  These results will allow improved evaluation of current crystal growth models.  Broader impacts will accrue through training of a graduate student in techniques of new-instrument design and data analysis and through dissemination of results via multidisciplinary conferences and scientific journals.  Ultimately these findings will contribute to improved representation of cirrus clouds in the earth's climate system.  Additional outreach will include web-based distribution of high-quality video microscopy depicting crystal growth and sublimation.</AbstractNarration>

The new instrument has better control of thermodynamic conditions than existed in previous methods, and has the ability to perform three simultaneous growth or sublimation experiments under identical conditions.   This capability allows us to continually check the reproducibility of our measured growth rates and crystal shape evolution.  The new instrument provides us the opportunity for experiments over a range of air pressures including very low pressures; for experiments in a range of temperatures including cirrus cloud-relevant temperatures, and in well-controlled and experimentally determined humidity levels.   After instrument testing, we used the instrument for a six month experimental campaign of growth and sublimation experiments at temperature and growth conditions similar to those found in cirrus clouds.

In the experiments we observed the formation of both hexagonal prisms and irregular crystal shapes &ndash; crystal types that are also commonly found in cirrus clouds. A focus of the experiments is to understand how reproducible sublimation rate, growth rate and ice crystal shape are under well-controlled conditions.  One of our findings are that a variety of crystal shapes do form under identical temperature and growth conditions and that crystal growth rates are often quite variable and crystallographic-direction dependent.   The intellectual merit of the project is to reduce the uncertainty of ice growth and sublimation processes in cloud models.  We have done experiments to obtain precise, artifact-free data sets photographing the development of the ice crystal shapes and quantifying the distribution of growth and sublimation rates for both the basal and prism faces of both single- and poly-crystalline ice particles.  We then use our growth and sublimation rate measurements for detailed comparisons with crystal growth models in order to extract values for the fundamental and experimentally unknown parameters in these models &ndash; parameters like the deposition coefficient functions.  We expect this information will be useful to cloud modelers and could assist in solving several current research problems.  The broader impact of this work is to assist climate modelers and policy makers.  Global climate change may greatly impact society, making it crucial that policy makers have the most accurate possible assessments from climate models.
