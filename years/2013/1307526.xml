<AbstractNarration>This award supports the Particle Physics Group of Jawahery and Roberts at the University of Maryland to study the physics of heavy flavor and CP-violation at the LHCb Experiment at the LHC Collider at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland.   The Maryland group is a new institutional member of the collaboration and will be making both technical and analytical contributions to the experiment in its current configuration, and forthcoming upgrades.  The technical focus for the current experiment will emphasize tracking software and flavor tagging, operations and data analysis and, for the upgraded experiment, tracking and particle identification.  The analytical focus will emphasize the group's expertise in CP violation studies of charm decays and loop-dominated B meson decays.  Broader impacts of the program include engaging high school students and undergraduate students  from underrepresented groups in science in hands research in the group's Photo Detector Laboratory on the campus in College Park, Maryland.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding the fundamental structure of matter and the origin of the universe is at the core of research in physics, astronomy and cosmology. Our current knowledge of the fundamental constituents of matter and the laws that govern their interactions, obtained from decades of experimental observations and theoretical ideas and efforts, is encapsulated in the so-called Standard Model. These laws also have profound influence on our understanding of the universe.  However, the Standard Model is believed to be incomplete, as it fails to account for some important findings and questions, such as the apparent imbalance of matter with respect to antimatter in the universe and the strong evidence for dark matter inferred from astronomical observations. A major goal of this research program has been to search for and examine possible evidence for new particles and laws of nature beyond those described in the Standard Model. The program involves the study of proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland. These collisions are recorded by a particle spectrometer called the LHCb detector. While the results of these studies overwhelmingly conform to the predictions of the Standard Model, evidence for potential deviations has emerged in a few areas, which, if confirmed by future more precise observations, will have a tremendous impact on our understanding of the laws of nature.   Evidence for unequal lepton interactions   Enshrined in the Standard Model is the equality of the strength of interactions between charged leptons- the three electron-like particles amongst the building blocks of matter- and the gauge bosons that mediate the electroweak forces. A key finding of the research supported by this award is evidence for preferential interactions involving the heaviest charged lepton.  This result, which deviates from the Standard Model predictions, is consistent with a previous finding at the BaBar experiment that operated at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory from 1999-2008.  Similar results are also reported by the Belle experiment in Japan.  Influenced by these observations, new studies are planned to perform more precise and comprehensive measurements that may reveal the origin of this intriguing effect and its implications.   Study of differences in Matter and Antimatter Interactions  Another key objective of this program is to perform precise measurements of differences in the behavior of matter particles compared with their antimatter counterparts, the results of which may reveal information on the origin of the observed matter-antimatter imbalance in nature, which is crucial to understanding how the universe evolved to its current state.  Studies carried out in this research program led to the development of new algorithms and techniques that improved the capabilities of the LHCb detector in performing such measurements.    Upgrade of the LHCb Detector   The LHCb collaboration, the international consortium of institutions that built and now operates the LHCb experiment at CERN, is also engaged in a major program to upgrade the detector.  The detector upgrade enables the experiment to operate at much higher collision intensities, thus allowing more precise measurements of rare processes.  On this front, our research program has been focused on the design of sophisticated electronics instrumentation for extracting and recording electrical signals from a silicon strip detector system, which is key to detecting and recording the trajectories of charged particles produced in the collisions.  The new instruments will be installed in the LHCb detector in the next prolonged shutdown of the LHC collider in 2019.   Training of young scientists and engineers  In addition to these fundamental research goals, this research program has helped train several young scientists and engineers, including undergraduates, PhD. graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and engineers, in sophis...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
