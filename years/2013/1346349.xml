<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop a novel holographic microscope system for examining cytological samples, such as blood smears, at the point of care. Current blood cell analysis techniques require manual examination by expert technicians, resulting in a costly and time-consuming test. The project proposes to develop a compact, portable, inexpensive, and easy-to-use wide field digital holographic microscope for automated screening of blood and cell samples. In this unique microscope design, optical fidelity and alignment are achieved through the use of an interferometric sample chamber, which produces holographic images of cell samples with simple laser illumination. The objectives of this project are to build a prototype microscope with low-cost chambers capable of imaging 1 million cells in 5 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is as new tool for detection of diseases such as malaria. Even with recent advances, malaria is a significant health concern with 300-500 million cases each year and 1-3 million deaths, 90% of which occur in impoverished regions in sub-Saharan Africa with the majority of the cases occurring in young children. The proposed holographic microscope can provide rapid diagnosis for far less expense than manual examination of blood smears, while improving on the accuracy of comparably priced antigen based tests. The commercial opportunity is significant both in the U.S. and abroad. Malaria detection is the first target; there are additional opportunities for detection of other blood based diseases as the technology develops.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project was to commercialize a holographic imaging system that performs high throughput, high resolution imaging of unstained blood cells in a robust, broadly useful platform.  This imaging system can be useful to analyze blood samples for biomedically relevant features as well as assessment of parasite presence, species, stage, and infection rate. In Phase I, we have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by building a prototype microscope system, including implementation of a software package for performing digital image processing, and developing the design of the InCh sample chamber, the key technological innovation for this system.  The main advantage of the InCh is that it produces holographic renderings of cellular samples through simple illumination with coherent light, a significant simplification over most holographic schemes, which can require complex, costly instrumentation. Instead, the simplicity of InCh sample chamber enables low cost holographic imaging permitting use as a biomedical diagnostic platform.   In the project, the performance of the InCh microscope system has been verified by imaging technical samples as well as unstained, aqueous blood samples.    The instrument developed during Phase I has significant intellectual merit since it improves cell imaging by providing high resolution phase maps of unstained cells at high frame rates.  Integration with a microfluidic chip will enable users of this technology to undertake high throughput studies of cell morphology and function.   The knowledge gained from these studies will provide new means for assessing the health of cells in applications such as diagnosis and monitoring of disease. The system creates a new measurement modality for digital holography and thus will make a significant contribution to the optical engineering field. In addition, the incorporation of spectroscopic information will offer a new label-free approach for assessing molecular parameters such as protein content, providing a significant contribution to the biosensing and cytology fields.  As part of the reviewer feedback on our Phase I STTR proposal was concern about the market need for malaria testing particularly in the field as we had proposed.  It was suggested that we look at other markets and needs for the holographic microscope and InCh chamber.  So during the Phase I period, we reached out to companies, researchers, and physicians and discussed their needs and the capability of the InCh system.  We found significant interest in point of care (PoC) blood cell imaging and counting for the US market.  Several large companies in this space expressed a need for low cost PoC systems and this was confirmed by discussions with physicians in pediatric and general practices.  The requirements include a system cost below $5,000 and a disposable with a cost of a few dollars.  Testing time needs to be less than 5 minutes and we need to match the test results from current tests such as total hemoglobin, 3 part WBC differential, and 5 part WBC differential.  The project offers significant broader impact since a high speed, point of care (PoC) blood imaging and counting system enables physicians to improve speed to diagnosis by providing real time information.  The knowledge gained by using this system can lead to new clinical uses that provide early-detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of a range of diseases. For example, accurate white blood cell counts can differentiate bacterial infection from viral infection leading to more accurate prescription of antibiotics and reduction of overuse.   Successful development of the InCh-based holographic microscope will significantly help health management of patients in a point of case setting.  We are confident we can commercialize the microscope to meet market needs based on our strong team and our previous work in this area. In addition, by employing the STTR mechanism, th...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
