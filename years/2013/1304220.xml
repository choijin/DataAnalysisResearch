<AbstractNarration>The Arctic is experiencing rapid environmental change ranging from diminishing sea ice extent, to warming permafrost, to melting and mass loss on ice sheets and glaciers. It is important that we advance our fundamental understanding of the drivers, impacts, and feedbacks of changes in the Arctic?s physical system and how they relate to Arctic and global climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential thaw of permafrost has received much attention in recent years as a diagnostic measure of climate change, yet we still do not fully understand the physical role that permafrost plays in the climate system. The unique physical attributes of permafrost impose particular constraints upon aspects of the climate system. For example, annual freezing and thawing of the ground and water in the ground provides a seasonal damping mechanism through the consumption and release of latent heat. On longer timescales, cold ice-rich layers of deeper permafrost can draw in considerable amounts of energy before breeching an isothermal condition and rising above the freezing point. In essence, permafrost acts as a terrestrial subsurface freezer. The ice matrix in permafrost soils inhibits drainage, which leads to saturated near-surface soils and phenomena such as a perched water table and an ice-rich transient layer at the base of the active layer. Permafrost can in some respects be considered as a bathplug at the base of the active layer that causes the active layer bathtub to fill (often with snowmelt water) seasonally. The existence of such processes, their seasonality and spatial occurrence are all expected to change, but the impacts remain undiagnosed. Until recently, climate or Earth system models have not contained sufficient process representation to allow investigation into the coupled land-permafrost-atmosphere- climate system. Model capabilities in the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and its terrestrial component the Community Land Model (CLM) have advanced considerably in recent years to the level that the role of permafrost on the physical climate system, in both the present climate and in a possible future with much less permafrost, can now be meaningfully investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand the contribution of permafrost to present and future climate trajectories, this project will conduct a series of targeted model experiments with the latest version of CESM-CLM. The researchers will seek answers to the questions: What control does permafrost, as a terrestrial ?freezer? and ?bathplug,? exert on Arctic climate? and How will a loss of permafrost feed back onto the amplitude, seasonality, or rate of Arctic climate change?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerical experiments will be conducted in both off-line and coupled simulations with various influences of permafrost on the climate system artificially manipulated to illuminate the present-day role of permafrost on the climate system and how its loss can feedback onto climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the research begins with an evaluation of CLM?s capabilities in the Arctic. The CLM model is used extensively by the broader science community. Through a series of experiments they expect to gain an understanding of the mechanistic role of permafrost within the climate system and how those mechanisms will influence the trajectory of overall Arctic change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the work are several. Understanding the longer-term impacts of permafrost on the climate builds intellectual capital that can aid with seasonal to decadal prediction with feedbacks to forecasting. Arctic change both hinders and encourages socio-economic development, thus system-wide understanding will aid efficient and responsible use of regional resources. Through the support of a graduate student the project will contribute to the next generation of researchers and improve scientific literacy, as the student is exposed to the cutting edge of climate modeling and develops analytic skills that can also translate to numerous sectors of the economy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this project were to further our understanding of the role of permafrost and permafrost thaw within the climate system and how permafrost thaw will influence the trajectory of overall Arctic change.  In particular, we examined the extent that climate change could be amplified or mitigated depending on the highly uncertain permafrost hydrologic response to permafrost thaw.   There is evidence in the literature and in models that both wetter and drier soil conditions, after permafrost thaw, is possible.  This uncertainty has implications for the projected surface energy budget and also the fate of currently frozen permafrost carbon. This so-clled permafrost carbon-climate feedback is highly uncertain is due to many factors, including the role that permafrost thaw-induced transitions in soil hydrologic conditions will have on organic matter decomposition rates and the proportion of aerobic (CO2 emissions) to anaerobic (CH4 emissions) respiration.  Large-scale permafrost thaw, as predicted by the Community Land Model (CLM) under an unmitigated greenhouse gas emissions scenario, results in significant soil drying due to increased drainage following permafrost thaw, even though permafrost domain water inputs are projected to rise (net precipitation minus evaporation &gt; 0).  CLM predicts that drier soil conditions will accelerate organic matter decomposition, with concomitant increases in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.  Soil drying, however, strongly suppresses growth in methane (CH4) emissions.  Considering the global warming potential (GWP) of CO2 and CH4 emissions together, soil drying weakens the CLM projected GWP associated with carbon fluxes from the permafrost zone by more than 50% compared to a non-drying case.  Evaporative fluxes are also reduced if soils dry.  However, because evaporation rates across the Arctic region are generally energy-limited, rather than water-limited, the reduction is evaporation associated with soil drying is relatively weak and therefore not as impactful to climate and climate change as the carbon cycle response.  An assessment of other ?permafrost-enabled? reveals a wide range of soil moisture responses to thaw.  This high sensitivity to hydrologic change combined with the wide uncertainty across models with respect to the simulated change highlights the need for better understanding and modeling of landscape-scale changes in soil moisture conditions in response to permafrost thaw in order to more accurately assess the potential magnitude of the permafrost carbon-climate feedback.   As a partial means towards reducing uncertainty, a second focus of this project has been on improving metrics against which the simulation of permafrost and related high-latitude climate variables are evaluated.  The International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) package is a comprehensive land model evaluation tool that integrates assessment of more than 25 variables against more than 65 global, regional, and site level datasets.  The PI on this project is also a PI on the ILAMB.  In the context of this project, new diagnostics were developed and added to ILAMB focusing on permafrost.  New metrics included through this project include a permafrost area diagnostic, snow water equivalent diagnostics, and an innovative snow heat transfer diagnostic.  In addition, a polar instantiation of ILAMB has also been developed, that allows scientists to focus and assess model performance in Arctic terrestrial regions, specifically.  Development of new metrics has a broad impact across the international research community since ILAMB is used by many modeling centers and will be used to assess models for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6).
