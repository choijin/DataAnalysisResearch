<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) Program of the Chemistry Division of NSF, Professor Gregory S. Girolami of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will develop new and better molecular precursors for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) of thin films.  The current work will develop new classes of transition metal compounds, especially as they relate to the use of such molecules as precursors for the deposition of metal diborides, metal nitrides, and metal oxides.  The work will enhance already existing interactions between Professor Girolami's group and leading companies in microelectronics development. The research will lead to deeper understandings of the chemistry of volatile transition metal compounds, and could lead to better ways to deposit the wires and insulators that are key components of modern-day computer chips. In addition, the award will contribute to the education of a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students, and allow Professor Girolami to maintain his involvement in various services and outreach activities, such as library exhibits of rare books illustrating the history and advancement of science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity is aimed toward the synthesis of new volatile compounds (especially of the transition metals), investigations of their chemical reactivities, and studies of their volatilities and utilities as thin film precursors.  Some of the specific objectives of the current project are synthesis of new two-coordinate complexes of the late transition elements, and the chemical tuning of ligands to change the volatility, reducing power, and deposition activation energies of their complexes in a systematic way. In parallel, investigations of the use of these new CVD precursors for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) will be carried out collaboratively with experts in these techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Developing new and improved chemical methods for making faster, more powerful, and less expensive computer chips has been one of the main objectives of this funded research.  With support from the National Science Foundation, this research program led by Dr. Girolami resulted in the development of new molecules that can serve as chemical starting materials for the deposition of thin films of a variety of metals, metal diborides, metal nitrides, and metal oxides.  One of the main challenges facing the microelectronics industry is to find methods to grow the films at temperatures as low as possible, often below 300 degrees Centrigrade.  Dr. Girolami and his research group have been successful in developing new chemical starting materials able to convert at such low temperatures into useful thin films.   Another challenge is to develop methods to grow thin films in very tiny recessed features, because this ability enables a number of key chip manufacturing steps, such as forming wires that connect the electrical components in computer chips together.  During the project period the PI and his coworkers and collaborators developed several new methods to achieve this goal of growing films in such nooks and crannies.   As part of our broader impacts, the PI has contributed directly to the education and training of B.S. and Ph.D. students, and the results of their research were disseminated to other scientists through presentations at international conferences and by publication in scientific journals. The work is also helping companies in the microelectronics sector to develop better methods to make computer chips in the future.
