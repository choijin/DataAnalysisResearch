<AbstractNarration>The research team has developed a distributed active microbial fuel cell (DA-MFC) that harvests energy from the marine environment. By utilizing natural microorganisms and organic compounds in sediments, the team's DA-MFC provides a long-lasting and renewable power supply. The DA-MFC uses a compact configuration with multi-pair electrodes and is integrated with power management systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A renewable power source that is able to be effective in deep waters would benefit ocean exploration and real-time monitoring, meteorological research, security units and oil and gas industries. There are innumerable subsea sensors supporting government and industry that rely on either solar cells or battery, neither of which are effective in deep water. The technology in the DA-MFC has the potential to be effective in deep-water environments due to its power supply technology.</AbstractNarration>
