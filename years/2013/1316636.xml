<AbstractNarration>This project is bringing together Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Computer Sciences, Engineering, Mathematics, Earth and Planetary Sciences, Physics and Astronomy education researchers from postsecondary institutions across New Mexico, with the goal of promoting cross-disciplinary research in the emerging fields of Discipline-Based Education Research (DBER).  The meeting will be in a workshop format and will be focused on current topics, emphasizing contextual and cultural considerations important to New Mexico.  New Mexico has a number of active grants to which DBER work can contribute significantly and these grants, in turn, will help to focus the research undertaken by DBER scholars in New Mexico.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Background/Need: The proposal was aimed at organizing and hosting a workshop  with the goal to promote cross-disciplinary research in the emerging field of discipline based education research (DBER) with a focus on context and relevant cultural considerations in NM. Educators in New Mexico are facing special challenges: The student population in this majority-minority state is comprised of 46% Hispanic, 10% Native American, and 40% Non-Hispanic White students. Significant portions of our students are from educationally disadvantaged groups, with many of them first generation college students. Students tend to have a long commute, need to work close-to-full time, or have family obligations (single parent families are not uncommon.) All these factors compete with class attendance and study time. While these factors present a challenge to our NM STEM students, they also offer a great opportunity to allow investigation of DBER questions that address these very challenges.  A recent report by the National Academy of Sciences recommends "research that explores similarities and differences among different student populations". New Mexico has the perfect student demographics to allow for such research. However, NM DBERs are isolated geographically and by nature of their different institutional types, and even by departmental differences at the same institution. Faculty economic and time pressures, which mirror those of our students, make participation by NM DBERs at larger national meetings difficult.    Major Activities:  The meeting served as starting point for long-term collaborative efforts to inform and improve research questions and scientific teaching strategies at the participantsÆ home institutions Specific Objectives:   This Workshop was designed so that participants did    a.     have an opportunity to connect to other local undergraduate faculty and students with interests in research on education practices and hypothesis driven education research  b.     establish local mentor relationships, making key people visible as resources for advice on specific methods or future proposals, c.     be supported to advance a broader and more inclusive New Mexico community of education researchers.         Outcomes   Many attendees identified themselves as beginning DBERs (43%). During the event CVs were exchanged and mutual interests discussed. Many are involved in faculty educational development, but only about 10% stated that this is where they are spending the majority of their effort.  Since the  meeting  84% of participants made contact with other undergraduate faculty and/or graduate students with interests in research on education practices and hypothesis-driven education research 83% had discussed ideas that came up during the meeting with colleagues or other participants multiple times  81% strongly agreed that they are interested in pursuing discipline-based education research. Thus, this event may contribute to instructional change at several institutions in New Mexico. 41% had made some changes in their teaching based on evidence from DBER literature or discussions. The impact may be higher given that a good third of the responders reported that were not teaching at the time.    Furthermore responders stated that TAs and undergrads were instructed on teaching and learning, leadership meetings in DBER were attended, workshops given or attended, proposals discussed and /or written.     Building a local scientific DBER community addresses the need to encourage inclusion and recruitment of early-career DBER participants, who may not feel ready for the national stage. It also make it explicit that DBER is an approachable scholarly activity for small, teaching-intensive schools that are not well endowed.  Active participation of instructors to generate evidence that improves learning outcomes will motivate  a local DBER community longterm for the benefit of students in the state.
