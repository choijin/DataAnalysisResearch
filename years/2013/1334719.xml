<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to support an experimental and computational study of the phenomenon of ?flow-induced polymer crystallization?, referring to the profound impact of processing flows on the rate of solidification. The experimental portion of this work utilizes new capabilities for x-ray scattering studies of polymer structure in well-defined uniaxial extensional flows which involve pure stretching deformations with no superimposed shear.  X-ray scattering experiments will be performed at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory, taking advantage of high brilliance radiation and fast detectors to monitor development of crystallinity and the degree of crystallite orientation as a function of temperature and flow conditions (deformation rate and total applied strain) in several semi-crystalline polyolefins, such as polyethylene, polypropylene and poly(1-butene). The experimental program will also include exploratory studies of polymer crystallization during injection molding. In the computational portion of the work, these data will be used to test and guide refinements of existing models of flow-enhanced nucleation and crystallization.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will lead to improved ability to rationally predict the processing of semi-crystalline polymers in flows where extensional (stretching) deformations play an important role.  These include high volume processes such as fiber spinning, film blowing and blow molding.  By comparing the nature of flow-induced crystallization in both extensional and shearing flows, this work will also provide insights into the fundamental molecular processes that underlie accelerated polymer crystallization during flow.  For instance, one class of models is built upon the assumption that flow-induced chain stretch, predicted by molecular rheological models, is the crucial variable governing accelerated nucleation.  This hypothesis will be tested directly by designing shear and extensional flow protocols to produce similar molecular stretch using very dissimilar flow types.  Finally, this work serves as a prototype for how powerful in situ experimental studies of materials processing may be closely coordinated with process modeling.</AbstractNarration>

In this project we have leveraged unique capabilities in our lab for in situ synchrotron x-ray scattering during polymer flow (Fig. 1) to study the flow-induced crystallization of polymer melts in shear and extensional flows, and to use experimental data to test of available models and modeling concepts of this phenomenon.  Over the course of the project, new capabilities were added to this instrument to enable direct measurement of the mechanical response (characterized by an 'extensional viscosity') while x-ray images are being collected.  This has enabled direct connections to be made between the development of crystallinity during flow and the corresponding mechanical properties (Fig. 2).  In this work we have sought to explore the ability of existing models of flow-induced polymer crystallization to predict the rate of crystallization.  Based on the known properties of a sample polymer melt, the theory was used to predict conditions (combinations of stretching rate and final degree of stretch) that should promote similar enhancement in crystallization kinetics.  Experiments conducted to test these predictions revealed that current theories fail this test (Fig. 3).  Over the course of the project, experiments were performed on three different commercially-relevant polymers.  Studies on poly(1-butene) included comparisons between accelerated flow-induced crystallization phenomena following both shearing and extensional flows, known as 'short-term flow' experiments. These experiments were the focus of attempts to test experimental models.  High density polyethyelene (HDPE) was used in so-called 'continuous flow' experiments in which crystallization occurred during the flow field, which led to characteristic crystal structures known as 'shish-kebobs'.  Finally, experiments were performed on low-density polyethylene (LDPE), where it was possible to collect data using both short-term and continuous flow protocols.  Studying an array of different polymers provides opportunities to investigate which phenomena are universal, and which may be more system-specific.  Interestingly, we have only found highly oriented 'shish-kebob' structures during continuous shearing protocols, indicating that such structures may not be a general phenomenon in flow-induced crystallization, but rather only occur under particular circumstances.  Over the course of the project, we have also collaborated with other researchers who sought to take advantage of the unique capabilities of the instrumentation described here to study the structure of other polymer materials during stretching deformations, indicating the impact of this project on experimental infrastructure that will continue to be of value to the US research community in subsequent years.
