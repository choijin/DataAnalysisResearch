<AbstractNarration>This RAPID supports the aircraft service component of the funded EAGER project of the same name (J. Welker, lead PI, ARC-1332274). The main objective of the EAGER project is to characterize the hydrologic cycle over various landscape types by collecting water vapor isotopes from tower measurements as well as an aircraft. A fixed-wing aircraft has been modified to support the sensors necessary for the project. Contracting was expected to take place through NSF's arctic research support and logistics contractor but will instead be done by the awardee for approximately the same cost and with increased involvement of the PI.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This 'Aircraft Component' RAPID logistics grant was associated with a EAGER Collaborative Research proposal that focused on the measurement of atmospheric water vapor isotopes from an aircraft. The science component was completed successfully and reported on under the EAGER grant. The logistics component was also completed successfully, collecting data to make possible the science component. Aircraft campaigns were performed on Alaska's North Slope near Toolik Field Station, and in Alaska's Interior, near Fairbanks.&nbsp; These were coordinated with ground-based and satellite-based observations to provide a multi-scalar measurement campaign. Results suggest that the portion of the hydrologic cycle that is modified by the ecohydrosphere is relatively small and near to the ground. Meteoric waters dominate, but can provide important information about open water conditions in the Arctic, prevailing winds, and cyclonic activity. These results were published in two manuscripts by the project team with first author post-doc, Eric Klein and another in preparation by Cherry et al.
