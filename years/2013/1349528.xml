<AbstractNarration>Society increasingly depends on numerical software, which uses finite precision arithmetic to approximate the reals and necessarily introduces approximation and error. Anti-lock breaks and medical devices such as haptic control systems for remote surgery are two such examples. Numerical errors in these systems can be disastrous.  Toyota suspects such errors contributed to its recent, costly unintended acceleration problem, and the Ariane 5 rocket exploded due to an overflow in its inertial reference system.  This project explores practical techniques to test and analyze numerical software, which will advance the state-of-the-art in engineering robust numerical software to help avoid costly, dangerous errors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the project focuses on the two most fundamental sources of numerical errors: uncaught exceptions and numerical stability and accuracy. The proposed core framework is centered around symbolic execution, and domain insights will be used to develop principles and heuristics to make it practical. This project will complete several preliminary research tasks to validate and demonstrate the promise of the proposed general approach. It will explore new problem modeling strategies for numerical accuracy and stability, examining realistic numerical constraints to build insights into constraint solving strategies and algorithms, and improving the promising Ariadne symbolic analysis infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

The conducted research and educational activities have advanced the state-of-the-art in improving the reliability of these important software systems, provided techniques and foundations for developing future technologies, and trained next generation researchers and engineers. More specifically,  - We have developed an effective search-based technique for isolating program inputs that lead to significant inaccuracies in numerical  implementations.  - We have developed the first technique to successfully automate the  computation of backward error, a fundamental and powerful concept for understanding numerical (in)stability.  - We have introduced a new general approach for solving floating-point  constraints that significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art  solutions, and extended our capability in analyzing and verifying numerically intensive software.  - We have disseminated our research results through publications in top outlets such as highly-competitive conferences and premium journals, tool distributions and research exchanges.  - We have successfully trained the next generation computer scientists through postdoctoral scholar and graduate student advising, and engineers through undergraduate and graduate level education.
