<AbstractNarration>The 9th International Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and Technologies&lt;br/&gt;(CoNEXT) will take place from December 9th to 12th in Santa Barbara, CA.  CoNEXT is a highly selective (&lt;20%), high-quality conference sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication (SIGCOMM).    The conference is a major forum for presentation and discussion of novel networking protocols and technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests funds to partially support the travel of 20 US-based graduate students.  The support amount will be $1,000 or the actual documented amount of expenses, whichever is less. Each student will need to cover expenses in excess of the fixed amount from other funds.  If students spend less than the $1,000 limit the surplus funds will be used to support students from under-represented institutions.  Preference in the award of the travel grants will be given to students who have their work accepted to the CoNEXT student workshop which will take place the first day of the conference. Other criteria will include evidence of a serious interest in networking, as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;This project integrates research and education of students through exposure to a premier technical meeting in computer networks and communications. Students will have the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the field both in the main conference and the associated workshops. The PI will especially encourage women and under-represented groups to participate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 9th International Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and Technologies (CoNEXT) took place from December 9 to December 12 2013 in Santa Barbara, California. This proposal requested funding to assist several US-based graduate students for attending this conference. Participation in conferences such as CoNEXT forms a central part of the graduate school experience as it provides students with an opportunity to interact with senior researchers from academia as well as industry and exposes them to leading-edge research in the field. ACM CoNEXT stands unique in its emphasis on interactions between networking researchers at an international level, and attending CoNEXT presents an excellent opportunity for US graduate students to connect with a thriving international research community. As in past years, CoNEXT 2013 included a special student workshop that will enable students to present and obtain feedback on their work in progress. The support requested in this proposal will enable students to attend the main conference and associated workshops at CoNEXT 2013. These students would otherwise be unable to attend the conference.  The bulk of the award was used to support US-based graduate students to attend the 9th annual CoNEXT conference with the award extended to fund an additional two US-based students to attend the 11th annual CoNEXT conference which was held in Heidleberg, Germany in December 2015. In 2013, 16 students were awarded the travel grant and an additional 10 were funded in 2015 (with two of these being funded by this grant).  Students were selected based on whether they had an accepted submission to the CoNEXT student workshop (as a smaller workshop it is sometimes harder for advisors to fund this sort of travel) their stage in their degree and relevance of their research to topics covered at CoNEXT. In 2015 we were able to fund all applications to the program as they were in scope and had potential to benefit from the workshop and conference. Of these 10 funded applicants, we funded two female participants and also funded students from 9 different states. Notably, this included states distributed around the country including the South (Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina), Mid-west (Ohio, Illinois), Mid-Atlantic (Pennsylvania), Northeast/New England (Massachusetts), Mountain (Utah), and Pacific coast (California).
