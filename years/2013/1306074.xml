<AbstractNarration>The Hope College Nuclear Group is studying neutron-rich unstable nuclei near the drip-line with the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) and Large area multi-Institutional Scintillation Array (LISA) at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) and is applying a variety of nuclear techniques (e.g. Particle Induced X-Ray Emission, Rutherford BackScattering, Nuclear Reaction Analysis, and Ion Beam Induced Luminescence) to a range of interdisciplinary questions with the Hope Ion Beam Analysis Laboratory (HIBAL).  In addition, work to harvest isotopes with medical and stewardship applications is moving from development to production. This award supports two faculty in both of these efforts, each of whom will include undergraduate researchers in all aspects of the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students and faculty are investigating unstable neutron-rich nuclei to refine the theoretical understanding of light, neutron-rich nuclei. The group is measuring the excited states of 9He and the ground state of 13Be with the MoNA/LISA/Sweeper system at the NSCL.  The interdisciplinary portion of the research involves developing techniques to harvest isotopes of strategic and medical interest at the NSCL and future Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) and examining, with HIBAL,  metalloprotein stoichiometry, forensic characterization of layered automotive paints, forensic comparison of auto glass fragments, and luminescence studies of feldspars and carbonates.  Collaborators include other Hope researchers (characterizing structured nanomaterials) and groups outside Hope College (metal contamination in sediment, river sediment origins, and flame retardants).  All of these initiatives are important for the specific science result they yield and for possible far-reaching impact on the analytical techniques used in many areas. The Hope College Nuclear Group has demonstrated its ability to carry out similar research for a number of years, and the new experiments are designed to match our interests and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, this project has a significant impact on a large number of undergraduate researchers.  Experience shows that undergraduate research enhances a student's education and better prepares the student for graduate work or for a wide variety of STEM careers in either industry or academia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ RUI: Cutting-Edge Nuclear Physics Research (Collaborative and Interdisciplinary) at Hope College  PHY-1306074  Paul A. DeYoung and Graham F. Peaslee  This grant had several goals: studies of neutron-rich unstable nuclei, the development of the ability to collaborate at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Lab on astrophysics measurements, and the development of techniques to detect a variety of harmful chemical in consumer products and environmental samples rapidly.  There was an additional focus on mentoring undergraduate students for careers in STEM fields.   The Intellectual Merit of the supported work included specific measurements of neutron-rich unstable nuclei to better understand the fundamental nuclear force, development of local ability to carry out and analyze astrophysics experiments, and development of  techniques, based on nuclear physics and the Hope particle accelerator, to rapidly detect dangerous chemical contaminants in a variety of samples.  Researchers from Hope participated in experiments and data analysis of nine different nuclei (10Li, 12,13,15Be, 19,21,22C, and 24,26O).  Understanding the energy levels and decay of these nuclei will refine current models of how the neutrons and protons in the nucleus bind together.  Our initial work on astrophysics measurements (properties of nuclei involved in the rapid neutron process forming heavy elements in the universe) was beneficial to Hope researchers and to researchers at the NSCL.  We are now in a postion to expand our efforts in this field and we were able to produce needed ancillary detectors for future measurements at the NSCL (plastic beta detectors and a large cosmic-ray veto detector).  Lastly, work based locally with the Hope particle accelerator was successful in developing a number of rapid tests for a variety of harmful chemicals (polyfluoroalkyl substances/PFAS and chlorinated and bromated fire retardants).  The tests cannot identify the specific molecule containing the F, Cl, or Br atom but because of the high correlation between the presence of these specific atoms and the presence of the harmful compounds, the developed tests provide a very efficient prescreening.  The Broader Impacts of the work fall into three categories.   There was a significant impact on undergraduate researchers at Hope College.  There were 19 students involved in this work.  Nine of these entered a STEM Ph.D. program.  One directly entered the workplace at a STEM company, two are still undergraduate students, four switched to non-STEM fields, two are in medicine, and one is not known.  The measurements of unstable nuclei were a collaborative effort involving 10 institutions.  Our participation included opportunities for students to be involved in large-scale research, provided support to others in the Modular Neutron Array (MONA) collaboration with technical aspects of data analysis, and facilitated smooth operation of the various experiments  because of our understanding of the sophisticated logic systems.  Lastly, in addition to a basic understanding of how to apply nuclear techniques to quantify polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and flame retardants (chlorinated and bromated compounds) in water and solids, our success in this area promises to greatly simplify testing of environmental and consumer samples which could have a large positive impact on the health of the general population.
