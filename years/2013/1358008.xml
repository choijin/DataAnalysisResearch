<AbstractNarration>Understanding how individuals or groups interact is at the core of virtually every economic and social problem.  A central difficulty in studying such interactions is the fact that, in practice, players face strategic uncertainty, that is, they (often) do not know what their opponents plan to play and how their opponents will react to choices they adopt.  For instance, a country may be uncertain about which tactics a terrorist organization is planning. And, likewise, the terrorist organization may be uncertain about what defense measures the country is adopting.  Of course, which defense measures the country adopts will be influenced by what tactics it thinks the terrorist organization is planning.  And, likewise, which tactics the terrorist organization adopts will depend on what defense measures it thinks the country has put in place.  As such, which defense measures the country adopts will be influenced by what it (the country) thinks the terrorist organization thinks about its own defense strategy.  And so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is aimed at bringing strategic uncertainty to bear on economic and social phenomena by using epistemic game theory to model it. There are two aspects of the project.  First, it develops a set of tools aimed at bringing strategic uncertainty to bear on economic problems.  Second, it uses these tools to show how, in important applications, strategic uncertainty can give way to novel behavioral predictions.  One natural application of strategic uncertainty is to bargaining problems: If negotiators face uncertainty about how others bargain, then there may be difficulties in reaching agreements.  The project identifies strategic uncertainty as a source of inefficiency in bargaining problems. It argues that these inefficiencies can arise, even if bargainers are strategically sophisticated (in the sense of engaging in forward induction reasoning) and even if strategic uncertainty only arises after surprise moves in the negotiation process.  It derives testable implications.  It goes on to address the extent to which efficiency can or cannot be improved, if the source of inefficiency is strategic uncertainty. This research can also have important implications for policy prescription, particularly in the area of mediated bargaining</AbstractNarration>

There were two central themes studied in the short (one year) duration of the grant: The effect of strategic uncertainty on (in)efficiency and understanding how players reason under strategic uncertainty. Below I report the main projects studied under the theme.  (Smaller projects are not reported here.)  1. Strategic Uncertainty and Inefficiency. A central project studied the effect of strategic uncertainty on negotiations. When negotiators face uncertainty about how others bargain, then there may be difficulties in reaching agreements.  The project identified a particular type of strategic uncertainty---second-order optimism---as a source of inefficiency in bargaining problems.

A central project that falls under this theme is ``How Many Levels Do Players Reason? Observational Challenges and Solutions'' (with Adam Brandenburger and Alex Danieli). The aim is to obtain a better understanding of how players actually reason in dynamic settings. It takes as given that the players' processes of reasoning are not observable.  Instead, the researcher observes only the behavior of the players or (weaker yet) the outcome of the game.  Can the researcher use this information to identify---or provide bounds on---levels of reasoning?  Similar questions have been addressed in the context of simultaneous move games.  The case of dynamic games is quite different. In dynamic games, reasoning about rationality involves (not only) reasoning at the begining of the game but also reasoning after learning information about the other players.  This leads to chal...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
