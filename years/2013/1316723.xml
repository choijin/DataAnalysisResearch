<AbstractNarration>This action funds Jeffrey McDaniel of University of California, Riverside to conduct a research project in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering area during the summer of 2013 at National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, Taiwan  The project title is "Design and Verification Tools for Chips to Automate Biological Experiments." The host scientist is Dr. Tsung-Yi Ho.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a top to bottom design automation tool chain for microfluidic bio-chips, which are able to automate biochemical experiments. The tool chain integrates components that have been developed independently at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) and National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan. The input to the system is a structured description of the experiment; the tool chain performs the necessary scheduling, placement and routing, and outputs a specification for a chip that can be fabricated using capillary electrophoresis subsystems, which have a broad range of applicability in biochemical assays by separation and detection of unique species. The scheduling of the chip involves binding specific operations to the individual component of the chip which will perform that operation. The components are then placed on the chip, and the channels between the components are routed. The chip is then verified by the tool chain to ensure correctness in accordance to the original experiment. The tool chain, increases the potential for commercial development of low-cost biochips which may supplement, or even replace, traditional benchtop chemistry equipment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the tool chain brings a standardized format to chip design and assay specification that does not currently exist, allowing for an easier collaboration with other universities. It will facilitate rapid dissemination of biochip designs between laboratories, which will enhance scientific reproducibility of experiments.  The Fellow plans to publicly release the tool chain to academia once it reaches a mature and stable state, allowing the wider research community to benefit from its development. UCR is a federally recognized minority serving institution. Under the guidance of the his Ph.D. supervisor, the Fellow he is collaborating with two female undergraduate research assistants and plans to continue mentoring them, along with underrepresented minority students, throughout his Ph.D. studies at UCR.</AbstractNarration>
