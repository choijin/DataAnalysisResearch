<AbstractNarration>A clear understanding of the neural mechanisms that govern how memory influences reproductive decisions will reveal much about the basic neurobiology that shapes decision-making. Mating and reproductive decisions are among the most important choices an individual will face. To this end, an individual must take stock of the current state of the social context in which it finds itself. This includes knowing with whom and where mating opportunities are to be found. Unfortunately, the influence of social and spatial memory on how individuals in a population tend to mate (e.g., with one or multiple partners, or a mating system) is often ignored. Moreover, we know virtually nothing about the ways the brain modulates these decisions or how memory and mate choice decisions are related. This project will use prairie voles to investigate how expression of two neuroendocrine systems known to be important in social / spatial memory and monogamous reproductive decision making, namely, oxytocin and vasopressin, modulate complex social behavior to shape reproductive choices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will study reproductive choices in the prairie vole, a species that can switch between monogamous and non-monogamous mating tactics, with the aims to determine (1) whether or not mating decisions in natural conditions and laboratory performance in memory tests relate to each other, and (2) how oxytocin or vasopressin in the hippocampus and the retrosplenial cortex, regions implicated in spatial and social cognition, shape these behaviors. The working hypothesis is that nonapeptide neuromodulation governs socio-spatial memory, which in turn, predisposes animals to succeed at either a monogamous or a non-monogamous mating tactic. This hypothesis will be tested using a combination of natural living conditions, behavioral assays to assess social and spatial cognition, radio-tracking to monitor extent of home range and social interactions, DNA sampling to assess mating tactic, radiography to measure oxytocin and vasopressin 1A receptor density, and intra-hippocampal or -retrosplenial delivery of slow-release receptor antisense oligonucleotides to knock down oxytocin and vasopressin 1A receptors in these brain structures.  In the process of completing this project, students at all levels will be trained with a broad range of skills that will prepare them to begin competitive careers in biomedical research, medicine, or higher education and academics. The PI will also continue his strong record of promoting research experiences and professional development in students from underrepresented groups. It is essential to understand the influences on behavior under simulated and natural contexts if we are to know how complex behaviors are produced.</AbstractNarration>
