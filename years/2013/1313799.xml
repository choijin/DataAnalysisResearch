<AbstractNarration>Mountain basins and the headwaters of river basins along the foothills of major mountain ranges are undergoing rapid environmental change due to urban development, land acquisition by private and public investors, population increases, and climate change. Besides increased water supply demand, other impacts of anthropogenic land-use change are the shrinking of groundwater recharge areas, removal of vegetation, and the alteration of links between the landscape and the natural drainage system. The challenge is to develop sustainable and reliable water allocation policies that best support a well-functioning landscape while meeting the basic water demands of natural and human systems and the associated infrastructure.  This project will factor the opportunity costs of environmental constraints and the economic value of conservation strategies into hydro-economic assessments of water allocation policy at the basin level. To accomplish this goal, an eco-hydrological model with coupled surface-groundwater and vegetation dynamics will be integrated with a water allocation model and operated within a probabilistic hydro-economic framework to support decision-making.  The model will be used to investigate water system sensitivity to: a) land-use modification and land-conversion in rapidly urbanizing landscapes; b) eco-hydrological sustainability defined in terms of hydrological and ecological flows; and c) net present value for baseline conditions (current climate, status-quo policy) and for alternative future adaptation pathways under possible climate change scenarios. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An innovative framework that brings together scientific and socio-economic principles to evaluate quantitatively and systematically urbanization impacts and adaptation strategies toward improving water resiliency of coupled human-natural systems will be developed.  The modeling framework will be tested and evaluated for the French Broad River in the Southern Appalachians, one of the fastest growing rural regions in the nation.  The project will be conducted in close collaboration with the Land-of-Sky Regional Council, the lead local government planning agency in western North Carolina.  The research addresses national climate adaptation priorities to enable resilient communities, and is readily transferable to regions elsewhere undergoing large environmental change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The major outcomes of the project relate to the characterization of the relationship between water use and water availability in coupled natural-human systems with a focus on hydrological drought in the SE US.  Water use by nature was quantified in terms of : (1) the minimum hydro-ecological flow requirements, also referred to as instream flow requirements, to meet the needs of regionally endangered aquatic species which along with public water supply (anthropogenic water use) are the dominant constraints on water resources management during severe hydrologic drought, and (2) water use by vegetation ecosystems.   First, a comprehensive analysis of groundwater contributions to streamflow (i.e. baseflow) at multidecadal scales was conducted for the Mills River Basin in Western North Carolina and extended to the regional scale.  Barros et al. (2017) were able to identify for the first time spatial modes of climate versus landscape controls of baseflow that should be instrumental in guiding future regional scale characterization of extreme hydrologic drought.  Further, they linked multidecadal variability in regional hydrological drought to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).  Figure 1 shows how extraction of streamflow for public water supply in the Mills River results in severe intensification of hydrologic drought compared to unaltered streamflow conditions especially during the warm phase of the AMO (1990-200's).  Second, Lowman and Barros (2016) focused on the role of Tropical Cyclones (TCs), specifically land-fallen hurricanes, to redress drought in the SE US and their impact on Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), which is carbon uptake by vegetation via photosynthesis.  They showed that TCs can impact plant activity in 40-50% of the SE US  increasing GPP by 3-5 Mg C/M2/yr. corresponding to 9% of the total carbon assimilated in the SE US.   Using a phenology predictivie model developed in this project, Lowman and Barros (2018) quantified the climate sensitivity of carbon uptake by SE ecosystems with regard to water use by plants obtaining GPP/ET = 2gC:1mm per unit area at annual time-scales (see Figure 2).
