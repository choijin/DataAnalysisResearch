<AbstractNarration>This RAPID proposal seeks funding to produce a next-generation integrated deep-sea in situ geochemical sensing package, with leveraged support from Marine Science and Technology Foundation (MSTF) contributing to sensor development, an improved sensor wand micromanipulator, and overall instrumentation integration with smaller ROVs, and with NSF support contributing to purchasing upgraded ISEA electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integration of this specific NSF-supported instrumentation upgrade with Glazer?s project with the Marine Science &amp; Technology Foundation provide for a synergistic, highly leveraged partnership between academic (UH), federal (NSF), private foundation (MSTF), and small business (AIS, Inc.) entities for addressing complex biogeochemical processes occurring in the deep-sea. The project is expected to result in a series of publications and presentations to be disseminated in appropriate peer-reviewed scientific journals and international meetings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Advances in instrumentation that can provide the capability for making more frequent measurements of important chemical parameters in the environment (like oxygen, iron, sulfide, pH), as opposed to only making laboratory measurements upon samples collected in the field and returned to a lab provides researchers with indispensible information about actual processes occurring in the environment.     Through this NSF award, we have worked with industry partner, Analytical Instrument Systems, Inc., to customize electronics, upgrade capabilities, and field-test the next-generation in situ electrochemical analyzer (ISEA).  The new instrument is capable of making autonomous deployments, running preprogrammed scripts to collect time-series datasets from multiple sensors, or can be configured to run under real-time control over serial or Ethernet communication. Our lab and field testing deployments have demonstrated the new instrumentÃ†s performance and reliability as part of a cabled nearshore seafloor observatory, as a component of seafloor autonomous sampling landers, and on Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs).     The new ISEA runs not only in situ voltammetry, a specialized type of electrochemistry that utilizes custom solid-state sensors to measure dissolved redox chemistry in fluids, but also interfaces with commercially-available sensors to measure oxidation-reduction potential, pH, and dissolved oxygen via a robust optical optode. The ISEA can also control stepper motors or other triggers, which we have used to perform in situ, high-vertical-resolution electrochemical profiling across the sediment-water interface.
