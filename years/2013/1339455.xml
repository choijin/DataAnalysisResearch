<AbstractNarration>This is a request to support the participation of seven US scientists to attend a meeting to be convened and supported by the European Commission, Joint Research Center; Ispra, Italy, in March, 2013. The workshop title is: "SCOPE Rapid Assessment Project on Benefits of Soil Carbon".  This workshop will provide an important venue for US scientists studying the Critical Zone to actively engage with the international community in developing science-based solutions to an important issue with global importance. The outcome of the workshop is a monograph of the same title.</AbstractNarration>
