<AbstractNarration>The Tennessee State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (TLSAMP) project is comprised of 10 Institutions enrolling 3800 URM students. This is a Phase III LSAMP Alliance Proposal. The goal of TLSAMP is to significantly increase the quality and quantity of baccalaureate degrees awarded to underrepresented science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students who continue to graduate programs over the next five-year period. Sharing a long-term commitment to work together, TLSAMP will play a substantial role in increasing the production of underrepresented STEM professionals to meet the needs of government, industry, and academia. The partners share a strong commitment to increasing access and opportunities for underrepresented minority students through the following objectives: (1)Improve the recruitment of underrepresented students into STEM majors at TLSAMP universities, especially those students transferring from community colleges (2)Improve the retention and persistence of underrepresented STEM majors across the Alliance (3)Increase the number of underrepresented undergraduate STEM majors who enter graduate programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  The specific goal of the Tennessee Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (TLSAMP) program is to significantly increase the quality and quantity of baccalaureate degrees awarded to underrepresented STEM students who continue to graduate programs over a five-year period.   The objectives to achieve the Alliance?s goal are to:  Improve the      recruitment of underrepresented students into STEM majors at TLSAMP      universities, especially those students transferring from community      colleges Improve the      retention and persistence of underrepresented STEM majors across the      Alliance Increase the      number of underrepresented undergraduate STEM majors who enter graduate      programs.    OUTCOMES          I.            Objective - Recruitment  In the Fall of 2012, TLSAMP institutions enrolled 4,590 undergraduate minority STEM students.  By the Fall of 2017, minority student enrollment in STEM disciplines at partner institutions had increased to 5,265 students, representing a 15% increase.  However, when compared to the 2,955 minority STEM students enrolled at the start of TLSAMP in the Fall of 2002, TLSAMP overall enrollment has increased by 78%.  TLSAMP added two community colleges to the Alliance in Phase III with the intent to transition more of these students into the four year institutions.  TLSAMP actually increased the number of minority STEM students from community colleges into the four year institutions by 42% from 2012 to 2017.       II.            Objective - Retention  TLSAMP tracks the retention of freshman students who began in the fall of one academic year and returned the fall of the next academic year with the same STEM major.  The freshmen minority retention rate for students who enrolled as a STEM major in Fall 2016 and returned in the Fall 2017 in the same major averaged 69.2% for the Alliance institutions. This compares with 61.0% for the Fall 2011 (baseline year).  Therefore, the TLSAMP freshman retention rate increased by 13%.   TLSAMP also tracks the persistence of Level I students across the Alliance.  Over the last five years this persistence rate averages about 92%.  Other strategies also show dramatic improvement for retention efforts.  Additionally, degree productivity for Alliance institutions for minority students went from 422 degrees in 2013 (baseline) to 634 in 2018, an increase of 50.2%.  Since our enrollment increased by 15% while our degree productivity increased by 50%, this difference reflects an increase in overall retention.    III.            Objective - Graduate School Preparation  The Alliance partners prepare students for graduate school by hosting GRE preparation workshops and engaging students in professional development seminars that aim to pique interest in exploration of graduate studies.  Based on senior surveys, about 10% of undergraduate minority students have applied and been admitted to a graduate program by commencement.  The Level I students are tracked over a longer time period and the graduate school attendance rate for those students is about 40%.  In 2013, 41% of the Level I cohort group enrolled in graduate studies, while 42%, 35%, 37%, and 40% enrolled in graduate school in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.  We feel confident that even more Phase III Level I students will pursue graduate studies.   In keeping in context with promoting and fostering students to continue their education beyond the undergraduate degree, the TLSAMP Alliance held the 15th Annual Research Conference, hosted by Tennessee Technological University (TTU), February 22-23, 2017 in Chattanooga, Tennessee.  The research conference prepares TLSAMP participants to engage in a technical environment that encourage professional development. The conference welcomed 158 undergraduate students, the majority of whom are African American, in attendance.     During Phase III, the TLSAMP program also supported three international summer research experiences that provided opportunities for 10 undergraduate STEM students from five Alliance partner universities (Fisk University, Middle Tennessee State University, Tennessee State University, University of Memphis, and Vanderbilt University) to participate in a global research experience as given below.  Tennessee State University facilitated an experience with Sichuan University in Chendu, China.  The research topic was Investigation of a Gene, FDNC5, to Determine the Structure, Distribution and Function using Cutting-Edge Research Techniques.  Middle Tennessee State University facilitated an experience with Zamarano University in La Paz, Honduras.  The research topic was Understanding the Differences Between Organic and Biodynamic Production Techniques in Tropical Agriculture. The University of Memphis facilitated an experience with Donghua University in Shanghai, China.  The research topic was Development of Next Generation Biomaterials for Dental Bone Reconstruction/Regeneration.    SUSTAINIBILITY  All institutions in the Alliance uphold the mission of TLSAMP by institutionalizing pre-college summer bridge programs for recruitment and success of STEM students, continuing to foster tutorial and mentoring programs for STEM students, and participating in an Alliance-wide undergraduate research conference to support graduate school preparation.  While TLSAMP has clearly built up the capacity to positively influence the learning environment, maintaining the momentum and appropriate levels of resources for ongoing processes, practices and outcomes for underrepresented minorities and underrepresented groups (URM/URG) in STEM at the Alliance and institutional levels, is essential.
