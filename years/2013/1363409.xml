<AbstractNarration>In 2011, the nation experienced a record fourteen, billion-dollar weather-related disasters.  The next year, Superstorm Sandy, the focus of this study, caused an estimated $68 billion in losses, making it the second-costliest storm in our history.  These losses show why it is critical to understand how the nation can become more resilient in the face of disasters.  Dynamic resilience, defined in this project as the ability to "bounce back" after experiencing a disaster, is widely seen as a way of reducing the disruption disasters cause and of containing costs, including those borne by individual property owners, the U. S. Treasury in the form of disaster aid, and the insurance/reinsurance sector.   The financial losses that result from disasters and post-disaster recovery assistance reduce the supply of resources available for other productive investment.  This project is thus consistent with the mission of NSF, particularly aspects of that focus on understanding how to "advance national health, prosperity, and welfare."&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;In this study, we will explore one dimension of resilience - dynamic economic resilience - by developing a better understanding of how affected businesses in the New York City area coped following Sandy and the extent to which they were able to recover.  We seek to understand in an integrated way how both business owners' decisions and broader economic conditions contribute to resilience. We will model post-disaster recovery  investment decisions; conduct a survey with a representative sample of businesses to learn more about their recovery decision making; and examine the effects of community-level conditions such as employment rates, labor force characteristics, and community economic diversity on dimensions of economic resilience and recovery. The project will employ several analytic strategies to provide a holistic and integrated model that incorporates micro-, miso-, and macro-level factors affecting economic resilience following disasters. A microeconomic investment framework will be developed to take into account business owners' decisions to invest in post-disaster recovery.  A database will be developed consisting of community-level factors important for regional economic recovery.  We will also develop a dynamic computable general disequilibrium model to analyze resilience at the macroeconomic level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We conducted integrated conceptual and empirical research on dynamic economic resilience to disasters, which is the ability of businesses to recover quickly and effectively from a disaster. The study developed a comprehensive  framework for analyzing various aspects of dynamic economic resilience following disasters&mdash;that is, investment in repair and reconstruction of damaged assets&mdash;to determine the ability of businesses to survive and their  willingness to remain in their communities and to reduce their vulnerability to the next disaster.  The study focused on a case study of the damage and disruption in New York and New Jersey as a consequence of SuperStorm Sandy in 2012. A case study of dynamic resilience in the recovery from  the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China was also completed.  The research questions that guided this project were:  1) What constitutes dynamic economic resilience? 2) What causal and background conditions are associated with dynamic economic resilience at micro (business), meso (sector), and macro (regional/economy-wide) levels? 3) What key business investment considerations are associated with achieving dynamic economic resilience? 4) What factors influence investment decisions that reduce vulnerability to future disasters? and 5) What is the dynamic resilience of individual businesses and the economy as whole in New York and New Jersey in the aftermath of SuperStorm Sandy?  Regarding the  intellectual merit of the project, the study team made major progress in understanding how businesses recover from disasters--a topic that is relevant for academic disciplines such as economics, sociology, and organizational science.  Regarding the broader impacts of the project, approaches and insights from this project have been shared with the research and practitioner communities through professional presentations and publications as well as advice provided to agencies and organizations that are working on the topic of community resilience to disasters.  Tierney and Rose advise the Resilient Economic Infrastructure Consortium, based at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, NZ.  Rose has been asked to advise the economics team of the recently established NIST Research Center on Infrastructure Resilience, based at Colorado State University.  Rose has been asked to advise The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power on its mitigation and resilience activities.  Rose has also been asked to take the lead on a new US Coast Guard initiative on resilience in relation to Maritime Cyber Security. Dormady presented the ongoing research on this project to policymakers at the Department of Homeland Security at a DHS kickoff event, including members of first-responder agencies such as state national guards.  Ritchie has been serving as a resilience fellow with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a federal agency; her work has involved collaborating on the development of the NIST Community Resilience Program and participating in resilience workshops held at different U. S. locations. The project has been the subject of a panel session at the Natural Hazards Workshop, which is attended by disaster risk reduction researchers and practitioners.  The concepts of economic resilience, and disaster resilience more generally, receive significant emphasis in a forthcoming book by Tierney, which is expected to be published in 2018 by Polity Press.
