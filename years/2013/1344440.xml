<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation manages the U.S. Antarctic Program, which coordinates all U.S. research on the southernmost continent and in the Southern Ocean. This project has the potential to create an appreciation in a wide audience about the national importance of the research program supported by NSF in the Antarctic and the ways in which modern science has advanced over its antecedents in the "Heroic Era" of scientific exploration a century ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the Antarctic Artists &amp; Writers program is allow a very small number of professional artists across a variety of disciplines to experience that research first-hand in order to use non-technical media interpret the science in  that are accessible to a broad swath of the general public, with the goal of increasing visibility and appreciation for the science NSF supports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to create installations in the United States science museums that creatively stage ?virtual encounters? between scientific explorers of the Heroic Age of exploration at the turn of the 20th century and contemporary scientists, allowing participants to compare and to contrast the two eras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This medium will allow prospective participants to explore this material in a new, distinct, fresh and engaging way that immerses them in the experience and that draws parallels and distinctions between science, as it was conducted a century ago and how it is carried out today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Science Foundation provides access to US Antarctic Program activities in Antarctica but does not provide funding for this work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In residence at McMurdo Station Antarctica, the co-PI's were able to obtain nearly 60 video and audio profiles of scientists and support staff as part of the NSF Artists and Writers project "Antarctica: Persistence of Vision".   As described in the original proposal, the video portraits are designed to show connections between ongoing work in Antarctica today and activities documented by photographers on the Scott and Shackleton expeditions during the Heroic Age of Exploration.  Each video/audio portrait restages an iconic photograph from the Heroic Age using high-definition video and parallel modern equivalent environments and activities.  Video portraits collected ranged significantly in style (from slow motion to time lapse) and content, including: scientists in the field (penguin researchers, Dry Valley LTER researchers), scientists in the lab (Weddell seal researchers, geologists), support staff at work (supply logistics, food and waste management) , facility engineering (waste water treatment facility, power plant), and social environment of McMurdo (sports, music).  In each case audio profiles of the subjects were also collected as they talked about their research and/or support role.  The intellectual merits of the work center on making the connections between past and present activity in Antarctica as well as on the modification of the video/audio portraiture methodology in ways to bring out both the aesthetics and the science of ongoing activities in Antarctica.  Post-production processing, design and implementation of the initial exhibition of the project are underway, with a premiere target date of February 2017, followed by touring dates at several other universities.
