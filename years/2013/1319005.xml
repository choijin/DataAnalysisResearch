<AbstractNarration>The Keys Marine Laboratory (http://keysmarinelab.org) is awarded a grant to upgrade and expand its existing seawater system to provide a state of the art research capability on-site. The Keys Marine Laboratory (KML), in the Florida Keys, is an educational and research laboratory serving researchers, faculty and students from around the world. This enhanced seawater system will provide KML users with year-round high quality, on-demand seawater to conduct laboratory experiments and hence allow on-site research not previously possible. The upgraded system provides the ability to recirculate and manipulate water quality, temperature, and pH into a variety of tanks, allowing for recirculation and effluent treatment, including filtration and UV sterilization. The proposal leverages prior improvements supported by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC). Water from the treatment facility (built with FWC funds), will flow into a series of head tanks where temperature and pH adjustments take place. A set of heaters and chillers provide temperature control and similarly, injected carbon dioxide regulates pH to desired levels. The head tanks then deliver water, via pumps, to the experimental tanks. The experimental tank setup will allow for experiments requiring replicate ability at varying volumes and a variety of temperature and pH combinations. Larger tanks will be equipped with the capacity for water recirculation. Recirculation allows for further control and manipulation of water, increased filtration, and provides a safeguard against upstream failures or contaminations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new seawater system will provide a basis for research on tropical and sub-tropical ecosystems, including living marine resources, with global implications.  In particular the ability to manipulate water quality to represent past, present, and future conditions will provide an improved scientific understanding and anticipation of the range of impacts to systems and living marine resources. In this way, forecasts can provide best case and worst case scenarios in addition to intermediate scenarios, which will guide resource management actions.  For example, research on coral under future climate scenarios will provide new insights into coral productivity and vulnerability.  It is estimated that coral reefs support a $4.4 billion industry in South Florida alone by providing a habitat for fishery resources for recreational and commercial fishing and through recreational snorkeling and diving activities. As such, they are not only of scientific curiosity, but are also of economic importance and a means of educational outreach to a broader audience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A state of the art well based sea water system was completed at the Keys Marine Laboratory (KML), which is midway in the Florida Keys. This system allows for manipulations of water quality and in particular, simulating thermal and pH changes, as projected to occur in tropical and sub-tropical systems while simulating present and past conditions. Sea water is pumped via the well into a 15 ft. tall tower which eliminates hydrogen sulfide and other organic materials that lower pH and oxygenates the water.  Secondary water treatment includes the ability to manipulate temperature through the use of heat pumps and chillers and pH via CO2 injection.  Water can be distributed from four 1700 gallon tanks to any combination of 24 experimental tanks in any combination of pH, temperature and salinity. Experimental tanks range from 40 gallons to 750 gallons and different water quality conditions can be established and maintained in any combination of tanks at any given time or period of time. The 1700 gallon tanks are continuously monitored for salinity, pH, conductivity, ORP, temperature and dissolved oxygen and the data is logged via a commercially available software program called Aqua Manager. In addition to logging the water quality data, Aqua Manager controls the injection of carbon dioxide to manipulate pH at desired levels. The system is fully automated and can be controlled remotely using an application downloadable on a smart phone, tablet, laptop or desktop computer. The system is maintained and managed by an on site KML science staff member with two scientists as backup.   In this way, there is 24/7 coverage for the system which can be corrected or attended to at any time to insure experimental integrity.  The new system provides a basis for research on tropical and sub-tropical species and systems with results that can be compared with research conducted elsewhere.  Effluent is sterilized via UV before being discharged back into the ocean.  The intellectual merit of the system is the result of the interplay between the ability to conduct field work and laboratory experiments on site at KML rather than transport specimens back to the home laboratory placing the specimens at risk of loss.  Because of the inclusion of large volume tanks, ecosystem research can be conducted with side by side mesocosm experiments at the same time. The design guarantees that research can be conducted applying the best practices and protocols providing publishable results that can be compared to similar research completed elsewhere.  Research results can be used to inform management decisions and provide guidance in developing new management strategies for living marine resources and systems.  Research results can inform and educate the public regarding impacts of water quality, for example, resulting from climate change and how these changes can impact their quality of life.
