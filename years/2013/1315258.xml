<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a compact, energy-efficient 1U server cooling solution that uses rotating heat sinks, or kinetic heat sinks (KHSs), to provide localized processor cooling while also generating the airflow required to cool peripheral server components. The cooling technology would eliminate all 40 mm case fans currently used in 1U servers and replace the high-impedance processor heat sinks with flow-generating KHSs. The proposed KHS solution has the following advantages over existing technologies: (1) lower flow impedance, since each KHS generates pressure instead of flow impedance; (2) lower power consumption, due to the larger flow-generating blades of KHSs compared to those found in 40 mm axial case fans, combined with the lower server flow impedance; and (3) smaller footprint, since the air mover and heat sink are combined into a single component. Phase I studies will involve component- and server-level computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and experimental validation of both the current state-of-the-art cooling solution and the proposed KHS cooling solution. The goal is to demonstrate 50% reduction in footprint and power consumption compared to the state-of-the-art cooling solution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project stems from the rising power density and overall power consumption in data centers. With the explosive growth of the ?cloud? there has been exponential growth in data centers, whose electricity consumption is the fastest growing electricity-consuming sector in the U.S. The miniaturization of components has resulted in more heat being generated per unit volume, while smaller product form factors provide less space for coolers to dissipate that heat. Kinetic cooling is an early-stage technology that has the potential to significantly reduce cooling power requirements while using a smaller footprint. There are no commercial KHS cooling solutions in the market presently; consequently, the proposed KHS solution would be the first system designed and sold in this category. The initial target markets for the proposed server cooling system will be brand and whitebox server vendors and system integrators.  According to analyst reports, 7.6M server systems were brought online in 2010 and this figure is growing at a CAGR of 4.7%.  The total market opportunity is approximately $400-$500M with the potential for providing a return on investment under 30 months.</AbstractNarration>

With traditional fan-cooled heat sinks (FCHSs), the cooler size, thermal performance, and acoustics are tightly coupled, and it is practically impossible to improve one parameter without adversely affecting others. The proposed kinetic-cooling architecture can provide superior tradeoffs between these three critical performance variables by integrating the role of the heat sink and fan used in traditional air-based cooling solutions. In the proposed cooling architecture, a rotating heat-sink impeller is used to generate airflow while simultaneously transferring heat into the flowing air. The heat generated by a chip (or other electronic component(s) being cooled) is first spread across a baseplate spreader (metal, vapor chamber, etc.) and then transferred to the rotating heat-sink impeller across an air-gap region designed to have a low thermal resistance relative to the overall cooler resistance. By including the air mover in the heat-transfer process, the ratio of heat-transfer surface area to overall cooler volume can be increased as much as 2X compared to the traditional FCHSs, preserving thermal and acoustic performance at approximately half the overall cooler size.  The target application for the Phase I project was game console cooling, where there is a great market need for decreasing the size of the cooling solution without affecting thermal and acoustic performance.  The technical objectives for this Phase I project were to:  Reduce the thickness (and overall volume) of the cooling solution      in game console product by at least 40%; Preserve cooling performance when the size of the cooling solution      is reduced; Preserve audible noise levels when the size of the cooling      solution is reduced; Provide sufficient cooling airflow for peripheral components so      that no secondary fans are needed.   The benchmark cooling architecture used for this project was a commercial game console cooler.  CoolChip performed thermal, airflow, and acoustic analyses of the benchmark cooler to quantify its performance and ensure that the benchmark and CoolChip-proposed solutions were measured and tested with the same equipment and procedures. Similarly, CoolChip performed in-house computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the benchmark solution to ensure that the same models and assumptions were used for both the benchmark and the CoolChip-proposed cooling solution.  The CFD code was then used to design kinetic coolers having approximately the same footprint, heat-transfer surface area, and flow impedance as the benchmark cooler to obtain similar thermal and acoustic performance.  Kinetic cooler designs were experimentally tested to verify airflow and acoustic performance.  After several iterations, the outcome of this Phase I project was a cooling architecture design that:  Had 43% lower profile and 52% lower volume than the commercial cooler; Achieved the same thermal performance at the rated operating      point; Achieved the same acoustic performance at the rated operating      point; Provided sufficient airflow to cool peripheral components in the      box.   There are no commercial kinetic cooling solutions in the market presently. Consequently, the proposed kinetic cooling solution will be the first in its category. The initial target markets for the proposed kinetic cooling solutions include PC Gaming and Game Console applications. Initial focus on the gaming market will gain technical and market validation for the broader IT electronics cooling market.
