<AbstractNarration>This award will support student travel to the 2013 ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI '13), which is being held in Seattle, Washington.  PLDI is a top conference in the fields of programming languages and compilers.  The funds will help support U.S. students, focusing on Ph.D. students at an advanced stage in their program and students who would otherwise not be able to attend PLDI.  Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF.  Broader impacts include training the next generation of researchers in this important research area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ACM Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI) is the top technical forum for the presentation of new and exciting advances in programming languages and compiler research. The symposium covers a wide range of topics, including language design and novel programming models, static and dynamic analysis, domain-specific languages and tools, type systems and program logics, program transformation and optimization, checking or improving the security or correctness of programs, memory management, parallelism, debugging, program understanding, and program synthesis.  The funding received for this proposal has enabled broader student participation, especially by those that may not have adequate support at their educational institution. As we did in the past, we have supported  the participation of underrepresented minorities.  Since the conference was held in Seattle, and close to Portland and the Bay Area, with their abundance of software companies, the travel funding provided has helped strengthen the ties between the supported student attendees and researchers/practitioners working at these companies, which will have benefits in both research and education.  The 34th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI 2013) and co-located events were held in Seattle, WA, from June 16 to June 22, 2013. The main conference was held over three days, June 17 to June 19. Every day featured two parallel research papers sessions.  PLDI also included a Student Research Competition (SRC) and a Fun and Interesting Thoughts (FIT) session---''a venue for new, interesting, provocative, and/or inspiring ideas.'' June 16 was dedicated to tutorials. The Static Analysis Symposium (SAS) was held June 20--June 22, the ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management (ISMM 2013) was held on June 20, and several workshops were held June 19--June 22. The co-location and allowed participants to amortize their travel expenses across two conferences.  The lead organizers of PLDI'13 were Dr. Hans-J.

PLDI is one of the top conferences in programming languages and systems. The 2013 edition of PLDI received 267 submissions; 46 papers were accepted, yielding an acceptance rate of 17%.        The NSF provided $12,000 in travel support.  ACM, via SIGPLAN (Special Interest Group on Programming Languages) provided additional travel support.  NSF funds supported only US citizens and US permanent residents.  US citizens and US permanent residents.  The general strategy was to prioritize funding for women, underrepresented minorities, and student authors.   All in all  11 students (US citizens or permanent residents), out   of which 1 underrepresented minority (African-American), 1 undergraduate, and 2 mixed ethnicity,  were funded.
