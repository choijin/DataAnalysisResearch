<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 13-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum and the G8 countries Heads of Research Councils. The Belmont Forum is a high level group of the world's major and emerging funders of global environmental change research and international science councils.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. The G8 Heads of Research Councils developed a funding framework to support multilateral research projects that address global challenges in ways that are beyond the capacity of national or bilateral activities. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders.  This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working together in an inaugural call of the International Opportunities Fund, the Belmont Forum and G8HORCs have provided support for research projects that seek to deliver knowledge needed for action to mitigate and adapt to detrimental environmental change and extreme hazardous events that relate to either Freshwater Security or Coastal Vulnerability.  This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports research activities that will identify future drought adaptation options, with an emphasis on building resilience to water scarcity in drought prone social-ecological systems, using the arid Northwest region of Costa Rica as a case study. Resilience to drought requires development of coherent conceptual and scientific knowledge as well as an improved understanding of human and institutional responses to events and forecasts. The goal of this project is to contribute to the sustainable management of water resources for the benefit of both society as well as ecosystems. The project will do this by (1) characterizing current physical and social conditions; (2) modeling the impacts of changing climate and weather on resources, people and other drivers of change; and (3) developing new methods for and implementation of decision aids, including the development of practical new heuristics, communication, and outreach. These efforts will contribute important aspects of drought management and adaptation, with applications both to dry tropical environments and more broadly to drought sensitive coupled socio-ecological systems. The project will contribute toward an improved and integrated understanding of the monitoring and modeling of aquifers, agriculture, ecosystem services, climate scenarios, and weather forecasts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF project served as the US portion of a study sponsored by the Belmont Forum and the G8 Heads of Research Councils, under the Belmont Forum Freshwater security program. Other members of the team include the University of British Columbia (Canada), the Agricultural Research for Development Institute (France), and the Center for Tropical and Agricultural Research and Education (Costa Rica). Here we report on only the portions of this research conducted by Carnegie Mellon University and supported by this NSF grant.  The broad objective of this project was to develop new scientific methods that can support decisions that improve freshwater security. This requires new climate science as well as improved understanding of individual and organizational responses to uncertain information (for example, drought forecasts). Methods development and application were focused on decision support for managing freshwater resources in the Guanacaste region of northwestern Costa Rica. The study team worked closely with local community organizations in the region as well as the entities that manage water.   The Carnegie Mellon research effort focused on two major phases of the study, addressing:  a)  The climatology and statistical characteristics of annual and seasonal rainfall occurrence in the Guanacaste region, how these features might change under future climate, and the reliability of seasonal rainfall forecasts made using models fit to historical data for rainfall and El-Ni&ntilde;o occurrence in the region; and  b)  The knowledge, beliefs, and information needs of stakeholders who provide, manage and use water resources in Costa Rica, including two major surveys to determine how different groups use precipitation and hydrologic forecasts, and the key gaps in understanding that should be addressed in developing forecasts of greater use and value.  For the climate-rainfall studies a number of long-term climate models were evaluated to determine their ability to match current (observed) seasonal patterns of rainfall amount as well as year-to-year variations in rainfall.  The subset of these models that provided the best agreement with current observations was chosen to analyze model predictions for the time period 2074-2100. These models predict a general reduction in the average rainfall during both the early and late wet seasons, as well as an earlier onset of the mid-summer dry period.  These outcomes could have significant effects on water availability for many water users in the region (such as municipal supply, agriculture, hydropower, tourism, and ecosystem support), but these effects could be moderated by improved forecasts that allow better decisions on water use and conservation.  Statistical models for expected rainfall 3-6 months in the future, with the help of information on El- Ni&ntilde;o status, would be of great benefit in the development and use of rainfall forecasts that support better water conservation and security.  A method for achieving this has been developed by lead researchers Dr. AlMutairi, Dr. Grossmann and Dr. Small, and is undergoing further testing and review.  To improve our understanding of the knowledge, beliefs, and information needs of stakeholders who provide, manage and use water resources in Costa Rica, we conducted two major surveys to determine how these different groups perceive and use precipitation and hydrologic forecasts, These involved 40 one-on-one interviews among seven water-related groups in the region (subsequently analyzed and published in the 2016 paper in Earth Perspectives, "Stakeholder perceptions of water systems and hydro-climate information in Guanacaste, Costa Rica," by Babcock, Wong-Parodi, Small, and Grossmann.  This was followed by a second survey of 87 relevant stakeholders in Costa Rica to identify the prevalence of beliefs, as well as predictors of attitudes and decision making. Both surveys find a relatively high association between education level, the understanding of forecasts, trust in forecast use, and a subject?s current use of forecasts.  While these results are unsurprising, the way they play out among different stakeholders and organizations provides useful information for the design and targeting of information and programs for education and stakeholder participation in the region.    The results of this project have been disseminated and shared at a number of scientific meetings.  Furthermore, Dr. Babcock and Dr. Wong-Parodi will share a summary report with stakeholders who were interviewed and surveyed as well as other interested groups in Guanacaste, Costa Rica.
