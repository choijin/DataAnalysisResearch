<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to strengthen the fabrication capabilities at Wake Forest University (WFU) by acquisition of an electron-beam evaporation system. This instrument will be unique in northwest North Carolina, provide a comprehensive fabrication-characterization infrastructure, and allow investigators to improve the quality and expand the scope of their research and training endeavors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The system will enable researchers to grow single and multilayered non-magnetic, ferromagnetic and organic metals, (doped metal) oxides, nitrides and a wide range of semiconductors. It will advance several nanoscience, nanotechnology, biotechnology and energy programs with the potential to yield transformative applications in organic electronics and spintronics, solid oxide fuel cells, solid electrolytes for Li-ion batteries, high-performance scintillators for homeland security, photocatalytic membranes for water splitting and CO2 reduction, and the study of cell mechanics and protein mobility during neoplastic transformation. Crucial fabrication tasks to realize these advances are limited or impossible due to the current lack of infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The instrument will significantly enhance multidisciplinary cross-departmental research collaborations among groups from WFU, neighboring institutions and small companies. Over 50 students and postdoctoral fellows from WFU, Appalachian State University, Winston-Salem State University, and Forsyth Technical Community College will use this instrument for over 15 research projects. The system will support curricular improvement by allowing new experiments that will expand Physics and Chemistry syllabi. About 150 graduate and undergraduate students will receive formal training in the 7 courses and a summer workshop that will use the instrument.</AbstractNarration>
