<AbstractNarration>This project will further the development of a new computer code for cosmological N-body simulations.  Abacus implements a novel method for computing gravitational forces that is a hundred times faster and substantially more accurate than current methods.  It can be run on commodity graphics processing units and offers a vast improvement in price-performance.  Observational surveys of large scale structure rely on cosmological simulations to calibrate their statistical estimators and compute accurate error bars, making it essential to run large grids of highly accurate simulations in order to realize the potential of current and future cosmological surveys.  Abacus relies on a mathematical breakthrough that accomplishes a clean split between the near-field and far-field force on particles.  The present work will add essential support for individual particle time steps, on-the-fly group finding and merger tree building, and light-cone outputs.  The study will also extend Abacus to a parallel implementation, and allow release of a public version of the code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will use Abacus for a first suite of large simulations, whose resulting halo catalogs, merger trees, and light-cone outputs will be made public as a direct benefit to current and future survey projects.  Abacus is a game-changer, opening up the ability to do large simulations to many more astrophysicists at exactly the time that the need for large sets of large simulations will intensify.  The mathematical approach of Abacus opens up substantial new possibilities in the solution of elliptic equations, one of the most common computational tasks across a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines.  Along the way, the project will train a post-doctoral researcher and a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have developed Abacus, a new code for cosmological N-body simulations.  Abacus is extremely fast and accurate due to its novel method for solving the gravitational far-field.  Abacus runs on single workstations using commodity graphics processing units to speed the force calculation and arrays of hard disks and solid state disks to sharply decrease the memory requirements.  We have run simulations up to 130 billion particles on a 24-core workstation costing about $10K and recorded sustained speeds of 20 million particle updates per second.  We have used Abacus to produce a set of nearly 120 simulations covering 40 different cosmologies; these data and their halo catalogs will be released in the coming month.  Grids of high-accuracy simulations such as this one are important for the interpretation of observational surveys of cosmological large-scale structure.   We have already completed 4 different analyses using the Abacus simulations, with applications to forecasts of clustering of JWST-detected galaxies, measurements of higher-order clustering, and interpretation of small-scale weak lensing and galaxy clustering.  The very high precision of Abacus also allowed us to diagnose a common but little known problem that discrete N-body calculations do not reproduce linear perturbation theory on small scales; we offer a solution that partially mitigates this effect.
