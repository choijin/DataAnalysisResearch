<AbstractNarration>This project aims to develop an advanced modeling framework that integrates the physical, biogeochemical, and human components needed to simulate and select climate change adaptation strategies that will support a sustainable system. It merges a fine resolution hydrodynamic model with a broader-scale whole-ecosystem model that is capable of simulating socioeconomic interactions to characterize human-natural linkages in the system. The research specifically uses hypothetical alterations to the Chesapeake Bay designed to reduce storm surge  to examine the impacts on estuarine dynamics, fisheries production, and potential flooding risks, with emphasis on feedbacks to the human system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conceptual framework for the project is an examination of the physical, chemical, and biological consequences of an alteration of the estuarine system designed to reduce risks in the linked human system. The focus of the proposed work is simulation of the intervention?s impacts on fisheries production and potential flooding risks, both feedbacks to the human system. This work directly addresses the issue of risk mitigation through physical alterations of estuarine systems potentially confounding current efforts to sustain water quality and fisheries production. Informing the policy and management decisions will require this type of enhanced modeling tools and expanded understanding of system responses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together researchers with complementary strengths in the essential modeling efforts and the subsequent translation to policy guidance. The project will provide two senior graduate students training in interdisciplinary research on issues of sustainability, and it will provide course materials for other graduate students working in the Center for Coastal Resources Management at VIMS and the Coastal Policy Law Clinic at William &amp; Mary.  Because the project will be managed from the Center for Coastal Resources Management at VIMS, the products and insights developed will have a unique connection to the coastal management and policy communities in Chesapeake Bay. The results of this project will be incorporated into the formal guidance, the outreach education programs, and the online data provided to local and state government personnel by the Center, thus ensuring the direct translation of project products to management and policy. In addition, because these topics are currently of great interest to a wide variety of public and private entities, there are opportunities for outreach education sessions to increase the understanding of sustainability concepts, policy options, and management challenges across a wide spectrum of stakeholders including state legislators, NGO staffs, and private citizens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under NSF's Coastal SEES (Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability) program.</AbstractNarration>
