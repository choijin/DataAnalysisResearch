<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a novel radio-frequency (RF) sensing method to provide a real-time measurement of black carbon emissions.  The feasibility of this concept was demonstrated in Phase I, and engine emissions measurements are targeted in Phase II.  Accurate measurement and characterization of black carbon emissions are hampered by the lack of low-cost, portable measurement systems suitable for use in the field.  This information is critical to ensure regulatory compliance, and diagnose engine malfunctions leading to inefficient operation and high soot emissions.  Currently there exist two broad classes of instruments used for monitoring black carbon: (1) expensive laboratory instruments, and (2) low-cost, portable devices with limited utility.  This work will bridge this gap, by utilizing radio frequencies to provide a direct, real-time measurement of black carbon.  The research will investigate using inexpensive RF technologies, similar to those used in cellular phones, which are ideally-suited for use in a portable measurement system.  The Phase II work will build on the results of Phase I, specifically focusing on pushing the limits of this sensing method to increase low-level sensitivity, and increase functionality by identifying other particle constituents in the black carbon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will address a currently unmet market need for the development of a black carbon emissions measurement system, which will enable further black carbon emissions reduction and provide tangible benefits to human health and the environment.  Recent studies indicate a warming potential for black carbon 2,000 times greater than the equivalent amount of CO2, and have also linked the pollutant to a range of adverse health effects, including cancer.  Regulators and source operators alike require tools to monitor black carbon emissions, ensure in-use compliance, and improve engine efficiency.  Currently, few technologies can distinguish black carbon from other types of particulate matter.  Accurate measurement systems generally range in price from $15,000 to $70,000 or more, and   are ill-suited for portable use in the field.  Driven by strict emissions regulations, the market for particle and black carbon measurement systems is rapidly outpacing the markets for other types of emissions analyzers.  The proposed technology is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth, providing a robust, portable, and much lower-cost alternative to high-end instruments. This technology is not limited to black carbon emissions measurements, but a wide range of related applications including powder processing and nanofabrication.</AbstractNarration>
