<AbstractNarration>The Targeted Infusion Project will form a partnership between physics programs at South Carolina State University (SCSU) and Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College (OCtech) that will strengthen both programs and serve as a model of best practices for developing collaborations. This partnership will be accomplished through shared resources and a variety of activities that include curriculum revision, infusing cyberlearning into the coursework and faculty training in current pedagogical methods. Efforts include an improved approach to recruitment and retention that focuses on the first year, both for freshmen entering college and for transfer students transitioning from OCtech to SCSU. Partner institutions will use a variety of means to strengthen the academic and social support for majors such as bringing first year students in contact with seniors through hands-on research experiences. Activities and products include institutionalization of five new courses, such as the LabVIEW course at OCtech and the Research Methods class at SCSU; development of renewable energy lab exercises; and online modules created for the physics courses that will lead to the use of flip instruction at both institutions. Finally, the introduction of iLabs will enable the development of the first physics hybrid course, mixing lab exercises that are online with others that are taught face-to-face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The growing need for STEM graduates in this country is well documented as is the underrepresentation of minorities in STEM disciplines, particularly in the field of physics. This project will address these issues by strengthening the physics program at SCSU through a partnership with OCtech to improve recruitment and retention.  Lessons learned from the adoption of products, practices and techniques such as on-line tutorials, iLabs and Invention Instruction, will serve as a model for teaching physics at other HBCUs. Attainment of the project goal, to form a successful physics partnership between two institutions, will serve as a model of best practices for STEM collaborations at other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Targeted Infusion Project (TIP):  Piloting a Physics Partnership was a project that brought together the physics faculty, students and resources of a four-year HBCU and a nearby two-year, Predominately Black Institution (PBI). The project goal was to form a successful physics partnership between South Carolina State University (SCSU) and Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College (OCtech) that would strengthen both programs and serve as a model of best practices for developing STEM collaboration.  This was largely accomplished during the period of the project, 2013-2017 through shared resources and a variety of activities that included curriculum revision, infusing cyberlearning into the coursework and faculty training in current teaching methods.     Faculty exchanges between the two institutions enhanced the teaching of physics at both schools.  OCtech faculty trained SCSU faculty in hands-on, applied techniques in LabVIEW and alternative energy activities.  SCSU taught graduate-level physics-for-teachers to an OCtech instructor as well as team taught the physics courses at OCtech with the new instructor. That instructor has now taken over the teaching of physics at OCtech and has helped stabilize the annual offering of those courses that is needed to support a number of STEM programs at the school.     Curriculum products were revised or new ones developed under this project. OCtech now has a new set of 23 physics lab exercises developed under TIP where none were available previously.  At SCSU, 256 SCORM-compliant short videos lasting 2-5 minutes each were created to teach specific topics in physics and math.  These videos are now available online through YouTube for use not only by SCSU students, but those at other institutions.  These videos allow the students to prepare for lecture by viewing them before class, and to reinforce their understanding later, outside the classroom since they are available at any time for student review.     Both programs have adopted new textbooks and other teaching resources like online physics homework that not only are more effective than previously used materials, but save students a significant amount of money by being available at low or no cost while still being well established and recognized in the field. Laboratory and computer equipment purchased under this project have helped both schools modernize their laboratory and lecture courses.  For example, the web server acquired by the SCSU under TIP will serve the physics program long after the period of the original award.
