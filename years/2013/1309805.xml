<AbstractNarration>As climate change alters temperature and precipitation, the distributions of plant species are expected to shift.  However, the ability of plants to survive and grow in new areas will also depend upon how well they can resist the new sets of herbivores and pathogens they are likely to encounter.  To investigate this in the forests of Michigan, a large experiment is underway in which 8,000 seedlings of 10 species of trees have been planted at 5 sites at different latitudes within and beyond the current ranges of the species.  This project will enable researchers to identify the individual herbivores and pathogens that are attacking the trees at the different sites, and to tell which are responsible for the damage and disease observed.  Results will help assess whether biotic interactions will prevent forests in this region of the U.S. from surviving climate change through species migration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will train a Ph.D. student and an undergraduate student, and help continue educational outreach to 9th grade students.  Results will also help the U.S. to anticipate and mitigate the negative effects of climate change on its natural resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the most widely anticipated effects of climate change is a shift in where species occur (referred to as species distributions).  We expect species distributions to shift poleward because species are in areas that are associated with a particular set of temperatures and temperatures are generally rising.  The resulting range shifts of plants could have important consequences for forests, such as changes in forest composition.  This could in turn affect many of the ecosystem services that are provided by these forests, including timber, recreation, tourism, and carbon sequestration.  ItÆs also possible that some species wonÆt be able to track climate change, and will go extinct.  If we are to avoid these impacts on ecosystem services, we need to know how these changes will occur, which means we need to be able to predict how individual species ranges will shift.   Many researchers are working on this topic, but few of the models that have been developed explicitly include interactions between plants and other organisms, such as herbivores, pathogens, competitors and mutualists (known as biotic interactions).  However, there are entire subfields in ecology that are based on biotic interactions being different in different places and we know that biotic interactions often determine whether a population can establish and persist in a particular area.  Many researchers have pointed out this discrepancy and believe that the predictions made by these species distribution models arenÆt reliable because they donÆt include biotic interactions. This could complicate predictions of range shifts over time scales of decades to centuries, which are relevant to policy and management decisions.   The purpose of this project was to determine whether biotic interactions with natural enemies will affect latitudinal range expansion dynamics.  To do so, we asked the following questions: Do biotic interactions vary across range edges?  Can these differences be understood through the framework of distance dependent biotic interactions?  Do differences in biotic interactions affect plant performance and therefore colonization success?  In order to answer these questions, we conducted a large transplant experiment in which we planted 13,000 seedlings of 10 species in four regions along a 450 km latitudinal gradient in Michigan.  Within regions, we established sites in different forest types, and within forest types, we established plots in areas with varying amounts of light and soil moisture.  For five years, we monitored herbivory and disease on the seedlings as well as seedling growth and survival.  We also measured the relevant environmental conditions using a combination of stationary and mobile devices.     Through this transplant experiment, we found that species often experienced reduced disease beyond their range edges, but there werenÆt consistent differences in herbivory.  We also found that the species that experienced the most enemy release beyond their ranges were the species that experienced the strongest enemy release at smaller spatial scales within their ranges.  This means that differences in biotic interactions across range edges can be thought of as a spatial extension to the concept of distance dependent biotic interactions.  This framework provides the basis for general predictions of how biotic interactions could vary across range edges in other systems.   After accounting for other variables, including environmental conditions and vertebrate herbivory, we found that foliar disease decreased survival for five species and foliar herbivory reduced survival for three species.  However, the effects of these biotic interactions on seedling survival were very small (0 &ndash; 7 percent reductions in survival at observed levels of damage after four years), which is verified by the minor effects of the pesticide treatment on seedling survival.  As such, our results suggest that even when there are differences in foliar herbivory ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
