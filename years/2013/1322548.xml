<AbstractNarration>As the largest European seismic event in the historical record, the 1755 Lisbon earthquake served as the catalyst for subsequent changes in how modern societies mitigate and manage potentially catastrophic events. This catalytic collaborative project, involving researchers based in the US and Portugal, will explore the response of communities in 18th century Portugal to this event, drawing upon contemporary reports from hundreds of parishes in Portugal which describe how members of the clergy, military and government responded to the disaster. Characteristics of the communities under study are available from additional contemporary sources which, along with other sources for this work, are held in the Portuguese National Archives. Additional research will be undertaken to characterize the development and deployment of post-disaster assessment tools (such as surveys) used by the Portuguese government following the event. Combined qualitative and quantitative methods (such as content analysis and statistical data modeling) will be used to provide a context for the data under study and to enable testing of research hypotheses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is expected to advance understanding of human response to disaster by considering community response activities in light of current understanding of the effects of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. It will contribute to research on how disaster response decision making may be shaped by characteristics both of affected communities and of the disaster itself. It will thus provide an historically grounded critique of current theories of community resilience, and is expected to identify opportunities and limitations to improving the response of current communities to disaster. Finally, it is expected to contribute tools and techniques for undertaking analysis of disaster-related data that are embedded deep in the historical record.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project undertook preparatory work, in the context of an international collaboration, for investigating community resilience from a historical perspective. The case study for this work was the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, the largest in the historical record and a catalyst for wholesale change in societal attitudes towards risk management, particularly in Europe. The research yielded preliminary results (presented in an international conference), materials to support the development of future proposals, and international collaborations. Preliminary results are being developed for two journal paper submissions. Collaborations with two colleagues in Portugal are ongoing, with involvement of faculty and PhD students at Portuguese universities. A considerable amount of effort was devoted to identifying, cataloguing and analyzing raw materials for this work. The primary sources were the holdings of national and local archives and libraries in Portugal. Extensive work was done to piece together the disparate documentation associated with the human response to the earthquake. The main product of this phase of the research was a database containing detailed, document-level information on the responses to parishes in Portugal to a survey on the impact of the disaster. During the course of the study, the PI met with more than one dozen researchers in Portugal, most often in the areas of engineering, the social sciences, and the humanities. A nucleus of interested and appropriate researchers has been formed, and work is underway to undertake the next phase of the research. Preliminary results of the work suggest that taking an historical perspective on community resilience opens new avenues for theoretical and applied research (e.g., on the tacit assumptions  that underlie contemporary theories of resilience), as well as implications for research methdology (e.g., how to undertake "deep" archival research on signficant historical disasters).
