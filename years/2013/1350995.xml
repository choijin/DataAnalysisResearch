<AbstractNarration>The effects of cybersickness (i.e., motion sickness caused by immersive simulation, such as virtual reality) on healthy users has been one of the fundamental research areas in virtual reality (VR) for many years, but its impact on persons with physical disabilities is still unknown, even though it could have a significant an impact on VR-based physical rehabilitation for this population. This project investigates cybersickness for persons with disabilities, specifically for persons with multiple sclerosis with a moderate level of mobility impairment and no cognitive impairment. The expected outcome of this research is to minimize the negative effects of cybersickness for people with disabilities, and to thereby significantly improve the effectiveness of VR-based physical rehabilitation and the quality of life for people with motor impairments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first objective of this project is to determine the best way to measure cybersickness in people with disabilities, and the second is to then figure out the main factors that contribute to cybersickness in persons with disabilities, specifically for people with proprioceptive and balance deficits (e.g., due to neurological, vestibular, balance issues). Based on preliminary data, the central hypothesis is that VR-induced cybersickness will be magnified for persons with disabilities as compared to persons without disabilities because of differences in balance and proprioception abilities. To test this hypothesis, the project will (a) determine how disability correlates with VR-induced cybersickness, (b) determine the most effective objective measures of VR-induced cybersickness for people with disabilities, (c) determine the main contributing aspects of VR design that affect cybersickness in people with disabilities and (d) create, disseminate, and maintain an open database of (anonymized) cybersickness data from people with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project will take a critical step towards the challenge of universal usability in VR and offer a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of VR as a medium for rehabilitation. The project will impact the way that people with disabilities are able to engage in VR-based rehabilitation and exercises, which could potentially have long term impact on the effectiveness and efficacy of the rehabilitation and ultimately the quality of life for these people. The project will actively engage graduate and undergraduate students in research, integrate results from research into a novel course on accessible user interfaces and universal usability, and collaborate with national advocacy societies for persons with disabilities to promote education and motivation for VR-based rehabilitation.</AbstractNarration>

Subjective questionnaire feedback (e.g.; Simulator Sickness Questionnaire) and objective physiological characteristics (e.g.; Heart Rate, Breathing Rate, etc.) have been compared between groups and within groups. All participants experienced the same virtual reality simulation. Heart rate, breathing rate, galvanic skin response, and brain signals were recorded before, during and at the end of VR-exposure to compare physiological aspects between groups and within groups. Simulator sickness questionnaire feedback was recorded before and after VR-exposure. The physiological data suggest that the cybersickness may have triggered similar changes in participants with MS and participants without MS, with different variability. These differences in severity of physiological changes ask an important question - will cybersickness reduction techniques, developed for persons without disability (e.g.; use of static rest frame, postural adjustments, etc.) be equally effective for persons with disabilities? To answer that question, I have investigated the effectiveness of Static Rest Frames (SRF) to reduce cybersickness in persons with MS. All the participants (with MS and without any disability) experienced a roller coaster simulation with and without SRF. Then their subjective feedback and physiological measures were compared between subjects and within-subjects.
