<AbstractNarration>This proposal has three main objectives. The first is to extend the results of Cattani, Deligne and Kaplan on the algebraicity of the locus of a Hodge class in a variation of pure Hodge structure to variation of mixed Hodge structures. The second is to study the asymptotics behavior of the archimedean height of a family of cycles and the singularities of the associated normal functions in the sense of Phillip Griffiths and Mark Green. The third objective is the study of the limiting periods of the relative completion of the fundamental group of a smooth complex algebraic variety with respect to tangential base points. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A period integral is a generalization of the integral of an algebraic function over an algebraic set. Such period integrals have long been of importance in number theory, geometry and physics. By allowing the integrand and/or domain of integration to vary, such period integrals define holomorphic functions of the parameters. The object of this proposal is to shed light on the Hodge conjecture and other basic questions in algebraic geometry via the study of the asymptotic behavior of such functions. In addition to pure mathematics, such period integrals play an imporÂ­tant part in a branch of physics called string theory, which seeks to unify gravity and quantum mechanics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary: The results from these investigations give new methods (singularities of  normal functions) to study the interplay between geometry, topology and  analysis for complex projective manifolds.  Specifically, the results  obtained during this investigation should eventually lead to a  formulation of the Hodge conjecture in terms of the behavior of certain  canonical metrics attached to Hodge cycles.  In this way, new techniques  from Hermitian geometry may eventually be brought to bear on the Hodge  conjecture.  Intellectual Merit: In its simplest form, Hodge theory is the study of periods -- integrals of algebraic differential forms which arise in the study of complex geometry, number theory and physics.  Its difficulty and richness arises in part from the non-algebraicity of these integrals.  According to the beautiful conjectures of Hodge, Bloch and Beilinson, what algebraic structure they have should be explained by algebraic cycles.   One long standing approach to these question is to associate to a Hodge cycle a normal function, which spreads the algebraic cycle to yield a map to a family of complex tori.  Near the boundary of the underlying parameter space, the normal function becomes "singular".  By the work of Mark Green and Phillip Griffiths, the existence of certain types of singularities of normal is equivalent to the Hodge conjecture.   In joint work with Patrick Brosnan, the PI prove that the locus of points where a normal function vanishes is algebraic.  By related work by Christian Schnell, it would then follow that the closure of a positive dimensional component of the zero locus with the boundary of parameter space would contain a point where the normal function acquires a singularity of the type required by the Green--Griffiths program.  The algebraicity of the zero locus also means that one can ask what kind of numbers appear in its defining system of polynomial equations.  This is called the field of definition of the zero locus.  In joint work with Matt Kerr, the PI showed that the compatibility of the zero field of definition of the zero locus and the field of definition of the original algebraic cycle is closed related to the properties of a conjectural filtration on Chow groups.   In joint work with Matt Kerr, the PI began the study of boundary components of Mumford-Tate domains in order to study the arithmetic nature of limits of Hodge structures.  Broader Impact:  During the past 5 years, the PI has  given numerous talks, seminars and colloquia, and played an active role  in organizing  seminars and other mathematical activities within his  home department. The PI has also been involved in the training of the  next generation of mathematicians.  The PI also organized a conference and summer school for graduate students and postdocs in Vancouver in June 2013 on topics closely related to the work proposed in the grant.
