<AbstractNarration>This project will collect and analyze lake sediment drill core records from key localities in Kenya and Ethiopia to vastly improve our understanding of the paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic context of human evolution. Understanding the relationship between climate/environmental history and human evolution is an enduring challenge of broad scientific and public interest. Key questions include: How did climate and tectonic change interact during critical intervals of human evolution? What processes regulated this history on local to regional scales? Do local records of climate change reflect global changes? How and when did climatic and tectonic processes combine to influence early human habitats, resources, and demography? Were these changing conditions related to evolutionary processes and events in the human lineage? Research on this relationship cuts across Earth, environmental and anthropological sciences.  The sediment drill cores we will collect from lake deposits will provide detailed and highly resolved records of environmental history.  Through data collection and modeling we aim to fundamentally transform the debate concerning how environmental dynamics at global, regional and local scales may have shaped human evolutionary history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will obtain continuous paleoenvironmental records by drilling long cores from five high-priority areas in Ethiopia (N. Awash River and Chew Bahir areas) and Kenya (W. Turkana, Tugen Hills and southern Kenya Rift/Lake Magadi) where highly-resolved, continuous lacustrine paleoclimate records can be collected through important time intervals in the same basins that contain fossils and artifacts. Rather than assume a linkage between environmental history and evolution, we designed this study as a series of data collection and modeling exercises to explicitly test overarching and local hypotheses about environmental and evolutionary dynamics. Our high-resolution (centennial-millennial scale) and datable geochemical, paleoecological and sedimentological records will allow quantitative reconstruction of paleoprecipitation, paleotemperature, paleohydrology and geomorphic evolution at a regional scale. We will correlate these records using high-resolution tephrostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy and other geochronological techniques to adjacent exposures that contain hominin and other vertebrate fossils, and artifacts, as well as to nearby marine records. We will develop predictive numerical models of environmental change and ecosystem response during critical intervals of human evolution and evaluate these models against our new, high-resolution records. These experiments will examine how landscape and climate change across a hierarchy of temporal and spatial scales impacts the durability and predictability of critical ecosystem resources. They will allow us to evaluate the importance of climatic thresholds and abrupt environmental changes and better understand the earth system dynamics that might have shaped the record of human evolution. Our modeling will generate new, testable hypotheses of human evolution/Earth system dynamics, including possible feedbacks from evolving hominin populations to their environments. Our project will create a key data set for addressing fundamental, existential questions for humanity. We will provide training and internship opportunities for 16 American graduate students, 2 post-docs and 10 undergraduates, and numerous training opportunities for African student and professional participants during the field and initial core description phase of the project. We have also planned significant investment in informal education, through a 3-D video project and outreach activities we will coordinate with our three museum partners (Smithsonian Institution, National Museums of Kenya and Ethiopia), both during and following the drilling phase.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this project was to collect high quality, sediment drill cores from ancient lake beds in Kenya and Ethiopia, in order to document the environmental context of human evolution through key intervals of our evolutionary history.Understanding the relationship between Earth?s environmental history and the evolution of humans and our close relatives (the <em>hominins</em>) is an enduring geoscientific challenge that generates broad interest among scientists and the general public. Research on environment-human evolution relationships is interdisciplinary, involving studies across the Earth sciences, climate science and anthropology. This project supported a portion of the drilling costs associated with the <em>Hominin Sites and Paleolakes Drilling Project </em>(HSPDP), as well as the bulk of the sample analysis, computer modeling and outreach costs associated with the project. Long-lived lakes such as those of the African Rift Valley, are often locations of highly continuous sedimentation, providing the potential for recording environmental events in their surrounding watersheds over their history. Lake bed drill cores, through their enclosed fossils, sediments and chemistry, provide the opportunity to collect detailed records of key climate (temperature, precipitation, seasonality), ecology (watershed vegetation, fire history, lake ecology) and landscape histories critical for evaluating competing the many hypotheses linking environmental history to human evolution.</p> <p>Drilling was conducted at five areas in the Eastern Rift Valley of Africa in lake beds adjacent to where key fossil and archaeological evidence for human origins has been recovered. These include (from oldest to youngest), a site in the northern Awash Valley , Ethiopia (~3.2-2.9 million years old), a site in the Tugen Hills-Lake Baringo area of central Kenya (3.2.-2.5 million years old), a site in northern Kenya, west of modern Lake Turkana (1.8-1.3 million years old), the Chew Bahir Basin of southern Ethiopia (0.7-0 million years old) and the Lake Magadi Basin &nbsp;of southern Kenya (1.1-0 million years old). Over the course of several field campaigns in 2013 and 2014 we collected ~1.5 kilometers of sediment cores, retrieved from the ground with mobile drill rigs in 3m segments. After collection drill cores were transported to the U.S. National Lacustrine Core facility, where they we opened, subject to high resolution photography, multi-sensor geophysical core analysis, detailed description and subsampling for the many research teams that analyzed these records. Sampling teams generated records of ancient ecology (from fossil pollen and other plant parts, fossil algae, fish and invertebrates) and geochemical records of past climate and lake conditions (from variations in sediment chemistry and isotope records of leaf waxes and minerals).&nbsp; We also conducted climate and vegetation modeling studies to help understand the regional and global processes that may have controlled our paleorecords.</p> <p>Our detailed findings to date have greatly reshaped our understanding of environmental and ecological history in East Africa and how they may have impacted human evolution. For example, we now know from our studies that a major technological transition that is well documented in East Africa, from the Early to the Middle Stone Age (between 500-300 thousand years ago), was accompanied by a transition from wetter to both drier and more variable climate conditions. Similarly, an increase in the diversity of hominin species and the first stone tools, between about 3-2.5 million years ago, was also accompanied by shifts towards drier and more variable climate conditions.</p> <p>HSPDP has been very successful in communicating its results to both the scientific community and the general public. To date, 28 peer-reviewed publications have been published (with many more in preparation), along with over 200 conference presentations. Nine Ph.D. dissertations, 10 MS theses and 11 B.S. theses have been written based on project results. The project?s website (hspdp.asu.edu) and Facebook site (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/HSPDP">https://www.facebook.com/HSPDP</a>), both supported by this award, have provided important outlets for informing the public about our activities.
