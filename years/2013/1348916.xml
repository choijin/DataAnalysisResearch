<AbstractNarration>How do we determine if someone poses a threat?  To make this assessment, not only do we draw on external cues (e.g., the individual and surrounding environment), but we also use our own internal cues (e.g., our personalities, situations, and contexts) to guide these perceptions and judgments. Theories of embodied social cognition posit that the state of one's body (e.g., clothing or accessories) and behavioral repertoire (e.g., skills and abilities) influence our perceptions and thoughts about other people in our environment. Therefore, simple cues such as what we are wearing or holding can shape how we interpret and understand our social world. The present investigation will examine how holding objects with different meanings can change how we perceive the intentions of others.  For example, do we perceive others differently if we are holding a gun versus holding a phone?  This research will examine the role of individual differences and situation-specific factors that affect the likelihood that holding a gun will produce false perceptions about the actions of others; for example, whether they incorrectly believe another person is holding a gun instead of another object. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;If this type of misperception occurs in real life situations, it could be costly. Falsely perceiving that someone else is holding a gun could lead to negative consequences, including instigating violence towards unarmed individuals who do not pose a significant threat. This research could be relevant for the law and judicial system when violence or other crime results from misunderstandings of threat. Additionally, the findings could be used to educate those who might carry a gun as part of their occupation on how this could shift their observations and judgments, which could mitigate misperceptions. Overall, the proposed work will contribute to our understanding on the importance of individual differences and situational contexts for how we perceive and understand our social surroundings. This is particularly important when the context in question has implications for misperceiving malicious intent of others.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ How does a person determine if someone else poses a threat?  To make this assessment, people draw on external cues such as clothing or movement style of the observed individual.  Surprisingly, the assessment of threat is also influenced by internal cues such as one?s own behavioral repertoire (e.g., skills and abilities).  Wielding certain objects, such as a ball or a gun, can change one?s behavioral repertoire.  The present investigation examined the effect of holding objects with different meanings on the perceptions of others.  We found a bias to see others as being more threatening when the perceiver?s own abilities were enhanced.  Specifically, people were slower and/or less accurate to identify that another person was holding a shoe (rather than a gun) when the perceiver wielded a gun than when they wielded a spatula.  Wielding a gun created a bias to see guns.      If this type of bias occurs in real life situations, it could be costly. Falsely perceiving that someone else is holding a gun could lead to negative consequences, including instigating violence towards unarmed individuals who do not pose a significant threat. This research could be relevant for the law and judicial system when violence or other crime results from misunderstandings of threat. Additionally, the findings could be used to educate those who might carry a gun as part of their occupation or recreation on how this could shift their observations and judgments.

The present research demonstrates that social cognition is influenced not only by factors related to the person being perceived but also by factors related to the person doing the perceiving.  Perceptual reality is in the eyes, and the hands, of the perceiver.       Last Modified: 08/29/2018       Submitted by: Jessica K Witt]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
