<AbstractNarration>1337787&lt;br/&gt;Ren&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding for the acquisition of a state-of-the-art fluorescence activated cell (FAC) sorter. Syracuse University (SU) does not currently have a FAC sorter and this is a limiting factor for many research projects in different SU departments. The selected model is a Special FACS AriaTM system with 4 lasers from BD Biosciences. It fulfills the needs of all confirmed users and has sufficient flexibility to successfully incorporate future users. It will enable researchers to sort both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells between 0.2 - 100 Ã¬m in diameter with high speeds (up to 70,000 cells per second) and high accuracy (&gt;99%).  This major piece of advanced instrumentation will be a crucial resource for many ongoing projects at SU in the areas of biomaterials (including cell-surface interactions, drug delivery, and nanotechnology), molecular and cell biology (including neuroscience, cell physiology, development, and inter-kingdom signaling) and biofuels research involving algae cells.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award allowed the team to acquire the first fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) at Syracuse University, which has been playing an essential role in promoting many research projects in different departments at Syracuse University, and collaboration with nearby institutions such as SUNY-College of Environmental Science and Forestry, and SUNY-Upstate Medical University. The selected model is a Special FACSAria<sup>TM</sup> system with 4 lasers from BD Biosciences.

It enables researchers to sort both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells between 0.2 &ndash; 100 &mu;m in diameter with high speeds (up to 70,000 cells per second) and high accuracy (&gt;99%). This grant also facilitated the establishment of a flow core facility at Syracuse University. During the first year of this project, the proposed system was purchased and the operator of this facility was hired and trained. The designated room was renovated and the system was installed. After an open house, the core facility was opened to the public in June, 2014. This core facility (comprising the FACS and a flow cytometer) has been providing regular services to users from both Syracuse University and nearby institutions. It has also been used for teaching and outreach activities as proposed. The PI has further developed innovative teaching and this facility played an important role in the new endeavor. For example, the FACS has been used for a Bioengineering junior course named Biological Principals for Engineers. The activities include a lecture and a hands-on lab designed to use the cell sorter to quantitatively follow bacterial horizontal gene transfer in a model system. These new modules allowed the students to learn cutting edge technologies at first hand and helped them understand not only the knowledge and experimental skills, but also the societal issues related to bacterial antibiotic resistance. In summary, this MRI grant has led to not only the acquisition of an advanced instrument, but also the creation of a core facility. After this MRI grant ends, this core facility will continue serving the community for transformative research, teaching, and outreach activities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/15/2016<br>      Modified by: Dacheng&nbsp;Ren</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
