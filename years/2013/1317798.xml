<AbstractNarration>Project Overview &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to develop a normative framework for policies of cyber warfare. They plan to conduct an investigation into cyber warfare practices and to evaluate the extent to which current cyber warfare conforms to basic war ethics principles underlying the Hague and Geneva conventions including discrimination, attribution, proportionality, and deception. For these purposes, they are partnering with the Consortium for Emerging Technologies, Military Operations, and National Security (CETMONS).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The US is clearly worried about cyber attacks; other nations could inflict serious damage to military capabilities, as well as strike physical targets and infrastructure, with more anonymity and without placing their soldiers at risk. In response to these prospects, the US is developing a thoughtful plan to operate with greater safety and security in cyberspace. However, cyber warfare also poses great challenges to just war theory, the basis for international laws of armed conflict. This project fills an important need by investigating tensions with the basic principles of war, helping to determine the permissibility and policies of cyber warfare. It will provide a concise set of normative principles that could also serve to safeguard cyberspace, which is increasingly essential to modern life. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will include a comprehensive report on cyber warfare ethics, a university-level ethics course, and an edited volume that would serve as a text for such a course. This report will identify specific options for a coherent cyber war ethics in clear language useful for policymakers. The PIs plan to solicit input and disseminate their research through public workshops, one at the beginning and another at the end of the project, as well as conference and classroom talks throughout.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Philosophical and ethical discussions of warfare are often tied to emerging technologies and techniques. In particular, discussions over how warfare can be conducted in a morally justified manner have come in response to such changes in the character of warfare.

Today we are presented with what many believe is a radical shift in the nature of war &ndash; the realization of conflict in the cyber-realm, the so-called ?fifth domain? of warfare.

Are the standard theories of just war capable of analyzing and assessing this mode of conflict?  This new form of war &ndash; cyberwarfare &ndash; has been brought about by a series of technological and social shifts.

All of these activities present ways in which the cyber-realm is rapidly becoming part of the 5th domain, a new space in which warfare or warfare-like activities are conducted.  Upon short reflection, these changing circumstances present us with a series of questions demanding serious attention. Is there such a thing as cyberwarfare?

Especially given the idea that events that are constrained within the cyber-realm do not directly physically harm anyone, what do traditional ethics of war conventions say about this new space?  Our research project sought to address these, and other, questions.  We leveraged a strong team of international researchers, publishing in top journals and with top presses.  Woth specific note is the first-ever book on this topc, *Binary Bullets:  The Ethics of Cyberwarfare* (Oxford University Press).  We also collaborated with a range of institutions, ranging from the International Committee for the Red Cross to the Naval Postgraduate School to the US Naval Academy.  We also had substantial outreach with Euroean partners, mostly facilitated and hosted by the Faculty of Political Science at the University of Iceland.  We appreciate the opportunity to do this work, sponsored by the National Science Foundation, and to advance conversatons relating to ethical, legal, and policy issues that adhere to cyberwarfare.
