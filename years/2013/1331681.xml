<AbstractNarration>The application of innovative ocean observing and animal telemetry technology over Palmer Deep (Western Antarctic Peninsula; WAP) is leading to new understanding, and also to many new questions related to polar ecosystem processes and their control by bio-physical interactions in the polar environment. This multi-platform field study will investigate the impact of coastal physical processes (e.g. tides, currents, upwelling events, sea-ice) on Adélie penguin foraging ecology in the vicinity of Palmer Deep, off Anvers Island, WAP. Guided by real-time surface convergence and divergences based on remotely sensed surface current maps derived from a coastal network of High Frequency Radars (HFRs), a multidisciplinary research team will adaptively sample the distribution of phytoplankton and zooplankton, which influence Adélie penguin foraging ecology, to understand how local oceanographic processes structure the ecosystem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Core educational objectives of this proposal are to increase awareness and &lt;br/&gt;understanding of (i) global climate change, (ii) the unique WAP ecosystem, (iii) innovative methods and technologies used by the researchers, and (iv) careers in ocean sciences, through interactive interviews with scientists, students, and technicians, during the field work. These activities will be directed towards instructional programming for K-16 students and their teachers. Researchers and educators will conduct formative and summative evaluation to improve the educational program and measure its impacts respectively.</AbstractNarration>

Converge education and outreach efforts served as the prototype for NSF funded Polar Interdisciplinary Coordinated Education (ICE) (grant # PLR-1440435 and OPP-1525635).  The Science Investigator program (Sci-I) was modeled after Converge and serves 48 educators and more then 3,000 students in inquiry based learning.   The Converge model has shown statistical significance in building a) student engagement in science- defined as persistence, interest and curiosity in STEM; b) contributions to student identity, defined as describing themselves as having qualities or characteristics of a scientist (think of themselves as scientist); and c) understanding of the  "Process of Science" defined as complex, iterative, and non-linear procedure, involving observation, exploration, testing, communication, and application.  Through integrating educators and students into the research mission and exposing them to the actual process of science by the scientists and for themselves, educators and students increased their understanding of the authentic process of science and use of real-world data.
