<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to derive, develop, implement and test a theoretical framework for control and estimation methods for sensor networks that enables the derivation of near optimal rates of approximation of the vehicles' environment. The theoretical framework will serve as the foundation for deriving encoding and decoding schemes that are essential to high-bandwidth mobile sensor networks. The approach relies on the synthesis of techniques from several disparate technical fields including control theory, estimation theory, approximation theory and statistical learning theory.   The work extends recent efforts that study the fidelity of approximation in distribution free learning theory, a sub-problem of statistical learning theory, to include classes of decentralized and dependent measurement processes.   The algorithms developed under this project will be validated using multi-vehicle network that host three dimensional laser-ranging sensors to map unknown environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful completion of the research will enable novel and efficient algorithms for the mapping of unknown fields over complex environments by decentralized, autonomous robotic vehicle teams. The successful completion of the research will enable large-scale, multivehicle sensor networks to be employed in a host of environmental monitoring and mapping applications including contaminant dispersal in a marine environment, chemical plume dispersal in urban environments, wildfire evolution in forests, and crop density in automated agribusiness.  This research project will build human and institutional infrastructure for science and technology via the creation of new graduate courses that treat the synthesis of estimation, control and approximation theory.  The research program will create an outreach program that engages K-12 students in robotics and environmental mapping.  The results of this research will be disseminated through presentation and publication at national and international conferences, as well as through top-notch peer-reviewed journals.  The dissemination of the research will enable industry to implement and field scalable and general algorithms for decentralized mapping using robotic vehicle sensor networks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary : This project  studies methods for estimating terrain and the environment from sensor vehicle teams. In many applications,  there is the need to be able to develop an accurate estimate of the environment from a collective that consists of sensor vehicle networks. These applications include scenarios such as the  mapping a region of flooding for disaster relief,  creating maps of a growing wildfire for access by firefighters, or measuring contaminant, chemical plume, or radiation over  extended regions.   While technology for mapping the environment from a single vehicle is now commercially available, these applications that require decentralized estimation pose unique, as of yet unmet, challenges.   This research project has developed a framework, learning theory with consensus,' with which to study the problem of decentralized estimation of the environment from sensor vehicle teams. In this theory a sensor vehicle team consists of a team of agents that must collectively measure the environment in some region. It is assumed, consistent with current and emerging sensor hardware capabilities, that each agent in the network is equipped with  high-bandwidth, high-resolution sensors. Examples of sensors of this type in include, but are not limited to, high speed cameras, arrays of optical sensors,  or laser-scanning sensors. It is also assumed that the local rate of capture of measurements far exceeds the communication bandwidth among the agents in the network. The agents or sensor vehicles team members, employ an intuitive  two stage learning process to create a local map of the environment. Each agent in the collective first collects measurements of the local environment: these measurements could be urban geometry, density of contaminants, level of radiation, etc.  Using these measurements, each agent updates its local estimate of the enviroment. The agents then exchange information regarding their own local map with other agents in the network, according to some constraints on the communication topology.  This process is repeated as more and more measurements are made.  While this is an intuitive approach, it is the newly introduced learning theory with consensus that dictates exactly how the local learning and information sharing is carried out. The essential difficulty is that there is a fundamental tradeoff that must be address by any map-building team: how should the resolution of the map be related to the number of samples taken by each agent? This is determined by the theory derived in this project. By employing the theory developed in this project, the two stage learning dynamic is guaranteed to converge: the estimate generated by each agent converges to the true map of the global region. In other words, all the agents eventually reach consensus about what the global environmental map should be.  It is important to note that even if the agent has never visited certain portions of the region, it's local estimate is still an accurate estimate of the global map.   The theory and algorithms created in this project is distinguished from other techniques in that it enables the determination of an upper bound on the rate at which the collection of environmental estimates generated by the team converge to the true environmental map. This rate of convergence of the environmental estimate to its true valued depends on the number of discrete samples collected by each agent and on the regularity of the environmental state that is being estimated.   Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project to the field of decentralized estimation from sensor vehicle networks is clear. The developed theory enables the construction of estimates that are guaranteed to converge to the true environmental map at an explicit rate that depends on the number of samples.  Newly developed theory and algorithms in this field should view this metric as a new standard of performance.  In this sense this research project has the potential to have a  deep impact on future developments in estimation from sensor vehicle teams. In addition, the theory developed in this project is formulated by bringing certain cutting edge approaches of approximation theory to define and solve new problems of statistical learning theory.
