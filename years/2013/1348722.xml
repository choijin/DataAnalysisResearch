<AbstractNarration>PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS: &lt;br/&gt;University of Massachusetts Boston (Lead)&lt;br/&gt;University of Nebraska-Lincoln&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CORE AREA(s):&lt;br/&gt;STEM Learning/STEM Learning Environments - Undergraduate Education&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION &lt;br/&gt;The project is studying the abstraction capacity in problem solving among undergraduate students in two STEM disciplines. The three-year project involves faculty and students in electrical engineering at University of Nebraska-Lincoln and in chemistry at University of Massachusetts Boston. The study is examining two courses in each discipline (that typically occur in the sophomore and junior years) for evidence of an abstraction threshold - the gap in reasoning ability that can be crossed by students. The project is seeking to characterize reasoning applied to problem solving using a cognitive processing model, Representation Mapping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study tests two hypotheses: &lt;br/&gt;1) Many students do not have fully mature processes for abstraction, i.e., cognitive supply, and it is possible to measure what their processes are and the degree to which they are capable of reasoning using abstraction. &lt;br/&gt;2) Somewhere in each undergraduate STEM curriculum, cognitive demand increases to the point where a typical students current capacity for abstraction is not matched to the complexity of problems posed, and this impacts student performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research questions being studied are: &lt;br/&gt;RQ1: How can students problem solving processes and degree of abstraction in two different STEM disciplines - electrical engineering and chemistry - be characterized using Representation Mapping? &lt;br/&gt;RQ2: What evidence is there that abstraction thresholds exist in undergraduate electrical engineering and chemistry curricula? &lt;br/&gt;RQ3: What are discipline-specific nuances of abstraction in electrical engineering and chemistry education?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This theory-driven project involves a rigorous interdisciplinary study that has the potential to significantly advance the understanding of how students reason when solving problems associated with deep concepts in STEM disciplines. The effort is in direct alignment the report from the National Academies on Discipline-Based Education Research (DBER), which includes "Interdisciplinary studies of cross-cutting concepts and cognitive processes" as one of its four overall recommendations for promising directions in studying undergraduate STEM education. The project is making significant contributions to the knowledge base on how to increase students' problem solving approaches and is helping to uncover how domain-general and discipline-dependent cognitive processing interact in two STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER SIGNIFICANCE &lt;br/&gt;As manifest by its strong alignment with the DBER report, the project is an area of national interest. The project is uncovering commonalities of abstraction in two STEM disciplines and clarifying differences in abstraction between the disciplines. This effort is providing fundamental insights to support how instructors can capitalize on commonalities and deliberately provide avenues for students to practice discipline-dependent reasoning strategies in problem solving. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Situating the data collection in two very different universities - a traditional research university in the Midwest and a majority minority non-traditional university in the Northeast - lends greater potential relevance to the findings, which is being widely disseminated at high profile conferences in both science and engineering education. An interdisciplinary study is producing results that are more readily transferred to other STEM disciplines, thus enhancing their potential for broad adoption.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[In relation to the overarching goals of the entire project at both collaborative sites (University of Massachusets Boston and University of Nebraska-Lincoln), the following can be summarized from the perspective of the first site (UMass Boston), which was responsible for the chemistry side of the project: Goal 1: Characterize students' proficiency in abstraction when solving problems in STEM courses. The representation mapping framework of Hahn and Chater was applied and determined to be useful in analyzing abstraction during problem solving. Methods of data collection were developed and this analysis approach was used to examine students? problem solving in organic chemistry, analytical chemistry, and physical chemistry. Students demonstrate strategies in problem solving that rely on all four reasoning approaches that are able to be characterized by representation mapping, specifically memory bank and rule-based reasoning (rules processes) and similarity-based and prototype reasoning (similarity processes). Students who demonstrate greater flexibility to use both rules and similarity processes exhibit stronger performance when solving problems and also perform better in the courses.  Goal 2: Determine whether a measurable shift in students' abstraction capacity occurs in two different STEM curricula (electrical engineering and chemistry) and to identify the course in each curriculum in which the abstraction threshold is most prominent. Students use both rules and similarity processes in solving problems in all courses studied (organic, analytical and physical chemistry). Across a semester in organic chemistry, students generally become more proficient in applying similarity processes. In chemistry, the organic chemistry II course appears to be the location where there is a large mismatch between the abstraction that many students supply toward solving problems and the abstraction demanded by those problems.  Goal 3: Uncover domain-general and discipline-specific nuances of abstraction in solving problems in the courses studied. There are characteristic indicators of two aspects of abstraction in problem solving: the abstractness of the stored knowledge and new instance (problem interpretation) representations formed by students as they solve a problem, and the actions of abstracting as a student matches these two representations in order to solve a problem. Abstractness of representations can be characterized along several dimensions: (1) explicit vs. implicit features of the problem in the representation, (2) sequence of events vs. explanation of properties, (3) structure vs. function, and (4) specific vs. generalized terminology.

Goal 4: Determine implications for interventions to enhance students' success in problem solving and for faculty professional development to assess in ways that build students' abstraction capacities. Several implications for teaching can be drawn from the findings from this research. (1) Deliberately drawing students? attention to the implicit features of representations, and the differences between these and explicit features, may help bridge students to notice implicit features on their own.
