<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports combined theoretical research, education, and outreach to pursue the consequences of spin-orbit coupling in various materials through a chiral Fermi liquid theory.  The research part of the proposal will explore possibilities of new phases of electronic matter in two-dimensional electron systems with strong spin-orbit coupling, focusing on electron and hole gases in gallium-aluminum-arsenide heterostructures, surface states of oxides, states at oxide interfaces, and three-dimensional topological insulators. The main thrusts of the project include&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;+ developing the general theory of chiral Fermi liquids;&lt;br/&gt;+ applying this theory to three main archetypes of chiral Fermi liquids: systems with linear and cubic spin-orbit  couplings, and Dirac fermions on the surface of  topological insulators;&lt;br/&gt;+ identifying and classifying possible novel phases resulting from the interplay between the electron-electron and spin-orbit interactions in these systems;&lt;br/&gt;+ analyzing ferromagnetic order of nuclear spins coupled by an indirect interaction via heavy holes in p-gallium arsenide quantum wells; &lt;br/&gt;+ developing a theory of novel collective modes in chiral Fermi liquids and proposing experiments for detecting  these modes;&lt;br/&gt;+ understanding the interplay between superconductivity and spin-orbit coupling in a 2D superconductor at lanthanum aluminate/strontium titanate interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award also supports educational and outreach activities that will address diverse audiences of graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Florida, as well as a broader community of STEM teachers via the FloridaTeach program. Using the already existing framework of the advanced multi-faculty course at the UF Department of Physics, the PI will develop month-long courses of lectures on the topics relevant to this project for graduate students. Educational materials for these lectures will be available for a broader audience of graduate students and researchers via the UF Physics website. At the undergraduate level, the PI will involve participants of the existing REU program in some of the research projects related to this proposal. Finally, the PI will deliver popular lectures on advances in nanoscience to Florida STEM teachers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research that crosscuts two very active research areas in materials research. The first one is the field of strongly correlated electron systems and quantum phase transitions in itinerant electron systems. The main goal of this field is to understand the mechanisms by which the electrons in a many-electron system choose to organize themselves into  an ordered state, such as magnetism over a liquid-like state. The second one is the field of semiconductor spintronics and quantum computation with spin qubits. The main physical ingredient of this field is correlated dynamics of just a few or many electrons along with their spins. There are interesting "overlap regions" between these two areas, and the PI aims to investigate them. The results will help to improve our understanding of fundamental physics in both areas, and thus will be of interest to a broader community. The universal language of symmetry-based phenomenology employed by the theory of Fermi liquids should be equally familiar to large communities of researchers working in strongly correlated electron systems and in spintronics/quantum computation. Training of graduate students will prepare them not only to life in academia but would also give them useful problem-solving skills that can be used outside of academia. The PI's group has a strong record for placement of PhD students some of whom made successful academic careers and some chose equally successful careers in industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Spintronics is a rapidly developing field which aims at achieving electrical control over spins, with potential applications in quantum computing and data storage. Electric field couples to electron spins via spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which plays an important role in physical and chemical properties of materials. For example, the color of gold, the liquidity of mercury at room temperature, and about 80% of the voltage generated by a lead-acid battery all owe their origin to SOC.  This project focused on exploring interplay between SOC and Coulomb interaction between electrons. The main outcome is opening a new avenue in spintronics by predicting and analysing a novel type of excitations--spin-chiral waves &mdash; which arise from such interplay. The usual spin waves are not unlike sound waves in solids, except that a wave carries not pressure but magnetization. The spins are oriented either externally (by magnetic field) or internally (by magnetic order). However, the theoretical work of the PI's group has shown that there exists another possibility: magnetization can propagate in a wave-like manner even in the absence of the magnetic order. An electron spin is aligned with respect to its velocity by SOC while electron-electron interaction ensures phase-locking of oscillations. This is a fundamentally new type of collective excitation which has recently been observed in a magnetic semiconductor heterostructure.  The group made predictions the interplay between spin-orbit and Coulomb interactions should modify the way in which electron spins absorb electromagnetic energy: instead of absorption at a single resonance frequency, energy can be absorbed simultaneously at up to three frequencies.   The group also generalized the canonical theory of interacting electrons (the Fermi-liquid theory) to account for the effects of SOC.  The main research findings were published in high-impact peer-review journals, reported at the international conferences, and incorporated into the curriculum of classes offered at the University of Florida.
