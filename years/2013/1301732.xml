<AbstractNarration>The goal of the Arctic Human Development Report II (AHDR-II) is to provide a second assessment and synthesis report on the state of human&lt;br/&gt;development in the Arctic, ten years after the initial report. This project will enable that the seven U.S. lead authors of AHDR-II can&lt;br/&gt;participate in critical project meetings, which are typically held in Denmark. In addition, the project will partially fund several&lt;br/&gt;"town-hall meetings" in various arctic locations (e.g., Alaska, Canada, Russia, Sweden). These meetings are being held in non-academic&lt;br/&gt;settings and are intended to stimulate feedback to draft chapters of the report by arctic residents. Finally, the project will support the&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of results of AHDR-II by contributions to a printed report and through assistance for establishing and maintaining an&lt;br/&gt;AHDR-II website, where updates and other products relevant for the user-community will be posted in regular intervals.</AbstractNarration>

Each of the ten topical chapters of the AHDR-II provide an overview over the state of the art, and offer policy-relevant conclusions. For example, the chapter on "cultures and identities" concluded that "interest in and awareness of the Arctic is growing, and Indigenous culture is increasingly seen as a resource in the North. Great cultural variation and complexity characterize the Arctic. For Arctic Indigenous peoples the challenge is not of choosing between ?modernity? and ?tradition,? but to find a fulfilling combination of the two." (p. 478). The chapter on "economic systems," on the other hand, concluded that "the Arctic will remain a high cost region. The effects of environmental changes in the Arctic may in some cases benefit economic development, but in others will make resource development more costly. Natural resource production will continue as a driving force of the Arctic economy, although expectations of higher prices and lower costs for Arctic resources may be overly optimistic." (p. 480).
