<AbstractNarration>This NSF IDBR award is made to Prof. Katsushi Arisaka and collaborators at the University of California, Los Angeles, to develop a Bessel beam line confocal microscope. The goal of this project is to develop a system enabling the recording of three-dimensional cell structure in vivo, in real-time, with exceptional penetrating depth, and with minimal damage to the targeted sample. The proposed system will advance scientific understanding by facilitating cellular observation and systems level biologic analysis. Significantly, this system will enable the unprecedented high-speed recording of cell dynamics at super-resolution, in a temporal range permitting observation of developmental phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact is a cost-effective, easily configurable and user-friendly 3D imaging system for use by scientists towards the in vivo structural characterization of dynamic biological samples over a timespan of days. This collaboration will generate an available and reproducible microscope that significantly advances obtainable information concerning embryo development, dynamic neural network function, cellular differentiation and regulation, while enabling high-volume 3D cell imaging. This project directly integrates educational and research goals through incorporation of microscope development into a novel, interdisciplinary laboratory course developed by Dr. Arisaka at UCLA. Thus, development and construction of the system will serve as an educational platform directly fostering student learning. Moreover, the system will be housed in the Advanced Light Microscope Facility at the California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI), resulting in widespread availability to the extended scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being made jointly by two Programs- (1) Instrument Development for Biological Research, in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Biological Sciences Directorate), and (2) Biomedical Engineering, in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (Engineering Directorate).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With this award, we have developed three types of sheet illumination microscopes:  [1] Gaussian sheet (OpenSPIM) for embryonic long duration development studies (Fig. 1).  [2] Bessel Beam sheet (BB) using an axicon lens for clarified neural tissue samples (Fig. 1).  [3] Spatial Light Modulator-based Bessel Beam sheet (SLM-BB) for whole-brain dynamic imaging (Fig. 3).  These microscopes are fully operational for numerous scientific applications. The first two microscopes (OpenSPIM and BB) are in CNSI?s user facility and have been used extensively by a dozen researchers.   SLM-BB has been extensively utilized for their research, providing vital feedback to its optimization.  The OpenSPIM is based on Gaussian sheet illumination, and optimized to study embryonic development of model animals with minimum photo toxicity.  The BB system is optimized to generate a &gt; 1mm long Bessel beam with a diffraction limited width, which is ideal for scanning large-volume (&gt; 1 cm3) CLARITY-treated biological samples.  Figure 2 shows preliminary results of a clarified mouse brain (from the Dan Geschwind Lab, labeled with Thy-1 YFP).   (A) shows a 2.4 &times; 2.4 &times; 1 mm3 volume consisting of 36 individual scans of a small 3D volume each 0.4 &times; 0.4 &times; 1 mm3. The 3D volume image is projected on to a 2D plane for convenience based on maximum intensity per depth. (B) is a magnified view of a region of the hippocampus.  (C) is a bundle of nerve fibers (labeled with ALEXA488) across the surface of a clarified mouse heart (from Dr. Tompkins).
