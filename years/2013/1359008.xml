<AbstractNarration>The Siena College Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site provides unique opportunities for undergraduates to develop research expertise in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The Siena College REU Site environment fosters learning through research by means of faculty advisors and peer mentors. The students work in teams on real problems in information extraction in areas such as information gathering for military and security needs to targeted marketing of products. Especially due to the emerging area of Big Data, this REU program is having an impact on applications that address national and global societal problems, such as medical information retrieval systems that identify people for clinical trials and systems to predict the focus of a groups with adverse intentions from automated text analysis. Teams working in these areas need to have diversity in skills, knowledge, and cultural perspectives, and the Siena REU program is recruiting a wide range of students, including a focus on women and other under-represented groups, so that the students can gain the broad experience needed to address the big problems in today's society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU students are involved in research teams with Siena College faculty and student mentors working on projects that are conducted at the Siena College Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SCIAI) in computational linguistics (CL) for information extraction. The projects are improving the state of the art in CL, as well as investigating interesting real-world applications. Students are learning about the nature of scientific research and how to communicate their work in student-authored publications and through presentations at research conferences. The results of the students' work, including transcripts of presentations and copies of posters, are disseminated via the Siena College REU Site website (http://www.siena.edu/reu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Undergraduate Research Experience on Artificial Intelligence and Text Analysis  Award Id : 1359008  Dr. Sharon Small  Summer 2016  Summary:  The Siena College Institute for Artificial Intelligence successfully completed its third Summer REU program. We were able to support 13 REU students and 2 mentors.  We ran the summer with four projects and all teams finished their work with publishable results. All students presented their work in a formal poster session and two papers were accepted for publication and posters were presented at an international conference.     Projects:  Siena College's Institute of Artificial Intelligence: The TREC Contextual Suggestion Track  This project participated in the Twenty-Sixth Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) Contextual Suggestion Track.  The TREC conference is a yearly, international gathering of researchers in various areas of computational linguistics; in 2016, the conference supported eight tracks.  The Contextual Suggestion Track involved the development of a system that can offer suggestions to a person based on their profile preferences and the current context.  A profile of a person consists of suggestion/preference pairs of various topics.  For example, a suggestion of having a drink at the Dogfish Head Alehouse may be met with a positive or negative preference.  From these pairs in the profile, it was the system's responsibility to make suggestions for other contexts, based upon profile and location(the context) information.     Detecting Cyberbullying and Tragic Event Patterns in Social Media  Students worked as to team to develop applications that collected social media data.  The team then analyzed this data using natural language processing tools to identify patterns that may indicate cyberbullying and/or predictors of tragic events.  Summer research included investigating social media APIs, developing Java programs to collect and analyze data, review existing research in the cyberbullying and social media domain. The final deliverable was a student authored paper that will be submitted to a professional journal/conference for publication and/or presentation.      Detecting Compromised Implicit Association Test Results using Supervised Learning  An implicit association test is a human psychological test used to measure subconscious associations. While widely recognized by psychologists as an effective tool in measuring attitudes and biases, the validity of the results can be compromised if a subject does not follow the instructions or attempts to manipulate the outcome. Compared to previous work, we collect training data using a more generalized methodology. We train a variety of different classifiers to identify a participant?s first attempt versus a second possibly compromised attempt. To compromise the second attempt, participants are shown their score and are instructed to change it using one of five randomly selected deception methods.      Siena?s Clinical Decision Assistant (SCDA)  The Clinical Decision Support Track (Simpson et al., 2014) is a program in the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) (Voorhees, 2007). TREC is a program co-sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Department of Defense.
