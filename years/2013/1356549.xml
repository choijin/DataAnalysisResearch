<AbstractNarration>Nicholas Iacobelli, under the supervision of Dr. Phillipe Bourgois of the University of Pennsylvania, will explore how healthcare security is negotiated among socially marginal communities. The research focuses on prison inmates, a population largely uninsured and with inconsistent healthcare access on the outside, but who are paradoxically the only U.S. population group currently guaranteed a constitutional right to healthcare. The study seeks to evaluate this paradox through an ethnographic evaluation of the legal, political, and economic determinants of prison healthcare juxtaposed with the everyday operations of correctional healthcare administration in a maximum-security prison. This project will address 1) How prisons are relied upon to generate healthcare security, and 2) What social factors shape local care seeking and provision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project responds to the dearth of detailed ethnographic research in prison settings by examining the everyday dynamics of incarceration and analyzing them in the larger context of state services and citizenship. The study's ethnographic approach will provide insight on the interpersonal, administrative, and legal processes that dictate care with a focus on what is at stake "on the ground."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is thus uniquely situated to generate knowledge about contemporary state services, social marginalization, and the political role of health. It will also be able to help local correctional healthcare providers structure their policies and practices to address the study's findings and generate broader debate about care provision and the costs of incarceration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The United States is currently the world leader in incarceration. The US has 5 percent of the worldÆs population, yet holds 25 percent of the worldÆs prisoners. This project provides ethnographic data on healthcare services in a menÆs maximum-security state prison in Pennsylvania in order to understand its role in this larger structural phenomenon. It elicits perspectives about and experiences with prison healthcare from a broad range of actors &ndash; administrators, corrections staff, healthcare providers, and inmates themselves &ndash; gleaned from over 20 months of ethnographic fieldwork in the prisonÆs medical unit. Combining these perspectives with the observation of the daily practice of care delivery there and the larger political economy of prison healthcare, the research draws out the tensions between care provision and the logics of containment and punishment inherent in the criminal justice system. Understanding these practices offers insight to how ideologies about punishment, profitability, and care produce lived effects.  Intellectual Merit  This project responds to the dearth of ethnographic data collected from within carceral institutions, especially in the United States. As such, it documents the local healthcare environment within a state prison &ndash; both its day-to-day operations and the resultant processes of socialization or "institutionalization" for both providers and inmates. It explores how the legal history granting inmates a right to healthcare based on the Eighth Amendment protection against "cruel and unusual punishment" and the history of contracting healthcare services to private, for-profit companies while the prisons themselves remain state-run shape inmatesÆ perceptions of themselves as rights-bearing individuals who are granted limited rights by virtue of being reduced to the biological property of the state and the financial property of the company. Thus, this project speaks to particular configurations of state power and ideologies about rights, ethics, and worthiness.  Broader Impacts  One of the studyÆs main findings is the tension between fostering a caring environment and the continued recognition by all actors that prisons are "not healthy places," including the myriad structural and interpersonal forces that maintain them as unhealthy places. Thus, this research is situated to produce data that is helpful in prison healthcare policy-making, but also productively questions the role of prisons as sites of adequate health outreach and health maintenance. This research also highlights the structural forces that align to defer and deny care to the incarcerated, offering points of policy intervention in the areas of prison service privatization, legal protection, and institutional transparency.
