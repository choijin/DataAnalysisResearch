<AbstractNarration>Computers are increasingly used to monitor and manage many aspects of our daily lives.  These systems are often required to work together to solve complex problems that are rapidly changing.  Current approaches to addressing these situations develop tailored distributed protocols that are verified through empirical testing.  This project increases the practical applicability of distributed problem solving techniques by developing a theoretical model of these problems based on thermodynamic theory.  Using this model, a protocol's performance can, for the first time ever, be predicted under previously untested conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This theoretical model is validated through extensive empirical evaluation and this project develops a new protocol that alters its problem solving strategy to maximize the trade-off between deliberate and reactive decision making based on environmental dynamics.  This protocol is applied to address a pressing practical problem: allocating telescopes for tracking objects in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). With nearly all of our manned space missions and satellites in LEO, effectively monitoring space debris has broad implications to society at large and scientific progress along numerous directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This transformative research combines cross-disciplinary ideas from artificial intelligence, distributed systems, and statistical physics.   The educational initiatives in this project directly address the recruitment and retention of students, especially focusing on women and minorities, into Computer Science by generating excitement through the Heartland Gaming Expo and by utilizing a new peer outreach program, called Engineering Ambassadors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to advance our understanding of the methods and techniques needed to develop protocols that allow computers to work together to solve problems in an ever-changing environment.  This goal is challenging because, despite years of work developing methods to solve these problems, there are no scientific theories that can guide the design and evaluation of these algorithms.  This project developed the first-ever model of dynamic, distributed problem solving.  Based on thermodynamic theory, this model creates a common set of evaluation metrics, explains how these protocols function, and most importantly, can predict their performance in unknown environments.  Building from this theory, six of the most commonly used algorithms were tested to evaluate the model and develop a greater understanding of each protocol’s strengths and weaknesses.  Finally, a new protocol was developed that estimates problem dynamics and the communication environment to solve dynamic resource allocation problems for tracking debris in low-earth orbit.  The development of this new model, the subsequent evaluation of existing protocols, along with the creation of a new best-of-the-breed protocol for solving these important and challenging problems will prove to transform the landscape in distributed problem solving.  In total, this project has currently yielded eight peer-reviewed publications along with one PhD dissertation and one master’s thesis.  Beyond the immediate intellectual merits, this project has also had a number of broader impacts.  Among these have been the graduation of one PhD student, who is now a professor at Austin Peay University and four master’s students.  It has also provided valuable research experience to five Computer Science undergraduates, one who has won the prestigious Goldwater Fellowship.  Additionally, most of these students were involved in outreach efforts to local title I elementary schools as part of an after-school program.  This program was developed specifically to promote STEM to underrepresented groups of students.  This project also supported the largest STEM oriented event in the Oklahoma region, the Heartland Gaming Expo.          Last Modified: 03/18/2020       Submitted by: Roger T Mailler]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
