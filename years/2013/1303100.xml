<AbstractNarration>The principal investigators will conduct research in the geometric Langlands program.  Given a connected smooth projective algebraic curve X over a field of characteristic zero and a reductive group G, the goal of this program is to construct a canonical equivalence between the DG category of D-modules on the stack of G-bundles on X and a certain DG category related to O-modules on the stack of local systems on X with respect to the Langlands dual of G.  The principal investigators will work on the construction of this equivalence for G=GL(n).  Using methods of non-commutative geometry, they will study the duality on the DG category of D-modules that corresponds to Serre duality for O-modules.  They will also study the classical automorphic counterpart of this duality, which is a non-standard scalar product on the space of automorphic forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Langlands program was formulated in 1967 as a series of conjectures in number theory and the theory of automorphic forms.  Later the geometric Langlands program was formulated in terms of algebraic geometry over algebraically closed fields and interpreted in physical terms as a duality in quantum field theory.  This project is aimed at proving the main conjecture of the geometric Langlands program in an important particular case.  It combines ideas from the geometric and classical theory of automorphic forms as well as non-commutative geometry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focuses on a field of research known as the Langlands program. This program has a classical version (suggested by Langlands around 1970) and a geometric one (suggested in the 1980â€™s by the principal investigator and Gerard Laumon).  The main results in the geometric direction deal with the issues related to the fact that the moduli stack of principal bundles on a smooth projective curve is not quasi-compact. One of the main theorems proved by the principal investigator jointly with Dennis Gaitsgory says that nevertheless, the category of D-modules on this stack is compactly generated. Another key result (also joint with Dennis Gaitsgory) is that two constant term functors on this category are equal despite being defined quite differently.     The principal investigator and his student Jonathan Wang introduced and studied a new invariant bilinear form on the space of automorphic forms; they also explained its relationship to the geometric Langlands program.  Using the Langlands conjecture for function fields proved by Laurent Lafforgue, the principal investigator proved that the l-adic prosemisimple completion of the fundamental group of a smooth variety over a finite field does not depend on the prime number l.  Zhiyuan Ding (a student of the principal investigator) constructed a certain subspace of the space of principal horospherical divisors on the moduli space of shtukas.  At least in the rank 2 case, the subspace constructed by Ding is equal to the space of all prinicpal horospherical divisors.
