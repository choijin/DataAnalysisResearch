<AbstractNarration>A growing body of research indicates that biomass and industrial aerosols from mid-latitudes have a broad range of effects on arctic climatological systems.  Pollutant aerosols directly and indirectly perturb solar reflection and thermal radiative emission in the atmosphere, and soot accelerates melting when it accumulates on snow.  Nonetheless, much remains unknown about how pollution plumes are modifying arctic cloud properties and precipitation.  Consequently, the impact of pollution on the arctic climate system is not well understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Past research into aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions in the Arctic has generally focused on small time and spatial scales, using a combination of aircraft and numerical modeling work.  Less research has investigated these processes over climatological time scales and pan-Arctic spatial scales, the scales that are particularly relevant to guide and evaluate precipitation formation in larger scale climate models.  Using a range of observational techniques for studying aerosol-cloud-precipitation-climate interactions, including ground-based and space-based approaches, the researchers will assess the following question: When particulate pollution reaches the Arctic, is it associated with a modification of cloud properties and an inhibition of ice crystal precipitation from super-cooled, low-level Arctic liquid clouds?  The knowledge generated from this study will contribute to a better understanding of the impact of biomass burning and industrial aerosols on the arctic climate system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The climate and meteorology of the Arctic region has been changing particularly rapidly over the past decades in response to globally increasing surface temperatures. Of particular interest to arctic climate scientists is the question of how clouds and precipitation will change as the region continues to warm. Clouds tend to warm the surface at night and cool it during the day, while recipitation determines how long clouds last.  An important aspect of this question is the role of aerosols. Pollution plumes from forest fires and industrial activities further south blow northwards towards the arctic where they can modify clouds properties. Scientific work over the past two decades has begun to show the potential for significant climate modification by distant aerosol sources through changed cloud properties, but assessing the magnitude of the impact has been made more difficult by the fact that data observatories in the Arctic are sparse and that there are unique challenges with studying arctic clouds from space using satellites.  This study has provided the most detailed quantification to date of how pollutants with their origins in human activities and forest fires are changing clouds in the Arctic, their physical state, and how they warm and cool the surface by season. Original techniques were developed for discriminating pollution impacts from natural variability in both ground-based and space-based measurements to reveal a wide range of responses of arctic clouds to pollution from elsewhere.  In summary, the properties of arctic clouds appear to be uniquely senstive to mid-latitude aerosols, up to eight times more so than similar clouds at mid-latitudes.
