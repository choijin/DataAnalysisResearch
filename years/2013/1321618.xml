<AbstractNarration>This project will develop a global numerical model of the electromagnetic fields produced by ionospheric electromagnetic currents with the research goal of enabling better prediction of the impact of space weather on the electric power grid.  The methodology involves finite-difference time domain (FDTD) computational solutions of the full-vector three-dimensional time-dependent Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic wave propagation within the global Earth-ionosphere system.  In particular, the atmosphere-lithosphere volume between 400 km above the Earth's surface to 400 km below will be studied in unprecedented detail at high spatial resolutions.  The research will build on previous and current work in this area by using Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) data and by establishing collaborations with the Electric Power Research Institute SUNBURST monitoring network project.   The model will simulate the effects of ionospheric currents that develop as the result of coronal mass ejections in order to improve our understanding of the resultant electrodynamics.  The fine spatial resolution of the newly computed FDTD solutions will provide improved information for assessing and mitigating potential hazards specific to the operations of inland and coastal power grids and oil pipelines.  One education goal is to develop a sequence of three computational electromagnetic courses at the University of New Mexico.  A second goal is to initiate and establish a Residential College system at the University of New Mexico.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Periodically, storms (coronal mass ejections or CME) transpire on the sun and project particles and magnetic fields towards the Earth, resulting in a geomagnetic storm.  The largest documented geomagnetic storm on Earth resulting from a CME on the sun occurred in 1859.  That storm caused telegraph operators communicating over 100-km-long wire lines to experience electric shocks, some nearly fatal.  Further, business transactions requiring telegraphic exchanges were completely shut down in the worldÆs major capitals.   A 2008 National Academies report indicates that extreme space weather events, "though rare, are likely to occur again some time in the future."  However, a re-occurrence of an 1859-magnitude space weather storm could disrupt todayÆs society to a much greater degree than in 1859 due to the proliferation of vital but vulnerable electrotechnologies.  Interruptions to radio communications, commercial airline flight plans, satellite operations, transportation, banking, financial systems, home and industrial computer electronics, and electric power grids are just some examples.  The National Academies report estimates the overall economic cost of one such extreme event as ranging from millions to trillions of dollars, with a recovery time of 4 - 10 years.  The goal of our research was to improve our knowledge of the effect of space weather on the Earth-ionosphere waveguide (within about +/- 100 km in altitude from the EarthÆs surface) and specifically on the operation of electric power grids.   The outcomes of this project were two-fold:  (1)  Using global MaxwellÆs equations models, we discovered a new physics mechanism for the coupling of space-weather-induced ionospheric currents to electric power grids. Namely, we demonstrated that space weather-induced transient ionospheric current pulses lead to momentary intra-ionosphere charge displacements with the potential to produce high voltages on overhead power transmission lines oriented in any way parallel to these ionospheric charge displacements.  Measurement data of extreme, transient ground-level electric fields have recently been observed. (2) We greatly advanced the capabilities of our global MaxwellÆs equations models of Earth-ionosphere waveguide applied to space weather events.  Our models now have the following robust attributes (the three starred items below are a direct result of this project):  Solve the full-vector MaxwellÆs equations  ** Model the entire Earth-ionosphere waveguide at resolutions up to 600 meters as needed (and even higher with sufficient computing resources). Include the global 3-D spatial material variations of the ionosphere, topography / bathymetry, lithosphere, geomagnetic field, disturbed ionospheric currents, etc. Calculate the complex shielding, shadowing, scattering, and diffraction of electromagnetic waves upon reaching the EarthÆs surface / other obstacles. Permit any number of observation points, and the ability to create movies of the propagating waves Model arbitrary time-varying source waveforms as well as time variations of the ionosphere composition (e.g. day versus night, etc.) Provide propagation results over a large spectral bandwidth via a discrete Fourier transform. ** Calculate all important ionospheric effects on signals, including absorption, refraction, phase and group delay, frequency shift, polarization, and Faraday rotation. ** Account as needed for variability in the electromagnetic fields due to uncertainties and variability in the ionosphere composition at various positions and altitudes   None of the existing analytical formulations or numerical approaches for studying space weather effects on electric power grids simultaneously solve the complete MaxwellÆs equations while also accounting for all of the 3-D geometrical details and realistic time variations as permitted by the PIÆs models.  The outcomes from this project in combination with future ongoing work may help individual power grid stations predic...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
