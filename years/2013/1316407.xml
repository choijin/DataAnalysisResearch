<AbstractNarration>This action funds Jerry Chen of San Diego State University to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan.  The project title is "What Makes a Neuron: Genetic Analysis of Essential Nervous System Genes in a Primitive Marine Invertebrate." The host scientist is Jr-Kai Yu in the Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Dr. Yu, the Fellow is using the marine invertebrate amphioxus to study the conservation, expression and interaction of the proneural transcription factors Pou4, NeuroD, MyTF and Ash, as well as the proneural microRNAs miR-9 and miR-124. Collectively, these genes are essential to nervous system development in humans, as several recent studies have shown that expression of these genes can convert human stem cells into functional neurons, and dysfunction of these genes results in various neurological diseases. Using DNA sequence alignment tools along with in situ hybridization, this project is determining the conservation and expression patterns of these genes in developing amphioxus embryos. The Fellow is also performing experiments eliminating the expression of each of these genes to determine how these genes interact with each other. Such experiments cannot be done in humans, which is the motivation for doing this work in amphioxus. And since the nervous system of amphioxus is similar to that of human, such genetic analyses give us insight into the how the human nervous system develops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, upon return to the U.S., the Fellow will present his research at local and national research conferences, and will also become actively involved in promoting specific collaborations with the research faculty and colleagues he meets in Taiwan.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>For the summer of 2013 I was awarded an NSF fellowship to perform research at Academia Sinica in Taiwan with Dr. Jr-Kai Yu. This was an excellent experience for me to conduct science research in a foreign country and in another language, and to gain perspective on the differences in how another culture approaches science. My research project involved identifying and characterizing the expression pattern of proneural gene homologs in the amphioxus <em>B. floridae</em>. This was important to determine the evolutionary history of nervous system development. It was also important for answering several questions for my own thesis on proneural gene expression in the tunicate <em>C. intestinalis.</em> Through a bioinformatics analysis, I was able to confidently identify 10 proneural gene homologs in <em>B. floridae</em>, and showed that the majority of these were well-conserved in mammals. I then cloned seven of these from the amphioxus genome, and then proceeded to perform <em>in situ hybridizations</em> to determine their expression pattern over development. Through this, I observed that, consistent with my findings in <em>C. intestinalis</em>, the important proneural factors <em>Acete-Scute Homolog </em>and <em>MyT1 </em>show pan-epidermal and PNS-specific expression, respectively, throughout development. At the end of the summer, I presented my findings at an Asian Developmental Biology conference held in Taichung, Taiwan, where I met many other international scientists in the field. In the future, I plan to work with local collaborators here at UCSD to continue characterizing the expression of other proneural genes in amphioxus. I am also continuing to work on a collaborate project with Dr. Yu on using high-throughput RNA sequencing to perform transcriptome-wide expression profiling over the entire amphioxus life cycle. These two projects should lead to high-impact publications in the developmental biology field. Finally, given the rise of the economy in China and other neighboring countries, this work was very important for fostering international collaborations with researchers in East Asia. International scientific collaboration is something I am passionate about and will continue fostering while I continue my research work in the United States.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/01/2014<br>      Modified by: Jerry&nbsp;S&nbsp;Chen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
