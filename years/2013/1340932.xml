<AbstractNarration>High performance data networks are critical infrastructure for researchers and educators who rely on unimpeded access to remote instrumentation, massive data sets and distant collaborators to achieve objectives in science and engineering fields. This project builds a high-performance research network at the University of Dayton to provide unimpeded connections to other research institutions via state and national high-capacity networks. The project expands the campus network from 1Gb to 10Gb and establishes science DMZs in four science and engineering facilities across the campus, providing researchers with new capabilities. Research initiatives link researchers with colleagues and students for: (1) education and outreach initiatives at Sinclair Community College and regional high schools, (2) remote instrumentation access at The Ohio State University, (3) climate research remote processing at the Ohio Supercomputer Center, and (4) collaborative sensors research at Central State University (a historically black university). This network expansion connects the University at 10Gbps to Internet2 and OARnet's IntraOhio (both running at 100Gbps). Additionally, the University of Dayton is utilizing perfSONAR monitoring to measure and document the performance of the science DMZs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key upgrades for this project include installing science DMZ edge hardware and upgrading distribution and access layers at the University of Dayton, and hardware upgrades for science DMZ connections at Central State University. These improvements enable our scientists and engineers to better connect, collaborate, and share science data, provide robust STEM educational outreach, contribute to high-value workforce development and create cost-effective models for sharing scarce scientific resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ High performance data networks and high speed data flow are the life blood of the modern research university. This critical infrastructure is essential to the work of researchers and educators who must rely on unimpeded access to remote instrumentation, rapid movement of massive data sets and high fidelity interaction with distant collaborators. This capability enables researchers and educators to achieve their research objectives in the increasingly competitive and demanding fields of science and engineering.  The overall strategic goals of this project were to enable high performance end-to-end access to dynamic data networking services so as to enhance key science, engineering and research locations across campus, as well as provide ongoing network capacity and services that will strengthen the UniversityÆs ability to effectively collaborate, compete and contribute to future research and educational outreach initiatives.  Five research and educational outreach initiatives were directly strengthened by this upgrade:  - Cross-institutional Nanotechnology STEM Education and Workforce Training via the state-wide 100Gbps IntraOhio network and commodity Internet in cooperation with Sinclair Community College (Dayton, OH) and regional high schools. (Co-PI Andrew Sarangan)  - Collaborative Research with Central State University (a historically black university) on Human Centric Intelligence, Surveillance &amp; Reconnaissance (ISR) Sensors and Advanced Image Analysis for Automatic Pipeline Threat Detection requiring network capacity for real-time massive data exchange and STEM outreach. (Co-PI Vijayan Asari)  - Ongoing research investigating patterns of precipitation change as a result of global climate change and projecting future precipitation changes utilizing massive data sets moving between the Ohio Supercomputer Center in Columbus, Ohio and the University of Dayton via the state-wide 100Gbps IntraOhio network. (Co-Pi Shuang-Ye Wu.  - Ongoing support of materials research initiatives through a resident science DMZ implementation enabling remote access and manipulation of instrumentation located at the Ohio State University (OSU) Electron Microscope Center.(Co-PI Charles Browning)  - Extension of Science DMZ connections to additional climate science labs and offices in Department of Geology to support the research of Dr. Umesh Haritashya.  His work on the humanitarian impact of earthquake-induced landslides, river blockages and related geohazards requires robust access to massive data sets provided by NASA, USAID, GLIMS and AmericaView.   The overriding goal of this project was to build a high-performance research network (commonly called a "Science DMZ) at the University of Dayton that provides unimpeded connections to other research institutions via state and national high capacity networks,   This outcome has enabled our scientists and engineers to better engage with colleagues and share science data regardless of its size or complexity. However, these initiatives go far beyond their core contribution to advancing scientific knowledge by also providing robust STEM educational outreach, contributing to high-value workforce development and creating cost-effective models for sharing scarce scientific resources.  Building and sustaining a network of this caliber is an important component in advancing a vision for a ubiquitous research infrastructure that is well-positioned to meet the challenges of a demanding and uncertain future.  As a result of this project, we are now seeing growing interest among our colleagues in data-science fields - particularly computer science and management information systems where "big data" research is beginning to emerge.    In addition, we are seeing opportunities for faculty to access existing massive data sets that are remotely accessible for both new studies and meta-analyses.  This research strategy is helping us rethink the role of the library as a resource for locating and accessing researc...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
