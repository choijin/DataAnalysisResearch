<AbstractNarration>This EArly Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award provides funding to explore the feasibility of using nanostructured particles and thin films as key components in a polymeric nanocomposite suitable for solar applications. The synthesis of the nanocomposite polymers will focus on key constituents in the polymer/nanoparticle matrix that have the potential to aid in the strategic placement of the functional molecules, i.e. chromophores, in a solar cell. This feasibility study will evaluate the photo conversion behavior of the nanocomposite, focusing on photoconductive atomic force microscopy and electrical characterization of bulk solar cell devices as well as examination of the topography and interfacial zones of the nanocomposite.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;If successful, the data from this study will provide guidance for the feasibility of water-based manufacturability of nanoparticle/conductive polymer thin film flexible solar materials, and will guide future research into fundamental studies of photovoltaic nanocomposite materials. The effort will contribute to the development of a new strategy for solar heterojunction materials that is based on the dispersion of customized nanoparticles within conductive polymer arrays using facile self-assembly within aqueous phases. An additional advantage is that the material system would be amenable to inkjet printing and roll-to-roll processing for flexible solar materials manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>

The synthesis of the nanocomposite polymers focused on key constituents in the polymer/nanoparticle matrix that have the potential to aid in the strategic placement of the functional molecules, i.e. chromophores, in a solar cell. This feasibility study evaluated the electrical behavior of the nanocomposite, focusing on conductive atomic force microscopy and electrical characterization of nanostructured materials as well as examination of the topography and interfacial zones of the nanocomposite.  The nanostructured composite material is synthesized using a facile, water-based process.  As such, the data from this study provides guidance for the feasibility of water-based manufacturability of nanoparticle/conductive polymer thin film flexible solar materials, and will guide future research into fundamental studies of photovoltaic nanocomposite materials.  An additional advantage is that the material system would be amenable to inkjet printing and roll-to-roll processing for flexible solar materials manufacturing.  The research activities supported by this study provided an opportunity for undergraduate students to participate in the synthesis and characterization of the nanocomposite materials.  Undergraduate chemistry and engineering students were afforded the opportunity to learn the principles behind and operation of various microscopy and electrical characterization instruments.  Research results from this effort were disseminated to the technical community via conference and invited presentations as well as through peer-reviewed journal publications.
