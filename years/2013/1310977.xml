<AbstractNarration>How does the natural world maintain its astonishing diversity, especially among species that directly compete with each other? Theory predicts that constant changes to the physical environment over time and space and the transition from one scale to another (smaller to larger space, shorter to longer time) can account for species coexistence. To date, this prediction lacks rigorous empirical tests. The proposed project will use multi-scale field experiments and mathematical modeling based on field data to test the hypothesis that smaller scale environmental variation promotes broad-scale coexistence between invasive and native desert winter annual plants in the Sonoran Desert. Researchers will combine stable isotope analysis, aerial photographs, and field experiments to quantify a key mechanism underlying coexistence and the maintenance of biodiversity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide a powerful model for scientists to conduct rigorous empirical tests on species coexistence across a broad spectrum of natural communities. Together with addressing a fundamental question in ecology, the project will foster an understanding of the dynamic nature of biological invasions, highlighting conditions under which an invasion is likely to cause problem. By informing land managers of those conditions, the project offers practical solutions to managing invasive species. The project is a collaboration between the University of Arizona and the US Marine Corps Air Station, Yuma, and results will be shared with military units and government agencies that must manage invasive species. This project will also train four undergraduate students, introducing them to the rigor and excitement of scientific discovery.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focuses on empirically understanding how variable environments affect the coexistence between competing native and invasive species. Environmental variation in time and space can provide opportunities to differentiate the temporal and spatial niche between competing species, thus promoting  their coexistence. However, little empirical work has been done to quantify exactly how much coexistence can be promoted by temporal or spatial niche differentiation. We found that in a community of desert winter annual plants, the native and invasive species differ significantly in their germination and growth responses to spatially and temporally variable environments. Therefore, there are strong preconditions for their coexistence. However, within the three year study period, within-species competition was generally weak due to dry conditions. The potential for spatial coexistence was therefore weak within those three years because for coexistence to occur, within-species competition has to be high enough that each species limits itself more than limiting other species.  We also found some critical weakness of Sahara mustard, one of the focal invasive species in this study. We found that Sahara mustard had extremely high germination fraction and extremely low survival rate of ungerminated seeds in sand flat habitat. A combination of a low germination fraction and a high seed survival rate is known as a bet-hedging strategy that can effectively buffer the adverse effect of hostile environments that are often unpredictable. Without adopting this strategy, Sahara mustard population in the sand flat habitat becomes highly sensitive to fluctuating environment and follows a boom and bust cycle. Nevertheless, the Sahara mustard population on the dune had a lower germination fraction and higher seed survival rate and therefore formed a mor e persistent local populaiton less sensitive to environmental fluctuation. This explains why Sahara mustard populations on dunes in other parts of the desert southwest are more persistent and often become a species of large impact. Those findings are crucial for designing cost-effective management plan to control this invasive species.  The project is a collaboration between the University of Arizona and the US Marine Corps Air Station, Yuma and Luke Air Force Base. The finding is being used by natural resource managers in these two military installations to develop a better management plan to control the invasion of Sahara mustard on the Barry Goldwater Military Range. The plan aims to protect the landscape scale habitat heterogeneity crucial for the coexistence between native and invasive annual plant species as well as to target Sahara mustard in years and places of greater population growth.  Moreover, the project has trained one Ph.D student, two field assistants (females with a bachelor's degree in Economics and a master degree in biology respectively), two lab assistants (both females with B.S. degree in biology related fields), and seven undergraduate assistants (five female and two male students, three of them are ethnic minorities) through work training as well as discussion session organized to enhance their understanding of theoretical ecology, its application to conservation, and the methods in statistical inference.  In general, the study fosters our understanding how habitat heterogeneity is connected with biodiversity maintenance, especially under the current threat of increasing incidence of biological invasions. It further emphasizes the importance of preserving habitat heterogeneity in order to maintain the health of the natural environment that we rely upon.
