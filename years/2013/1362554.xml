<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of US participants in the international conference "Perspectives of Modern Complex Analysis" that will be held July 21-25, 2014, at the Mathematical Research and Conference Center (MRCC) in Bedlewo, Poland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching theme of this event is the celebration of the many contributions of Alexandre Eremenko to mathematical analysis in general and to complex analysis in particular. The scientific program will cover a large number of topics, including the following: classical complex analysis and potential theory; iteration theory of real, rational, and entire functions; real algebraic geometry. There will be three plenary speakers: Mario Bonk, Misha Sodin, and Alexander Volberg. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The principal purpose for the project was to support researchers and students who are US citizens and permanent residents  to attend the international conference "Perspectives of Modern Complex Analysis" in the Stefan Banach Center in Bedlewo, Poland, July 21-25, 2014. The two PIs were among six members of an internationalorganizing committee, the other four members were from outside the US. The meeting centered on important areas in complex analysis, real algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics, providing an opportunity for a large interdisciplinary group of mathematicians and physicists to interact and learn from each other. The program included plenary lectures by world leaders in their respective areas, and many opportunities for informal seminars, since this facility is used exclusively for mathematically-based scientific meetings and conferences.  The residual funds were used by Purdue university almost exclusively to support graduate students and postdocs travel. Special emphasis was made on supporting women and minorities. The students selected were chosen to maximize the effect of this resource. All of them were involved in research related to analysis and its applications. In addition to presebting their own research and communnicating with prominent mathematicians, several students and postdocs supported by this grant had job interviews during the meetings they attended.
