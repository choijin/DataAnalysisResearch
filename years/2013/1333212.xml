<AbstractNarration>The PIs request funding to develop a rapid vertical profiling autonomous underwater vehicle with biogeochemical sampling capabilities. This system will add a new, and much needed, biological dimension to the GEOTRACES program, and would most likely become the central instrument for a GENOTRACES microbial and enzymes research initiative - ultimately enabling the global marine mapping of microbial DNA, RNA and proteins, including key biogeochemical enzymes. The PIs will develop a wireless water-column sampling technology: a 6000m rated autonomous vertical sampling vehicle with a high throughput sampling and sensing payload. The combination&lt;br/&gt;of rapid vertical transport, the 6000 m depth range, and the need to stop at numerous target depths represents a novel and significant engineering challenge and developing a vehicle capable of this task with the sampling capacity needed for GENOTRACES "-omic" sampling is the objective of this proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project leads oceanic sample collection into the future where they will need to be collected from a variety of autonomous platforms. This is of great societal importance because understanding the ocean, its sheer magnitude, and its role in global processes will require more than ships and moorings, it will take samples from many parts of the ocean and their analysis by many techniques for many different analytes. This project will also sponsor two consecutive teams of undergraduate female engineering students from Smith College's Picker Engineering Program during their senior engineering design course. This is seen as a real plus and an innovative outreach effort. The PI has very successfully done this in the past.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The most significant impact of this work is the creation of a new deep-diving underwater robot called Clio, designed specifically for the purpose of studying the microbiology and biochemistry of the world ocean. Clio can dive to a maximum depth of 6000 meters and return within hours, collecting and preserving samples along the way, samples that oceanographers can then use to measure the genetic and functional diversity of marine microorganisms as well as the nutrients that control that diversity.  In particular, Clio is capable of collecting "omics" samples (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics) that can reveal the inner workings of marine microbial ecosystems. Over the duration of this development project Clio went from a design on paper to a fully function system that successfully completed sea trials on July 9th 2017 and has been in operational use since that time. Sea trials off Woods Hole, MA, and a series of research cruises southeast of Bermuda have demonstrated Clio?s ability to rapidly collect and preserve samples that are comparable in quality to those collected by conventional means.  Whereas conventional sampling is labor intensive and requires the use of a research ship?s winch and wire, Clio operates autonomously, acting as a force-multiplier that allows the research vessel to conduct other scientific activities while Clio dives.  In some cases Clio may deliver samples superior to conventional methods.  For example, Clio can hold depth to within a few centimeters enabling it to precisely target finely structured biological layers too thin to reliably sample from a ship, where wave-induced motion causes wire-mounted samplers to move rapidly up and down many meters. Overall, this project shows that Clio is an effective method of autonomously collecting samples for microbiological and biogeochemical studies. The results pave the way for the use of Clio in new initiatives aimed at characterizing how microbial communities vary across the world?s oceans and their physical and chemical gradients.
