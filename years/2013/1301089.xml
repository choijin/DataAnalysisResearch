<AbstractNarration>This award establishes a new Research Experiences for Teachers Site at Appalachian State University.  High school teachers and community college faculty from a ten county region surrounding the university will work on summer research with their university faculty mentors.  The research covers a range of computing disciplines including data analysis and mining, image processing and visualization.  The educators will also develop inquiry-based classroom modules and curricular materials related to their research and then implement the models in their classes during the academic year.  Workshops will be held to train additional teachers to use the materials.  The program hopes to build a community of educators that can work together to integrate computing concepts into STEM education in the participating school districts and to establish partnerships that continue to thrive and provide leadership to ensure quality computing education in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is in the research focus on data mining and visualization, two areas that are current and of importance to the computing disciplines. The university faculty has outstanding expertise and resources to lead the site.  The project team has significant related research and experience in educational applications and K-12 school outreach. The projects are compelling and current and of interest to the teachers and their students.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project include providing a quality research experience to teachers and the infusion of sound instructional models into the K-12 schools and community colleges. The project includes outreach to a large community of teachers in Appalachian region and should impact a student population in a rural area where there are limited opportunities for students.  The materials will be broadly disseminated for use by others.  The project has the potential to create a sustainable partnership between the university and schools thus benefiting the area for years to come.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We held three summer programs over the duration of the project in Summer 2013, 2014, and 2015.&nbsp;</p> <p>During the three summer programs, teachers worked in teams on 19 distinct image processing, visualization, or data mining research projects that solved different problems in STEM disciplines. For a list of all projects, please visit the main page of the RET program at <a href="http://www.cs.appstate.edu/ret/">http://www.cs.appstate.edu/ret/</a>. As our main web page shows, all teachers participated in research in teams of two, prepared technical papers, and final presentations that are all listed on the main page. The participants had a list of activities to complete as follow-up.&nbsp; Some funding and classroom resources were provided to them to make the post-workshop activities possible and we maintain contacts during academic years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Thirty-five high school teachers or community college faculty (17 female and 18 male) participated in our summer programs. The goal of our programs was to involve 12 high school teachers and community college faculty in STEM disciplines per year to participate in the program. As shown in Figure (1), we had a group of participants who taught different courses. Figure (2) illustrates the distribution of the summer participants.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the first year of the program, our aim was to target teachers in the Western region of North Carolina where Appalachian State University is located. Most of our participants came from the nearby counties (the Yellow circles on the map below) in Year 1. In Year 2, we expanded our recruitment efforts to the counties further out (the Green circles), and in the Year 3, we recruited teachers from a wider region and had participants from across NC (the Blue circles). As the distribution of summer program shows, we have successfully reached teachers from a wide geographical region in the state. Distribution of the RET Summer 2013, 2014, and 2015 participants across North Carolina is shown in Figure (2).&nbsp;</p> <p>It should be noted that ASU has a very small percentage of minority and underrepresented students (about 4%) so as the Watauga County home of ASU. Watauga County, despite being one of the poorest counties of the state, &nbsp;has a very small minority and underrepresented population. We tried to recruit and admit teachers from the underrepresented communities for the summer programs and had 8.6% Asian, 8.6% Black/African American, and 82.8% White. We acknowledge that it was challenging to recruit teachers from the minority and underrepresented groups to attend our summer programs. However, we had a better participation of minority and underrepresented when we held our workshops at a different location than ASU, particularly in more central to the state.</p> <p>During our summer programs, in addition to the research, participants learned to prepare course modules for their courses and created many of them during and after the summer programs. At the time of this report, we had more than 110 course modules in the Repository of Course Modules that are available to all teachers for adoption. These modules are used by the summer participants as well as the RET workshop participants more than 283 times. With an average class size of 25 students, this resulted in at least 7,075 student being exposed to CS or CS applications. The Course Module Usage report (<a href="http://www.cs.appstate.edu/ret">www.cs.appstate.edu/ret</a>) as of December 8, 2016 is shown in Figure (3).</p> <p><strong>Summary of achivements:</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p>* Summer participants were&nbsp;8.6% Asian, 8.6% Black/African American, and 82.8% White. There were 17 female and 18 male participants.</p> <p>* More than 111 course modules were created for classroom use that use CS applications or programs to teach a concept in one of the STEM disciplines or help solve a problem. The modules were used more than 283 times. Thus, with an average classroom size of 25, more than 7000 students have been exposed to our course modules. Module 25 which is on Scratch programming has been most frequently used in classrooms. Figure (3) illustrates the module usage.&nbsp;</p> <p>* Held five RET workshops with more than 111 participants which were&nbsp;8.1% Asian, 20.7% Black/African American, 1.8% Hispanic/Latino, and 69.4% White. &nbsp;Figure (4) illustrates the distribution of the workshop participants. Among the RET&nbsp;Workshop participants; 5.4% indicated that they taught CS/CIS 5.4%, 22.5% Math, 5.4% Math &amp; Science, 53.2% Science, 2.7% Technology, and 10.8% Other. (Figure (5))</p> <p>* Provided RET teachers classroom resources to help them lay the foundation for CS related work in their schools.</p> <p>* Established a strong RET community in North Carolina where teachers communicate their accomplishments through our Facebook page.</p> <p>* Helped with many out of classroom events that utilized CS applications or programs to provide exposure.&nbsp;</p>
