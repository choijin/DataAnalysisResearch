<AbstractNarration>In this project co-funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program-A  and the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Michael Mirkin of the City University of New York, Queens College is developing new methodologies and employing them for studying electrochemical reactions on the nanoscale.  Single gold nanoparticles are dispensed from a glass or carbon nanopipette and delivered precisely to the desired location on the sample surface.  This methodology is useful for applications ranging from surface patterning to controlled reagent delivery to biological cells. This project will provide research opportunities to high school students and undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the proposed research is on the combining resistive-pulse technique with the scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM) for controlled delivery of nanoparticles.  The resistive-pulse setup enables monitoring of single particles passing through the pipette orifice, and the SECM is used for pipette positioning and surface patterning.  The particles are immobilized on the carbon surface modified with a polyphenylene layer.  The developed methodology is also employed to study the dynamics of oxidative stress in activated macrophages.   Interferon-coated fluorescent nanoparticles and platinized carbon nanoelectrodes are inserted in activated macrophages and their vacuoles to characterize and quantify the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.  The broader impacts of this work include the development of useful research tools for nanotechnology and cell biology.  The experiments with macrophages may help elucidate the mechanisms of oxidative stress, which are of great significance for the immune system and related diseases, including cancer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The most important outcome of this project is a major (more than an order of magnitude) increase in resolution of electrochemical imaging.  The attained spatial resolution of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), higher than 5 nm, exceeded that of "superresolution" optical methods and enabled topography imaging and reactivity mapping of individual catalytic nanoparticles.  The possibility of novel SECM experiments based on tunneling between the tip and a nanoparticle was demonstrated.  This approach potentially can improve the lateral SECM resolution to ~1 nm and allow one to investigate catalytic processes at metal nanoparticles with no direct ohmic contact. New methodologies have been developed for measuring electron-transfer kinetics using nanometer-sized electrodes and SECM.  First unambiguous evidence of the electrical double-layer effect on the electron transfer at nanointerfaces was obtained.  The reliability of kinetic measurements at nanoelectrodes was improved by obtaining steady-state voltammograms with both oxidized and reduced forms of redox species initially present in solution (for more reliable curve fitting), characterizing the nanoelectrode geometry with the AFM, and using water with an ultra-low level of organic contaminants.  These improvements allowed us to reevaluate kinetic parameters previously measured for several rapid outer-sphere reactions.  Carbon nanopipettes and nanoelectrodes produced by chemical vapor deposition of carbon inside a pulled quartz capillary were shown to be suitable for a wide range of electrochemical and sensing applications.  Our experiments in carbon pipettes and numerical simulations revealed a new physicochemical phenomenon: the electron-transfer gated ion transport in conductive nanocapillaries.  Open carbon pipettes were shown to have potential for ultrasensitive measurements of dopamine and other charged analytes.  Flat FIB-milled carbon nanoelectrodes were developed as SECM tips.   Several methodologies for single-entity electrochemical measurements were developed, including resistive-pulse sensing and nanoparticle collision experiments.  Multiple collisions of just one nanoparticle with the electrode surface were monitored by capturing it inside a conductive nanocavity.  This approach allowed us to investigate the evolution of the nanoparticle response in a series of successive collisions and the effects of nanoconfinement on collision dynamics.  Resistive-pulse sensing of a cancer biomarker (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-C) was accomplished using antibody-modified Au nanoparticles.  Additionally, the resistive-pulse control enabled localized delivery of the exact number of nanoparticles from a nanopipette.   This project provided opportunities for multidisciplinary research to four graduate students, one undergraduate student, and four postdoctoral fellows.  They were trained in mechanistic electrochemistry, bioanalytical chemistry, and nanoscience.  These students gave oral and poster presentations at national and international meetings and participated in preparation of research papers and reports.  They also performed joint research with our collaborators at &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure (France), University of Connecticut, University of Pittsburgh and Brookhaven National Laboratory.  One student obtained a PhD and started postdoctoral studies, and one obtained an M.S. degree.  A visiting student from China has been doing research in the PI's laboratory closely related to this project.  One postdoctoral fellow obtained an academic position.  A high school student spent one summer and a fall semester doing research in the PI's laboratory.       Last Modified: 01/08/2018       Submitted by: Michael Mirkin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
