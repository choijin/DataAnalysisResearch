<AbstractNarration>This EAGER project is engaged in the initial development of a postsecondary educational attainment data dashboard.  It is organizing and analyzing available data from multiple existing sources to provide an annotated and coherent set of STEM metrics that can be used over time.  The dashboard integrates issues that are often separated, such as high school graduation, college enrollment and postsecondary attainment, with a particular focus on those underrepresented in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will take advantage of all existing data sources, and with expert input, create a web-based platform on STEM educational attainment for use by evaluators, researchers, and policymakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the risks are substantial (both technically and methodologically), there will be significant value if the project succeeds in creating coherence around STEM educational attainment.</AbstractNarration>

This project analyzed and integrated data on educational attainment from a variety of sources. In our report, Educational Attainment: Understanding the Data (http://gsehd.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Educational_Attainment_FINAL_Report_4.27.pdf) and a recent article in Change Magazine, we present and interpret data on five aspects of educational attainment: variation across states; comparisons across racial and ethnic groups; comparisons across age groups; gender gaps in STEM attainment; completion versus attainment;  We highlight differences in the populations, methodologies, and definitions across data sources used to addresses each issue. For example, states rank differently depending on whether the measure is any postsecondary degree or a bachelorÆs degree or higher; college enrollment rates vary depending on whether the base is all 18-to-24-year-olds or only those who have graduated from high school.  In the case of comparisons across racial /ethnic groups, attainment rates for all whites are lower than those for non-Hispanic whites; combining Asians and Pacific Islanders conceals sharp differences between the two; and one of the two main sources of data on this issue includes individuals who are incarcerated or living in military barracks, while the other excludes these populations.  Frequently voiced concerns about lower educational attainment among younger age groups ignore the reality a significant number of people earn credentials at older ages. TodayÆs 25-to-34-year-olds have higher levels of attainment then older groups did at the same age. The gender gap in degree attainment in basic sciences, engineering, and mathematics disappears if the medical professions and science and engineering technology fields are included in the definition of STEM. And educational attainment&mdash;the percentage of the population having achieved each level of education&mdash;is not the same as completion rates, which measure how man people who enroll complete the programs they begin.  The types of data issues highlighted in this study are relevant for many other issues. Our analysis should call attention to the care needed to interpret data, particularly for the purpose of developing public policies.
