<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to create an RCN-UBE network for the purpose of providing faculty development activities at several historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in Alabama. The HBCU-Alabama Biosciences Network (HBCU-ALBN) will be a community of biologists and life scientists from all ranks, diverse experiences, pedagogical approaches and scientific training who will be willing to adopt and explore recommended curriculum changes in undergraduate science education that are much needed in the HBCU system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virtual and in-person planning meetings by the Steering Committee will proceed a workshop planned for the summer of 2014 at Alabama State University. Network activities will provide a forum to exchange examples of reforms that are underway and will challenge other faculty to incorporate active learning approaches in their classes to better engage students.  For example, faculty will consider using case studies to demonstrate the everyday relevance of what students learn in life science courses, encourage cooperative learning among students, and explore the use of new technologies in the classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project lie in forming a network of faculty at HBCUs who want to adopt student-centered approaches in the classroom to better engage students.  Courses for both majors and non-majors will be the focus of network activities to improve biological literacy of all students and retention of students interested in biology. Currently there is no central association of life science faculty at HBCUs in Alabama for them to share resources and information to improve undergraduate biology education.  This RCN-UBE network plans to form such a network that could serve as a model for other HBCUs and community colleges in other states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education in support of efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes:                  The RCN-UBE Incubator Project: HBCU-ALBN, Network of Biologists and Life Science Educators for Vision and Change in the Curriculum achieved its goal of establishing the first HBCU-ALBN Network of biologists at Alabama State University (ASU) on October 31, 2014. Two core planning meetings were held with the advisory members at Alabama State University before the HBCU-ALBN workshop.  Nine institutions in higher education made up this Network: Alabama State University, Montgomery, AL (host institution), Alabama Agricultural &amp; Mechanical University (Huntsville, AL), Concordia College (Selma, AL), Oakwood University (Huntsville, AL), Selma University (Selma, AL), Stillman College (Tuscaloosa, AL), Talladega College (Talladega, Al), Trenholm State Technical Community College (Montgomery, AL) and Tuskegee University (Tuskegee, AL).  Two local high school science teachers, Robert E. Lee High School and Carver High School (Montgomery, AL), were invited as a part of our outreach activities for K-12.  Pre- and post- survey results indicated that HBCU-ALBN faculty major concerns were lack of resources, faculty development opportunities and resources to develop technology and innovative teaching strategies in the classroom.  The workshop offered 4 active learning and technology sessions for the newly formed HBCU-ALBN Network.  These sessions included:  Dr. Patricia Marsteller, Director, Center for Science Education and Science Case Network, Emory University (Problem-Based learning &amp; Case Studies in the classroom); Dr. Kenley Obas, College of Education and Technology expert, ASU (TED Talks, presentation); Dr. Sabita Saldanha, Department of Biological Sciences, ASU, (Online Classroom technology-CONNECT); Dr. Manoj Mishra, Department of Biological Sciences &amp; Director of Freshman Biology Lectures and Laboratories, (CLICKERS: Use in the Classroom).  Other outreach efforts included Dr. Diann Jordan and Dr. Roberta Troy being interviewed by WSFA, a local TV station, and WVAS, Alabama State University?s public radio station.  Beyond the host campus workshop, Network members were provided opportunities to attend various conferences and workshops.  These conferences included local, state, regional, national and international conferences:  the Alabama Academy of Sciences (University of West Alabama, Livingston, AL), Southeastern Regional PULSE Institute (various locations), Gordon Meeting (Conference in Maine) on Undergraduate Education in the Life Sciences, Gender Summit on STEM research in South Korea, RCN-UBE Summit (Washington, DC), and ASU President?s Summit on STEM Education.  These conferences provided networking opportunities for the HBCU-ALBN members.  Due to the funding from this Incubator grant, Alabama State University has now become a part of the Southeastern Regional Pulse Institute (SERP) in 2014 and has been invited to present on departmental transformations in biology in the 2015 and 2016 meetings.  Our sister institution, Talladega College (also a part of the HBCU-ALBN Network) has joined the SERP Institute in 2016.  The PULSE mission is to provide undergraduate life sciences departmental transformations aligned with current education reform reports, including the Vision and Change Report, that will lead to a more inclusive, student-centered and evidence-based teaching (www.pulsecommunity.org).  These Incubator project goals tied directly to other national initiatives to improve faculty skills and provide opportunities for under-represented groups to implement more inclusive recruitment and retention strategies in STEM fields.  The Incubator project laid the framework for developing an HBCU Network for biologists and life science educators, thus filling a void in networking and faculty development opportunities for its members.
