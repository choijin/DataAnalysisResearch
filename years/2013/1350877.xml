<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Nathaniel Szymczak of The University of Michigan will develop transition metal complexes capable of cooperative interactions with metal-coordinated substrates for bond activation and functionalization reactions. The work seeks to provide fundamental insights into how small molecules, such as H2, can be activated with assistance from Lewis acid and base sites in the secondary coordination sphere of a metal complex. The study  targets pincer-based metal-ligand scaffolds that feature pendent borane and amine sites. These will be selected to confer a highly polarized secondary coordination sphere environment that will bias the system toward heterolytic bond activation/transfer reactions. The directed delivery of H-E (E=H, SiR3, BR2) is a goal. The Educational Plan involves the development of an authentic research design approach to teaching undergraduate lab courses. Hypothesis-driven experimentation, which simulates a real-world research environment, will be incorporated into both lower and upper level undergraduate laboratory courses. This should better prepare students for careers in STEM fields. The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits from the discovery of low-energy chemical conversion strategies. These may ultimately be adapted to earth-abundant metals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydrogenation reactions are among the widest used catalytic reactions, encompassing many industrial sectors, including petrochemical, food, and pharmaceutical production. This project focuses on the development of transition metal compounds that contain multiple reactive sites in order to promote otherwise difficult hydrogenation reactions of chemical feedstocks. By using a system with highly modular units, synthetic catalysts are targeted that are ultimately scalable, promote highly specific chemical reactions applicable to many fields, generate minimal waste, and contain earth-abundant metals. The educational component will provide interdisciplinary training for undergraduate and graduate students to prepare them for careers in teaching, in industrial chemistry, at a national lab, or in public policy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Intellectual Merit  One of the central hypotheses in our NSF CAREER proposal is that by modifying substituents in a ligand’s secondary coordination sphere, a catalyst could be engineered to promote a bifunctional activation pathway.

This effect affords extremely rapid catalytic rates, in many cases with unique selectivity compared to unmodified catalysts.  During efforts to understand the reactivity effects of Lewis acid/base interactions, we made an important discovery that relates to how Lewis acidic sites can be used to stabilize reactive carbanions while promoting facile transfer. We uncovered a new strategy to use fluoroform (HCF3), a waste byproduct of Teflon manufacturing, as a transferrable source of CF3- by using appropriately selected Lewis acids (hexamethylborazine) and bases (derived from NaH). Our design strategy established that boron Lewis acids exhibit highly tunable acidities that span over 30 orders of magnitude for forming a CF3-boron adduct. Equilibration of boron/base adducts is critical for the success of the overall reaction, and following CF3- transfer to a substrate, the Lewis acid is regenerated. We demonstrated that trifluoromethylation using this approach is very broad in scope: elements from 7 groups of the periodic table and a diverse array of organic compounds were rapidly trifluoromethylated.          In addition to using fluoroform as a reactant, we found that the Lewis acid/base approach is general to other fluoroalkanes including CF2H2, HC2F5, and HCF2Ar. We discovered that the affinity of most -CF2Ar groups for Me6B3N3 is roughly the same as CF3-, which indicated the system that was initially optimized for CF3- should directly translate to the widely available class of difluoromethylarenes. As a result, we showed the first examples of deprotonation of HCF2Ar molecules to afford isolable -CF2Ar reagents.
