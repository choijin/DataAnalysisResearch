<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Alexandru Asandei of the University of Connecticut will develop new methods towards the controlled synthesis of fluorinated (co)polymers with complex architectures.  First, convenient reaction conditions for the small scale polymerization of fluorinated monomers will be explored, and novel initiating methods, such radical generation directly from (fluoro)alkyl halides or hypervalent iodides, will be studied.  Second, the development of catalyzed iodine degenerative transfer controlled radical polymerization of vinylidene fluoride to obtain "living"-like, narrow molecular weight distribution fluoropolymers will be examined.  Third, the utility of the proposed chemistry will be demonstrated via the synthesis of well-defined, fluoromaterials with complex architectures.  The broader impacts include advanced training for graduate and undergraduate students, collaborations with high school teachers on the development of a workshop with hands-on experimental work related to polymers and nanotechnology, dissemination via social media of the demonstrations developed in the workshop, and the broad dissemination of research results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polymers are long chain organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life that utilize plastics, including food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and lightweight electronic devices.  Polymers that contain the element, fluorine, (fluoropolymers) are versatile specialty plastics used anywhere from nonstick coatings, pipe liners, and O-rings for rocket engines to materials for fuel cell membranes. This research seeks to advance our knowledge in the synthesis of fluoropolymers and could lead to new types of advanced materials for a wide range of applications.</AbstractNarration>

These materials are based on a variety of chemical structures and architectures, and are available as homopolymers, as well as random and block copolymers, especially for conventional monomers such as styrene, acrylates, dienes, etc., with well-established production technologies.   Conversely, while fluoropolymers represent &lt; 1% of the polymer market (yet ~ $2 billion/year in the US alone), they display outstanding properties including high thermal, chemical, ageing and weather resistance, low surface energy, refractive index, flammability and moisture absorption, and especially piezo/ferro electroactive behavior and high dielectric constants (e.g. poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVDF), which drives their use as high-performance specialty materials with high end applications in the chemical, medical, electronic, defense, aviation and aerospace industries, as coatings and paints, transmission fluids, pipe liners, antifouling layers, membranes for fuel cells or protein immunoblotting, O-rings for extreme temperatures, sensors, actuators, transducers, high power capacitors, optical fibers, binders for Li-ion batteries etc.  These, and novel, emerging properties can be tailored and significantly enhanced by the ability to polymerize fluoroalkenes in a controlled fashion, and especially by the synthesis of well-defined fluorinated block copolymers and of other complex architectures.   However, due to the difficulties associated with the gaseous state and special reactivity of fluoroalkenes, only their homo- or random copolymers are currently available.  Indeed, the low VDF boiling point (-84 &deg;C) and the high typical polymerization temperatures imply the use of costly metal reactors which are impractical for high throughput catalyst optimization and for the development of novel chemistry for the controlled radical polymerization (CRP) and for the synthesis of PVDF block copolymers.  As such, the absence of relevant synthetic chemistry has resulted in a vast lag vs. conventional monomers with respect to the study and understanding of their self-assembly, and of the properties and applications thereby derived. Therefore, its development, the synthesis of sophisticated fluoropolymer structures and the mapping of the resulting fluoromaterials genome remains a commendable and challenging effort. The successful elaboration of such enabling chemistry constituted the major goal of this project, which we have recently summarized in Chem. Rev. 2016, 116, 2244-2274.  In terms of intellectual merit, our first successfully concluded aim was to develop reliable room temperature (rt), low-pressure polymerization methods that permit the safe use of glass tubes.  Here, as many small-scale reactions can be carried out concurrently and under visible light photocatalysis, this approach afforded dramatic experimentation cost savings and efficiency increase for fast catalyst optimization.  An exhaustive survey of the effect of reaction parameters including solvent (&gt; 40 solvents), temperature (0-100 C), reagent ratios, and of the structure-property relationship with respect to the nature of the metal catalyst (&gt; 20) and of the (fluoro)alkyl halide initiator (&gt; 50) etc. has enabled us to select photolyzable metal carbonyl dimers (e.g. Mn2(CO)10), alkyl carbonates (e.g. CH3-O-CO-O-CH3) and (fluoro)alkyl halides and respectively, perfluoroalkyl iodides (e.g. I-(CF2)6-I) as the preferred catalyst, solvent and initiators for the free radical and respectively, the controlled radical VDF polymerizations.  As an alternative metal-free method, we have introduced the inexpensive hypervalent iodide derivatives such as (CF3COO)2IPh as novel radical photoinitiators that also afford the CRP of VDF in the presence of iodine.  These polymerizations proceeded via the iodine degenerative transfer (IDT) mechanism in a controlled fashion, as evidenced by a linear dependence of molecular weight on conversion, moderate polydispersity, suppression of side reactions (e.g. head-to-head  &ndash;CH2-CF2-CF2-CH2-CH2-CF2- defects), and by the high PVDF-I iodine chain end functionality.  Having mapped the controlled PVDF synthesis, in the second stage of the project we turned our attention to the preparation of well-defined PVDF blocks. Here, an unprecedented in-depth kinetic and NMR study of the dependence of the nature of the PVDF-I chain ends on conversion revealed that in both the metal- or hypervalent iodine mediated VDF-IDT polymerizations, the reactions proceed with a continuous decrease in the concentration of the active PVDF-CH2-CF2-I and respectively, a continuous increase in the concentration of the unreactive PVDF-CF2-CH2-I chain ends.  Therefore, the most important problem to be solved was the quantitative radical activation of both types of PVDF-I chain ends.    A wide variety of photoactive metal catalysts and reaction conditions were exhaustively surveyed and rationally selected to subsequently provide the first examples of well-defined PVDF block copolymers with styrene(s), (meth)acrylates, vinyl acetate, dienes etc. which were synthesized and thoroughly characterized.  The broader impact of this project was illustrated by the active involvement in research, training and mentoring of both undergraduate and graduate students (including female and minorities), and by the broad dissemination of the results in high impact journals, as well as at national and international meetings and by invited lectures at US and international universities.
