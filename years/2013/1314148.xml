<AbstractNarration>This grant supports research to complete the determination of the weak charge of the proton and investigate new aspects of the Standard Model of fundamental matter and interactions. The Standard Model describes three of the four forces of nature in an elegant manner; those three forces are the electromagnetic interaction, the weak interaction, and the strong interaction. The weak charge of the proton is a basic property, like its electric charge and mass, which determines the proton's response to the weak interaction. It is also related to how the weak and electromagnetic interactions mix with each other. Because the Standard Model predicts how that mixing varies with the amount of momentum that is exchanged in an interaction, a precise measurement of the proton's weak charge at a low value of momentum transfer is a rigorous test of the Standard Model. Additionally, it is sensitive to physics not yet included in the Standard Model. The research program of this award also includes measurements of semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering that is sensitive to charge symmetry breaking at the quark level and further extends our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;fundamental interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research group supported by this grant will re-commission the Mott polarimeter at Jefferson Lab. That polarimeter will measure the alignment of electron spins in the electron beam of Jefferson Lab; knowing that alignment is crucial to providing polarized electron beams to the four experimental halls of the Lab. Both hardware and software issues will be addressed in this project so the student and postdoctoral researchers will gain a wide range of valuable skills. These broader impacts on the polarized program of Jefferson Lab and the training of young scientists are interwoven into the research program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Qweak experiment at Jefferson Lab involves parity-violating electron scattering from a proton target as a means of measuring the weak charge of the proton.  This quantity is related to the weak mixing angle for which there are firm predictions within the Standard Model and a particular dependence as a function of momentum transfer (the "running" of the weak mixing angle).  The results of the multi-year Qweak experiment comprise one of the most precise measurements to date, and these results are entirely consistent with the predictions of the Standard Model.  The precision of this work has enabled tight constraints to be imposed on semi-leptonic parity-violating contributions to physics beyond the Standard Model.  The Proton Radius Puzzle is the difference between the radius of the proton when measured with electrons, as oppposed to that when measuring with muons.  MUSE will be the first measurement to measure elastic muon scattering on the proton with sufficient precision to address the Proton Radius Puzzle.  This funding support enabled finalization of the design for MUSE by financing the acquisition, setup and installation of electronics which were used to prepare for the final experiment and read out the prototype test detectors.  Broader Impacts: The work on the Qweak project was carried out by a collaboration involving one PhD student.  The work on MUSE was carried out by a collaboration involving one PhD student and two postdoctoral research fellows.  In both projects, the participants gained experience in modern data acquisition systems, experimental operations, data analysis methods, and project management.
