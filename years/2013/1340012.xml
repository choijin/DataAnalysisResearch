<AbstractNarration>Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) is providing scholarships for 22 students, including 12 STEM majors, each receiving two years of support and 10 Masters of Teaching students, each receiving one year of support.  The program also provides stipends for 12 master science and math teachers who serve as Noyce Teaching mentors.  Using the existing infrastructure of the successful Phase I VCU Noyce Initiative, this Phase II also is providing funds for internships for Pre-Teacher education students from J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College (JSARCC) in an effort to encourage additional students to enter the STEM teacher pipeline.  The program is also providing two years of induction support which provides a professional learning community and programming activities to enhance instructional and leadership skills and assist in the professional development of the new teachers.  The support during the first two critical years of service is likely to result in increased teacher retention in high-need districts within the target area:  high-need schools in the Richmond Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).  The project is providing needed information on the use of culturally-responsive pedagogy and collecting and qualitatively analyzing the efficacy of instruction using a cultural competency framework.  The creation of a culturally responsive classroom ecology framework can be used both as a planning tool for instructing pre-service and in-service math and science teachers in high-need districts and used as an analytical tool for conducting research on teaching in high-need settings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The major goal of the Phase II Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Noyce Initiative was to increase the number and retention of highly effective, diverse secondary science and mathematics (math) teachers in high-need districts in the metro-Richmond area. This goal will be achieved by providing Noyce Scholars with financial support, a collaborative support network, and Master?s degree program geared toward leadership in the field.    To aide in recruitment, we offered one week summer internships to 18 undergraduates (30+ applications) and three of these undergraduates pursued MT degrees through VCU Noyce Phase II.    We prepared and graduated 33 MT science and 11 MT mathematics Scholars. 33 of these Scholars continue to teach with 29 of the Scholars continuing to teach in high-need school districts. A key component of the program was and continues to be the preparation of candidates that are highly qualified culturally competent science and math teachers. Our districts provided support with placements for practica and student teaching. This collaboration with the Richmond MSA School Districts provided additional highly qualified science and math teachers and professional development for in-service science and math teachers.     Our process for selection, training, and certification of Teaching Mentors allowed us to standardize the selection of mentors and maintain quality. This selection process can be used by teacher education programs to critically select classroom teachers for service as cooperating teachers to student teachers.     A two year induction program during the Scholars first two years of teaching are held. These meetings were held monthly and provided Scholars with an opportunity for problem-solving and celebration of success. These protocols have helped our novice teachers work through issues they are facing in a safe environment with former classmates. Our attendance ranges from 3 to 12 per meeting. Some Scholars accept positions that are not near VCU  so they are not able to attend. 83% of the Scholars attended at least one induction meeting.     Furthermore, VCU Noyce Scholars and Teaching Mentors will bring into classrooms deep content knowledge and effective strategies for connecting STEM to the daily lives of diverse students and their communities impacting the lives of thousands of school children and their families during the duration of the grant and millions  of school children over their teaching career.    We have presented and shared posters at the SE Noyce Conferences 4 of the 5 years. We continue to analyze data on cultural competence, self-efficacy, the induction model, and retention of our graduates with paper submissions in the works.
