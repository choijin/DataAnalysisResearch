<AbstractNarration>As a capacity building effort to increase the pipeline of women security professionals, this project is working to build momentum toward a movement of proactive efforts to diversify the cybersecurity workforce. For the first time, Women in CyberSecurity (WiCyS) conferences are being organized. It is a unique effort to bring together women from different levels in academia, industry and government to promote recruitment, retention and progression of women in cybersecurity. Tennessee Tech University is leading this collaborative partnership with the National Centers for Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education at the University of Memphis and at Jackson State Community College. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from orchestrating the WiCyS conference, project activities include: development and deployment of "Discovering Cybersecurity" workshop for raising students, awareness of and interest in cybersecurity careers; development and deployment of "Facilitating Active Learning in Cybersecurity" workshop for faculty professional development, post-conference research apprenticeship in security for students; networking and mentoring platform through WiCyS online community. The project is assessing how its various activities contribute to increase: undergraduate women's awareness of and interest in pursuing further study in cyberseccurity, faculty expertise using active learning strategies to teach cybersecurity, female students' participation in security internships and security research experiences and female students' recruitment into the CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is to provide substance and practice that has the potential to be continually used to increase awareness as well as capabilities of a greater cybersecurity workforce, with special emphasis on women who are underrepresented in computing fields and especially in cybersecurity. Full participation of a diverse workforce is crucial to integrate more creativity and multi-perspective problem solving to shape technology in cybersecurity. As a part of the expected broader impact, this project contributes to increase in the ability of the United States higher education enterprise to produce diverse group of cybersecurity professionals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This overall project was a collaborative grant among three educational institutions. The primary goal was to provide training that would introduce females to the extensive options related to careers in cybersecurity.  The specific targets were females in high school and college  Th contribution of this portion of the grant was to measure some of the initial attitudes, perceptions, etc., of participants before some training was provided, compared with possible changes after the training.  The specific training was hands-on and showed the participants some of the ways that hacking occurs rather easily, as well as ways of recognizing it when it occurs.This training was not lengthy; it was completed in about one hour.  To measure the possible impact of this training on their perceptions of cybersecurity careers, a survey instrument was provided prior to the training and repeated at the end of the training.  Comparison results were very positive as to the effectiveness of the training.  The initial question asked about their level of knowledge regarding cybersecurity.  Most partipants at both educational levels indicated they had little or no knowledge.  However, the results after the training were primarily in the medium or fairly good knowledge levels.  Another question asked participants to indicate some specific areas of interest to them, e.g., programming, application development, penetration testing, website design, online testing for security/privacy, overall management of information security/privacy.  Again, the results after the training showed a considerable increase in areas of interest.  Participants were allowed to add other related topics of interest to them, and their additions clearly showed a career in this area might be of considerable interest.  Their other topics of interest the students added included cyber intelligence analyst, cybersecurity defense, hardware engineering, bioinformatics, and forensics.  These results indicate that a little training and introduction to possible careers in cyber security is quite effective in developing a potential female workforce.  This finding clearly suggests that women could be recruited effectively for this career field through providing them with a comfort level and awareness of the many options available.  Employers and educators could increase their representation of women students by developing programs that target them specifically, where possible.  This effort would reduce some issues seen in the past such as an assumption that women are not interested or not capable to pursue technology-related careers.  The findings have also shown a methodology that could be applied to people in other phases of their life; they do not need to be high school or college students and can be either male or female.  Greater efforts to provide initial encouragement to many underserved groups could be effective in increasing the number of potential employees who could work in the cybersecurity field.  An effort of this type would be likely to be well received by many employers and adapted to their greatest areas of need for skilled employees.
