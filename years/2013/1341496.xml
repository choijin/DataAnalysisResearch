<AbstractNarration>Current oceanographic interest in the interaction of relatively  warm water of the Southern Ocean Circumpolar Deep Water ( CDW) as it moves southward to the frigid waters of the Antarctic continental shelves is based on the potential importance of heat transport from the global ocean to the base of continental ice shelves. This is needed to understand the longer term mass balance of the continent, the stability of the vast Antarctic ice sheets and the rate at which sea-level will rise in a warming world. Improved observational knowledge of the mechanisms of how warming CDW moves across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is needed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding this dynamical transport, believed to take place by the eddy flux of time-varying mesoscale circulation features, will improve coupled ocean-atmospheric climate models. The development of the next generation of coupled ocean-ice- climate models help us understand future changes in atmospheric heat fluxes, glacial and sea-ice balance, and changes in the Antarctic ecosystems. &lt;br/&gt;A recurring obstacle to our understanding is the lack of data in this distant region. In this project, a number of subsurface profiling EM-APEX floats adapted to operate under sea ice will be launched on up to 4 cruises of opportunity to the Pacific sector during Austral summer. The floats will be launched south of the Polar Front and measure shear, turbulence, temperature, and salinity to 2000m depth for up to 2 year missions while following the CDW layer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary:  Melting rates of the Antarctic glaciers increase when warmer ocean water reaches the continental shelf and glacial grounding zones. This melting is accelerating and is the largest source of uncertainty in predictions of global sea level rise (currently ranging between 0.3 and 1.2 meters by the end of the century). In order to better understand the physical processes connecting offshore ocean heat in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to the ocean cavities under the floating Antarctic ice shelves, a multi-year field campaign was undertaken in the Amundsen Sea sector of Antarctica using EM-APEX profiling floats (measuring temperature, salinity, currents, and turbulent mixing) deployed from research vessels of opportunity.  The major goals were to (a) develop under-ice capability for the EM-APEX to allow operations in seasonally ice covered waters; (b) collect year-round profiles as well as ice draft timeseries in a data-poor region of the Antarctic seasonal ice zone; (c) explore the structure of the southernmost limb of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and its connectivity to the Antarctic continental slope and shelf--particularly as a conduit for warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) and its accompanying heat transport to the underside of the West Antarctic ice sheet.  Outcomes: Over 4 field seasons, the project was able to accomplish its goal of collecting a broad multi-year multi-season dataset spanning the geographical extent of the Amundsen Sea, including the splitting point between the Ross and Amundsen gyres and some of the continental shelf flows feeding the ocean cavities under the floating ice shelves.  Important results included the observations that:  (1) Thin ice observed by the floats over large areas of the Amundsen sea suggests formation primarily during calm conditions.  (2) Southward CDW flow is driven by the net upwelling volume transport but does not respond immediately to specific upwelling wind events. Instead, CDW is brought southward in episodic mesoscale eddies and jets.  (3) On the Antarctic continental shelf, substantial mixing and cooling of CDW occurs during its transit toward the ice shelves. Measurements of the rates of mixing, transit pathways, and residence times on the shelf are critical to determining the ultimate heat flux.  (4) The off-shelf seasonal cycle of upper layer temperature and salinity is driven by atmospheric cooling and heating along with evaporation, precipitation, ice formation and ice melting. This results in ocean responses to heat loss with potential feedbacks that could act to accelerate or slow the exchange of heat or gases.  (5) The floats recovered in Jan 2017 after 2 seasons under the ice had minimal damage (apart from the very fragile microstructure probe tips). This illustrates the overall robustness of autonomous measurements in the ice-ocean boundary layer.  (6) The velocity, water depth (from bottom contact), and magnetometer measurements from the EM-APEX can provide enhancements to navigation when GPS positions are unavailable, especially where there are strong east-west gradients in the geomagnetic field parameters.   Intellectual Merit:  The success of this project in collecting year-round profiles of shear, water properties, and ice draft in the Antarctic seasonal ice zone, together with the demonstrated capacity for long-term float survival, established ice contact as an effective method for future work in the region. The low-tech simplicity of a simple rod in protecting the top-end sensors, along with attention to minimizing the time spent in the potentially dangerous under-ice boundary layer, makes this innovation an important one despite the increased risk of breaking sensors (especially delicate microstructure probes) and occasional CTD data loss due to intake stoppage.  The project has already begun to have an impact on how observations are made in the ice covered waters around Antarctica, with a subsequent program of ours sending 4 EM-APEX under the Dotson Ice Shelf and the British Antarctic Survey deploying 2 EM-APEX in the southern Scotia Sea for a study of mixing processes and topographically-influenced circulation downstream of Drake Passage.   Broader Impacts:  Antarctic work has interdisciplinary applicability as well as high education and outreach potential. Because of the innovative nature of the project, major scientific impacts on the broader fields of Antarctic research (cryosphere, ecosystems, air-sea interactions, and gas exchange) are expected. When compared with and incorporated into ocean circulation models, the observations will lead to better understanding and simulation of the processes leading to sea level rise, especially through the risk of West Antarctic ice sheet collapse under future climate scenarios. The processes under study also impact predictions of Southern Ocean transport and mixing and how it will change ecosystems, global watermass properties, and air temperature.  The project provided seagoing experiential education to undergraduate students, postdocs, and APL field engineers (with 2 of the 4 field seasons led by early-career women) over its course. Additionally, both equipment and scientific content from the project formed the core of numerous public outreach presentations through the UW College of the Environment and the Pacific Science Center.
