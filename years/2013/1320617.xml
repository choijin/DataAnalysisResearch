<AbstractNarration>Big data leads to big challenges, not only in the volume of data but also in its dynamics and variety. Multiple descriptions about the same set of objects or events from different sources unavoidably lead to data or information inconsistency. Then, among conflicting pieces of data or information, it is crucial to tell which data source is reliable or which piece of information is correct. Accurate information is referred to as the truth and the chance of a source providing accurate information is denoted as source reliability or trustworthiness. The objective of this project is to detect truths without supervision, by integrating source reliability estimation and truth finding. A unified framework is developed to model complex trustworthiness factors, heterogeneous data types, incremental and parallel computation, and source and data dependencies so that truth and trustworthiness can be inferred from multiple conflicting sources of heterogeneous, disparate, correlated, gigantic, scattered, and streaming data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project makes tangible contributions to data integration, information understanding and decision making, and benefits many applications where critical decisions have to be made based on the correct information extracted from diverse sources. Research results of this project are integrated into course materials and projects, and into training students and new generation researchers, especially female and minority students.

From Truth Discovery to Trustworthy Opinion Discovery: An Uncertainty-Aware Quantitative Modeling Approach (Figure 1)</strong></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Most existing studies work on finding truth facts from conflicting claims.&nbsp; This is the first study to mine trustworthy opinions from a large set of deviated opinions. &nbsp;We treat trustworthiness of an opinion as a random variable, and use its distribution to describe consistency or controversy and propose an uncertainty-aware approach, KDEm (Kernel Density Estimation from Multiple Sources), which effectively evaluates the trustworthiness of opinions.&nbsp; The work has been published in KDD&rsquo;2016</p> <p><strong>2. SegPhrase and AutoPhase: Automated Mining of Quality Phrases from Massive Text Corpora (Figure 2)</strong></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>We have developed two phrase-mining algorithms, SegPhrase and AutoPhrase, which can automatically mine high-quality phrases in large text corpora, with little or no human training efforts.&nbsp; Segphrase relies only on 300 human provided labels (on whether a k-graph is a quality phrase) but Autophrase will need only a general knowledge-base such as Wikipedia, without any human dedicated labeling.&nbsp; The methods work in multiple languages (such as English, Spanish and Chinese wikis) and corpora of very different nature, such as DBLP, Yelp, and tweet data.&nbsp; It generates a large set of quality phrases with high precision and recall, and the algorithms are quite efficient.&nbsp; SegPhrase has been published at SIGMOD&rsquo;2015 and received the Grand Prize of 2015 Yelp Dataset Challenge.&nbsp; Both software packages are open sourced in Github and have attracted a lot of users both in academia and industry.</p> <p><strong>3. CoType: Joint Extraction of Typed Entities and Relations with Knowledge Bases (Figure 3)</strong></p> <p>We investigate joint extraction of typed entities and relations with<strong> </strong>labeled data heuristically obtained from knowledge bases (i.e., distant supervision).<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>As our algorithm for type labeling via distant supervision is context-agnostic, noisy<strong> </strong>training data poses unique challenges for the task. We propose a novel domain-independent<strong> </strong>framework, COTYPE, that runs a data-driven text segmentation<strong> </strong>algorithm to extract entity mentions, and jointly embeds entity mentions, relation<strong> </strong>mentions, text features and type labels into two low-dimensional spaces (for entity<strong> </strong>and relation mentions respectively), where, in each space, objects whose types are<strong> </strong>close will also have similar representations. COTYPE, then using these learned<strong> </strong>embeddings, estimates the types of test (unlinkable) mentions. &nbsp;We formulate a joint<strong> </strong>optimization problem to learn embeddings from text corpora and knowledge bases,<strong> </strong>adopting a novel partial-label loss function for noisy labeled data and introducing an<strong> </strong>object "translation" function to capture the cross-constraints of entities and relations<strong> </strong>on each other. &nbsp;Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness<strong> </strong>of COTYPE across different domains (e.g., news, biomedical), with an average of<strong> </strong>25% improvement in F1 score compared to the next best method. The research has been published at WWW 2017 and the package is open-sourced at GitHub.</p> <p><strong>4. MetaPAD: Meta Patten Discovery from Massive Text Corpora (Figure 4)</strong></p> <p>We propose a novel typed textual pattern structure, meta-pattern, and an efficient framework, MetaPAD, which discovers meta-patterns from massive text corpora.&nbsp; It develops a context-aware segmentation method to carefully determine the boundaries of patterns with a learnt patterns quality assessment function, which avoids costly dependency parsing and generates high-quality patterns.&nbsp; It identifies and groups synonymous meta-patterns from multiple facets&mdash;their types, contexts, and extractions. &nbsp;And it examines type distributions of entities in the instances extracted by each group of patterns, and looks for appropriate type levels to make discovered patterns precise. &nbsp;Experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework discovers high-quality typed textual patterns efficiently from different genres of massive corpora and facilitates information extraction, such as finding corporate leaders in companies or finding bacteria resistant to certain drugs from massive corpora. &nbsp;The research has been published at KDD&rsquo;2017</p> <p>5.&nbsp;<strong>TruePIE: Resolving Conflicts for Truth in Pattern-based Information Extraction (Figure 5)</strong></p> <p><strong></strong>We integrate truth-finding methodology with meta-pattern discovery method and propose a novel method, TruePIE, which resolves conflicts for true facts in pattern-based information extraction. TruePIE learns arity-constraints from data distribution of a seed pattern set and applies the constraints to tuples extracted from numerous pattern candidates of good content quality, which enables capturing conflicts, modeling the reliability of textual patterns, and finding true facts. We iteratively conduct the truth finding and pattern reliability modeling to mutually enhance each other. Experiments on a huge news dataset (over 25GB) demonstrate that our TruePIE is efficient and significantly outperforms baselines on each of the three tasks: true tuple extraction, reliable pattern extraction, and negative pattern extraction.&nbsp;&nbsp; The work has been submitted to WSDM 2018 for publication.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Jiawei&nbsp;Han</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1320617/1320617_10263193_1506822810603_Outcome-final-fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1320617/1320617_10263193_1506822810603_Outcome-final-fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="From Truth Discovery to Trustworthy Opinion Discovery: An Uncertainty-Aware Quantitative Modeling Approach"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1320617/1320617_10263193_1506822810603_Outcome-final-fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="From Truth Discovery to Trustworthy Opinion Discovery: An Uncertainty-Aware Quantitative Modeling Approach"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">We propose to mine trustworthy opinions from a large set of deviated opinions and this figure outlines the major ideas and results in our KDD'16 paper.</div> <div class="imageCredit">NSF IIS-1320617</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jiawei&nbsp;Han</div> <div class="imageTitle">From Truth Discovery to Trustworthy Opinion Discovery: An Uncertainty-Aware Quantitative Modeling Approach</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1320617/1320617_10263193_1506823062084_Outcome-final-fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1320617/1320617_10263193_1506823062084_Outcome-final-fig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Automated Phrase Mining (SegPhrase &amp; AutoPhase)"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1320617/1320617_10263193_1506823062084_Outcome-final-fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Automated Phrase Mining (SegPhrase &amp; AutoPhase)"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Our two phrase mining algorithms, SegPhrase and AutoPhrase, automatically mine high-quality phrases in large text corpora, with no/little human efforts, working in multiple languages, with high precision, recall, and efficiency.</div> <div class="imageCredit">NSF IIS-1320617</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jiawei&nbsp;Han</div> <div class="imageTitle">Automated Phrase Mining (SegPhrase & AutoPhase)</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1320617/1320617_10263193_1506823234319_Outcome-final-fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1320617/1320617_10263193_1506823234319_Outcome-final-fig3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CoType: Joint Extraction of Typed Entities and Relations with Knowledge Bases"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1320617/1320617_10263193_1506823234319_Outcome-final-fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CoType: Joint Extraction of Typed Entities and Relations with Knowledge Bases"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Our new algorithm, CoType explores joint embedding of entities and relations and outperforms many algorithms on entity/relation extraction and typing.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project NSF IIS-1320617 "III: Small: Collaborative Research: Conflicts to Harmony: Integrating Massive Data by Trustworthiness Estimation and Truth Discovery" has generated a lot of exciting results.  We outline five major ones (each associated with one figure, converted from a PowerPoint slide) as follows.  1. From Truth Discovery to Trustworthy Opinion Discovery: An Uncertainty-Aware Quantitative Modeling Approach (Figure 1)   Most existing studies work on finding truth facts from conflicting claims.  This is the first study to mine trustworthy opinions from a large set of deviated opinions.  We treat trustworthiness of an opinion as a random variable, and use its distribution to describe consistency or controversy and propose an uncertainty-aware approach, KDEm (Kernel Density Estimation from Multiple Sources), which effectively evaluates the trustworthiness of opinions.  The work has been published in KDD?2016  2. SegPhrase and AutoPhase: Automated Mining of Quality Phrases from Massive Text Corpora (Figure 2)   We have developed two phrase-mining algorithms, SegPhrase and AutoPhrase, which can automatically mine high-quality phrases in large text corpora, with little or no human training efforts.  Segphrase relies only on 300 human provided labels (on whether a k-graph is a quality phrase) but Autophrase will need only a general knowledge-base such as Wikipedia, without any human dedicated labeling.  The methods work in multiple languages (such as English, Spanish and Chinese wikis) and corpora of very different nature, such as DBLP, Yelp, and tweet data.  It generates a large set of quality phrases with high precision and recall, and the algorithms are quite efficient.  SegPhrase has been published at SIGMOD?2015 and received the Grand Prize of 2015 Yelp Dataset Challenge.  Both software packages are open sourced in Github and have attracted a lot of users both in academia and industry.  3. CoType: Joint Extraction of Typed Entities and Relations with Knowledge Bases (Figure 3)  We investigate joint extraction of typed entities and relations with labeled data heuristically obtained from knowledge bases (i.e., distant supervision).   As our algorithm for type labeling via distant supervision is context-agnostic, noisy training data poses unique challenges for the task. We propose a novel domain-independent framework, COTYPE, that runs a data-driven text segmentation algorithm to extract entity mentions, and jointly embeds entity mentions, relation mentions, text features and type labels into two low-dimensional spaces (for entity and relation mentions respectively), where, in each space, objects whose types are close will also have similar representations. COTYPE, then using these learned embeddings, estimates the types of test (unlinkable) mentions.  We formulate a joint optimization problem to learn embeddings from text corpora and knowledge bases, adopting a novel partial-label loss function for noisy labeled data and introducing an object "translation" function to capture the cross-constraints of entities and relations on each other.  Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of COTYPE across different domains (e.g., news, biomedical), with an average of 25% improvement in F1 score compared to the next best method. The research has been published at WWW 2017 and the package is open-sourced at GitHub.  4. MetaPAD: Meta Patten Discovery from Massive Text Corpora (Figure 4)  We propose a novel typed textual pattern structure, meta-pattern, and an efficient framework, MetaPAD, which discovers meta-patterns from massive text corpora.  It develops a context-aware segmentation method to carefully determine the boundaries of patterns with a learnt patterns quality assessment function, which avoids costly dependency parsing and generates high-quality patterns.  It identifies and groups synonymous meta-patterns from multiple facets&mdash;their types, contexts, and extractions.  And it examines type distributions of entities in the instances extracted by each group of patterns, and looks for appropriate type levels to make discovered patterns precise.  Experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework discovers high-quality typed textual patterns efficiently from different genres of massive corpora and facilitates information extraction, such as finding corporate leaders in companies or finding bacteria resistant to certain drugs from massive corpora.  The research has been published at KDD?2017  5. TruePIE: Resolving Conflicts for Truth in Pattern-based Information Extraction (Figure 5)  We integrate truth-finding methodology with meta-pattern discovery method and propose a novel method, TruePIE, which resolves conflicts for true facts in pattern-based information extraction. TruePIE learns arity-constraints from data distribution of a seed pattern set and applies the constraints to tuples extracted from numerous pattern candidates of good content quality, which enables capturing conflicts, modeling the reliability of textual patterns, and finding true facts. We iteratively conduct the truth finding and pattern reliability modeling to mutually enhance each other. Experiments on a huge news dataset (over 25GB) demonstrate that our TruePIE is efficient and significantly outperforms baselines on each of the three tasks: true tuple extraction, reliable pattern extraction, and negative pattern extraction.
