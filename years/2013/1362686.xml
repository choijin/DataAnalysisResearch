<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms-B (CSDM-B) Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Evgueni Nesterov of Louisiana State University is developing a new operational principle for amplifying fluorescent sensors using semiconducting polymers.  This program directly impacts one of the promising research and technological fields, organic optoelectronic and sensing materials, using highly sensitive and reliable detecting devices for important targets.  Materials to be studied include those with dual functions, for example, porous organic materials for simultaneous detection and detoxification of organophosphate warfare agents.  Participating students are trained in a multidisciplinary and collaborative fashion, preparing them to become highly competitive in the high-tech job market. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of this research program is to develop and study in detail the novel "higher energy gap" paradigm for controlling photophysical properties of fluorescent conjugated polymers (CPs).  The immediate objective is the preparation of novel CP materials which achieve high chemosensing performance and practical utility.  The project involves: (1) design and synthesis of a series of CP systems incorporating reactive sites, which are converted into higher-energy upon reacting with target analyte; (2) photophysical studies (including time-resolved spectroscopies) and synthetic manipulations to evaluate the nature of the higher energy gap control;  (3) design of practical chemosensory systems which utilize this control principle to as a natural counterpart to the traditional amplification schemes based on energy migration in CPs.  In addition to direct practical benefits of the advanced sensing systems to the national security and environmental monitoring, the broader impacts of this work include benefits to the society from multidisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students in STEM disciplines, from public awareness and appreciation of modern science and technology, and from increased interest in science in younger generations.</AbstractNarration>
