<AbstractNarration>This award is for participation in the Plains Elevated Convection at Night (PECAN) field campaign.  PECAN will take place in the central United States in the summer of 2015.  The focus of the project is on overnight thunderstorm complexes that regularly occur in the Great Plains area.  A variety of observational systems will be put in place for the field experiment including multiple aircraft, mobile radars, and ground-based systems that can profile the wind and particles in the lower atmosphere.  This project will provide funding for researchers to take part in the deployment of the NOAA P-3 research aircraft.  The P-3 will have a variety of sensors with cloud particle probes and airborne radar as key measurements.  The researchers will help collect, quality control, and analyze the data in order to study the key questions surrounding nocturnal elevated convection.  The main impact from this research will be better forecasts of overnight storms, which often come with severe winds and flooding rains.  The project will also help train the future generation of scientists by involving multiple graduate students in the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The steering committee for the PECAN campaign has identified four main research topics to be addressed:  1) Nocturnal convection initiation and early evolution of mesoscale convective clusters; 2) Bore and other wave-like disturbances; 3) Dynamics and microphysics of nocturnal mesoscale convective systems; 4) Prediction of nocturnal convection initiation and evolution.  This research will focus on the third topic.   In-situ cloud microphysical data, ground based and airborne radar data, and the results of numerical modeling simulations will be used to test the main hypothesis; microphysical cooling processes in developing and mature stratiform regions of mesoscale convective systems force downdraft circulations that create bore and mesoscale gravity wave features on the stable nocturnal boundary layer that in turn focuses, organizes and maintains future convective activity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summertime thunderstorms over the U.S. Great Plains often form during the late afternoon, but persist well after dark and into early morning hours.  After sunset, storms organize into distinct lines, during which time slow-moving storm complexes can often produce flash floods, severe winds, or occasional hail or tornadoes.  How thunderstorms persist at night long after the source of their energy, the sun, has set is an open question, although many hypotheses have been forwarded related to the presence of low-level jetstreams, gravity waves and atmospheric bores. The 2015 Plains Elevated Convection at Night (PECAN) field campaign was designed to collect ground- and aircraft-based observations to advance understanding of nocturnal convection in conditions where the lowest layer of the atmosphere (the boundary layer) has stabilized at night, a low-level jetstream flows from (approximately) south to north above the boundary layer, and the largest Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE, a measure of thunderstorm buoyancy) is found above the stable boundary layer. A key goal of PECAN was to determine how nocturnal convection within elevated thunderstorm complexes (called mesoscale convective systems, MCSs) maintain their structure and intensity over long times in the absence of surface-based CAPE, and without a balance between cold-pool-generated vorticity and vorticity associated with environmental shear (a dynamic criteria for upright, surface-based thunderstorms).     The NOAA-P-3 aircraft was a key instrumentation platform used during PECAN.  This aircraft flew directly behind the thunderstorm lines, focusing on the region of the storm referred to as the transition zone, which divides stratiform precipitation to the west and the line of thunderstorms to the east.  The PIs of this proposal flew on the aircraft, and were responsible for quality control and analysis of the NOAA P-3 microphysical measurements and subsequent analysis of those data in context of storm kinematics and dynamics. As part of this work, the PIs also were responsible for producing kinematic flow analyses by combining data from the NOAA P-3 tail Doppler radars with ground-based Doppler radars.
