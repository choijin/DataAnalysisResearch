<AbstractNarration>The project aims at quantifying a general network's inner potential&lt;br/&gt;for supporting various forms of security by achieving secret common&lt;br/&gt;randomness between pairs or groups of its nodes.  Statistical and&lt;br/&gt;computational secrecy measures are being considered against a general&lt;br/&gt;passive adversary. Common-randomness-achieving protocols are classified&lt;br/&gt;into two groups: culture-building and crowd-shielding. The former achieves&lt;br/&gt;common randomness between nodes situated in close proximity of each other,&lt;br/&gt;from correlated observations of specific (natural or induced) network&lt;br/&gt;phenomena. The latter ties together the security of multiple communication&lt;br/&gt;links, to the point where an adversary can no longer isolate and attack&lt;br/&gt;a single link without attacking the group as a whole. The broad range of&lt;br/&gt;investigated protocols cover multiple topics, from multipath diversity&lt;br/&gt;to network tomography, from secure network coding to protocol coding,&lt;br/&gt;and from anonymous routing to the spread of epidemics.  The protocols&lt;br/&gt;harvest network randomness from diverse sources like ciphertext blocks&lt;br/&gt;originating at various terminals, contention protocols (delay randomness)&lt;br/&gt;or network topology (in highly-dynamic, or ad-hoc networks).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Communication networks are naturally dynamic, inherently redundant,&lt;br/&gt;and largely unpredictable. While the former two features have long&lt;br/&gt;been recognized as a valuable resource for integrity, efficiency&lt;br/&gt;and confidentiality, network unpredictability is often regarded as an&lt;br/&gt;incommodity. This project shows how network randomness can be harvested,&lt;br/&gt;and, together with diversity, exploited to enhance communication&lt;br/&gt;security. In doing so, it develops a more  profound understanding about&lt;br/&gt;the statistical nature of networks, which can be applied to a broad range&lt;br/&gt;of information-assurance objectives.  The technical approaches and the&lt;br/&gt;general philosophy developed in this project, and disseminated through&lt;br/&gt;conferences and seminars, have the potential to inspire an abundance of&lt;br/&gt;related research. The project will directly impact dozens of students&lt;br/&gt;through Senior Design projects, a research-and-open-project approach to&lt;br/&gt;curriculum development, and three new graduate courses containing related&lt;br/&gt;topics. The PIs are actively involved in programs aimed at increasing&lt;br/&gt;the involvement of women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with&lt;br/&gt;disabilities in engineering and computing sciences.</AbstractNarration>
