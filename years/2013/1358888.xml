<AbstractNarration>This award renews funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at Rutgers University. Advances in remote sensing, ocean observatories, autonomous vehicles, numerical modeling, and molecular biology are changing oceanography. The faculty and research facilities at Rutgers allow undergraduates to explore how to use these, and other, technologies to understand marine ecosystems. The program brings ten students to Rutgers each summer for ten weeks. Some students will be housed at the main campus in New Brunswick, NJ and some will be housed at Rutgers University Marine Field Station in Tuckerton, NJ. Through independent projects and team research experiences, students focus on process-oriented concepts and techniques applicable in any marine ecosystem. Students are recruited through national and regional advertising. An initial four-day orientation introduces students to ongoing research, focusing on the Raritan River-Raritan Bay and the Mullica River-Great Bay systems. The two estuaries provide a sharp contrast in their human impacts on coastal ecosystems. The orientation includes two days at the Rutgers University Marine Field Station in Tuckerton, with hands-on experience in the coastal LEO-15 research area, and on the Mullica River. During the first week students also consult with mentors and attend workshops on how to formulate a research question and write a proposal. Other orientation activities include workshops on effective teamwork and an online course on responsible conduct of research. Ethics training will be supplemented by group discussions of case studies. Students make oral progress reports of their research in a mid-program workshop. Discussions of careers in ocean science and when and how to apply to graduate school take place towards the end of the program. All participants receive instruction on how to write up and analyze their data and how to prepare a poster for the final poster session. A total of thirty students will recieve an excellent summer research internship experience and career training via this award.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported a Research Experience for Undergraduates site at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.  This program, Research Internships in Ocean Sciences (RIOS), provided hands-on research experiences for undergraduate students who are interested in the marine sciences.  The program ran for ten weeks during the summers of 2015, 2016, and 2017.  Thirty-one students attending colleges and universities from around the country participated.  Students received a stipend, and their travel and room expenses were covered under the grant.               When applying for the program, applicants were provided with descriptions of ongoing research projects by faculty in the Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences at Rutgers and asked to identify potential mentors.  Applicants were screened by a selection committee and evaluated on the basis of their undergraduate transcripts, personal statements of their career goals and research interests, letters of reference, and potential match with a suitable mentor.  Mentors can be faculty, postdoctoral researchers, or advanced graduate students.               The goal of the program was to provide students with an in-depth research experience.  All major phases of conducting research were covered, including writing a proposal describing the planned project and the expected outcome, designing the study, collecting data, analyzing and interpreting data, making an oral presentation of the results of the project, and preparing a professional poster.  The capstone of the program was a poster session, similar to those held at professional marine science meetings.  Posters were judged, and the winner was sent to a national science meeting to present their project.  During the course of the program, students also participated in workshops covering various aspects of a career in science, such as responsible conduct of research and how to apply to graduate school.
