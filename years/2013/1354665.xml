<AbstractNarration>This project will explore how leaf-feeding insects may determine leaf color and the timing of autumn leaf fall.  The project challenges two traditional beliefs about autumn foliage color:  that the timing and degree of autumn coloration can be predicted exclusively from the temperature, moisture, and day length conditions experienced by a tree, and that the fall colors we enjoy are simply those exposed as green pigment, in the form of chlorophyll, is degraded.   In particular, the research will test the idea that insect damage can either advance or delay the timing of leaf loss and can alter presence of anthocycanins, the compounds responsible for orange, red, and purple leaf colors.  By examining a suite of deciduous trees common in eastern North America, this study will contrast how leaf damage by insects affects tree species that use anthocyanins compared to those that use other pigments.  Chemical changes in leaves, including the production of colors, are a major way in which plants recover necessary nutrients for growth and reproduction in future seasons.  Therefore, a second part of this research will determine how trees that differ in the amount and timing of autumn coloration differ in how and when they produce new leaves in the subsequent spring.  A long term goal of this work is to predict how insects change the timing of plant growth in ways that affect the sustainability and diversity of forests. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These ecological studies will contribute to a better ability to forecast how well trees prepare for winter.  Such knowledge is critical to predicting how biological communities of plants and leaf-eating insects in temperate forests will change with increasing global temperatures.  Additionally, it will help us determine if insects that cause widespread damage to forests may potentially impact fall foliage tourism revenue by delaying or decreasing autumn coloration across the landscape.  Finally, this award will support the training of graduate and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research in botany, entomology, and climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Our experiments conducted in understory forests in Virginia revealed that low levels of leaf damage (at a level commonly caused by chewing insects) advanced autumn leaf coloration in red oak and red maple trees.  On the other hand, we found that at high levels of insect damage (at a level occasionally caused by outbreaking insect pests), trees were more likely to drop damaged leaves mid-summer, as well as decrease color expression in the autumn.  When comparing oak and maple tree species that produce red autumn color (anthocyanin pigments) to those that have yellow or orange leaves (carotenoid and anthocyanin pigments), such as sassafras, we found that leaf damage by chewing insects increases expression of red pigments but decreases yellow color in autumn.       Our experiments tracking leaf production, color change, and leaf loss in an open-field, common garden plot revealed many stressors for small saplings in high light environments.  Red maple and red oak trees that were damaged by insects did show some evidence of earlier coloration.  However, exceedingly high levels of insect damage and early spring warming led to production of new leaf material and to red-colored leaves in all summer months.  This abnormal pattern of leaf production led to high levels of heat-related leaf scorch and advanced leaf loss.       These findings were echoed when we analyzed photographed and digitally curated herbarium collections of maple leaves from the late 1800s to present day.  These digitized specimens revealed new seasonal patterns of leaf production and insect and pathogen damage in warmer, more recent decades.  Samples pooled into pre and post-1960 data sets suggested that maples have experienced a lengthening of the time span of new leaf production.  Specifically, herbaria specimens collected after 1960 showed evidence of new leaf production in every month from April to September compared to a simple peak in May prior to 1960.  Both fungal damage and damage by chewing insects was higher in the post-1960s collections.  However, when compared to post-1960s specimens, red maples collected after 1960 showed autumn leaf color about 1 month later, not earlier as in our field studies.         We conducted two additional studies of the timing of autumn using citizen science data.  First, we used data across the eastern and central U.S. (South Carolina to Maine) from the National Phenology Network beginning in 2011 to calculate the average start date for autumn leaf drop.  We found that statistical estimates that use linear methods rather than circular statistics to calculate the start of the autumn season may underestimate the timing of autumn by as much as a week.  Second, we established an autumn and spring phenology lab in our university?s BIOL 308 course and used student collected data to investigate the accuracy of citizen science reported data.  We found that students often err on the side of failing to report data rather than risk making mistakes.  We also found that students had a more difficult time accurately reporting seasonal changes in non-native species compared to trees that they regularly encounter in their local environments.    Our investigations, particularly of herbarium specimens, reinforce other phenology research showing later autumn phenology in response to climate change.  However, our results suggest that damage by leaf chewing insects on understory trees may offset the lengthening of the growing season by advancing the start of autumn senescence in some species.  Nonetheless, should insect pest outbreaks increase in response to earlier spring leaf production, we predict that trees will be unable to complete the nutrient retention processes that are a natural part of seasonal leaf color change. Given the changes in timing of new leaf production that we uncovered, we suggest scientists expand climate-related studies beyond the typical search for changes to the length of the growing season.
