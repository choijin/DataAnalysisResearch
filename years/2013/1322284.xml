<AbstractNarration>While nation-state research proliferates, sub-national analyses of the adoption of global rules are still rare. There is still a limited understanding of the ways in which the layering of multiple norms could produce divergent outcomes. This research will contribute a much-needed analysis of the differences that may exist across policy-issues within one sector.  This research investigates the implementation of two international rules that regulate when imports can enter markets, attending to the significance of differences in the rules and in the variation in national priorities. Preliminary research reveals significant cross-national variation within one region in the response to international rules that harmonize regulation. Moreover, there is also within-country variation as countries comply with one international rule but resist the other.&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation asks why countries respond differently to international standards but also why states comply with some international rules while resisting others. The project addresses these questions by comparing the implementation process of rules since the late 1990s and providing a detailed historical account of regulation in since the 1960s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will also explain how middle-income countries balance national well-being priorities and industrial development outcomes in the context of international harmonization projects. This could prove immensely useful when exploring alternative possibilities for diversifying provision of market goods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This dissertation seeks to explain why Brazil and Colombia took puzzling positions with regards to quality requirements for generic and biosimilar medicines.  While the literature on the political economy of pharmaceutical intellectual property has attributed similar policy decisions to the ability of policy makers to build alliances with powerful partners (Shadlen 2009), I show how  such alliances are insufficient to explain policy decisions regarding Marketing Approval Requirements (MARs) in Brazil and Colombia. Similarly, while some authors have argued that pharmaceutical regulatory choices in developing countries merely reflect the consensus reached by northern harmonization initiatives (Abraham and Reed 2001), I show how both Brazilian and Colombian bureaucrats disregarded international guidelines at some point, which undermines this explanation.  Instead of the society-centered explanations described above, my research findings suggest that what explains the puzzling policy choices taken by Brazil and Colombia is the behavior of state officials with particular characteristics and sets of beliefs, who operated either in moments of health crisis or in moments or normality.  For each case I found that the level of autonomy from interest groups and from the state itself was crucial. I also found that when a sectorial crisis was present bureaucrats gained more independence and leverage to influence others within and outside the state. When bureaucrats were highly autonomous and there was a crisis, the policies that resulted were visible and more stable. Stability means that MARs were fully regulated afterwards and that the possibility of future governments changing them was slim. When the bureaucrats are less autonomous and/or there is no crisis giving them power and leverage, policies tend to be less stable.  Yet, the regulatory trajectories were different in Brazil and Colombia. The reason for that is that the bureaucrats that drafted the regulations in each country belonged to different epistemic communities, and thus had different ideas about what MARs are and about the level of stringency they should have. Colombian bureaucrats belonged to the rational use of medicines epistemic community, while Brazilian bureaucrats belonged to the interchangeability epistemic community. The former believed that pharmaceutical innovation is not what it seems and that a rational and austere use of medicines should be promoted. They also believed that stringent MARs constitute an artificial barrier of entry for generic medicines that favor MNCs. The latter epistemic community, in contrast, is composed of people who believe in interchangeability, which means that they believe that generic and biosimilar drugs should be tested in humans in order to be completely certain that they are the same as the originator drug.  My findings contribute to the sociology of development literature by complementing the notion of autonomy and suggesting that autonomy from the state itself is important for policy-making in developing countries.  Common state-centered approaches tend to focus on the autonomy of the state to pursue goals that do not reflect the demands or interests of particular social groups, and on the stateÆs capacity to implement such goals despite the opposition of powerful interested parties (Skocpol 1985, 9). Following a Weberian tradition, state agencies are considered to be autonomous when they are constituted by an organized, meritocratic and expert bureaucracy with opportunities for long-term careers (Evans 1995, 30). What is exceptional about the cases analyzed in this dissertation is that bureaucrats came out ahead despite lacking a formal bureaucratic platform and despite the fact that their goals contradicted what the rest of the state was striving for.  This dssertation also contributes to the institutional change liiterature by suggesting that sectorial crises, which are not epochal or extended, can result in rapid and yet dur...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
