<AbstractNarration>CHE-1362477: Irving Epstein, Brandeis University, "Nonlinear Chemical Dynamics"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Irving Epstein of Brandeis University is funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A program for research to deepen our understanding of chemical systems that operate far from thermodynamic equilibrium. One question the researchers are investigating involves the chemical mechanism of the development of form in an embryo, a process known as morphogenesis. Experiments are underway in this research project to more fully test a suggestion made over fifty years ago by the late Alan Turing that patterns in biology arise from a particular type of chemical pattern that also exists in nonliving systems. In other experiments, the investigators are building connected groups of model nerve cells to mimic and study communication networks in the brain. Other experiments are using gels and a specially-designed reactor to try to capture and preserve chemical patterns that have been observed in previous studies but, to date, only as fleeting and transient patterns. Because these studies are specifically designed to mimic certain behaviors in biological systems, such as communications between neurons and the development of form in embryos, the work helps us understand key life processes. Broader impacts of this work are the education of future scientists and the inclusion of otherwise under-represented groups in science. The Science Posse project, a mentoring and outreach program designed by Epstein as part of this research project, has received national recognition for its success in recruiting and maintaining a diverse group of STEM students. Other outreach efforts include the Science Caf√© project, designed to bring science to the public, and a series of YouTube videos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research project, the investigators are building an open flow reactor for the study of emulsions consisting of 10-50 nm sized droplets of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction mixture. They are also seeking to determine the conditions under which chemical oscillators other than the BZ system can be introduced into nano-emulsions and will study pattern formation in these other chemical systems. The group is exploring whether the patterns that arise in emulsions can be "frozen in" to yield gels or solids that might have novel optical, electrical or mechanical properties and, thus, might be useful for developing new devices. Another study involves a hexagonal droplet array of 100 nm BZ drops. Previous observation has revealed that the drops first undergo chemical differentiation to produce either a reduced or an oxidized steady state. Subsequent physical differentiation occurs and the droplets are observed to either shrink or swell. Finally, new experiments are being carried out to synthesize gels containing the BZ catalyst attached to a conducting polymer backbone. Other experiments involve finding ways to attach new catalysts for the Briggs-Rauscher oscillator to polymers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project was to elucidate, using both experimental and theoretical methods, how chemical reaction and diffusion generate patterns of behavior in time and space.  Many of our methods and results in this field of nonlinear chemical dynamics are applicable to a variety of complex systems outside of chemistry, from magnetic spins to social and financial networks to population genetics.   One area of focus has been the behavior of chemical oscillators perturbed by the external environment or by other oscillators.  Many of our studies have employed the classic Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.  We examined the effects of time-delayed stochastic feedback on a model BZ oscillator and studied the behavior of asymmetrically pulse-coupled BZ oscillators with and without time delay and frequency modulation.  A variety of new, complex patterns were found, and good agreement was obtained between experiments and simulations.  We developed an approach to predicting the behavior of systems of pulse-coupled oscillators, a form of coupling that resembles that found in neurons linked by synaptic connections.   Another phenomenon of interest has been Turing patterns, which are periodic in space and constant in time, which have been proposed as a mechanism for morphogenesis in developing organisms.  We studied how Turing patterns interact with chemical waves and other patterns and also developed a method to produce as much as a five-fold increase in the wavelength of Turing patterns, significantly more than has been obtained in previous studies.   A major focus has been on understanding and extending the remarkable properties of polymer gels that incorporate the reactants of the BZ reaction.  These gels shrink or swell as the reaction oscillates, converting the energy of the chemical reaction into mechanical motion.  They display a complex dependence of their oscillation frequency on light intensity, allowing us to generate motion either antiparallel or parallel to the direction of propagation of the chemical waves in a gel placed in a tube illuminated at high intensity in one half and low intensity in the other.  This behavior mimics that found in nature, where, for example, earthworms display antiparallel locomotion, while the some molluscs show parallel locomotion.  We identified the mechanistic origin of these modes of locomotion as a delicate balance between the push and pull associated with the wave back and wave front.  In another study of BZ gels, we showed that one can control the morphology of groups of waves formed in response to temporally periodic illumination.  These patterns, which can be understood in terms of the mechanism of the BZ reaction, resemble those seen in the development of sea shells and plant leaves.   We have carried out several investigations in which we employ approaches from nonlinear chemical dynamics to investigate systems with potential for practical application.  We found the first evidence for oscillatory peptide formation and decomposition, leading to the periodic appearance and disappearance of microfibers and microspheres in solutions of amino acids.  Such short, linear, self-assembling polymers may be useful as building blocks for nanodevices or scaffolds for tissue engineering.  We analyzed experimental data on the toxicity to cancer cells of several precursors for enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA) of cytotoxic hydrogelators, providing insights into the mechanism of cytotoxicity5.  We prepared alginate nanoparticles containing crosslinking ions and incorporated urease within the resulting nanogel.  These nanogels may offer considerable promise relative to existing methods for detection and measurement of urea in diagnostics and therapeutics.  Based on work supported by this grant, we established a collaboration with the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center to exploit the antimicrobial properties of chlorine dioxide for disinfecting clothing and equipment and preserving food.  A patent application has been submitted, and we hope ultimately to commercialize the idea.  We have made efforts to bring the results of our and others? research to a broader public and to increase diversity in the sciences The PI co-founded and spoke at the Brandeis Science Caf?, a monthly meeting at a local restaurant where Brandeis science faculty gave talks for members of the lay public on their research.  He directs the Science Posse, a program he founded to increase the retention of economically disadvantaged and underrepresented students in the sciences.  To date, 67 Posse students have graduated from Brandeis, 50 in STEM majors, with 40 more in the pipeline. Science Posse has been adopted by ten other institutions and was recognized by President Obama for its success in increasing minority retention in STEM disciplines.  A graduate student working on this research project served as the mentor for one cohort of ten Science Posse students.  The PI was an invited speaker at a symposium on Diversifying STEM and contributed an invited chapter on Science Posse and cohort models to a volume on Diversity in the Chemistry Community.
