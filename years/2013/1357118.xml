<AbstractNarration>This proposal proposes to commercialize the technology, Light Modulated Acoustic Devices (LMAD) to translate basic research on photonic materials from the laboratory to the market place. Controlling sound actively using light is challenging and is considered to be one of the holy grail of acoustics technology due to the fundamental differences in the nature of the acoustic and electromagnetic waves. The PI and his team propose to commercialize the technology to photo-actively control phononic properties remotely using the novel dielectric properties of nanoparticles embedded in phononic crystals. Since phononics deals with vibrations, acoustic or otherwise, potential applications range from active, non-contact vibration dampening for vehicles and devices, to smart, high resolution ultrasound technology, to environmental technologies to actively reduce noise pollution. LMADs are part of the subcategory of technology of photonics, phononics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greater dynamic flexibility in existing focused-sound technologies will be achieved via this technology. Active selective-filtering element for vibration dampening can be used to filter out selected unwanted vibration modes. Typical customers would consist of manufacturers of ultrasonic equipment for either hyperthermic  biomedical, imaging, or structural characterization applications.</AbstractNarration>
