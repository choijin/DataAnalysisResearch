<AbstractNarration>This project will concern the investigation of reactions of slow electrons with biomolecules. Such slow electrons are typically found in human tissue after irradiation with deep ultra-violet photons and X-rays. The processes concerned will be in the excitation of electron states in the biomolecule, a process which is complicated by the size of such molecules, and involves close collaboration between two established and advanced theoretical (Caltech) and experimental (Cal State Fullerton) groups. Recent success in work with water has provided impetus for this collaboration to look at more complex molecules - methanol and ethanol and has provided a good foundation for this direction of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this collaboration is its involvement of international experimental (U. Juiz de Fora) and theoretical groups (USP, U. Parana in Curitiba, Unicamp) in Brazil. It also provides involvement of US undergraduate students at Cal State Fullerton to go to Brazil to carry out summer research to do experimental work in developing projects there as well as taking electron-biomolecule collisions data to transfer US technology to Brazil and to foster scientific relations between the two countries. This also provides impetus for Brazilian faculty and students from these universities to come to the USA to CIT/CSUF and collaborate. The students who participate get international experience and are very likely to pursue graduate studies in physics or physical chemistry. This award is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International and Integrative Activities.</AbstractNarration>

There are a very large range of such processes we can study and each has its special interest to physics.   The results are also used in modeling electrons igniting plasmas such as fluorescent lamps, aurorae, natural plasmas, DNA fragmentation in the body, and a range of physical phenomena.   We have published 10 papers on electron scattering from molecules- mostly polyatomic molecules and mostly elastic scattering studies. We  sent six students to Brazil to participate in experimental research; four students to U. Federal Juiz de Fora and two to U. Federal Sao Carlos. We have measured with these students elastic electron scattering from two halocarbons (CH2Cl2 and CH3Cl) at high energy and at CSUF we are doing these measurements at low energies. We just finished the work on CH2Cl2 down to 0.5eV incident energy.   We have also done electron impact excitation of H2O, CH3OH, C2H5OH and H2.  All of these are significant as they were useful deterimations of differential cross sections for important molecules and addressed both forbidden and allowed transitions in these molecules.  Our work on molecular hydrogen (the simplest molecule)  H2 was important last year as our data were used by the Curtin University's Convergent Close-Coupling model to test a rigorous computation job on the scattering of electrons from H2 , by them, and employed our results from 2004 at CSUF to test their calculations. We recently analyzed more data of electron scattering from H2 at much lower incident energies (closer to threshold) and have a paper in press with the Curtin group model and our results viewed together, which show nice comparisons between experiment and theory.  We have also built a working, novel time-of-flight electron scattering requiring short time-width (1 nanosecond) electron pulsed beams experiment which we will use to undertake low energy electron scattering from H2, H2O, CH3OH, C2H5OH. We have currently four Physics Batchelor of Science and two Masters of Science students in the lab plus one Fulbright Fellow from Poland working in the lab Our lab projects, although in an undergraduate institution, are competitive with PhD granting research universities..
