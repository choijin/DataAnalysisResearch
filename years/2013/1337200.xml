<AbstractNarration>The mobility of teachers in schools is the focus of this project. Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and the 21st Century Partnership for STEM Education are developing a system of indicators to measure the magnitude and impact of changes in school system staffing, a construct they call Ambient Positional Instability. The researchers are constructing case studies of school districts working within the context of an ongoing multi-site STEM experimental study. They are mapping the accessibility of teacher positional change data in 100 of the largest school districts in the United States, working with the Council of Great City Schools, to identify potential models of that data to better understand the phenomena. As a fourth component of the study, they are conducting a review of published reports on randomized trials and interviews with the authors to examine teacher instability that is not necessarily reported in those studies. The findings from this study inform a Campbell collaboration protocol for systemic review of the evidence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teacher mobility is caused by reassignments to grades or subjects taught, promotions or demotions to nonteaching positions, and temporary appointments, as well as school leaving. Schools are frequently indicated as being very volatile environments with much turnover of staff and students a perennial problem. Yet the extent to which this is a problem has not been well characterized, and a system of indicators of this instability does not exist. This study provides such an indicator system and much potential use for both research and evaluation purposes. The instability in teacher positions has implications for the implementation of educational interventions. It affects the sensitivity of research and evaluation to detect the impact of interventions in experimental studies. In addition, teacher mobility has implications for policy decisions at the school, district, state and federal levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Goals  This research, in cooperation with our grant partner at the University of Pennsylvania (ID# 1337237), has aimed to generate dependable evidence based entirely on public data systems about Ambient Positional Instability (API) among teachers in public schools.   API includes shifts within and across years in what subjects, courses, and/or grades teachers teach within and across schools, movement to other positions across schools and districts, and leaving the profession altogether.     Rationale  High levels of API among teachers has implications for the education of children. High turnover and re-assignment rates among teachers are associated with lower student achievement and an unstable organization which impedes reform implementation.  Elementary teachers re-assigned within schools to different grades are also more likely to leave the profession. This instability has implications for the management of school resources including induction/retention tactics and professional development experiences.  High levels of API also has implications for designing and executing field tests of innovative STEM interventions in schools, for analyzing test results, and for designing school based interventions that accommodate teachers? instability.     API Results  Ohio  In Ohio?s 2008 cohort of nearly 60,000 STEM teachers, 25% had left their initial positions at the end of that year.  Five years later, only 50% of the teachers were in the same schools and teaching the same subjects.  The year-to-year rate for movement away from high schools and grades and subjects was 20-22% for the state and 30-34%  for the biggest cities. Teachers in non-charter public high schools in the five largest cities have roughly 50% higher API than those outside those cities. Charter schools have the highest level of API.     Pennsylvania  In Pennsylvania, 59% of math and science secondary non-charter teachers are in the same school after 4 years and 20% of these teachers are not in the same assignment. Only 29% of secondary non-charter teachers in Philadelphia and 39% of secondary charter teachers remain in the same school after 4 years. Teachers from Philadelphia (SDP) and in charter schools have most intra-district and intra-school change.     By the sixth year, only 28% percent of math teachers and 28% of science teachers in the SDP remain in the same position.

Texas  In Texas, using a longitudinal dataset of 299,000 teachers beginning with the 2008/9 cohort, we produced findings separately for elementary and secondary teachers, given differences in the type of their assignment (i.e., single inclusive classroom for elementary versus multiple different courses and students for secondary teachers).  For elementary full-time teachers working in self-contained classrooms, 36% remain teaching in their same school and grade assignment, 10% same school but different grade, 37% have either left teaching or moved out of state to teach, and 18% have changed schools after 5 years.
