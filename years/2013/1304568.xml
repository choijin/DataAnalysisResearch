<AbstractNarration>The Mechanized Vineyard-Teaching Project (MVTP) increases the number of program faculty, provides professional development, develops and disseminates new curriculum, and provides student learning experiences in mechanized vineyard management in a commercial-scale teaching-vineyard. The purpose of MVTP is to recruit, retain, and graduate increased numbers of students who are fully able to own and operate their own vineyard, or are fully employable in any commercial-scale mechanized vineyard in the Midwest. The activities undertaken teach STEM skills to operate and maintain commercial-scale equipment utilized in mechanized vineyard management and enhance students' employability.  The goal of MVTP is to establish a career pathway to increase the percentage of rural, underrepresented, nontraditional, and veteran students recruited, retained, and graduated in order to meet workforce demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIghland Community college (HCC) provides students with learning experiences about the STEM inherent in mechanized vineyard management. HCC enhances its current viticulture curriculum by creating three courses specific to mechanization in the vineyard. As vineyards swell in numbers and acres and labor becomes more scarce, mechanization is gaining in relevance in a traditionally labor-intensive industry. This project is educating students and entrepreneurs to adapt to these changes in the grape industry. All evidence points toward an expanding industry demanding more and better educated employees. The results of the project are being disseminated statewide through college affiliation with state and regional industry organizations, and national dissemination is being accomplished through association with the VESTA National Center of Excellence.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Throughout the Midwest the grape and wine industry is growing.  In Kansas, wineries have indicated a huge need for more grapes.  Producing more grapes requires expanded or additional vineyards, but these vineyards are less likely to materialize until they can be operated in a less labor-intensive manner.  The Mechanized Vineyard-Teaching Project enabled Highland Community College to purchase machinery and expand an already existing vineyard to teach students about mechanical vineyard management and raising vines on a commercial scale versus a small, hand-labor, "hobby" scale vineyard.     In addition to expanding the vineyard, the Highland Community College Viticulture and Enology Program (HCC V&amp;E) purchased a vineyard tractor and several implements to utilize in the vineyard.  Upon hiring a fulltime Viticulture instructor, HCC V&amp;E staff attended several grape industry conferences nationwide and collaborated with both members of the industry and faculty from the Viticulture and Enology Science and Technology Alliance (VESTA) National Center of Excellence.  Through these collaborations HCC V&amp;E developed a series of modules for instructing students to use the various items of equipment in the field.  These various modules were incorporated into existing viticulture courses at HCC.  HCC will compile the modules and create a stand-alone course(s) on vineyard mechanization.     The majority of students enrolling in the viticulture program at HCC have been non-traditional with an average student age of 45 years.  HCC V&amp;E has partnered with the Kansas Chapter of a relatively new organization, Farmer Veteran Coalition to seek out veterans interested in agriculture.  HCC V&amp;E also worked closely with local high schools offering field trip and vineyard work experiences (planting vines and harvesting grapes) with the intent of gaining the interest of more traditional aged students.  Through persistence and partnership with VESTA, HCC V&amp;E had its first graduate in Spring of 2015, second in Spring of 2016, and three more are on track to graduate in Spring of 2017 (including two traditional aged students).      The vineyard expansion undertaken by HCC V&amp;E is located on a frequently traveled highway next door to a major tractor and implement dealership.  Many commodity crop farmers have seen and inquired about the vineyard since it was planted.  As a result, management of that dealership and others in the area have become more active in grape and other specialty crop forums throughout Kansas.  Over time, it seems likely that these dealerships will begin carrying various lines of vineyard machinery, making mechanization much easier for a grape grower in Kansas because parts and repair expertise will be nearby.     In recent years colleges and individual college programs have been tasked with finding ways to generate income and alleviate general budget shortfalls.  Sometimes this is referred to as becoming sustainable.  The expanded vineyard funded by this project does exactly that for the HCC V&amp;E program.  The additional six acres of grapevines has the potential to generate as much as $36,000 per year through selling harvested grapes.  Although subject to weather-related disruptions, a typical grapevine can survive and produce fruit for ten to fifty years.  This vineyard should provide additional income to assist in sustaining the HCC V&amp;E program for many years to come.     It is the intent of HCC V&amp;E to continue collaborating with both VESTA and the grape and wine industry to remain on the leading edge of learning about, implementing, and teaching technology so support the local grape industry.  HCC V&amp;E seeks to expand the hands-on training opportunities for both industry and students through workshops and coursework.  The overarching goal of HCC V&amp;E is to train workers and entrepreneurs to grow grapes in the most efficient way possible, and this nearly always involves mechanization in the vineyard.
