<AbstractNarration>Three borehole strainmeters will be installed into boreholes provided by internationally supported Geophysical Observatory at the North Anatolian Fault (GONAF). The borehole strainmeters will enhance the ability of the scientific instrumentation to monitor ultra-slow process near the probable source zone of the Mw&gt;7 earthquake that is soon expected beneath the Marmara sea. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Twice in the past 1000 years a sequence of damaging earthquakes has propagated during the course of a few decades along the North Anatolian fault in Turkey towards Istanbul, the final earthquake in the sequence catastrophically destroying the city.  This occurred most recently in 1509 when the population was about 200,000 and ten thousand people died.  The population is now 20 million, the building stock more fragile and the last earthquake of the current sequence is considered imminent.  An opportunity to enhance the detection capability of a suite of deep seismometers installed near Istanbul has arisen that would permit us to monitor the tectonic processes leading to this failure.   The Anatolian fault setting of Istanbul in many ways resembles the San Andreas Fault setting of San Francisco, and we envisage that what we learn from the next Istanbul earthquake will act as a template for future damaging shocks in California.  The RAPID funding for the project is necessary to install the strainmeters allowing us to make geodetic observations of this segment of the fault before, during and after a large earthquake, which combined with the seismic data from GONAF will provide valuable data for understanding earthquake processes. In addition this investigation will incrementally raise awareness of seismic hazard of Istanbul and it?s surrounding environment with direct societal benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is designated as a Global Venture Fund Award and is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

Previous sequences in the 10th and 16th centuries concluded with an earthquake near Istanbul, with catastrophic damage to the city. (Figure 1) Following the 1999 Mw=7.5 Izmit earthquake few doubts remain that a damaging earthquake will soon occur near Istanbul, with its population of 8 million. Numerous scientific projects have been initiated to characterize the probable size and timing of this earthquake.  Similar to what is observed on the San Andreas fault system in California, slip on the North Anatolian fault occurs principally in major earthquakes, but partly by processes of aseismic creep, a process whereby the fault slips slowly without releasing seismic energy. Slow slip at depth has been observed to precede some major earthquakes, which suggests that it may be possible to monitor processes preceding the occurrence of a future large Istanbul earthquake. These slow processes require sensors capable of monitoring very small, long duration signals in the Earth. To learn more about slow slip processes along the western end of the North Anatolian fault we have installed two surface creepmeters and six borehole strainmeters.

In addition, during 2015, the creepmeters at Ismetpasa and Izmit have recorded intriguing creep behavior indicative of variations in creep processes with depth: no slip, slow slip, and distinct creep events (Figure 4). We anticipate that the GeoGONAF instrument network will see numerous unique signals related to the westward propagation of strain along the North Anatolian fault.  The importance of our observations (to date primarily from the two creepmeters) is that they emulate the known stick-slip behavior of faults.  The slow slip process (B) occurs in the top tens of meters of the fault and creep events (C) in the top hundred meters.  Below these depths damaging earthquakes occur at longer intervals and release tens of cm or meters of slip.  By studying these harmless processes at Ismetpasa we hope to gain insight into processes that may precede damaging earthquake elsewhere on NAF.  One of the important broader outcomes of this investigation is that the instruments were installed with participation of scientific and technical colleagues in Turkey and Germany, who engaged at all levels during the site selection, instrument installation and telemetry of data from the sensors.  The creepmeter data are available publically and to our colleagues within minutes of transmission (datagarrison.com    (user) Ismet (password) pasa), and the borehole strainmeter data are available from UNAVCO.org.   The most important outcome from the project will be the successful identification of failure mechanisms, should any occur, prior to rupture of the Marmara sea segment of the Anatolian fault. The identification of a precursory signal would be of immense value to the city of Istanbul, yet we recognize that such signals have been elusive in the past. A more concrete milestone likely to be achieved is the recognition and characterization of the complex tectonic processes leading to seismic rupture, which will be of great value to the inhabitants of Turkey in one or two centuries when the process will repeat, and w...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
