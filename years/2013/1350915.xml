<AbstractNarration>Aneuploidy, an abnormal chromosome copy number, is common in evolution and nature.   For the cell, there are both positive and negative effects of aneuploidy.    Aneuploidy alters transcription but the mechanisms driving these changes are not understood.   The powerful yeast model organism will be utilized to ascertain the underlying molecular mechanism using a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation, next-generation sequencing, and computational analysis.   Understanding these mechanisms will provide tremendous insight into not only aneuploidy but also transcriptional regulation in general.  This project will lead to a better understanding of the costs and benefits of aneuploidy.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt; A similar cross-disciplinary approach will be utilized to build a summer undergraduate research program in synthetic biology and develop an interactive fiction tool for teaching responsible conduct of research.    Tremendous leaps in scientific understanding often arise from individuals who ignore traditional disciplinary boundaries to relentlessly pursue the question at hand.   In this proposal, the PI seeks to instill this philosophy into generations of undergraduates through the development of a University of Colorado internationally Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) team.   This synthetic biology competition brings students together for an intensive summer to design and construct unique biological circuits.    Additionally, the PI seeks to bring the ante-disciplinary philosophy to teaching responsible conduct of research by developing an interactive fiction game.   This game will not only train scientists in an engaging and interactive manner but also will enable studies into how peer pressure influences ethical behavior.   The long term impact of creating honest, intelligent, and creative scientists is incalculable.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Alterations in chromosome content, either through duplication of whole chromosome sets (polyploidy) or by alternations in chromosome number (aneuploidy) are observed frequently and are thought to be an important force in evolution.   Aneuploidy invariably leads to a transcriptional response, but the molecular mechanisms behind altered gene expression are largely unknown.  The majority of genes are transcribed at levels that are proportional to the copy number, but many genes (both on and off the aneuploidy chromosome) show altered transcriptional regulation.  In this work, we sought to better understand the mechanistic basis of transcriptional dysregulation in aneuploidy cells, both in yeast and in humans.  In yeast, we initially employed an experimental evolution study to understand the impact of polyploidization on molecular adaptation.   Yeast of assorted initial ploidy) were subjected to a carbon stress (raffinose).  After several generations, the strains adapted to growth on raffinose.   The tetraploid (4N) strains underwent the largest change in fitness.  Subsequent sequencing of strains identified examples of mutations that are selectively beneficial in polyploid strains, including whole chromosome aneuploidy (Selmecki et. al. 2015).    In subsequent studies, we carefully characterized a variety of adaptive mutations and demonstrated that aneuploidy of chromosome XII was beneficial in an initially tetraploid background but not in the diploid strains (Scott et. al. 2017).   Many of the adaptive mutations were within regulatory regions of the yeast genome, underscoring the importance of defining the mechanisms underlying differences in regulation of gene expression between individuals.  As a case study, we sought to understand the mechanistic basis of a pair of co-reguated, divergently transcribed transcripts that differ between the reference (S288c) and sigma strains of yeast (Read et. al. 2016).   By combining classical genetics techniques with high-throughput sequencing, we identified a trans-acting single nucleotide polymorphism within the transcription factor RIM101 that causes the background-dependent expression of both transcripts.  Subsequent RNA-seq experiments revealed that RIM101 regulates many more targets in S288c than in Sigma and that deletion of RIM101 in both backgrounds abrogates the majority of differential expression between the strains. Strikingly, only three transcripts undergo a significant change in expression after swapping RIM101 alleles between backgrounds, implying that the differences in the RIM101 allele lead to a remarkably focused transcriptional response.  In humans, our work focused on Down syndrome, the condition in which an individual possesses an extra copy of chromosome 21.  There we profiled the transcription (GRO-seq) and expression (RNA-seq) of these individuals.  We demonstrated that some genes are impacted by the post-transcriptional RNA maturation processing and stability regulation in a dosage specific manner.  This work is ongoing.   Finally, the computational tools and pipelines developed for this grant have been used to support a number of tangential projects (Wilson et. al. 2018, Tripodi et. al. 2020).      Broader Impacts  In addition to the work on aneuploidy, this work supported the development of two important educational initiatives on the Boulder campus.  First, we established an International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) team on the CU campus.  This summer research program allows teams of undergraduates to build synthetic circuits to achieve measurable goals and build unique devices.   At the 2014 competition, the CU team achieved a Gold Medal and won the North American Region Best BioBrick award.   There work was also published (Hendrix et al. 2014).  Over the duration of the award (2014-2018) iGEM provided tangible summer research experiences to 48 undergraduates, many of whom were first generation college students and under-represented minorities.     Second, we developed a summer research program developing a choose-your-own-adventure styled game (called Nudge) for teaching Responsible Conduct of Research.  We partnered with the campus Summer Multicultural Access to Research Training (SMART) program to engage under-represented minorities in the development of a text based game for engaging students in case studies through interactive choice.   With Nudge we provided summer research experiences to an additional 7 undergraduates.   Of these 55 undergraduates (both iGEM and Nudge), roughly 1/3 have moved on to graduate school and another third to industry.
