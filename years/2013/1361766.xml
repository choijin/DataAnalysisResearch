<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic and Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Steven R Kass of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota will explore networks of hydrogen bonds. The goal of this research is to learn about the consequences of multiple hydrogen bonds and develop new environmentally friendly acids, bases, catalysts, and sensors, as well as a better understanding of how enzymes work. This project lies at the interface of organic, physical, analytical, and biochemistry, and as such it is well suited for educating and training students from high school to graduate and postgraduate studies. Large numbers of students are exposed to this research in organic chemistry classes and the department's NSF-REU, Lando (domestic and international) and Khorana/Bose (international) summer research programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bio-inspired acids, bases, hydrogen bond catalysts, and anion molecular receptors which make use of multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonds will be prepared. Their properties (e.g., pKa's) and reactivities will be explored, and new insights into hydrogen bond networks will be obtained. By carrying out a variety of physical measurements including those in the gas phase, and examining chiral reagents, the effect of different types of hydrogen bonds will be determined. This should facilitate the design and development of useful reagents and sensors, as well as providing insights into naturally occurring biological processes such as enzyme-catalyzed transformations, protein folding, and ion transport.</AbstractNarration>
