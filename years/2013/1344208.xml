<AbstractNarration>This project supports the development of a Research Coordination Network for Undergraduate Biology Education centered on expanding the use of and knowledge about two effective teaching approaches:  case studies and problem based learning (PBL). Using these approaches, students collaboratively analyze a scenario that presents a biological issue within a realistic setting.  Students then conduct investigations and report findings.  Case studies or PBL have been shown to help undergraduates develop superior skills in question formulation and data analysis while they learn as much content as with traditional methods. The Case Study and PBL Network will stimulate pedagogical innovation while furthering understanding of the effectiveness of these methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The Case Study and PBL network brings together the expertise and resources of several existing U.S. centers for case studies and PBL in a unified effort to engage other biology faculty in using, developing or conducting research on these teaching approaches. The network will bring to fruition the potential for these pedagogies to utilize emerging technologies, data analysis and quantitative reasoning in biology learning while addressing NRC recommendations for problem-based, interdisciplinary biology education.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This project deliberately encourages and supports participation by members of traditionally underrepresented groups: minority faculty and minority serving institutions, community college faculty, graduate students and post docs. All institutional types from a wide range of geographic locations (including international members) are expected to participate. Recruitment will begin with existing mailing lists from the case study and PBL centers (over 10,000 people). The network will organize and stimulate the dissemination of resources, findings, and opportunities, and will encourage members to develop new projects and research proposals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education efforts.</AbstractNarration>

In particular, we developed these pedagogies to frame the learning of biology utilizing emerging technologies, data analysis and quantitative reasoning and to extend these efforts to other sciences.        Intellectual Merit:   Using a series of small and large network conferences, case development fellowships and an electronic communication platforms, the RCN UBE focused on two elements: (1) research on case study and PBL effectiveness in a wide variety of undergraduate institutional settings, and (2) providing a workspace where individuals using or wanting to use these pedagogies can find key information, opportunities, and support for their work as well as share their own questions, experiences, and findings. In year 3, we added Case fellows and SOTL fellows.     Our main activities of the Case Study and PBL Network included 20 small and 8 larger conferences hosted by case fellows. In addition, we began to use the NSF supported QUBES hub and STEM Central to extend discussions and working groups on case and PBL materials. We found that smaller working groups were more productive than the online community for undergraduate case developers and researchers. Social media sites are another useful tool in engaging new case and PBL users in sharing ideas and building collaborations to promote these pedagogies of engagement in undergraduate biology education.     Key accomplishments were the preparation and submission of three topical RCN case grants and a major grant for evolution cases.  So far three of the grants have been funded.  We are also working with the Native American Higher Education group on a case and PBL based INCLUDES submission.     Broader impact: Through presentations at BioQUEST and ASMCUE we reached over 800 new faculty and future faculty.  Our 40 case fellows created and published over 80 new cases and also conducted workshops that reached over 200 additional current and future faculty. Our fellows and participants represented faculty at community colleges, minority serving institutions, research intensive universities and liberal arts colleges.
