<AbstractNarration>Non-technical: This award by the Biomaterials Program in the Division of Materials Research to Arizona State University will use DNA nanostructures to study how quasi-crystals form.  Quasi-crystals are structures that exhibit long-range order but are not periodic.  In 2011 the Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to a scientist who discovered a type of crystal so unique that it completely changed the way that we view solid matter. That the discovery of quasi-crystals has led to a paradigm shift in material science is an understatement. Most crystals are precise three dimensional arrangements of atoms that repeat infinitely in a very ordered way. However, quasi-crystals are unlike other crystals; they have perfectly ordered infinite patterns that never repeat. As a result of their unique arrangement, quasicrystalline materials have special properties that have found use in everyday objects such as turbine blades, non-stick frying pans, and surgical instruments and LED lights. This grant supports research to construct self-assembled quasi-crystal materials from DNA nanostructures. The PIs will use DNA nanostructures to study how quasicrystals form, and how their structure leads to unique and useful properties and behavior. This information will ultimately be used to create new and useful biomaterials for a variety of applications. This research will have societal implications beyond the obvious value to basic scientific discovery - it will create opportunities to engage undergraduate, graduate, and underrepresented minority students to participate in cutting edge research and innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: This grant supports research to construct self-assembling quasi-crystal materials using rationally designed DNA nanostructures. Quasi-crystals are structures that exhibit long-range order but are not periodic. Despite the unique and potentially useful properties that are likely to emerge, after three decades of research very little is known about synthetic and naturally occurring quasicrystals or the mechanism of their formation. The creation of artificial DNA quasi-crystals will enable the discovery of the quasi-crystal growth mechanisms, and provide a novel platform to organize functional materials that display unique properties and collective behavior. This platform will allow the PIs to reach a level of structural complexity that does not exist in nature, thus creating unprecedented opportunities for engineering novel biomaterials. This project will create new cutting edge research opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and underrepresented minority students and present summer research opportunities for local high school students and teachers through full-scale online mass-mentorship in mathematics, science, engineering and technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report for Award Number: 1360635  Self-assembling Quasi-crystals from DNA Tiles     Quasi-crystal is an ordered, aperiodic structure, in which translational symmetry is lacking. The Bragg diffraction pattern of quasi-crystals shows symmetry orders different from classical crystals in nature. Quasi-crystalline materials have potential applications in surface coating for energy conversion, heat insulation and corrosion resistance. However, it remains challenging to construct designer quasi-crystalline materials in a programmable way since the formation mechanism of quasicrystal is not well-understood. Self-assembling of DNA nanostructures is a promising approach to engineer bio-molecular, two-dimensional (2D) materials with nanometer precision.This proposal focuses on the construction self-assembling quasi-crystal materials using rationally designed DNA nanostructures.    Intellectual Merit  With the support from this award, we conducted the proposed research following two major approaches.   First, DNA oligos were engineered to crystallize into two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) crystalline lattices by combining branched DNA unit, termed DNA tiles, with sticky-ended cohesion. Several types of novel crystals have been successfully constructed as designed as a demonstration of the superior programmability of DNA as the basic building material. Specifically, low-symmetry multi-arm DNA tiles were designed to assemble complex DNA tessellations, which is known to be the transition layer between classic crystal and quasi-crystal. The toolbox of DNA structural motifs has been greatly enriched by the proposed research.   Second, various DNA origami shapes and interactions were programmed in a controllable, hierarchical, and efficient way in order to create geometrically complex DNA tessellations. DNA origami was feasibly folded into quasi-crystalline patterns with 5 or 8-fold symmetries and well-designed sizes. Moreover, DNA origami nanostructures which represent different equilateral polygon geometries were designed in a mutually-compatible way and assembled hierarchically into 2D crystalline lattices, which indicated the achievement of a higher level of structural complexity.  Our results demonstrate an effective strategy of creating complex DNA tessellation by the accurate control of shape, size, angle and interaction, indicating the critical role of user-defined building units with mutually compatible geometries and tunable binding strength for scaling up the size and complexity of bottom-up self-assembly.   Broader Impact  A group of postdocs, graduate students and undergraduate students were involved in conducting the cutting-edge research and innovation. Opportunities were provided for students and postdocs to present their results at academic conferences. General design strategies for creating complex DNA structures were made available to the public who are interested in getting involved in the research of molecular design and biomimetics.
