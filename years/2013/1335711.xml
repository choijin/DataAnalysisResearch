<AbstractNarration>CBET 1335711&lt;br/&gt;David Cwiertny&lt;br/&gt;University of Iowa&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trenbolone acetate (TBA) is a high-value anabolic growth promoter used extensively in animal agriculture, yet its metabolites are potent endocrine disrupting compounds in aquatic organisms.  Recently, the rapid phototransformation of TBA metabolites, long thought to mitigate their environmental risk, was found to be reversible in surface waters at ambient conditions.  This unprecedented behavior results in unique diurnal cycling and substantial regeneration of TBA metabolites at rates that are temperature and pH dependent, implying unrecognized persistence for these emerging contaminants in surface waters.  Notably, reversible photohydration also appears to occur for structurally analogous compounds, including some human pharmaceuticals, suggesting that dienone and trienone steroids may represent a new class of environmental contaminants whose behavior confounds nearly all current predictive fate models and regulatory ecosystem risk assessment paradigms.  Motivated by these findings, this project represents a comprehensive mechanistic investigation of dienone and trienone steroid phototransformation. The PIs hypothesize that the occurrence, fate, transport and ecological risks of these steroids cannot be accurately assessed without evaluating photoproduct formation and long-term stability.   Focusing efforts primarily on TBA metabolites due to their widespread use and capability for endocrine disruption, this study will (i) characterize TBA metabolite phototransformation products; (ii) determine environmental factors promoting the formation of metastable products capable of reversion to parent structures or related steroidal analogs; (iii) explore whether reversible photohydration is generalizable to other dienone and trienone steroids and pharmaceuticals; and (iv) assess quantitatively conservation of bioactivity for structurally similar steroidal transformation products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a class, dienone and trienone steroids are among the most potent used therapeutically as pharmaceuticals or illicitly as performance enhancing agents. Included in this compound class are trenbolone acetate, an anabolic steroid used as a growth promoter for the overwhelming majority of beef cattle produced in the United States, and dienogest, a progestin used as an oral contraceptive that is 10 times as potent as levonorgestrel (i.e., Plan B).  While these compounds readily degrade in sunlight, the products of this photoreaction are unstable and ultimately decompose or revert into the bioactive steroid from which they were generated. Thus, this project will establish dienone and trienone steroids as a new class of environmental contaminants whose transformations do not necessarily reduce threats to ecosystem health, thereby challenging fundamental paradigms by which we as a community assess and control the risk posed by contaminants.  Collectively, outcomes of this project will facilitate the improved assessment of the occurrence, fate, transport, and modeling of dienone and trienone steroids in natural systems, and provide insights for optimization of engineered treatment systems designed to protect vulnerable aquatic ecosystems by sequestering or transforming this emerging contaminant class.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We now realize that there are far more chemicals present in our water supplies than are currently regulated for protection of surface or drinking water.  A major challenge for future water management will be developing approaches to assess confidently the risks posed to human and ecosystem health by these unregulated, emerging contaminant classes and their mixtures. However, existing paradigms for risk assessment and fate of emerging pollutant classes are confounded by instances where environmental reactions of contaminants yield products with retained or unique bioactivity. This scenario, in which contaminant transformation does not fully eliminate risk, requires a new, more holistic approach to contaminant fate and risk assessment, one where transformation pathways and reaction products are also evaluated.  Trenbolone acetate (TBA) is a potent synthetic steroidal androgen commonly used in animal agriculture as a growth promoter. We recently discovered a unique fate pathway for TBA metabolites, where their degradation in sunlight via a reaction known as photohydration (i.e., light-assisted water addition) is reversible. Thus, in the dark, thermal dehydration (i.e., water loss) results in the regeneration of the TBA metabolites via a process we refer to as "product-to-parent reversion", thereby prolonging the persistence and adverse endocrine-disrupting effects of TBA metabolites in surface waters.  This study expanded upon and improved our understanding of the environmental fate and photochemical cycling of TBA metabolites. Specifically, the objectives of this project were to:  Improve upon our understanding of the reversible photohydration of TBA metabolites by isolating and structurally identifying their major phototransformation products, and determining the influence of common environmental variables (e.g., pH and temperature) on the rate and extent of product-to-parent reversion.  Assess more holistically the risks associated with TBA metabolites in agriculturally impacted surface waters by establishing the bioactivity, fate and effects of their major phototransformation products (or photohydrates). Examine whether this unique fate pathway occurs for other, structurally related steroids (e.g., steroidal dienones and trienones), and develop fundamental insights as to the structural features that promote reversible photohydration so as to identify other compounds and chemical classes that may also undergo this fate process in sunlit surface waters.   Project outcomes addressed these goals, and ultimately resulted in significant advances that may one day improve our approach to risk assessment and pollution management for potent synthetic steroid used in medicine, agriculture and commerce.  These specific outcomes include:  pH and temperature-dependent trends for TBA metabolite photohydration and reversion, which improve our ability to predict the persistence of these compounds in sunlit surface waters; Isolation and structural elucidation of the major products generated by direct photolysis of major TBA metabolites, as well as methods that can be used by other researchers to perform these tasks;  Computational chemical analyses to evaluate the rate-limiting steps in the reversion cycle, and thus those reaction processes most critical to environmental persistence;  Discovery that the unique photochemical cycling of TBA metabolites extends to structurally related steroidal classes including common dienones (e.g., dienogest) and trienones (e.g., altrenogest), while also demonstrating that the photoproducts of these transformations not only retain bioactivity, but also exhibit different bioactivity endpoints from their parent compounds.  For select dienone and trienones, we show that in addition to product-to-parent reversion, phototransformation can also lead to the formation of more persistent photoproducts that also exhibit retained and, at times distinct, bioactivity relative to the parent chemical from which they were produced (e.g., transformation of a progestin to an estrogen).   We also began to investigate whether these fate pathways are available to other, non-steroidal emerging contaminant classes, while also starting to assess whether such reversible fate pathways may also occur for other chemical oxidation/reduction pathways (e.g., disinfection with free chlorine).
