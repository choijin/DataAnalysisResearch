<AbstractNarration>This award will support attendance by students and postdocs affiliated with US institutions at the upcoming thematic trimester on Semantics of proofs and certified mathematics at the Institut Henri Poincare in Paris. The thematic trimester will run from April 22, 2014 until July 11, 2014. The purpose of this thematic trimester is to provide a forum for the extended community of researchers and students in computer science and mathematics interested in proof assistants, and more generally, in the mathematics of formal proofs. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include training the next generation of researchers in this important research area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     This grant is for participation in the thematic trimest "Semantics of proofs and certified computation", at the Institut Henri Poincare in Paris (France), April - July, 2014. The grant enabled selected doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows affiliated with U.S. institutions to participate in the trimester. The allocation of funds favored graduate students.     After years of steady development, the technology of proof assistants is coming to a mature state. It is possible today to formalize a non trivial mathematical proof inside a computer, and to check its correctness auto- matically. This "tour de force" has been recently achieved for the four color theorem and well as for the classification of finite groups, and a certified proof of the Kepler conjecture is on the way. These achievements would not have been possible without the rich and active mathematics of formal proofs which emerged in the 1970s at the frontier of logic and computer science, along the Curry-Howard correspondence. This seminal correspondence en- ables us to understand a logical proof (of a given formula) as a well-behaved program (of a given type). Besides this by now traditional connection be- tween logic and computer science, a number of unexpected connections are currently emerging with other fields of mathematics &ndash; this including homo- topy theory, higher dimensional algebra, quantum topology, topos theory, functional analysis and operator algebra.

The purpose of the thematic trimester at Institut Henri Poincar ?e (IHP) is to provide a forum for the extended community of researchers and students in mathematics and in computer science interested in proof assistants, and more generally, in the mathematics of formal proofs.   A central topic of the trimester was the recent connections discovered between type theory and homotopy theory based on the interpretation of identity types as path spaces. These connections provide a new topological intuition that facilitates working with type theories and allow for new computational tools for manipulating homotopy-theoretic structures.
