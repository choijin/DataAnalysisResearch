<AbstractNarration>This action funds Darren Seibert of Massachusetts Institute of Technology to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at RIKEN in Wako, Japan.  The project title is "Encoding Human Brain Activity Using a Multi-Staged Model of Visual Object Perception." The host scientist is Justin Gardner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is easy to take for granted our ability to visually perceive the world. Making sense of the vast amount of information transmitted nearly continuously from our retinae is not a trivial problem: it requires approximately one third of the human cortex to process. Our ability to effortlessly recognize a vast array of objects in tenths of a second, despite being cast on the retina with different illuminations, positions, and rotations, represents the end stage of the so-called ventral pathway. This project contributes to the reverse engineering of object recognition by expanding current prediction and fitting procedures. Specifically, it expands these procedures in order to better exploit the rich, spatially distributed response patterns in human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the fellow plans to make his analysis source code publicly available to aid other researchers and to facilitate learning.</AbstractNarration>
