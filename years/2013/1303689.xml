<AbstractNarration>Hot flow anomalies (HFAs) are kinetic phenomena observed near planetary bow shocks that are characterized by heated plasma and flow deflection. The objective of this proposal is to determine the properties of HFAs and their generating mechanisms. The study will systematically survey two types of HFAs. They are traditional HFAs which are associated with interplanetary magnetic field discontinuities and spontaneous HFAs which occur in the absence of magnetic field discontinuities. This study will use a large data base from the Cluster and THEMIS satellites coupled with analytic theory and hybrid simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator (PI) is a young woman assistant professor and this grant will support a female graduate student. The results of this study will be used in the PI's classes. She will make the data base available.</AbstractNarration>

We found that magnetic field on at least one side of the interplanetary discontinuities has to be connected to the bow shock in order to form HFAs.
