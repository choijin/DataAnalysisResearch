<AbstractNarration>Professors Paul J. Chirik of Princeton University, and Elizabeth Jarvo of the University of California-Irvine, are supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to chair a workshop to discuss the opportunities and difficulties in seeking abundant, relatively non-toxic, and inexpensive alternatives for precious metal catalysts.  The workshop brings together a diverse group of established and emerging leaders in order to address the lack of readily available synthetic precursors, the suppression of deleterious radical chemistry, the identification and optimization of unique mechanistic pathways and metal properties, and the implementation of spectroscopic and theoretical/computational methods for characterizing open shell transition metal compounds serving as catalysts in homogeneous reactions.  Each of these critical topics must be addressed for base metal catalysts to attain or surpass the success of their precious metal (e.g. platinum, palladium, gold, etc.) counterparts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catalysts plays a critical for the commercial production of renewable energy as well as for the manufacture of polymers and building materials, and the synthesis of chemicals and pharmaceuticals.  This workshop focuses on fundamental research in which rare, expensive, and/or toxic metals are replaced with earth-abundant, inexpensive, and benign chemicals.  Industrial participation underscores the practical challenges associated with base metal catalysis in the commercial economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to broaden dissemination, this workshop is coupled with the Fall American Chemical Society National Meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana (Sept. 8-12, 2013). Additionally, the workshop proceedings and conclusions are disseminated to the scientific community through websites and a workshop report.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF SusChem Workshop on base metal catalysis was held in conjuction with a two-day Symposium at the 246th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Indianapolis, Indiana. The motivation for these events was the recognition that base metal catalysis is an essential component and driver of sustainable chemistry. Catalysis research occurs in many places and with many objectives &ndash; the chemical industry, academia and national laboratories are all home to catalysis research with emphasis on applications ranging from medicines to commodity to materials to energy. Participants were therefore chosen from each of these sectors in an attempt to capture both scientific and demographic diversity. The combined event explored contemporary and emerging challenges as well as presented the most recent findings. Together important areas for future growth in research, outreach, education and collaboration were identified.  A report outlining the key findings of the NSF SusChem Workshop is available to NSF and the broader community via the NSF Catalysis webpage.  The workshop and ACS Symposium have a strong positive impact on researchers across chemistry.  Defining questions and challenges increases awareness of issues related to base metal catalysis and galvanize fundamental research to accelerate discoveries with long-term application in catalysis, energy, and the industrial chemistry.  Furthermore, by moving toward base metal catalysts, we minimize American dependency on unstable foreign sources.  A range of researchers at every level, from undergraduate students to faculty, were engaged by coupling the workshop to a symposium at the National ACS Meeting.  Workshop participants presented seminars at a symposium, "Non-Precious Metal Catalysts: Opportunities and Impacts."  The symposium provided conference attendees with representative snapshots of cutting edge research in base metal catalysis, exemplified by the expertise of the invited participants       Last Modified: 02/09/2015       Submitted by: Elizabeth Jarvo]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
