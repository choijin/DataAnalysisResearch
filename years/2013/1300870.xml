<AbstractNarration>The objective of this collaborative research project is to predict product reliability in the earliest design stages, such as concept design. The prediction is based on information gathered from a variety of sources such as previous components and products, expert opinions, early prototype testing, and simulations. The project uses a Bayesian framework that aggregates and processes uncertain information. Quantifying product reliability in early design stages helps reduce risk and avoid costly and unnecessary design changes. This project uses a graphical model of probabilities to represent system reliability and a combination of subjective and objective information, using reliability-related data that are scattered, in different formats, at different levels of details, from various sources. Pulling together all this data allows for more accurate reliability prediction, leading to more effective actions identified early to prevent potential failures or reduce their likelihood. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project will improve design practices for all kinds of products, because reliability is a core element of product performance and directly determines customer satisfaction, product market share, and product safety. Specifically, this project will advance engineering design theory and methodology and expand the scope of reliability engineering. By quantitatively predicting product reliability early, the project provides engineers with a better way to achieve high reliability with reduced cost.</AbstractNarration>

The reliability considered in this project is the probability that a product performs its intended function without failures. Through comprehensive studies on the-state-of-the-art of the current reliability methodologies for early design stages, this project provides engineers with useful guidelines for selecting best approaches for their specific needs. The reliability methodologies developed in this project integrate all the information available to product designers in early design stages. Although information is limited and may not be precise (such as intervals), the predicted product reliability is more precise (with narrower bounds) than that from traditional methods. The ability of predicting product reliability more accurately enables engineers to make decisions more easily with respect to reliability. For instant, the most reliable design concepts can be selected by comparing their reliabilities predicted with the proposed methodologies. As reliability is a core element in the overall performance of almost all products, this project can help improve the reliability of a wide range of products. The inclusion of reliability in early design in design courses also enhances the awareness of uncertainty in all stages of a design process. It helps students better understand that reliability can be designed into products in the conceptual design stage, in addition to the reliability-based design in the later detailed design stage.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/27/2017<br>      Modified by: Xiaoping&nbsp;Du</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1300870/1300870_10261691_1509162539763_Fig--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1300870/1300870_10261691_1509162539763_Fig--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Concept selection"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1300870/1300870_10261691_1509162539763_Fig--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Concept selection"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Concept Selection with Predicted System Reliability</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xiaoping Du</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaoping&nbsp;Du</div> <div class="imageTitle">Concept selection</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
