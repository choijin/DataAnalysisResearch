McCaa&lt;br/&gt;Anne Meier&lt;br/&gt;University of Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) project is creating fundamental infrastructure for scientific research, education, and policy-making. The collaborators have created the world's largest population database, with information describing 545 million persons drawn from 238 censuses and surveys of 74 countries between 1960 and 2011. This proposal continues funding to build, enrich, and freely disseminate a microdata resource of unprecedented scale and scope. This next project phase expands the coverage of the database, preserves it for future generations, and disseminates the data to users around the world.  This project focuses on five major activities: (1) Data acquisition and long-run preservation; (2) Data cleaning and processing; (3) Creating comprehensive documentation to guide users on the meaning of census and survey responses and their comparability across time and space; (4) Improving the web-based dissemination and analysis system and conducting  an expanded program of education and dissemination activities; and 5) Developing with national statistical agencies a secure dissemination system for data that pose disclosure risks, making a vast new trove of big data available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IPUMS is critical scientific infrastructure. The extraordinary growth and redistribution of population and economic resources are reshaping the planet. To meet the challenges created by rapid demographic, economic, and environmental change, researchers must have full and open access to the best possible information. Richly detailed population data spanning the globe over multiple decades are indispensable for creating the next generation of social science and environmental models. IPUMS data have already stimulated new research that transcends national boundaries and static interpretation. The expansion, improvement, and support of the database are directly relevant to the central mission of the NSF to promote the progress of science. The next project phase will leverage the NSF's previous investments and make IPUMS an even more powerful resource for understanding the causes and consequences of the sweeping transformations of the human population. This infrastructure will multiply the quality, quantity, accessibility, and interoperability of information about the changing population, creating a transnational resource of unprecedented power for understanding human society on a global scale. By disseminating big microdata, this project will enhance scientific understanding of critical policy-related issues such as population aging, international migration, climate change, and the effects of government programs on economic development and well-being. The project will promote teaching through:  (1) online data analysis and sharing of curricular materials for teaching; (2) conducting training workshops and developing online instructional modules on data usage; and (3) employing a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate research assistants, including members of underrepresented groups, who will develop valuable new skills in a stimulating interdisciplinary en</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The International Integrated Microdata Series project supported the development of the world's largest collection of population data. Nearly 400 censuses from roughly 100 countries are incorporated into the database, which is available online to researchers. Unlike the published tables that are produced with every census, the Integrated Microdata Series contains each person's individual responses to all the census questions, as well as the responses of everyone in their household. This allows researchers to develop customized measures and to use the data for purposes that were not envisioned when the censuses were taken. For example, during the Covid-19 pandemic, researchers turned to the database to determine the number of elderly persons around the world who were living in households with younger persons, which increased their risk of exposure to the disease. Without the individual-level data, such measures would have been impossible to construct. Because the data are so flexible, no names or other identifying information are included, to ensure privacy. More than 20,000 scholars and policy makers have accessed the data more than 100,000 times for research purposes. During this grant renewal period (9/1/2014-8/31/2020), IPUMS International released 82 new census samples, merged in 44 historical censuses (most being full count), and began adding data sets (65) from labor force surveys. We completely overhauled our geographic data processing to include map creation and geographic variable harmonization over the course of the grant period. This work enables mapping of IPUMS data, cross-temporal comparative work, and facilitates interoperability with other data types and sources. We created new training and curricular materials, negotiated new data agreements with more than a dozen countries, and reached new global and interdisciplinary data users. We made significant technological upgrades and improved efficiency in the areas of both data processing and web-based data and metadata dissemination.This project required collaboration with the national statistical offices of dozens of countries, each of which had to agree to the public distribution of their data by an American institution, which is not the norm. The primary challenge was to make these data collected by so many contributors across multiple decades compatible across countries. We recoded the data to make them consistent and created extensive English-language documentation describing comparability issues. Censuses are not just counts of people, but contain a wealth of information on a host of topics, such as education, work, migration,fertility, housing, and disability. These data, describing over one billion persons, are now available to users everywhere at no cost.
