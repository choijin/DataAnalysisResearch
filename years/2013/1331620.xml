<AbstractNarration>How do young children learn so much about the world so quickly and accurately? And how can they learn so much when, at the same time, they often seem so irrational and unpredictable? The research in this proposal will help answer these questions by bringing together ideas from computer science with research on very young children. The basic idea is that young children learn in some of the same ways as the most powerful machine-learning programs. Both the children and the computers explore a wide range of more and less likely possibilities. Moreover, children may sometimes actually explore more widely than adults and so be smarter or at least more open-minded learners. Some of their apparently irrational play, like their wide-ranging pretend play, may really reflect powerful learning methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work should have significant broader impact for educational practice. If we understand children's basic natural rational learning mechanisms we can use those mechanisms to help teach science more effectively. In particular, there are significant practical questions about how we can leverage children's spontaneous play to help them learn.  Similarly, this research has impact for studies of developmental disabilities such as autism and mental retardation. There is reason to think that children with these syndromes may have particular difficulty with the kind of learning about possibilities that is facilitated by pretend play, and understanding that learning may help us understand and remedy these difficulties.</AbstractNarration>

In this project we used computational ideas, particularly from the "probabilistic models" or Bayesian inference approach to try to answer these questions We completed and published several studies of children's causal learning within the framework of sampling and search in probabilistic models. One set of studies showed that ideas from computer science and machine learning about "sampling" could help to explain how children learn about cause and effect. Another set of studies looked at children's ability to infer abstract relational concepts, like "same? and "different", in a causal setting,and showed that children as young as 18 months old could learn and use these concepts.  A third set of studies showed that young children can actually outperform adults in inferring an unusual or unlikely causal hypothesis, in both social and physical settings. We found this counter-intuitive "kids better than adults" pattern when we gave the same causal learning problems to participants from 4 to adulthood.

Adolescents and preschoolers were actually more flexible than either school-aged children or adults.
