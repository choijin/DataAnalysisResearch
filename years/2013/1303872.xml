<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2013 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Laura Rider is "Equivariant Sheaves and Formality in Representation Theory." The host institution for the fellowship is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Roman Bezrukavnikov.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     My research is in an area known as geometric representation theory. To give a sense of what this means, I'll first explain what representation theory and geometry mean separately.   The symmetries of an object contain some of the most useful information about that object. However, it is often very difficult to systematically identify symmetries of objects we cannot picture---for instance, a figure living in four or more dimensions. On the other hand, linear algebra is considered by mathematicians to be 'easy' and extremely useful. That is, it is well understood by mathematicians and most scientific, engineering, and technological developments use linear algebra. The goal of representation theory is to apply our understanding of linear algebra to make sense of symmetries.  By `geometry', I mean studying a geometric space using sheaf theory. Sheaves are special generalizations of functions. Why sheaves? Functions are such a central concept in mathematics that one cannot escape middle school without getting a taste of them. Grothendieck suggested we replace functions with sheaves, which remember more information about the related geometry. Some examples of geometric spaces I study include the Springer resolution and the nilpotent cone which are shown in the picture. The special point indicated on the nilpotent cone is an example of a singular point.   With geometric representation theory, we try to build bridges between these two worlds: geometry and representation theory. The structure of singularities in some geometric space---encoded by the local behavior of perverse sheaves---often contains deep information about related representation theory.  One example of this phenomenon is known as the Springer correspondence. In this case, the geometry of the nilpotent cone is used to understand the representation theory of a collection of symmetries built out of reflections. My work involved extending this relationship to have an algebraic description of the entire (equivariant derived) category of sheaves on the nilpotent cone.   Another example is known as the geometric Satake equivalence. In this case, the geometry of an infinite dimensional space called the affine Grassmannian is used to understand some `dual' representation theory. In some of my work, I helped to explain how to better understand this relationship in the `modular' setting using the Springer resolution. This connection has been crucial in extending our knowledge of symmetries in the modular case.            Last Modified: 09/28/2017       Submitted by: Laura Rider]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
