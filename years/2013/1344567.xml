<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to establish new methods and equipment to produce nanocomposites for biomedical applications at increased volume for direct translation to industry. This new synthesis method will combine electrospray, a top-down, continuous spraying process, with self-assembly, a bottom-up process that occurs spontaneously. Three equipment configurations will be examined to optimize the ratio of particle formation speed (i.e., kinetics) to particle quality (i.e., thermodynamics). This process will be developed in collaboration with experts in science communication to ensure that appropriate societal, ethical, and environmental health and safety considerations are integrated into the process design as it is being developed. The results of this process will be evaluated in two industrial test-beds focusing on biomedical imaging and separations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will addresses critical roadblocks in nanocomposite commercialization by providing a continuous manufacturing strategy for nanocomposite formation. Because electrospray droplet morphology is tightly controlled, this method should enable greater process control and improved particle uniformity, reproducibility, and scale. This research will study three nanocomposites with strong commercialization potential: composite magnetic nanoparticles, composite quantum dots (QDs), and magnetic QDs, which have potential applications in biomedical imaging, clinical diagnostics, and pharmaceutical separations. However, this approach could be used to manufacture composites containing any hydrophobic components smaller than the nanocontainer, and could thus impact a diverse range of fields including electronics, optics, and energy. Broad sharing of our endeavor to safely commercialize new nanocomposite products will be undertaken by two outstanding non-profit educational partners: Edheads, award-winning education web game producers, and the Museum of Science, Boston, lead of the NSF Nanoscale Informal Science Education (NISE) Network.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The primary goal of this work was to develop new manufacturing methods for producing nanoparticles at commercial quantities. In particular, this work focused on polymer nanoparticles, known as micelles, which encapsulate cargoes that are not soluble in water. In this work, three types of cargoes were investigated: semiconductor quantum dot nanoparticles used in imaging, magnetic nanoparticles used in imaging and separations, and drug molecules such as dexamethasone.</p> <p>This work explored five methods of large scale nanoparticle manufacturing. The first consisted of a flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) approach previously developed by Prud&rsquo;homme that was used for comparative purposes (Fig.1). The second approach combined FNP with electrospray (aero-FNP), a process in which a high voltage is used to break-up a charged stream by charge repulsion, resulting in a fine droplet spray (Fig.2). Third, electrospray was also used to adapt a batch scale approach, known as interfacial instability, in which surfactant is used to induce droplet breakup by altering droplet surface tension (Fig.2). This process was known as aero-IS. Lastly, electrospray approaches were adapted so that spray occurred entirely in liquid, as opposed to through the air, resulting in liquid-in-liquid (LLE) versions of the FNP and IS processes (Fig. 3).</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>Of these approaches, one failed. FNP could not be faithfully created using electrospray in the classic aerosol configuration (aero-FNP), most likely as a result of the low flow rates achieved. FNP requires rapid mixing that could not be enabled with the flow rates we were able to obtain. The IS processes (Aero-IS and LLE-IS) generally yielded larger particles with a higher size distribution. However, these approaches were able to process longer polymers at higher rates than competing FNP and LLE-FNP approaches. The best process was achieved with LLE-FNP, which yielded extremely monodisperse particles of small, compact, uniform size. All of these processes (excepting aero-FNP) could be used to encapsulate nanoparticle and drug cargoes. However, FNP processes (FNP and LLE-FNP) had the highest encapsulation efficiencies ranging from ~ 30% to nearly 100%, depending on the cargo.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong>: In addition to the capabilities of these processes, environmental, health, and safety (EHS) concerns were evaluated as part of the manufacturing design process. Classical electrospray (aero) processes require travel of the nanoparticulates through the aerosol phase. Further, aero processes require solvent removal through evaporation, which can result in exposure to chlorinated solvents, an additional EHS concern. Nanomaterials present several hazards through inhalation routes, and particles as small as 5 nm have been shown capable of traveling to the brain via this approach. Thus, generally, aero processes should be avoided. FNP and LLE-FNP processes, in contrast, are contained entirely in the liquid phase, minimizing operator exposure.</p> <p>This work was disseminated to the scientific community through publications and conference presentations. This work provided training for 1 postdoctoral fellow, 10 graduate students, and 5 undergraduates. Many of these students have graduated and are now working in the nanotechnology field in industry (e.g., Intel, General Motors).</p> <p>This work was disseminated to the general public through podcasts, YouTube videos, and presentations at the Museum of Science-Boston (Fig. 4-5). The participants developed new museum materials and classroom materials for nanotechnology education. In addition, the group developed a video game on entrepreneurship highlighting this all-female team for middle school audiences (available from edheads.org) (Fig. 6).</p> <p>This work resulted in 1 issued patent and 1 patent pending. This work also supported collaborations with two companies. Quad Technologies evaluated products produced via these approaches. Core Quantum Technologies, a start-up company associated with Ohio State University, is developing diagnostic reagent products for cancer detection based on manufacturing processes evaluated here. This product will launch in early 2018. In addition, the process for magnetic nanoparticle encapsulation has yielded a product with the highest encapsulation percent recorded for a commercial product, enhancing ability to perform magnetic separations. Core Quantum is working on developing these materials as a follow on product for the pharmaceutical market. This work has indirectly led to 3 permanent jobs at these companies, with more expected in the coming year.</p> <p><strong>Summary: </strong>This work provides a critical evaluation of manufacturing processes for the nanotechnology industry, specifically process based on spray for the manufacture of polymer micelles. Collectively, these findings suggest that the LLE-FNP process is the preferred path forward for commercial scale manufacturing of micelles composed of block copolymers and encapsulating large cargoes. This approach minimizes EHS hazards and provides products with a high degree of cargo encapsulation and small, uniform size. Potential applications range from materials for healthcare to consumer products and manufacturing industries.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/02/2018<br>      Modified by: Jessica&nbsp;O&nbsp;Winter</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1344567/1344567_10268165_1514935103320_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1344567/1344567_10268165_1514935103320_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1344567/1344567_10268165_1514935103320_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1: Flash nano-preciptation configuration.
