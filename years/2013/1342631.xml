<AbstractNarration>The research team has developed a thermostable and acidotolerant mobile enzyme sequestration platform (mESP) system capable of enhancing deconstruction efficiency of pretreated lignocellulosic substrates. The current research is focused on preparing this technology for use in 2nd-generation bioethanol production processes, and can also be employed in corn-based (1st-generation) production. The technology enhances the efficiency of enzyme-mediated processes that deconstruct pretreated feedstock and convert complex carbohydrates to simple fermentable sugars. The research team plans to upscale mESP technology from a laboratory-scale system to an industrial system that can potentially; accelerate the development second generation mESP prototypes for lignocellulosic (2nd-generation) production processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of mESP systems can result in significant savings for 1st-generation bioethanol producers and open markets for 2nd-generation products.  Additionally, mESPs enable wider-spread production of lignocellulosic-based biofuels (2nd generation) by providing another option for high efficiency feedstock deconstruction. Opportunities to use mESPs in bioremediation and food production will also be explored by this I-Corps team.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Intellectual Merit.  The purpose of this project was to determine the feasibility of commercializing a novel enzyme technology for use in biofuels production processes.  Research focused on enhancing the efficiency of feedstock conversion to produce a economically viable alternative liquid fuel product, or biofuel, is considered scientifically meritorious due to fluctuations in fossil fuel prices and availability.  Using a thermostable and acidotolerant protein platform system, it was determined that processing of both corn-based (1st-generation) as well as cellulosic (2nd-generation) ethanol products could be enhanced using this novel technology while lowering overall per gallon production costs when compared to traditional processing methods.    Broader Impacts.  Commercialization of this technology will provide new opportunities for local, regional, and national producers to enhance corn-based production by reducing costs associated with enzyme-mediated processes. In addition, the technology has the potential to stimulate the lignocellulosic-based biofuels market by providing a novel option for high efficiency feedstock deconstruction. This project has the potential for broad impact across several industries beyond the biofuels market. For example, opportunities to use this technology in bioremediation and food production may also be an option. Future investigation into the feasibility of employing this technology into other enzyme-mediated processes will extend the breadth of impact.
