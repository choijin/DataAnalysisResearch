<AbstractNarration>This action funds Joanna Corby of University of Virginia to conduct a research project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at University of New South Wales in Kensington, New South Wales.  The project title is "Mapping  Molecules in the Center of the Milky Way." The host scientists are Dr. Maria Cunningham and Dr. Paul Jones. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project utilizes Australia's radio telescope observatories to constrain the physics and chemistry of Sagittarius B2, a molecular gas cloud in the Milky Way's Galactic Center with active star formation.  The project maps spectral line emission and absorption by organic and pre-biotic molecules and provides information on the spatial distributions of these species that is essential for determining the chemical reaction networks that produce them.  Data analysis focuses on molecules that provide specific insight into physical processes, including the passage of shocks.  This details the kinematics and geometry of highly energetic processes in the central 600 light years of the Galaxy.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the data resulting from this collaboration will be used to train and motivate a younger generation of scientists, drawing on the Fellows work with high school students in central Virginia on 8-month research projects in astrochemistry. Project data will also be used in planned research in 2013-2014.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Within giant clouds of gas and dust, new stars are born.  Before any stars form within them, these nurseries are dark and cold.  As soon as the stars form, they become bright in radio and infrared light, but remain hidden in visible light for a few million years.  Finally, they become the bright, colorful nebulae infamous for their beauty.    This project studies the second stage of star formation, in which the nebulae are bright at radio wavelengths but are obscured at visible wavelengths.  Specifically, the project focuses on Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2), a uniquely interesting nebula. Sgr B2 is located in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.  It is not in the immediate environment of the central supermassive black hole, located ~400 light years away, but it is within a zone of the Galaxy in which gas behaves exotically.  In this zone, complex molecular chemistry is ubiquitous, so that the seeds of life, "prebiotic molecules", are widespread and abundant.  All stellar nurseries throughout the Galaxy generate prebiotic chemistry, but nowhere in the Galaxy do we see more diverse and complex molecular chemistry than in Sgr B2.   The project provides unprecedented information on the molecular chemistry of Sgr B2, providing high spatial resolution images of the region in tens of thousands of spectral channels.  This enables the researchers to map the locations of more than a hundred different molecules, most of which participate in the rich organic chemistry that may lead to extraterrestrial life.  The project uses a new class of telescope that has only recently become available, namely broadband radio interferometers. This is the first survey conducted by this class of telescope to be published.  While the broad goal of the project is to determine the connection between the physical structure and molecular chemistry of Sgr B2, this goal requires the contributions of a large number of studies and a large number of researchers.  The individual NSF-funded study included releasing the data survey, developing ways of handling the data through programming code, and a preliminary analysis of molecular gas in Sgr B2.  The method of handling the data is detailed in Corby et al. (2015), Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, accepted.  In this work, we applied the code to the data in order to study the molecular compositions of gas clouds in Sgr B2 and to constrain the arrangement of the gas clouds within the complicated physical structure of Sgr B2.
