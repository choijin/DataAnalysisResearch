<AbstractNarration>This award is for support for U.S. participation in the Arctic Observing Summit 2013 (AOS 2013).  The AOS 2013 is the first in a planned series of high-level, biennial international Arctic observing summits.  The AOS is led by the International Study for Arctic Change (ISAC) as part of the implementation of the observing change component of the ISAC Science Plan.  It is a task of the Arctic Council's Sustaining Arctic Observing Networks (SAON) initiative and as such is also part of the broader SAON implementation process, which is led by the Arctic Council jointly with the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).  Support is sought for U.S. participant costs, and specifically for the participation of early career scientists and representatives of Alaska Native organizations and communities engaged in observing activities or requiring observational information.  Exposure to the international community engaged in the diverse aspects of arctic observing and the process by which coordination and collaboration across multiple scientific and other boundaries will benefit early career scholars who will ultimately be responsible for creating the synergies and collaborations needed for the future.  The participation of Alaska Native groups will ensure that the AOS outcomes reflect their observing needs and will serve to build the community of partners to advance arctic observing over the coming years.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ARCTIC OBSERVING SUMMIT 2013 The Arctic Observing Summit (AOS)is a biennial event held in conjunction with Arctic Science Summit Week (ASSW). The AOS is led by the International Study of Arctic Change (ISAC) and is a task of the Sustaining Arctic Observing Networks (SAON) process[1]. SAON is an initiative of the Arctic Council and the International Arctic Science Committee. The AOS contributes to the SAON process through the synthesis of Arctic knowledge, and engagement of a broad stakeholder community in discussions around the development, design, implementation and long term support of a system for the collection of information on the physical, biological and human components of the Arctic. Participants in the AOS also work to identify areas where more information is needed and to prioritize the application of observational information to real world problem solving.  The inaugural AOS (http://www.arcticobservingsummit.org/), washeld in April  2013 in Vancouver, B.C., Canada, and supported in part by NSF. It brought together representatives of a cross-section of the Arctic community to deliberate on community-driven, science-based guidance for the design, implementation, coordination and sustained operation of an international network of Arctic observing systems. Participants from across the academic spectrum, from government, public and private sectors, aboriginal organizations and non-governmental organizations, established the need, interest, and urgency to contribute to, and derive benefits from, an integrated, comprehensive, and adaptive Arctic observing system that incorporates both the best of earth/space technologies, and community-based observing and local and traditional knowledge where appropriate. It was also recognized that a sustained Arctic observing system requires commitment and dialogue with international partners, funders, communicators, and community and policy leaders.  Recommendations stemming from AOS 2013  on the design, implementation process, engagement of researchers and research users, priorities, and working towards resolving challenges for an integrated Arctic observing system were obtained from Summit breakout groups, during panel discussions, from white papers, and through general participation prior, during and following the Summit. The over 100 recommendations illustrate that circumpolar nations, as well as non-Arctic countries, are ready and willing to contribute to a sustained, coordinated network for Arctic observing. Progress has been made on identifying Arctic observing needs, capacity, priorities, and on building international consensus and strengthening partnerships. Recommendations are grouped into the following thematic areas and related categories: 1.     Status of the Current Observing System  Tasks for System Inventory Closing Gaps  2.     Observing System Design  Stakeholder Perspectives on Design, Implementation and Operation Other Design Considerations Improvements to Existing Infrastructure 3.     Stakeholders and Arctic Observation Communication Capacity Building  4.     Coordination for Improved Arctic Observing Mechanisms for Coordination Funding Technology and Innovation  5.     Data Data Management and Sharing Data Rescue Data Products 6.     White Papers Process and Need  7.     Other Recommendations    Publications Policy  There are a series of very specific recommendations and identified tasks associated with each of these thematic areas and categories that will be spelled out in detail in the final publication of AOS 2013. This is available as a PDF at www.arcticobservingsummit.org. The next AOS will take place March 12-15 2016 at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, (http://www.arcticobservingsummit.org/aos-2016) in conjunction with ASSW 2016 (http://www.assw2016.org/) and other events associated with the US Chairmanship of the Arctic Council including the Arctic Council Senior Officials meeting.
