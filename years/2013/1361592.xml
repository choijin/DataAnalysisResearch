<AbstractNarration>This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project, co-funded by the Atmospheric Chemistry Program and the Environmental Chemical Science Program, is focused on laboratory experiments to measure important physical and chemical properties of selected chemical species that mimic the behavior of small particles and aerosol found in atmosphere. These properties are important for modeling cloud and ice formation and are needed for improving weather and climate models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Measurements are being made of the temperature dependent solubilities and glass transition temperatures as a function of concentration for aqueous organic acid/metals/ammonium sulfate solutions that contain solutes relevant for understanding the behavior of upper tropospheric aerosols. Properties of glassy organic acid salts and their mixtures with ammonium sulfate are of special interest because recent research suggests that glassy organic aerosol particles are effective at forming ice nuclei. The results of this effort will be used in climate models to make better predictions of how clouds and ice in the atmosphere influence climate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has served to advance our understanding of solid formation in liquid atmospheric aerosols and droplets.  We have studied the conditions under which solids may form when organic species combine with metals in water solutions.  Both types of chemicals have been found to be present in atmospheric water drops.  The organic species come from a variety of sources that emit long chain compounds to the atmosphere, that are subsequently broken down to smaller molecules by atmospheric reactions.  Some of the most common chemicals that result from this process are malonic acid, succinic acid, and glutaric acid.  All of these compounds are soluble in water, and so have been detected in atmospheric aerosols and droplets.   Sea spray and man-made sources of chemicals are the source of metals in the atmosphere such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and iron.  Studies have shown that these metals can combine with the organic compounds in water to form metal-organic salts.  Generally, these compounds will not evaporate from the droplets.  In regions of the atmosphere with lower humidity, these water droplets can dry out, concentrating the chemicals in them, and causing some to be insoluble.  This can also occur at low temperature conditions in the atmosphere.  Because of this phenomena, it is important to understand the conditions under which the metal-organic compounds can crystallize from solution.   We studied these effects in our experiments, looking at the compounds that can form in solutions that contain either sodium or potassium metal and the organic compounds mentioned.  Generally, we found that adding potassium ions to solution results in compounds that are more soluble than the organic compound without metals present.  For sodium, we found the addition of this metal to organic-containing solutions resulted in compounds that are less soluble than when metals are absent.   Ammonium and sulfate have been found to be present in almost all atmospheric aerosols and droplets.  Thus, we also studied what compound would first crystallize in solutions of metals, organics, and ammonium sulfate.  Surprisingly, we found that a little-studied mineral called Lecontite forms most often from these mixtures.  This compound is a mixture of ammonium, sodium, sulfate, and water whose formal chemical name is ammonium sodium sulfate dihydrate.  This compound has been found in nature in the droppings of bats.  That it may readily form in atmospheric water drops is a new revelation and implies this compound should be studied further, as well as taken into account in computer models of atmospheric aerosol and cloud formation and chemistry.  In solutions that contain ammonium, sulfate, potassium, and organics, a similar compound has been found to almost exclusively form: potassium ammonium sulfate.  There appears to be very few studies on the properties of this compound, and so this too needs further investigation.  This project has had broader impact in that multiple undergraduate students have played a critical role in the research.  They have been trained in scientific research and operation of advanced scientific instrumentation.  They have learned and participated in scientific data analysis and interpretation.  All of the students have been co-authors on one or more peer-reviewed publications in scientific journals.  So far, all students have gone on to either careers in industry, or further study in graduate programs.        Last Modified: 09/30/2020       Submitted by: Keith D Beyer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
