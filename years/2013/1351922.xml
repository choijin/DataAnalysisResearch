<AbstractNarration>Organized interests are more likely to file friend of the Court briefs with the Supreme Court when the organization and the Court agree.  However, there have been both data and theoretical limits to the ability to test this hypothesis.  Spatial understandings of the law provide a significant theoretical advance on explaining judicial decisionmaking.  For any legal dispute, there are different legal precedents or rules that courts can adopt.  By locating the ideal policy positions of various interest groups in the same dimensions as those of the justices, this project will allow testing of hypotheses concerning whether legally mobilized interests are highly polarized, whether policy preferences change over time, and whether preferences track justices' voting preferences.  Measures do not currently exist, however, for the preferences of third parties advocating at the U.S. Supreme Court.  Thus, while the rise of interest advocacy is one of the defining features of the modern Court, researchers have been limited in the rigor with which they can test theories of the incidence and impact of the participation of these extra-legal actors, which range from interest groups to businesses to state governments to the United States, the latter represented by the Solicitor General.  To map the location of these actors in legal policy space this project proposes applying measurement innovations from the field of quantitative psychology to data on the positions articulated in decades-worth of amicus briefs filed at the Court.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will produce a searchable online database of the involvement of interests and governments at the Court, which will be a useful resource for researchers and students. The project will contribute to training students who are members of underrepresented groups, contributing to improved retention of students as well.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Organized interests (such as interest groups and businesses), the U.S. states, and the federal government (as represented by the solicitor general) regularly involve themselves in U.S. Supreme Court cases and essentially "lobby" the justices through the filing of amicus curiae briefs.  To better understand the involvement of these actors, we develop novel measures of their relative locations in the Supreme Court?s legal policy space; which can be viewed as an ideological continuum.  These measures will allow researchers to better examine, for example, the legal mobilization of organized interests, the conditional influence of organized interest advocacy on the Court?s decisions, and the degree to which states represent their citizens when advocating before the Court.  Treating the positions advocated in six decades worth of amicus curiae briefs as equivalent to votes in these Supreme Court cases, we employ a measurement model that provides facially valid estimates of the ideological locations of the 1) 600 organized interests most active at the modern Court, 2) 329 attorneys general representing the 50 states from 1953 through 2013, 3) 17 solicitors general representing the federal government from the Eisenhower through Obama administrations, and 4) 33 Supreme Court justices who served during this time span.  Importantly, the ideological positions of these extralegal actors are estimated simultaneously with positions for the justices, which means that we are locating organized interests, for example, and the justices in the same policy space or ideological continuum.  This allows the positions of these different types of actor to be compared in an "apples-to-apples" manner and used together in statistical models of interest advocacy or Court decision making.  These measures and the raw (but cleaned) amicus curiae data used to develop them can be found at http://amicispace.ucmerced.edu.  These new measures reveal a number of important features of the modern Supreme Court and the extralegal actors who seek to shape its rulings.  First, while certainly diverse and varied in terms of ideological location, the interests who "lobby" the Court are not as extreme or polarized as perhaps previously thought.  They are somewhat more liberal on average than the justices, but conservative positions are represented.  Second, the states occupy a more conservative region of legal policy space than the justices do and there has been an increasing polarization of the positions expressed by the states as a function of the partisanship of the attorneys general representing them.  It also appears that attorneys general adopt positions that are more influenced by their own partisanship than by the preferences of their state?s citizens.  Third, the locations of solicitors general depend upon the ideological orientation of the president who appointed them but they might also bend themselves towards the positions held by the justices in civil rights and liberties cases.
