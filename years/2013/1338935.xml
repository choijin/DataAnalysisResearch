<AbstractNarration>Semantic Computing (SC) is an emerging field that addresses computing technologies which allow users to search, create, manipulate and connect computational resources. The research efforts will be anchored by the University of California-Irvine as the lead institution, partnered with the University of California-Los Angeles and the University of California-San Diego. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Semantic Computing includes the computing technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, natural language, software engineering, data and knowledge engineering, computer systems, signal processing, etc.), and their interactions, that may be used to extract or process computational content and descriptions. The proposed I/UCRC will focus on providing technologies that lead to a Semantic Problem Solving (SPS) network where distributed resources can be easily connected based on semantics for the purpose of problem solving. While some areas of Semantic Computing have appeared as isolated pieces in individual disciplines, Semantic Computing glues these pieces together into an integrated theme with synergetic interactions. It addresses not only the analysis and transformation of signals (e.g., pixels, words) into useful information, but also how such information can be accessed and used to synthesize new signals. The three proposed campuses have complementary areas of strength and have emphasized different aspects of Semantic Computing systems. All participating faculty are prominent researchers in one or more areas related to Semantic Computing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technologies developed by the proposed I/UCRC may support new inter-connectivity that has not been realized by the Internet today. It therefore may facilitate the transition of the Internet into Web 3.0 and stimulate new business models for a better economy that everyone can benefit. The technologies developed by the proposed I/UCRC will be delivered to the public via the Internet, and the PIs expect to create broader impacts in areas other than the five selected. The five areas are chosen as they characterize different aspects of problem solving, e.g., creativity (IT, entertainment), learning (education) and decision making (health, finance), which are applicable to many other areas such as manufacturing, science, engineering, and the humanities.</AbstractNarration>
