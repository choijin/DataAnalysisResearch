<AbstractNarration>Under the direction of Dr. Gillian Gallagher, Mr. Neil Myler will conduct linguistic fieldwork on two varieties of Quechua in order to deepen our understanding of possession sentences across languages. Possession sentences pose some long-standing puzzles for linguistic theory. In particular, their syntactic structure varies widely across languages. A minority of languages uses a transitive verb for possession (as does English- 'I have a sister'; 'I have a car'), but most use an intransitive verb corresponding to 'be', along with a preposition or a case-marker on one of the arguments. Such languages have constructions like 'at me is a sister', 'I am with a sister' or 'there is my sister', corresponding to 'I have a sister'. These facts raise two important questions for comparative syntax, which are the focus of this investigation: (i) what other syntactic properties of a language determine whether it has a transitive verb 'have' or not?; and (ii) how exactly do the many types of 'be' construction found cross-linguistically differ in their syntax and semantics?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Myler will investigate these questions by eliciting judgments on the grammaticality and meaning of possession sentences from native speakers of two closely related Quechua dialects: the Bolivian dialect of Cochabamba and the Argentine dialect of Santiago del Estero. Cochabamba Quechua has three syntactically-distinguishable 'be'-based possession constructions, making it ideal for investigating question (ii). In addition, Santiago del Estero Quechua is a 'have' language, while Cochabamba Quechua is a 'be' language.  Since the two dialects are otherwise very similar to each other, a direct comparison of the two should yield insight into question (i). As well as addressing these important theoretical questions, the project will make glossed transcriptions of the data available via a website, thus contributing to the description of Quechua languages and providing resources for future research on them. Finally, this award will enhance the training of a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aimed to contribute to our understanding of human language.    Humans are unique in their ability to acquire and use language, and we acquire it as children with little effort and almost no explicit instruction, despite its complex structure.  These facts have led many to the position that humans must be biologically "prepared" for language in a way that other species are not: that is, humanity possesses a genetically endowed Universal Grammar which allows children to acquire language.  If this is correct, then we must ask: what is the nature of this Universal Grammar (UG)?  While human languages do indeed display many commonalities, the amount of variation amongst them is nonetheless astonishing at first glance, and this has led some to be skeptical about the idea of UG. Can languages vary infinitely from each other, or can this apparent variation be explained in terms of a fixed template provided by UG?   My dissertation addresses this question with respect to a particularly challenging area which exhibits startling cross-linguistic variation; namely, the expression of the apparently basic notions of "having" and "being".  I show that different languages do vary in the structural "templates" with which they construct such meanings, in ways that some previous UG-based theories would expect to be impossible.  Nevertheless, this variation is constrained by the same abstract principles of structure which govern other aspects of grammar. Therefore, this variation can and should be accounted for by a severely limited UG with certain well-defined "choice-points".  The NSF funding for this project allowed me to gather the data that ultimately led to this new understanding of the syntax and semantics of possession sentences.  It allowed me to conduct linguistic fieldwork on two languages from the understudied Quechua language family, which is classified as "endangered" by UNESCO.   Linguistic fieldwork involves interviewing native speakers of a language and recording different types of linguistic data in an effort to understand how their language works.  Various sorts of data, from speech sounds to written texts, might be recorded depending on the goals of the linguist.  I was mainly interested in the way that the structure of certain types of sentence relate to their meanings. Therefore, most of the data I gathered involved presenting speakers with constructed sentences, and asking them questions about (i) whether the sentences could be used at all, and (ii) what sort of contexts they could be used in.  I would then record these native speaker judgments, and try to come up with a theory of the grammar of their language that explained these judgments.   For my fieldwork, I undertook two trips of about two weeks each to Cochabamba; one in January 2013 and the other in May 2013; and two similar trips to Santiago del Estero Quechua in June 2013 and January 2014.  Of these, all but the first trip to Cochabamba were funded by this DDRIG grant.  For the first trip, I was able to tag along as a research assistant for a different NSF project led by Gillian Gallagher.  The two languages on which I carried out fieldwork were Cochabamba Quechua, spoken in central Bolivia, and Santiago del Estero Quechua, spoken in northern Argentina.  These two languages, while closely related to each other, turn out to differ from each other in a number of surprising ways, particularly in the way they express possession.  In addition, each of the languages has a number of different constructions corresponding to the English verb æhaveÆ.  They thus serve as a microcosm of the variation in possession constructions we find cross-linguistically, and as an ideal test-bed for the sort of theory I was trying to develop.  The grant was instrumental in my being able to complete my dissertation (which can be found at https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54029686/Myler%202014%20Proquest%20Dissertation.pdf ), which went on to win the NYU DeanÆs Outstanding Di...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
