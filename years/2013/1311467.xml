<AbstractNarration>Parasites comprise a large fraction of biodiversity within most ecosystems and can exert strong effects on individuals, populations and communities of their hosts. Despite their ubiquity, the roles of parasites in ecosystem processes, such as fluxes of energy and matter, remain largely unknown due to the rarity of integration between ecosystem ecology and disease research. The central aim of this proposal is to examine the influences of parasites on two fundamental ecosystem processes in freshwaters ? nutrient cycling and primary production. The proposed research will first quantify the effects of infection by trematode parasites on two functional traits of snail hosts (grazing and nutrient excretion) and then use a realistic outdoor mesocosm experiment to quantify the direct and indirect mechanisms through which trematodes influence nutrient cycling and primary production. Collectively, this research will help to advance a conceptual understanding of the roles of parasites in ecosystem processes, which is a pressing topic in light of changes in parasite communities driven by ongoing disease emergence, losses of free living biodiversity, and introductions of novel hosts.&lt;br/&gt;The Co-PI will build upon a proven track record of community education and outreach by implementing an effective K-12 science curriculum that focuses on freshwater ecology and global change. The curriculum is novel in its use of a classroom mesocosm experiment utilizing 1 L glass jars containing field-collected pond organisms to create miniature freshwater ecosystems that are subsequently impacted by two widespread forms of global change: nutrient pollution from fertilizer and invasive species in the form of non-native snails. The students will closely track the development of their mesocosms while gaining knowledge on both global change issues and science standards at the elementary and middle school levels (e.g., hypothesis testing and critical thinking). In conjunction with outreach, the Co-PI will enhance ongoing efforts to serve underrepresented students by providing research opportunities to four undergraduates during the summer field seasons at the Hopland Research and Extension Center in Mendocino County, California. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>Our project focused on understanding the ecological roles of parasites in freshwater ecosystems. Because they are small and inconspicuous, parasites are often thought to be unimportant in the ecology of natural systems. Our results, however, indicate that parasites can play ecological roles that equal the importance of their free-living counterparts. We specifically examined how trematode parasites of aquatic snails can affect two fundamental freshwater ecosystem processes: nutrient cycling (the movement of nutrients, including nitrogen and phosphorus, through an ecosystem) and primary production (the biomass production of plants and algae). We examined these topics using an outdoor experiment and laboratory trials. We were specifically interested in whether trait-mediated effects (i.e., changes in individual host grazing and excretion rates) or density-mediated effects (i.e., changes in host abundance) were more important in determining how parasites affect ecosystem processes. Our results show that parasites can affect both nutrient cycling and primary production primarily by altering the densities of their hosts. This occurred because trematode parasites are able to castrate their snail hosts, thereby diverting resources from snail reproduction into parasite reproduction. The change in host densities due to parasite infection caused as much as a ten-fold change in the rate at which snails recycle nutrients through grazing and excretion. This is important because nutrients such as phosphorus often exert strong controls on aquatic ecosystem structure. Our results indicate that parasites can play important, although often overlooked, roles in the functioning of natural aquatic ecosystems.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>In conjunction with our research aims, we developed a science curriculum geared towards elementary and middle school students.

They add fertilizers and invasive snails to their jars, alone and in combination, to explore how these factors affect their aquatic ecosystems. The students are able to visualize and measure the consequences of these forms of environmental change in a way that is exciting and meaningful. We developed a collection of science lessons that goes along with the experiment and ties into national science standards. The lessons include topics such as the water cycle, food webs, energy flow, and global change. To date, we have deployed the curriculum in six Colorado schools.
