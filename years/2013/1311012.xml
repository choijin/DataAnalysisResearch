<AbstractNarration>This action funds Tyler Anthony Pritchard of The Pennsylvania State University to conduct a research project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at the Kavli Institute for Physics and Mathematics of the Universe in Kashiwa, Chiba at the University of Tokyo Campus.  The project title is "Modeling the Ultraviolet Properties of the Death of Massive Stars."  The host scientists are Ken Nomoto and Keiichi Maeda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Core-Collapse Supernovae are the result of a massive star exploding at the final age of its stellar evolution. These cosmic explosions are extremely important as our understanding of them influences a number of astrophysical subfields in addition to that of particle and plasma physics at high energies.  This project incorporates Ultraviolet (UV) light observations--important at early times but are rare and difficult to obtain--into cutting edge numerical models of these explosions in order to increase the understanding of these astrophysical events and the stars that create them.  In concert with the recent unparalleled UV observations of the supernova 2012aw by the NASA Swift space telescope and supporting ground-based optical and near-infrared multi-wavelength observations, this enhanced code is used to examine the properties of this stellar explosion.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, outcomes from this work will also be presented at scientific talks at research conferences and Astrophysics departments as well as talks for undergraduate students considering post-graduate education.</AbstractNarration>
