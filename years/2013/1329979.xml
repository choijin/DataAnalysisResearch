<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for establishing the scientific foundations of a product innovation process that can engage a vastly larger pool of talent to generate new ideas and to create new cyber-physical products. The primary objective is to address fundamental issues pertaining to natural interfaces, behavioral modeling and secure knowledge sharing, with particular emphasis on their integration. This objective will be achieved by pursuing the following three aims: (1) reducing barriers to participation in product innovation through natural interfaces between physical and virtual domains, (2) reducing barriers to model-based engineering in community-based product development, (3) overcoming information-related impediments to collaboration and information sharing. The findings will be embodied in a proof-of-concept cyber-physical platform for creative design and prototyping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research hold promise for a new conceptualization of a cyber-physical infrastructure, building on the developments in natural interfaces and information security. The specific outcomes include: (a) well-founded methods for 3D design support of cyber-physical products, and their software embodiment in a natural user interface, (b) techniques and middleware to support model-based engineering in virtual community-based product development, and (c) techniques and protocols for minimum disclosure interactions, quality of inputs assurance, provenance and integrity, and usage control for virtual design and making of cyber-physical products. The proposed research will advance the state of the art in shape creation, product design and manufacturing, and secure design coordination. Validation of the concepts in an educational context will benefit the engineering curriculum by exposing students to emerging ways of designing and making cyber-physical products. Over the long term, the research, education, and dissemination efforts conducted in this project will facilitate a paradigm shift where cyber-physical design and manufacturing using natural interfaces, secure behavioral modeling and knowledge sharing in communities will become a part of our nation?s creative design and manufacturing capacity.</AbstractNarration>
