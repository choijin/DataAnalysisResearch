<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to provide the required neuroscience and eukaryotic biology resources to usher new content and skill sets for upper level high school and lower level college life science courses.  Neuroscience today is an important focus for our society due to the aging population, since it will offer the beginnings of understanding on brain function and disease etiology. Unlike many of the sciences, neuroscience requires understanding eukaryotic biology and contributions beyond the classical life sciences to include aspects of quantitative sciences and engineering. Increasing numbers of jobs in pharmaceutical divisions of major companies require scientists from various disciplines. Likewise many universities are devoting large divisions to neuroscience research. Therefore it is important to expose students early to the necessary building blocks of neuroscience. The proposed neuroscience experiments will include cell culture-based research study of nerve damage, a hands-on animal behavioral study, and a student participation study of neurobiology of human taste. The long-term objective for the company is to manufacture safe robust and affordable classroom neuroscience resources that are linked to eukaryotic cell and molecular biology that will be introduced as comprehensive classroom experiments coupled to teacher professional development workshops and student learning assessment studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR is substantial, since it will advance student learning by exposing a diverse student population to neuroscience.  Over the past 15 years basic science has moved to eukaryotic systems with pharmaceutical companies shifting their focus from small molecule medicines to large human proteins that treat neurological disorders, such as interferon for multiple sclerosis, produced in mammalian cells.  Likewise, neuroscience has become a focus of graduate school research and is beginning to be offered to college and upper high school students. The company recognizes that introducing eukaryotic cell culture skills in high schools is challenging due to the cost of required laboratory equipment. Since students are provided with prefilled 96-well plates that contain medium and pre-attached cells, the company now has the opportunity to introduce a novel micro-scale cell culture option that minimizes the need for equipment, including expensive cell culture hoods, incubators and cell media.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Edvotek, Inc. "the company" is privately held and is exclusively dedicated to science education with an emphasis on high school and college life science.  The company research deals with designing safe, robust, teacher and student-friendly products, to be first to market with a price point that is affordable to education budgets. The corporate objective for this NSF SBIR research was to advance student learning in neuroscience by providing teachers with products that include experiment kits, equipment and reagents for classroom use. The company competencies include research in experiment and equipment development, sales marketing, and workshop education for teachers and students. The scientific competencies include molecular &amp; cell biology, DNA science, genetics, bioprocessing, immunology, biochemistry, environmental science and neuroscience.     Bridging science concepts for Grades 9 to 12 remains a critical challenge for our Nation. The gap between science discoveries and science education will continue to increase without active intervention. In the past twenty-five years, technological developments such as the polymerase chain reaction, the gene microarray, and next-generation sequencing have revolutionized the fields of biology.   Data analysis and statistics have created entire new fields of science that include bioinformatics and systems biology.     In 2013 the U.S. government using the Human Genome Project as a template initiated the BRAIN Initiative (nih.gov/science/brain/). The initiative will be funded at $300 million/year for the next 10 years from government, industry and private sources. Like the human genome project, there will be a large need for education products, including student laboratory experiments and equipment. As with the human genome project two decades ago this new emerging market will provide the company the opportunity for growth and to be a leader in neuroscience education.     Our research for this NSF SBIR was initiated two years ago with the goal to focus our effort on providing new education neuroscience products for the Brain Initiative.  The three areas we concentrated on were a) introducing students to the morphology of neural cells and their responses to excitotoxicity, b) investigating the use of the non-parasitic Planaria (Dugesia tigrina) as a platform for neuroscience, and c) introducing students to the biochemistry of taste using safe substances that yield the sensation of different tastes by acting on different taste receptors including the glutamate receptors.
