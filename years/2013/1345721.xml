<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a compact wireless solution for the highly accurate monitoring of fetal and maternal health (comprising a stand-alone device and/or an add-on to an existing technology). The inexpensive and nonintrusive fetal heart monitor (FHM) will not only provide a new level of diagnostic accuracy for hospital and clinical use, but will enable instantaneous wireless transmission for monitoring at home and in resource limited situations (e.g. third world and military applications). In contrast to current technology, the FHM will monitor not only heart rate, but will also provide full electrocardiogram (ECG) traces of individual heart-beats. The ability to obtain individual traces is not matched by any existing technology. The continuous monitoring of ECG traces will provide essential diagnostic information, as well as statistically valuable scientific information on fetal development. The ability to monitor multiple gestations is likewise unmatched by any other technologies. Finally, the system will also provide valuable information on fetal positioning and motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it addresses an urgent need for improved monitoring of problem pregnancies, especially in low-resource environments. By providing compact systems suitable for ambulatory off-site, clinic and hospital monitoring, the FHM will provide improved tools for prenatal and perinatal care that will enhance the health and well-being of mother and child. Adoption of FHM technologies will permit a more appropriate level of care (home, clinic, hospital) and allow timely intervention when required. The unique information provided by ECG traces will provide a more complete picture of fetal health and lead to a reduction in unnecessary surgical interventions. Consequently, the low-cost fetal heart monitor will improve health-care outcomes while reducing costs. Given the limitations of existing devices compared to the invention of this report, it is anticipated not only to capture a significant fraction of a rapidly growing market, but to create new diagnostic possibilities, and to access an addressable market of $139 million. The manufacturing, sales and support of the device will create jobs and enhance local economic vitality.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An urgent need exists for sensitive and specific non-invasive methods to monitor fetal and maternal health and well-being. Continuous monitoring of fetal and maternal health, both at home and in the hospital before and during delivery (by natural or surgical means) will permit clinicians to consider interventions that could improve the health of both mothers and children, and help to minimize unnecessary surgical procedures.  By providing compact systems suitable for both ambulatory off-site and hospital monitoring of fetal health, the Synsei Fetal Heart Monitor will provide improved tools for prenatal and perinatal care that will enhance the health and well-being of both mother and child.    The stated goal and product of this project was a compact working prototype of a Fetal Heart Monitor.  This mobile, wearable device monitors the heart health of multiple fetuses and of the expectant mother.  The device, which provides full fetal and maternal electrocardiograms, communicates through a cell phone/tablet interface for remote monitoring.  The device provides 1) reduction of patient risk by non-invasively providing performance equivalent to gold-standard, invasive fetal scalp electrodes; 2) simultaneous monitoring of the cardiac health of multiple fetuses and the mother; 3) continuous and continual real time data anytime and anywhere; 4) cost reduction by changing the site of care; 5) better access to care for remote locations; and 6) improved workflow and efficiency.  During this phase I project we developed the compact prototype according to plan and demonstrated performance equivalent to the larger, cart-based system previously developed.
