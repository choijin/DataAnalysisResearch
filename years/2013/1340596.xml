<AbstractNarration>Social entrepreneurship and the development of effective social policy are two approaches to social innovation and problem-solving. However, surprisingly little is known either theoretically or practically about social innovation processes and the practices that support knowledge transfer from the social, behavioral and economic sciences into social policy and new venture creation. This workshop will explore the intersection of the SBE sciences, social policy and entrepreneurship with the goal of developing a research agenda, collaborative arrangements and curricula to build bridges between knowledge-creators and practitioners in these areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[An Agenda for Research and Practice   The Social Innovation Process: Transfer &ndash; Translate - Transform  One of the major insights from the workshop comes from the session by innovation scholar Deborah Dougherty. Social innovation is not just one process. There are at least three processes for moving knowledge derived from research and academia into practice (a key feature of social innovation): transfer, translate, and transform.  Transfer describes moving knowledge, ideas, and inventions across boundaries that share a common language and perhaps regularly share knowledge with one another. An example of this type of knowledge transfer occurs when professional schools in academic institutions host conferences or workshops for practitioners. Often innovation can move from academia to practitioners in this context.   Translate describes moving this knowledge across semantic boundaries that require interpretation of this knowledge along the way. In this process, the actors have to negotiate the meaning of words and objects and develop a shared understanding of these words and objects. An example of this would be the implementation of various youth development techniques by the staff of Caf&eacute; Reconcile, an innovative restaurant, job training and youth development initiative in New Orleans.

Since innovation can be the result of any of these processes it is also important to understand how the process unfolds and under what conditions it emerges. Two of our working groups expanded on this theme of understanding the process of social innovation. Working Group #5 &ndash; The Role of University in Promoting Social Innovation proposed a study of what universities are doing in this regard. Working Group #4 &ndash; Researching Social Innovation Incubators &ndash; proposed a study of what is working across the country in supporting social innovation in incubators and co-working spaces.  Facilitating and Incentivizing Social Innovation  A second insight derived from the working group discussions is that progress in the area of social innovation can be made if we can facilitate bridging activities across sectors and if we can incentivize people, organizations and institutions to collaborate to address social problems. This is a very important activity for the so called "wicked" problems that challenge society. Facilitating these activities in classrooms, training institutes and other practice-based activities would lead to more creative solutions to social problems. In Session #2 of the workshop, Drs. Kickul and Lyons noted the significant challenge in providing useful training/courses across disciplines but when these efforts are successful the outcomes can be creative and innovative. It is also important to facilitate the interactions between the "inventors" of useful ideas, theories, and insights with the "innovators" that can apply this knowledge in the co...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
