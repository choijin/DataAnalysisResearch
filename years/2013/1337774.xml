<AbstractNarration>An award is made to Oregon State University to purchase a confocal and two photon microscope system for life science research, education and training. Combined with the rapid increase in genomic information, confocal and two photon microscopy provides an unparalleled ability to identify the cellular components of living organisms, and to determine their functions. Key new features of this microscope include: two photon excitation for deep tissue imaging, and preservation of live organisms and cells; a tunable TiSa laser; 34 spectral detection channels; and high sensitivity GaAsP detectors for faster acquisition and dynamic imaging. Research and training programs of over 38 faculty in 12 departments and centers and 7 colleges will be strengthened and transformed by the novel capabilities of the new instrument. The research will advance knowledge of plants, animals, microbes, pathogens, symbionts and communities, in natural, managed, healthy and polluted environments, spanning agricultural, forest, ocean, and human ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The novel capabilities of the two photon and confocal microscope, will advance solutions to the most complex challenges facing mankind including environmental health, ecosystem loss, sustainable food and energy production, infectious disease, and understanding behavior and the mind. A new undergraduate learning and research program on biological imaging will be enabled by the microscope acquisition and will provide students with the tools to understand and apply microscopy and imaging techniques, engage in inquiry-based research, conduct ethical and appropriate scientific methods. The interdepartmental Ph.D. program in Molecular and Cellular Biology program will be strengthened by the access provided students to cutting edge imaging technology. Access to this technology would benefit the broader Oregon research community, including small regional companies.</AbstractNarration>
