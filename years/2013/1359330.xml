<AbstractNarration>This renewal award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) led by Professors James Spiegel will supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in the Department of Chemistry at Western Washington University for three summers. This REU program supports eight undergraduate students for 10 weeks each summer from community colleges and small four-year universities with limited student research opportunities. The combination of externally funded research with the central involvement of undergraduate students in research projects results in an environment where REU participants are involved in meaningful summer research experiences. REU participants are able to choose a research project from one of three main areas of chemistry: biochemistry, synthetic chemistry and materials chemistry. The broader impacts of this REU site are to provide undergraduate students who have limited access to chemistry research with an authentic research experience. Among the recruited participants, an emphasis is placed on underrepresented minorities from community colleges and the University of Alaska system, resulting in a diverse population of students in this program, which contributes to increasing the diversity of the scientific workforce. Furthermore, the incorporation of community college students into an REU program has an additional impact by encouraging these students to consider graduate school as an educational opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combination of well-funded, cutting-edge research, and the involvement of undergraduate students in research, results in an outstanding environment for external undergraduate students to be involved in a summer research experience. REU participants are able to choose a project from one of three main areas of chemistry: biochemistry (protein structure, protein folding and design, biophysics of DNA modification), synthetic chemistry (organic method development, natural product synthesis, small molecule activation), and materials chemistry (solar concentrators, heterogeneous catalysis, ionic liquids, nanomaterials). In addition to numerous formal and informal activities for the entire group of REU participants, these divisional groups provide additional training that is specific to the research area, including workshops and combined group meetings. The culmination of the summer program is a symposium in which REU participants give poster presentations on their research projects in addition to keynote speakers from each of the three research areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program at Western Washington University (WWU) was awarded for the purpose of giving access to research experiences for students from community colleges and small four-year universities with limited student research opportunities.   These students were targeted by this program for three reasons:  1) to facilitate the transition from community college teaching labs, with limited access to instrumentation and advanced techniques, to 4-year universities that expect a working knowledge of many of these instruments; 2) to increase the likelihood of students from community colleges to obtain advanced degrees in the sciences; and 3) to provide research opportunities for a large population of underrepresented minorities that attend community colleges.  For the past three years, the 25 participants of the REU program in the WWU Chemistry Department have been 56% from community colleges, 56% women, and over 56% underrepresented ethnic minorities in STEM.  In addition to the diversity of our participants, this REU program has brought students to WWU from around the country.  This had synergistic effects both for WWU as well as the participants? home institutions.  At WWU, the REU program has provided a much-needed boost to the diversity of its student population.  Moreover, REU participants return to their respective home institutions with positive impressions of academic research, more clear, attainable goals regarding their career choices, and a more robust educational experience to bolster their classroom studies.  Outcomes in scholarship for the REU participants have resulted in multiple peer-reviewed publications, attendance and poster presentations at national meetings such as the American Chemical Society annual symposium, and entrance into graduate school for multiple participants.  All of the REU participants from community colleges enrolled in four-year universities, including Western Washington Univeristy, University of Washington, University of California, Berkeley, University of California, San Diego, University of Arizona and Reed College. Lastly, the success of the WWU REU program described herein allowed the WWU Chemistry Department to be approved for a third cycle of funding for this program.
