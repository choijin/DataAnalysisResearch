<AbstractNarration>The proposed project will make two main intellectual contributions: (i) the development of non-regular asymptotic theory for a class of problems involving dependent data (time series models, for example), (ii) inference on change-points for time-varying graphical networks. Non-regular problems, of increasing importance in modern statistics, are those where natural estimators are highly non-linear in the data and deriving their asymptotic properties requires the application of sophisticated tools (like modern empirical process methods), in contrast to the asymptotic linearization techniques that work for estimators arising in `regular' parametric and semiparametric problems. Shape-restricted inference for time series data, for which not much is yet known, and which has important implications for some pressing problems (as in the monotone trends observed in global warming and environmental pollution) will be one important focus in the proposed study of non-regular methods. Another goal is to develop a unified theoretical framework for the study of M-estimators (i.e. estimators obtained by minimizing/maximizing a random criterion function) for finite dimensional parameters in the dependent data setting, which will provide a generic approach (a paradigm as well as a set of tools) to the study of a variety of problems that have been, hitherto, solved on a case-by-case basis and other similar problems that arise in important applications in economics and biology.   As far as (ii) is concerned, the problem of time-varying graphs, either observed or unobserved, whose structures undergo sudden massive changes at certain points in time, is of prime importance in a variety of examples, ranging from biology and engineering to social sciences and economics.  Rigorous inferential procedures for determining such `change-points' in time -- regime changes -- in a variety of network models (like Markov transitioning random graphs, Markov random fields), that are interesting both from a mathematical perspective and in that they provide useful models for many observed phenomena, will be developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research program is motivated by problems arising in a variety of fields, ranging from climatology and environmental studies to economics and genomics. More specifically, part of the proposed project deals with making intelligent predictions on increasing or decreasing `trend' functions, e.g. the GDP output of a rapidly developing country, global temperature trends over time, by taking advantage of their pre-known monotone shape. The proposed techniques are novel and expected to enjoy considerable benefits over existing statistical procedures. A related goal is to develop new theoretical tools for addressing a wealth of statistical procedures that share some key common features and are of considerable importance in problems arising in economics. The second part of the project is focused on investigating sudden `regime' changes in mechanisms called `networks' which describe interactions among a collection of entities: for example, genetic networks which capture how genes interact with each other and with proteins to regulate bodily functions, social networks where a group of people interact on sites like Facebook or Twitter and exchange information in the process. Drastic changes in network behavior typically represent the onset of a critical event, say a disease in the gene network setting, or socio-economic upheaval in the social network setting, and it is therefore important to identify them. Inter-disciplinary collaborations with biologists, economists and environmental scientists will be pursued actively to enhance the impact of the proposed research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ DMS-1308890 dealing with asymptotic properties of non-regular models under dependence and inference in graphical networks produced a number of interesting results with important applications.  New methods were developed for determining the values of an increasing trend function in a time series context under both weakly and strongly dependent errors. Increasing (likewise decreasing) trend functions arise naturally in applications in economics, climatology, and internet traffic. Global warming is possibly the most well-known example. Our method enables the determination of plausible values of such trend functions at pre-selected time points using what is called an `inversion-based procedure' using a residual sum of squares type statistic. A powerful feature of our proposed method is that it works across a variety of dependence structures and is readily implementable, and robust to ill-behaved/capricious trend functions.  A related project developed a unified theory of M-estimation (M-estimation involves computing estimates of quantities of interests by minimizing a data-driven function) under weak dependence.  Progress was also made in the study of statistical models which display regime changes. A motivating application was a longitudinal study of female hormone levels around menopause which is suspected to exhibit two clear-cut changes in time. The hormone profile was modeled as a piece-wise linear function and the kinks in the model estimated via a computationally efficient procedure which circumvents a difficult search algorithm by using smooth approximations to the actual function. The relevant theoretical details were also developed. The approach will find use across a wide spectrum of problems. A theoretical investigation into the effect of change-point (regime-change) models under mis-specification &mdash; this is often the case, since statisticians may fit the wrong model by mistake &mdash; was conducted and revealed intriguing insights.  Advances in learning high-dimensional graphical models using penalized maximum likelihood methods were also made. The graphs under consideration were chain-graphs which are layered according to certain pre-specified hierarchies, with top layers affecting bottom layers. Such graphs are useful for modeling the interactions of genes, metabolites and proteins in organic life forms. Advanced techniques from convex optimization and probability theory were used to implement and validate the proposed methods.  Other work includes estimating a change-point in time for a dynamically evolving random graph with applications to voting behavior in the US Congress and estimating a baseline zone for a response function under a convexity constraint (with applications to dose-response studies and engineering).  In terms of broader impact, the results obtained under the auspices of the grant have been disseminated to the broader scientific community through publications in top-tier journals, as well as talks at prestigious workshops and conferences. The methods are being implemented in freely available software. The projects of this grant have contributed to both PhD student and post-doctoral researcher mentoring.
