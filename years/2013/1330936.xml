<AbstractNarration>This cross-cultural research investigates cultural models (CMs) of nature held by populations across several cultures and five continents ranging from long-time primary food producers, e.g., farmers, fishermen, herders (and also hunters and gatherers) to those who recently shifted to become primary food consumers due to globalization forces. CMs of nature, typically held out of one's or a community's awareness, affect environmental actions in ways not necessarily predicted by more traditional ecological models. The project comprises fifteen scholars and six graduate students who are experts in a particular cultural area. Linguistic and experimental data will be collected and analyzed by a common protocol that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches. Methodology and ethnography play paramount roles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers expect to discover a variety of CMs of nature that characterize each community investigated. These CMs represent specific organizations of the constitutive categories underlying the concept of nature, that is, humans, animals, plants, weather, physical environment, and the supernatural. They also expect causal relationships to be one of the major forces (in addition to spatial relationships) weaving together these categories. Similarly, while attributed to different elements and in a different potency, intentionality will be universally present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results, because of the focus on primary food producers, will provide insights on how this kind of population typically constructs a CM of nature. In addition, one can explore the possibility that conceptions of space are central to the construction of CMs (in this case, of nature), thus, provide supporting evidence for an architecture of the mind that includes a major role for the spatial domain in the forming of other domains of knowledge. Finally and more importantly, the findings are intended to supply policy makers, i.e., major actors in finding solutions to climate change induced problems, with information on indigenous CMs of nature that will assist them in their decision-making.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Goal and Methods  The primary goal of this pilot study was to explore Eastern Pennsylvania farmersÃ† understandings of what factors, both human and non-human, affect their livelihood. Being exploratory research, the methodology involved conducting audio-recorded, semi-structured interviews with a small number but wide variety of farmers, and then doing gist analysis of the transcripts to identify common themes as well as areas of disagreement. With the assistance of local Penn State Agricultural Extension officials, I contacted 15 farmers involved in four of the eight kinds of farming in the region (most being commercial grain farmers), and conducted in-depth interviews (lasting from two to three-and-a-half hours) with 14 of them. Key Findings  The widely shared views fit rather easily into five broad categories, all of which are viewed in mundane, secular, materialist  terms. They are understood as being just part of the way the material  world and our economic system work.     Soil      type / nature of the land itself &hellip; given the complex sub-surface geology      in Eastern Pennsylvania, there is a variety of soil types within short      distances, and the nature of the land one farms puts significant      limitations of how well different field crops will grow on it      FarmerÃ†s      own work-ethic, knowledge, and skills &hellip; willingness to work and not      procrastinate, how much the farmer knows about the crops/animals and what      they need to prosper as well as mechanical skills to keep equipment      working, and especially the farmerÃ†s business and managerial skills (such      as detailed record-keeping, long-term planning, and investment decisions)      Modern      technologies &hellip; wise use of soil science, plant genetics, computerized      record-keeping, modern farm equipment (such as no-till planters with GPS      systems), etc.      Marketing      &hellip; both marketing-decisions (when to sell) and marketing-arrangements  (where to sell, i.e., commodity      markets or develop direct-retail customers)      Weather      &hellip; local/regional weather, but also national and even international weather      conditions     When asked why some farmers are more successful than others, participants generally agreed about the factors most responsible:    a)  Soil      type / nature of the land itself    b)  FarmerÃ†s      willingness to work hard, knowledge, managerial skills, and long-term      business planning    c)  Wise      use of technologies, such as soil scientists, plant geneticists, no till      planters, computerized and very detailed record-keeping, etc.    d)  Well-informed      marketing-decisions (when to sell) and how products are sold (to whom)    The factors thought to explain year-to-year fluctuations for one's own farm were:    a)  Market price volatility    b)  Weather      conditions, especially locally and nationally    A few farmers think the five mundane, secular factors mentioned so far explain virtually all the important variations in farming. Most farmers, however, think the secular factors do not account for quite everything &ndash; there is residual variation the secular factors cannot explain. Thus, most believe there are additional, Ã¦cosmologicalÃ† factors at play that affect their livelihoods. -- luck and/or God's will.  Farmers showed a range of opinions concerning the importance of luck:  Those who simply donÃ†t believe in luck at all  [Secularist version] "One makes oneÃ†s own luck."  [Religious version] "There is no such thing as luck &ndash; everything that happens is GodÃ†s will." Those who believe in luck, but think it plays a relatively small role (e.g., 30%) Those who think luck plays a very large role in farming success (e.g., 80%)   Similarly, farmers showed a range of opinions with respect to GodÃ†s role in farming success:  Non-believers do not think gods cause anything Believers who think God, as Creator, is the ultimate cause of everything (including natural l...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
