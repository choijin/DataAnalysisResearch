<AbstractNarration>This action funds Kathleen Lask of the University of California, Berkeley to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the University of Adelaide in Adelaide, South Australia.  The project title is "Soot Characterization in a Wood-Burning Cookstove Using Laser-Induced Incandescence."  The host scientists are Professors Paul Medwell and Cristian Birzer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four million people die every year from exposure to sooty biomass fires.  In attempts to mitigate this health risk, researchers are developing improved cookstoves to reduce the production of harmful emissions, like soot, from cooking fires.  Laser diagnostic techniques, such as laser-induced incandescence, can characterize the soot formation and distribution patterns in a fire.  In this project, laser-induced incandescence is used to analyze the combustion in the Berkeley-Darfur Stove, an improved wood-burning cookstove, to identify particularly sooty regions in the flame zone and suggest locations for modifications to diminish soot formation. Soot formation in cookstoves has never been visualized with laser-induced incandescence before, so this project has a realistic potential of producing new, unique, and useful data to both the cookstove and combustion science communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.   Furthermore, the laser diagnostic techniques examined in this project could be applied to any number of cookstoves, and the understanding of how and where soot forms in a cookstove would allow for modifications to reduce the production of soot, decreasing the substantial health risks of biomass cooking for nearly 3 billion people worldwide.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Background  Almost half of the worldÃ†s population cooks with solid fuels such as wood, charcoal, and coal. The resulting smoke contains undesirable products such as soot, and inhalation exposure to these products results in four million premature deaths annually as well as local and global environmental damage, such as global ice melt.  Due to the undesirable side effects caused by current cooking practices, there is considerable interest in developing fuel-efficient, low emission biomass cookstoves. However, cookstove designers are in need of diagnostic tools to examine the combustion within the cookstoves which would enable them to make knowledgeable design decisions.  Laser diagnostic techniques are a potential solution for exploring combustion in a stove as they can provide nonintrusive, in-situ, real time measurements of a flame. However, these techniques could be difficult to apply to stoves due to lack of sight-lines into the combustion chamber and the variability of the flame. As little research has explored applying laser diagnostic techniques to cookstove combustion, experiments are needed to explore the feasibility of their use and develop the techniques for cookstove applications.  Project Outcomes  For this project, laser extinction was used to explore soot production in an improved cookstove, the Berkeley-Darfur stove (BDS). The BDS is a fuel-efficient, wood-burning cookstove intended for use in Darfur, Sudan. Laser extinction is a nonintrusive, line-of-sight technique that measures the attenuation of a laser beam, that is, the difference between the amounts of laser light entering and exiting the flame, due to particulates in the beam-path as it passes through the flame. This indicates the amount of pollutant particles within the flame zone.  Laser extinction was successfully applied to combustion in the BDS, proving an initial feasibility of applying laser diagnostics to cookstove combustion. Because wood combustion is quite difficult to analyze due to the inhomogeneous nature of wood and combustion in the BDS is an additionally complex system, it was useful to also explore a simplified system, the combustion of a single block of wood. The pollutant production was compared between the single wood block and the BDS to gain a deeper understanding of combustion in the stove and explain the fundamental phenomena occurring in the BDS fires.  There was good comparison between the wood block and the BDS. We saw some definite trends; the ignition of the wood was the smokiest portion of the burn with a release of inner combustibles the second. This was a promising initial step in the application of laser diagnostics to cookstove combustion, leading the way for much future work and collaboration. Research in this area, including from this project, will expand the knowledge base of both the cookstove and combustion communities as little is known about this field.  Other outcomes  The research conducted during this project not only got the experimental direction off the ground and proved feasibility of the experimental technique, but also initiated a mutually-beneficial, ongoing collaboration between research groups in the United States and Australia.  The opportunity to research in an Australian lab also had a great impact on my professional development. During this time, I was trained in the basics of laser safety, laser diagnostic techniques, and the required data analysis, while also being immersed in a different culture both in and out of the research lab. New insights were gained into the differences between the American and Australian educational systems and science policy of which I was previously unaware, which promotes a well-rounded knowledge base when dealing with academics from abroad. The results of the project were presented at two combustion conferences, one domestic and one foreign, providing presentation experience and recognition.  Besides professional development, the impact of this project on global s...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
