<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;In this project a new fully optical CE-FRS detection scheme is proposed to mitigate needs&lt;br/&gt;for any chemical treatments of the sample gas that is usually required with currently available&lt;br/&gt;instrumentation for trace oxygen sensing. The project will leverage unique capabilities of&lt;br/&gt;development and commercialization of cavity enhanced technologies by Tiger Optics and the&lt;br/&gt;new sensing technology based on FRS developed and demonstrated by MIRTHE. Initially a proof-of-concept&lt;br/&gt;prototype system will be investigated based on a conventional two mirror high-Finesse cavity&lt;br/&gt;equipped with a custom FRS optics for signal extraction. Most importantly the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;will also explore the possibility of implementing CE-FRS using the Tiger Optics proprietary&lt;br/&gt;high-Finesse optical prism cavity technology. This unique technology would allow CE-FRS to&lt;br/&gt;be implemented in combination with standard cw-CRDS in the same commercial instrument, permitting&lt;br/&gt;sensitive broadband detection of paramagnetic and diamagnetic molecules simultaneously. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed technology will eliminate routine maintenance issues, chemical conversion uncertainty&lt;br/&gt;and other disadvantages typical for electrochemical systems or indirect sensing technologies.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed direct laser-based detection provides significant advantage in industrial applications&lt;br/&gt;where 24-7 continuous monitoring is required and in environmental applications where analyzers&lt;br/&gt;are often situated in remote locations with basic infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;Development of a CE-FRS method will open up possibilities for sensitive monitoring of many&lt;br/&gt;other paramagnetic species. This method will be suitable for real-time monitoring of trace&lt;br/&gt;concentrations of radicals involved in combustion and atmospheric chemistry, i.e. NO, NO2,&lt;br/&gt;OH, HO2, and CH. In many cases, while the presence of these radicals is known, the reaction&lt;br/&gt;rates and abundances are not well known due to the lack of in situ monitoring capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;A direct laser-based method can provide a new tool for monitoring trace-radicals in a wide&lt;br/&gt;range of applications such as environmental monitoring, industrial process control or combustion&lt;br/&gt;diagnostics. Therefore scientific and engineering advancements in this field integrated with&lt;br/&gt;a comprehensive educational program addressing specific career development goals at each academic&lt;br/&gt;level from high school students to post-doctoral researchers, will provide an excellent training&lt;br/&gt;for the new generation</AbstractNarration>
