<AbstractNarration>The Ohio LSAMP Alliance is a new alliance among 7 four-year institutions (Central State University, the University of Cincinnati, Cleveland State University, Miami University, The Ohio State University, Wilberforce University, and Wright State University), 4 community colleges (Cincinnati State Technical and Community College, Columbus State Community College, Cuyahoga Community College, and Sinclair Community College), community partners, and an Industry Advisory Board.  The purpose of this alliance is to significantly increase underrepresented minority (URM) student recruitment, retention, persistence, and attainment of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees.  The goal of the program is to double the number of underrepresented minority baccalaureate degrees in STEM disciplines at partner institutions within five years.  Programming includes the following alliance-wide activities:  articulation agreements and credit transfers, Ohio LSAMP Alliance Conference, innovative curricular reforms in mathematics, interactive web site, sharing of online courses, cyber-enabled sharing of workshops, diversity sensitivity training, collaborative faculty mentoring, and production of Ohio LSAMP Alliance brochures, programs, and other materials.  In addition, each institution will provide programming that includes advisement and counseling, residential summer bridge and early arrival programs, undergraduate research internships with stipends, faculty and peer mentoring, and tutoring or supplemental instruction.</AbstractNarration>
