<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant provides funding to purchase a state-of-the-art field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) with extended capabilities including an electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) detector, an in-situ loading stage with 500oC capability, a backscatter detector, 3D image reconstruction software, and a color cathodoluminescence (CCL) detector.  The EBSD system and loading stage will be used to answer important questions in manufacturing regarding the impact of part-to-grain size ratio on evolution of grain structure and forming quality in micro and nanoforming, and the importance of twinning and dislocation-based deformation in forming of hexagonal close-packed alloys for lightweight structures. The information will be used to construct microstructurally-informed modeling of microscale forming. The EBSD system will also be used to map the orientation of the olivine crystals deformed under a range of hydrothermal conditions for Earth Science research studies of the deformation mechanisms that accommodate slip in fault zones. The CCL-enabled SEM will be used by Earth Scientists from UNH and area universities to conduct state-of-the-art investigations combining well-defined crystal growth zones and geochronology or trace elemental analyses to investigate the formation of Earth's lithosphere, fluid (including carbon) cycling within Earth's lithosphere, plate boundary processes, and related topics.  It will also be used to characterize volcanic ash for atmospheric transport studies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The information obtained with this instrument will be used to improve deformation-based manufacturing processes on the macro, micro, and nanoscale.  It will also lead to improved understanding of the formation of the earth's mantle, formation and transport of volcanic ash, and deformation of bio-inspired materials. The SEM will provide new opportunities for undergraduate research.  The instrument's remote access capabilities will also be used to greatly enhance the University of New Hampshire's K-12 outreach capabilities and to provide a resource for regional industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award was to acquire a high resolution scanning electron microscope equipped with new capabilities for the University of New Hampshire (UNH).  These include a cathodoluminescence (CL)  detector to perform studies of mineral structure, electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) detector to detect crystal orientation for metal forming studies and mineralogical studies, a tensile stage to observe the evolution of texture during tensile deformation and failure of fibers, and software to transform stereo image pairs to three dimensional surfaces.  In addition to the above features, the system has an EDAX energy dispersive (EDS) spectroscopy system and focused ion beam (FIB) micro-machining capabilities.  The FIB system is a new capability for UNH and has enabled new studies as well as collaboration with local industry.   The first year of the two-year grant was spent working with vendors to find the best system, going through the purchase process, installation of the system, and training.  During the second and final year of the grant, the usage of the microscope tripled over the usage of the previous system.  Three papers using information from the system were published and several are in preparation.  The attached images are examples of some of the work that has been performed.    The primary image shows how the EBSD system is used to image the orientation of individual grains.  The orientation and morphology of the martensite grains were correlated with texture evolution during deformation.  The EBSD capabilities were used in studies on aluminum deformation under continuous bending under tension and comparison of the morphology of Inconel produced by standard wrought methods to 3D printed forms produced by selective laser sintering.  The information used in these studies is essential to the continued evolution of crystal plasticity models used in simulation of texture evolution during metal deformation.   Figure 2 shows in interface produced by magnetic pulsed welding, a technique that can join dissimilar materials by ballistic impact from magnetic acceleration.  The high resolution capabilities enables the researchers to confirm that there is some localized melting.  FIB sectioning is being performed to improve the resolution of this observation.   Figure 3 shows an image of a boron nitride nanotube forest.  This kind of resolution would not have been possible with our previous system.  Figure 4 is a composite showing how the system was used to study adaptive coloration in squids.  Figure 5 shows how CL imaging is used to study growth rings in zircon crystals resulting from volcanic activity.  This method allows UNH researchers to select crystals that have unambiguous information for subsequent U:Pb analysis using mass spectrometry methods.   Many other studies have been performed in the first year of availability of this new system including studying morphology of silver nanowires, FIB sectioning of layered films for x-ray mirrors, stereo-imaging of volcanic ash, and studying morphology of surfaces for medical implantation.  This system has greatly improved the capabilities of UNH researchers.       Last Modified: 11/30/2015       Submitted by: Todd S Gross]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
