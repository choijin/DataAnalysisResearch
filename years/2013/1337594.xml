<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Evgeny Dikarev from SUNY Albany and colleagues Eric Block, Marina Petrukhina, Rabi Musah and John Welch will acquire a single crystal diffractometer system equipped with Cu microfocus source and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) detector. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) synthesis and structural investigation of volatile heterometallic single-source precursors for the preparation of energy-related oxide, fluoride, and silicate materials; (b) broad investigation of unique bowl-shaped polyaromatic hydrocarbons that map onto the surface of fullerenes; (c) studies of trifluoroselenomethionine and odorant receptors for low molecular weight thiol/thioethers and selenoethers involving Cu complexes; (d) development of new synthetic methods to access hypervalent fluorinated sulfur-containing compounds; and (e) organosulfur plant-derived natural products as well as other areas of the chemical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and natural products chemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training and will contribute to educate undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>With the funds provided by the National Science Foundation MRI program and the cost-sharing contribution from UAlbany as well as by trading-in our existing 12-year old Bruker SMART CCD instrument, we acquired state-of-the-art Bruker D8 Venture single crystal diffractometer system equipped with an X-ray dual-source configuration: air-cooled I&micro;S Cu microfocus tube with the high performance multilayer HELIOS optics and Mo sealed X-ray tube enhanced with the TRIUMPH monochromator. With this new dual-source diffractometer, we were able to collect structural data on the crystals that were impossible to work with using our old instrument. Since the installation in March of 2014, about 750 full experiments have been carried out and more than 120 structures have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) database based on 32 publications in peer-reviewed journals such as <em>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</em>, <em>Coord. Chem. Rev.</em>, <em>Chem. Sci.</em>, <em>Chem. Commun.</em>, <em>Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.</em>, <em>Organometallics</em>, <em>Inorg. Chem.</em>, and <em>Chem. Eur. J</em>. Four of those publications were featured on the journal covers. Structural characterization of new compounds supported the NSF-funded programs of 8 research groups at the Department of Chemistry working in the areas of organic, organometallic, materials, inorganic chemistry and biochemistry. The results have been reported through numerous invited talks by co-PIs and presentations by their graduate students at the local, national and international meetings.</p> <p>The new instrument was utilized in an undergraduate/graduate course X-ray Crystallography (CHM 470/570) that is delivered annually by the PI and includes a strong practical component. Students in this class are required to solve and refine unknown structures using crystals from their own research projects or from their research labs. After getting hands-on trained to collect and process diffraction experiments, the students refine new crystal structures to publication quality and make a 30-minute presentation at the special sessions describing their results that include the steps in data acquisition, structure solution, and refinement. A total of 33 students from Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Mathematics, as well as from the SUNY Poly and SUNY Buffalo have taken this class in the last three years. The success of the course is defined by two undergraduate and five graduate students publishing their first papers in peer-reviewed journals on the structures that they solved and refined during this class. Several student participants have presented their results of structural investigation at the ACS meetings. Graduate student Sarah N. Spisak received a prestigious international 2013 Ludo Frevel Crystallographic Scholarship Award from the International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) for her structural studies of multi-electron reduction of fullerene fragments. New X-ray diffractometer was also introduced into our popular B.S./M.S. Advanced Forensic Chemistry course (CHM 450/550) that focuses on training the students to apply both single crystal and powder X-ray instruments for analysis of real forensic objects. We have initiated assembling a structural database of the cathinone-related alkaloid derivatives &ndash; new synthetic drugs marketed as &ldquo;bath salts&rdquo;. The structural data are used to calculate the theoretical powder patterns of phase-pure components that can be effectively utilized by Forensic Investigation Labs for the phase analysis and quantitative analysis of the complex cathinone mixtures as well as of their combinations with common diluents.</p> <p>With the acquisition of new instrument, we obtained 10 licenses of SHELXL package for refinement of crystal structures and upgraded all computers in the Computational Center that is adjacent to the X-ray Crystallographic Facility, where all students and postdocs can perform daily practice of structure refinement, course homework assignments, database search, and preparation of materials for deposition/publication. Our X-ray Crystallographic Center has served as a "show room" at the University Open Door events for prospective students, alumni visits, and visitation weekends for recruitment of new graduate students.</p> <p>Our new dual-source diffractometer is presently the only instrument of its kind that operates in the New York Capital District area. Since Cu radiation data collection is required for determination of absolute configuration of organic molecules, we have launched a university-industry cooperation with Albany Molecular Research Inc. for structural elucidation of diastereomers in novel pharmaceutical compounds, which could not be unambiguously defined by NMR spectroscopy. Another collaborative project established with Siemens AG Technology Research and Technology Center (Erlangen, Germany) is also heavily dependent on the use of new X-ray single crystal diffractometer. A joint patent has been filed, and a joint manuscript published in <em>Adv. Mater.</em> was highlighted in C&amp;EN. The enhanced capabilities of new instrument for organic compounds make it an attractive tool for recruitment of new faculty members. The Department of Chemistry at UAlbany has recently added three new Assistant Professors specializing in synthetic Organic Chemistry, all of whom have already become the regular users of X-ray Crystallographic Facility.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/24/2016<br>      Modified by: Evgeny&nbsp;V&nbsp;Dikarev</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1337594/1337594_10273257_1477335231531_Figure_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1337594/1337594_10273257_1477335231531_Figure_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1337594/1337594_10273257_1477335231531_Figure_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">View of the X-ray Center at the University at Albany: the newly acquired Bruker D8 Venture single crystal X-ray instrument (right) and Bruker D8 Advance powder X-ray diffractometer (left).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr. Zheng Wei</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Evgeny&nbsp;V&nbsp;Dikarev</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1337594/1337594_10273257_1477335361217_Figure_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1337594/1337594_10273257_1477335361217_Figure_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1337594/1337594_10273257_1477335361217_Figure_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A view of the central part of Bruker D8 Venture single crystal X-ray diffractometer showing the PHOTON detector, goniometer, Oxford cryostream low temperature system for measurements between 80 and 400 K, and dual X-ray source with Mo and Cu anodes.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr. Zheng Wei</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Evgeny&nbsp;V&nbsp;Dikarev</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1337594/1337594_10273257_1477335508101_Figure_3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1337594/1337594_10273257_1477335508101_Figure_3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1337594/1337594_10273257_1477335508101_Figure_3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A view of the state-of-the-art CMOS PHOTON 100 detector (active area ca. 100 cm2) that is operated in a shutterless scan mode minimizing the time required for data collection.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr. Zheng Wei</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Evgeny&nbsp;V&nbsp;Dikarev</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1337594/1337594_10273257_1477335658491_Figure_4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1337594/1337594_10273257_1477335658491_Figure_4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1337594/1337594_10273257_1477335658491_Figure_4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Computer cell in the X-ray Crystallographic Center at UAlbany where students are working on crystal structure refinement, graphic oriented analysis, and preparation of the final data for publications.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr. Zheng Wei</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Evgeny&nbsp;V&nbsp;Dikarev</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 4</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
