<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a 3 year continuing award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site program at the University of Kansas (KU) entitled, "RET: Shaping Inquiry from Feedstock to Tailpipe with Education Development (SHIFTED)", under the direction of Dr. Susan M. Stagg-Williams. The proposed new SHIFTED RET Program enhances and extends the previous successful SHIFT RET Program (EEC-0909100).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program hosted by the University of Kansas and the Southeast Kansas Education Service Center (referred to as Greenbush) will provide a 6 week summer experience for a total of 39 in-service and pre-service teachers (13 per year for 3 years). The participants will be math and science high school teachers and UKanTeach undergraduate interns. THE RET:SHIFTED program at KU is a synergistic alliance between KU faculty, Greenbush, and the UKanTeach program.  This is a natural collaborative endeavor, KU faculty members have interdisciplinary research projects and a rich history of mentoring high school teachers, Greenbush has been delivering content to K-12 students and teachers for decades and UKanTeach is an innovative teacher preparation program for ~400 undergraduate science and math students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objectives of the program are to: 1)Engage high school teachers in authentic research opportunities. 2) Guide the creation of classroom activities that (a) use real-world applications; (b) bridge multiple subject areas; (c) engage students in scientific inquiry or engineering design; and (d) stimulate students' interest in science, technology, engineering and math. 3) Nuture long-term linkages between KU faculty and the surrounding educational community. 4) Provide professional development opportunities to pre- and in-service teachers. 5) Broadly disseminate classroom activities.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the participants will teach at schools with a majority of economically disadvantaged students.  The rural schools have a growing Hispanic population and the urban schools serve many students from underrepresented groups.  A partnership with Science Pioneers will also help the project team reach more than 1,000 teachers and 4,000 students in the greater Kansas City region. By partnering with UKanTeach, SHIFTED will expose pre-service teachers to research and innovative classroom activities, increase its recruitment pool via UKanTeach alumni, and broaden dissemination. Each participant will be equipped with the skills and tools needed to effectively disseminate outcomes with local, regional and national audiences. With guidance from Greenbush educators, participants will translate their research experiences into curricular materials, designed to meet state science standards, that can be used in their classes the following year.</AbstractNarration>

Wetlands were also studied, to understand their role in mitigating fertilizer runoff from cropland into waterways.  Charred biomass byproducts from hydrothermal liquefaction were studied and shown to have potential as fertilizer.  A filtration system for soybean oil was developed for processing biodiesel.

New computational models of catalytic materials were made, and advances in catalysis research led to a better understanding of how to control the synthesis of metal alloy nanoparticles as catalysts.  Participants transformed their research projects into 20 lesson activities to take back to the classroom. These resources integrate engineering with biology, chemistry, ecology, Earth science, engineering and physics.  They give students the chance to design and test concepts like algal photo-bioreactors, cereal box spectrometers, combustion stoves, and fertilizer runoff.  Several focus on environmental impacts of chemicals and fuels.  One notable achievement is getting computational chemistry activities into the hands of high school students, helping them to visualize forces holding molecules together, concepts that are traditionally hard to grasp.   Human resources have been positively impacted in several ways.  Pre- and in-service high school teachers learned about research and scientific instrumentation relevant to energy, nanomaterials, catalysis, wastewater, microplastics, biodiesel, etc.  Professional development sessions enhanced participants? understanding of scientific inquiry, next generation science standards, engineering practices, cross-cutting concepts, scientific argumentation, lab safety and research ethics. The program nurtured long-term professional collaborations between high school teachers and college faculty.  It gave educators the chance to work with people from different backgrounds, exposing them to new knowledge and pedagogical strategies.  By pairing pre-service undergraduates with experienced in-service teachers, we were able to harness the untapped enthusiasm and dedication of the experienced educators, giving them the chance to serve as mentors for the next generation of teachers.  The pre-service undergrads also brought a fresh perspective to group discussions because of their recent attendance in pedagogical courses.   While participants were majority white, most taught at schools with high proportions of Black and Hispanic students as well as economically disadvantaged students. To promote inclusion of underrepresented groups, we enhanced the diversity of our participants by recruiting from more populated urban areas.   Participants were highly satisfied and tended to reapply, with 58% returning for a second summer. Bringing enthusiastic teachers back for a second summer enhances the program, resulting in more effective group dynamics and more progress in research.  At least two teachers each year came from the same school as well, enhancing crosslinks between multiple disciplines.  Academic year follow-up assessments found a high level of student engagement in our participants? classrooms. Students also appeared to be "equalized" in learning; i.e., the high achieving students and the lower achieving students were difficult to tell apart because they all were so engaged. Student post-assessments showed increased interest in science, technology, engineering and math, with about 40% of the students saying they are more likely to consider careers in these fields. Female students (56%) were more likely to consider a STEM career than male students (42%).   The project enhanced infrastructure resources. RET participants enhanced their classrooms with educational resources and supplies needed to implement new curricula. Furthermore, a handheld x-ray fluorescence instrument was purchased at KU with funds from another grant (grant number CHE-1339661) based on advice from an RET participant.  This device has been used by researchers across campus and at public outreach events with hundreds of children and adults.   This project has significantly impacted society, educating more than one thousand students in Kansas and Oklahoma, making them better citizens with problem-solving skills and the knowledge base to address challenges facing the world today.  Published results will have impact at the national level as well.  The research has the potential to lead to several new technological advances of relevance to society, such as mitigating harm from microplastics in waterways, emissions from fuels, and pollution from chemical manufacturing.
