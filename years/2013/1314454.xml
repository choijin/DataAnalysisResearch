<AbstractNarration>Marine oil spills can release large volumes of persistently toxic chemicals into the environment, and many large active oil fields are in close proximity to high-density coastal human populations where humans can be exposed through clean-up and remediation efforts, through contact with oiled media in popular vacation areas, and through the food chain. Despite many large oil spills in recent years close to populated regions, and a few studies testing for acute and psychological impacts in humans, remarkably little is known of the medium and long-term health impacts of oil spills on important biological processes such as reproduction, development, growth, and performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, a research team from the University of California at Davis, the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, and the Louisiana State University and A &amp; M College will explore the biological impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to study such effects. They will use the Gulf killifish as a sentinel animal model because they offer an opportunity to carefully link cause with effect by virtue of their relatively short life cycle, a well-provisioned molecular and physiological toolkit, their local residence and well-documented exposure to the event in the field, and because they are tractable for laboratory and field studies providing an opportunity to verify predicted effects in the real world. Fish are established models for human health and development, and killifish are particularly appropriate for studying consequences of the DWH oil spill specifically because they are abundant, local, and non-migratory residents of Gulf of Mexico regions directly affected by the spill event. The team already has evidence that killifish were exposed and affected by the event. Now their objectives are to test for oil spill effects at various sensitive stages of the vertebrate life cycle including effects that span generations, to characterize the spatial and temporal extent of vertebrate risk from the spill, and to test for the influence of individual and population genetic variation on sensitivity to oil pollution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: There remains a clear deficiency in our understanding of health effects from hydrocarbon exposures that emerge over the medium and long term.  This research will offer insight into risk and mechanisms of oil spill impacts in a vertebrate model, offer biomarkers predictive or reflective of impaired biological processes, and accelerate the discovery of genetic and physiological risk factors. The project will support the training of PhD students and undergraduate researchers. PhD students from both LSU and UC-Davis will participate in EnvironMentors, a program that pairs graduate students with students from local high schools for an academic year, during which time participants are guided in the completion of an independent research project to be presented as a scientific poster at a local science fair. The LSU group will also present these posters and other summarized research results at Ocean Commotion, a yearly event organized by the Louisiana Sea Grant College Program, which attract thousands of local K-8 students. Given the socio-economical landscape of Louisiana, a diverse elementary school and undergraduate student body will be engaged by these outreach efforts. Furthermore, undergraduate research participation of groups that are historically underrepresented in the sciences will be supported through programs offered by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (LSU), the Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation (LSU), and Aggie Ambassadors program (UC Davis). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;JOINT FUNDING BY NSF AND NIEHS:  The original proposal on which this project is based (R01 ES021934-01) was submitted to the National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences (NIH/NIEHS) in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement RFA-ES-11-013 , "Oceans, Great Lakes and Human Health (R01)", an opportunity jointly sponsored by NSF.   This project is cooperatively funded through separate awards from NSF and NIEHS.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This collaborative research project examined the physiological and molecular effects of Louisiana Sweet Crude Oil in the killifish model system.  Killifish is a well-described, out-bred vertebrate model that exhibits population differences in hydrocarbon sensitivity.  Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (DHOS), large expanses of the northern Gulf of Mexico were heavily oiled, particularly during the reproductive season of the Gulf killifish.  There were two major interconnected aims of this research project.  The first aim was to screen populations of Gulf killifish embryos for variability in sensitivity to Louisiana Sweet Crude Oil.  This aim exploited the fact that differences in oil/hydrocarbon sensitivity exist in this and other closely-related fish species, and that differences in physiological/genomic responses to oil between populations could provide insights into the mechanisms of oil toxicity in developing vertebrates.  The second aim was to test for impacts, and identify molecular mechanisms of early-life and adult oil exposures on: early life stage development; early life stage performance; and adult performance and reproduction.  This final aim was extended to include oil spill impacts that span generations.  In early work in my laboratory, we demonstrated that coastal fish along the northern Gulf of Mexico had been exposed for an extended period to bioactive concentrations of oil.  Furthermore, oiling in the environment occurred during the reproductive season of the Gulf killifish.  Given the possibility that Gulf killifish were exposed chronically in the field to crude oil, studies were then conducted to evaluate the long-term impacts of oil in this species.  During 2014 and 2015, Gulf killifish were collected from five sites ranging from Texas to Florida.  Three of these populations were from sites in Florida, Louisiana, and Texas with no history of hydrocarbon exposure, and two of the populations were from polluted sites, including an U.S. EPA Superfund Site within the Houston Ship Channel and another from a site in Louisiana very heavily oiled following the DHOS.  Embryos were obtained from the adult fish collected from each site and these embryos were exposed acutely to oil at 6 or more concentrations from fertilization to hatch to assess their relative sensitivity to oil during embryo development.  In brief, we observed a significant interaction between population and oil concentration.  Whereas embryos from the clean sites and from the oiled site in Louisiana were highly sensitive to oiling, the embryos from the Superfund site in Texas were refractory to most oil effects.   Furthermore, oiling of these adults in the laboratory reduced gamete quality and reduced the hatching success of progeny for all these populations except for the Texas population from the Superfund site.  These data suggest that the progeny of adult fish adapted to survival in the Superfund site in Texas is better able to tolerate subsequent oiling.  Furthermore, there is evidence that embryos derived from the previously oiled site in Louisiana may in fact be more sensitive to acute oiling.    In the fall of 2015/spring 2016, we undertook three large experiments, which became the focus for much of the remaining research.  One of these experiments involved exposing adult killifish to clean or oiled water for 40-60 days, and then using these adults as a brood stock for the generation of an F1 generation of killifish.  We created four specific lineages of F1 progeny derived by crossing the gametes of control and oiled parents (i.e., F0 generation). The resulting F1 generation consisted of the four following lineages: control females x control males (CxC), exposed females x exposed females (ExE), control females x exposed males (CxE), and exposed females x control males (ExC).  The F1 progeny were grown for at least two years in clean water before they were used to generate an F2 generation of CxC; ExE; CxE; and ExC.  In 2017, once fish were reproductively active, we produced the F2 generation by crossing F1 females and F1 males of the lineage to create four lineages of F2 fish.  Following assessment of fertilization success, embryos from each lineage were randomly distributed into clean or oiled water.  Embryos were monitored over a 21-day period for heart rate, time to hatch, and hatching success, and embryos collected at several stages of development for transcriptomics and hatchlings sampled for transcriptomics and morphometric analysis.  First, there is clear evidence that the F0 oiling has significant effects in the F1 progeny, particularly in fish derived from oiled fathers.  F1 adults of paternally-oiled fish showed severe scoliosis, altered fin development, and discernible craniofacial deformities, including altered jaw development.  We have also demonstrated that F1 fish of paternally-oiled fish show impaired feeding efficiency and swimming capacity.  Oiling of F0 adults produces effects in the physiology and morphology of the F2 generation, despite the fact the F1 fish were held their entire lives in clean water.  These data support the potential of intergenerational impacts of crude oil in killifish.                  Last Modified: 10/19/2018       Submitted by: Fernando Galvez]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
