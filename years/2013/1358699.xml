<AbstractNarration>The long-term future of reef ecosystems depends on the continued persistence of corals as essential habitat builders. Environmental threats facing coral reefs globally include chronic and acute thermal stress (which can result in ?coral bleaching" as a result of the expulsion of their symbiotic algae), increasing CO2, and nutrient pollution. This project will assess the independent and interactive effects of these stressors using a new molecular based technique showing that coral bleaching susceptibility depends on the symbiont:host (S:H) cell ratio in coral tissues. Corals with higher ratios (more symbionts) are predicted to be more susceptible to thermal stress, suggesting that abiotic factors that affect symbiont densities can directly influence thermal tolerance. This new metric of symbiont density is of physiological relevance and has already revealed patterns that differ from currently used metrics, thus providing new insights into the dynamics of these symbioses. This project will also continue the development and application of these methods to further our understanding of the ecology of coral-algal symbioses, while helping to elucidate the responses of these critical ecosystem engineers to complex changes in their environment.  The proposed activities will help us understand how tradeoffs in the regulation of symbiotic partners respond to the environment and relate to the differential susceptibility of corals to environmental stress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of molecular assays to quantify symbiont abundance represents a technical resource that will help advance the field of coral ecology. This project will train a postdoctoral researcher and several students (graduate and undergraduate), helps expand a new state-of-the-science running seawater laboratory, establishes a new coral nursery as an educational resource, and will be incorporated into ongoing activities in K-12 outreach and involvement with mass media for broader public outreach.</AbstractNarration>

These partnerships can break down due to high-temperature stress in a process called coral "bleaching", which is now threatening reefs worldwide due to climate change. This project developed and tested a new genetic technique to assess the symbiotic status of corals in an effort to help understand if (and why) corals become more susceptible to heat-induced bleaching in certain environmental conditions. Specifically, this project tested the hypothesis that changes in the ratio of algal symbiont cells to coral host cells affect the thermal tolerance of reef-building corals, with corals that have higher ratios (too many symbionts) being more susceptible to bleaching. The project: (1) established a program in the Florida Keys to monitor changes in symbiont:host cell ratios in the field, how they vary between species, and how they respond to seasonal changes; and (2) used laboratory experiments to test whether corals raised under different environmental conditions (including elevated nutrients and carbon dioxide) increase their symbiont:host cell ratios and become more thermally sensitive as a result. These investigations showed that the symbiont:host cell ratio was a cost-effective way of rapidly obtaining quantitative information on both the abundance and identity of different algal symbionts from just a tiny DNA sample. More importantly, symbiont:host cell ratios are a useful indicator of the "symbiotic health" of corals and (although they are subject to considerable variability across species and can be severely disrupted in the event of bleaching) represent a useful way of monitoring symbiont changes in corals over time. This approach has now become a standard tool in our lab and is beginning to be adopted by other labs. During the course of this award we also expanded the use of the technique into the study of how corals could be manipulated to contain different algal symbionts in order to increase their thermal tolerance, which has some implications for how scientists might be able to increase the thermal tolerance of corals by manipulating their algal symbiont communities. These elements of the project led to the PI serving on a National Academy of Sciences committee at the end of the award (2018-19) to review interventions to increase the persistence and resilience of coral reefs, and guide managers in how they might be employed. This project contributed to the training of one postdoctoral scientist, four PhD students, and four Master's students, and provided research experience to 13 undergraduates.
