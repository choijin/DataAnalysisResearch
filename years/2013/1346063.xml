<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to support the North American automakers? need to develop and implement new technologies that will allow them to form the light weight, high strength metals required to support the 2025 56 mpg CAFÃ‰ standard. This research?s objective is to study a proposed hydroforming machine design concept to support that need with a machine constructed from a novel type of composite intensive fabrication. The project seeks to research the design for strengths and weaknesses and to propose a final concept proposal that has been validated through simulation to be suitable, viable and beneficial for forming OEM sheet metal panels.  This project will create a robust prototype design suitable for production and an associated scheme of construction. It will use software to simulate the designs and report the projected performance properties of the envisioned concept design. In addition, it will construct a 1/5th scale prototype that will be used to physically validate the pressure containment system and material formability assumptions. If successful, the research will produce a viable, validated design that demonstrates the concept's suitability and readiness for full scale prototype implementation and development testing in Phase II.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enhance scientific knowledge in the understanding and in the use of high strength polymer fibers in machine presses to contain fluids under high compressive pressure and direct those forces towards producing controlled hydroelastic deformation in metals. It is also to demonstrate how this can be done at cycle rates that are usable by the Automotive Industry. If successful, this will encourage prototype and low volume automotive production, potentially stimulating economic vitality in underserved and underutilized communities such as Detroit's Inner city through direct and indirect job creation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[HydroElastic Hydroforming: Executive Summary for Public  This NSF SBIR funded research project's purpose is to benefit the American Manufacturing Industry and to create jobs in the US by advancing the craft of sheet metal hydroforming. Hydroforming provides a low cost method for manufacturers to produce high quality sheet metal parts, equal or superior to stamping. Using hydroforming to form metal panels is a known way to drastically reduce tooling and investment cost in low volume metal forming.  The focus of this research was to increase the forming velocity used in hydroforming machines by using a configuration of dual air spring driven accumulators and air-liquid pressure intensifiers that are able to move and compress hydraulic fluids faster than conventional mechanical pumps of reasonable size.  Thus enabling a faster forming cycle that is intended in its mature form to approach the forming speed of sheet metal stamping. Thereby in turn, enabling the use of AHSS (Advanced High Strength Steel Alloys) such as DP (dual-phase), TRIP and bake hardened sheet steels as well as alloys such as AL-MG or AL-LI in hydroforming presses.   We tested our hypothesis by designing, simulating, and initiating the fabrication of an abridged 1/5 scale forming machine. We found that indeed, lighter, cheaper, faster and more versatile hydroforming machines seem viable for production that can provide an enhanced degree of performance for a reasonable cost.   Key industry leading opinions and the OEM Automotive voice of the customer requested and recommended power performance levels that required considerably aggressive increases in envisioned working fluid pressure. This new performance target challenged our internal objective to deliver a light weight design of reasonable cost.  We found that with certain innovations and new simulation methods that a creditable design can be deployed that advances the state of the art in the industry.   The understanding gained from this research into the desired mechanisms of operation for suitable industrial grade hydroforming machines may indicate that only systems of notably reduced pressure performance may be apporpriate for general consumer use.  However, these consumer grade hydroforming machines of reduced power may still offer a highly significant commerce building degree of value in the consumer market. Additionally, market trends show that small, low cost hydroforming machines may be able to be used to form parts from sheet polymers and thermally catalyzed composite materials using only energy from air pressure levels commonly found in the consumer retail tool market.
