<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funding in support of the domestic travel of participants to a symposium: "Hairy Particles: Theory, Synthesis, Behavior, and Applications", to be held at the ACS National Meeting Sept 8-12, 2013. Hairy particles are composed of a core, either inorganic, metallic, or polymeric, and a layer of polymer chains densely grafted by one end via a covalent bond on the surface of the core (i.e. polymer brushes). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The diverse potential applications of the hairy particles range from advanced composites to catalysis and sensing. The organizers (Profs. Zhao,Zhu,Li) bring a broad range of expertise in polymer chemistry and polymer physics pertinent to the symposium topic.</AbstractNarration>
