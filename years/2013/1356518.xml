<AbstractNarration>This project is providing scholarships to academically talented and financially needy students across all disciplines of engineering and computer science at Wright State University, with a particular focus on the recruitment and retention of underrepresented students. By increasing the number of academically talented engineering and computer science graduates, the institution is directly contributing to the technology-based economy in the Dayton region and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical aspects of the project feature the formation of student cohorts from both first-year and transfer students participating in Wright State's National Model for Engineering Mathematics Education and related interventions.  Student learning communities specifically for S-STEM scholars support their success in EGR 101 Introductory Mathematics for Engineering Applications. Separate S-STEM learning communities for computer science majors support their success in a newly redesigned SCALE-UP curriculum (based on a successful model adapted from physics education reform efforts). All S-STEM scholars receive student support and enrichment activities from first-year through graduation, including mandatory, individualized academic advising each term, peer mentoring and tutoring programs, undergraduate research, internship and co-op opportunities, undergraduate teaching and K-12 outreach opportunities, and other co-curricular interventions.</AbstractNarration>
