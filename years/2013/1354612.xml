<AbstractNarration>Deep within the brain resides a set of neurons that have inherent time-keeping capacity.  The electrical firing properties of this cell population (referred to as the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN) generates a 24 hour oscillation (referred to as a circadian rhythm) that functions as a timing cue to ancillary neuronal oscillator populations found throughout the rest of the brain.  This circadian timing circuit has remarkable power over the nervous system. For example, key functions of the nervous system, such as the sleep/wake cycle, and complex cognitive processes (e.g., learning, memory and critical thinking skills) are modulated by this circadian rhythm.  Further, the disruption of this circadian timekeeping system has profound effects on mood, cognitive capacity and sleep.   Notably, the disruption of circadian timing can result from alterations in one's work schedule (often seen in night shift workers), or from a number of acquired and congenital disorders of the brain (e.g., depression, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease).  In fact, the disruption of circadian timing in individuals with Alzheimer's disease is considered to be one of the most pressing issues for health care workers.  This rich series of observations raises questions about the functional relationship between the SCN and ancillary neuronal oscillator populations, and, relatedly, about the underlying neuronal circuits that modulate cognitive capacity over the circadian cycle.  In this application, the researchers propose to employ a wide array of innovative interdisciplinary approaches to determine the functional significance and mechanistic underpinnings by which circadian clock timing in brain circuits modulate complex cognitive processes, such as learning and memory.  The research will also provide an opportunity for direct student involvement in research and the data from the study will be used to generate an interactive website for outreach to the public and included in the Brain Awareness Program that presents research findings to elementary and middle schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the central nervous system, rhythmicity is not restricted to the SCN, but rather, is found in a diversity of brain regions.  In line with this, forebrain structures, including the cortex and hippocampus, express all of the molecular components required to drive clock timing. Here, the researchers propose to systematically test the contribution of forebrain clocks to the circadian regulation of learning and memory.  This application is predicated on the hypothesis that the SCN clock works in a coordinated manner with ancillary hippocampal/forebrain oscillators to regulate cognitive capacity as a function of the time of day.  To test this idea, the researchers propose to use an innovative set of transgenic animal models that will allow them to resolve clock timing at a single cell level, and thus, create a systems and cellular level blueprint of hippocampal timing (Objectives 1 and 2). This aim will allow the researchers to identify the cycling cell types (e.g., glutamatergic excitatory neurons, GABAergic inhibitory neurons, astrocytes and microglia) and to assess the phase relationship of discrete oscillator populations. Addressing these questions is key to the understanding of the tightly intertwined relationship between circadian timing and cognition.  In Objectives 3 and 4, the researchers will use conditional knockout technology to disrupt forebrain circadian timing and assess the effects on learning and memory.  Importantly, with this approach, SCN timing will be intact, and thus, the scientists will be able to specifically test the contribution of forebrain oscillators to learning and memory. These data sets will provide new insights into the complex processes by which the clock shapes cognition, and in turn provide a foundation for further experimental approaches designed to reveal clock functionality in a broad range of physiological and psychological processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Project Outcomes Report     Overview   Virtually every biochemical, physiological, and behavioral process is modulated by an inherent 24 hr circadian clock. Central to this time keeping process is the master circadian pacemaker located within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).  This relatively small brain region provides a daily timing cue that orchestrates ancillary clock timing systems found in all organ systems of the body, including the brain. Of note, complex cognitive functions are under tight control of the circadian clock; hence, the disruption of clock physiology, both through the abrogation of circadian rhythmicity, or through desynchronization of the clock from external time cues, has profound effects on mood, memory and executive function.  These observations raise questions about the hierarchical/ functional relationship between the SCN and forebrain oscillators, and, relatedly, about the underlying clock-gated synaptic circuitry and gene expression patterns that modulate cognition.   In this NSF-funded line of work, we used a wide array of experimental approaches to 1) examine the clock timing properties of brain circuits that underlie learning and memory, and  2) examine how clock timing in these same circuits modulates cognition over the circadian cycle.     Results:  1. Profiling  circadian clock timing in brain circuits that underlie cognition.  To profile clock timing we used our per1-Venus transgene clock-reporter mouse strain in combination with confocal and 2-photon based imaging methods.   Our in vivo work detected circadian oscillations with single-cell resolution in the hippocampus and cortex. Multiple cell types, including excitatory and inhibitory neurons, along with glial cells exhibited Per1-Venus rhythms, indicating that a complex network of cellular oscillators work in coordination to generate clock-gated physiological output.  Interestingly, we also used in vitro cell culture-based approaches to examine the inherent timing capacity of  hippocampal cells. Our data show that forebrain neurons and glia have inherent oscillatory capacity (i.e., their rhythms do not require input from the SCN).  Further, we show that these oscillations are cell autonomous, in that the rhythms persist in the absence of synaptic activity.   However, the oscillatory properties of many of these cells are very erratic and very weak. Together, these data provide important new insights into clock timing capacity in the brain, and provide exciting new ways to think about timing in brain circuits that underlie learning and memory.   2.  Circadian timing and the modulation of cognition.   To test the role of circadian timing on cognition in mice, we developed a transgenic strategy that allowed us to disrupt the circadian timing properties of cortico-limbic brain circuits that underlie learning and memory, while retaining the inherent clock timing capacity of the SCN master clock.   With this approach, we showed that the elimination of clock timing in cortico-limbic brain circuits results in a number of effects on learning and memory.  In specific, we found that clock-modulation of two types of memory (recognition and spatial) were disrupted.  We also probed the contributions of cortico-limbic clocks to different types of memory processes (e.g., working memory, memory acquisition, and retrieval) at multiple timescales - including working memory (seconds to a few minutes), intermediate-term memory (a delay of thirty minutes), and acquisition and retrieval of long-term memory (a delay of two days).  These projects revealed that retrieval (but not working memory, intermediate-term memory, or acquisition of long-term memory) is modulated by circadian time. These results reveal that cortico-limbic clocks play an essential role in the daily modulation of cognitive capacity.     Key outcomes  With respect to the broader impact goals, these data sets will provide new insights into the processes by which the circadian clock influences cognition, and in turn these data will provide a foundation for further experimental approaches designed to reveal clock functionality in a broad range of physiological and psychological processes.  For example, these studies should provide important insights into how the disruption of cellular oscillator populations in the human brain could contribute to a range of problems including acquired and congenital neurological disorders, as well as cognitive problems associated with shift workers, jet lag and even aging.       Broader impacts   Research funds from this application were used to create training opportunities for graduate students (8 trainees), undergraduate students (9 trainees) and one postdoctoral fellow.  Nearly all of these students have gone on to enter professional or graduate training programs, postdoctoral appointments, or are completing their dissertation projects. In specific, three students have gone on to medical school, one student is training in veterinary sciences, 6 students are currently performing postdoctoral fellowships and 5 students are completing their dissertation projects. Three of these trainees are underrepresented minorities. The career goals of all of these students were markedly facilitated by the training they received from this grant.
