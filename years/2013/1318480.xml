<AbstractNarration>The  demand for  advanced  optimization software  tools is  increasing sharply as the importance  of optimization methodology in engineering, basic  science,  finance and  data  science  is becoming  more  widely recognized.  The  dramatic  increase   in  computing  power,  and  the improvements in supporting technologies such as modeling languages and automatic   differentiation  are   fueling  demand   for  optimization algorithms  that  solve  more  and  more  computationally  challenging problems, including nonlinear  optimization problems with differential equation constraints and/or discrete  variables.  This project focuses on several  fundamental computational issues involved  in the parallel implicit solution of optimization  problems with differential equation constraints.  Such problems arise in  many contexts in engineering and scientific  computation, since  physical  reality  is often  expressed through models involving ordinary  and partial differential equations. Accurate discretizations of differential  equation constraints lead to very large structured constrained optimization problems, where much of the  structure reflects  the discretization.  A specific  goal is  the development   of   modern   algorithms   that   are   well-suited   to implementation  on advanced  computing platforms  (such as  those with multicore and GPU  architectures), interoperable with high-performance software  in  related areas  (such  as  linear algebra),  and  readily customizable for  particular important applications.  A  major part of the project involves the development of software and its dissemination within  the  manufacturing,   engineering  and  scientific  community. Software developed  as part of  the project will provide  an effective method  of  technology   transfer  and  will  extend   the  scope  and effectiveness of the  existing codes PLTMG, MC and  SNOPT developed by the investigators.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Differential equations conveniently characterize  the physical laws of many complex systems  occurring in science and  engineering. They also lie  at the  heart of  the mathematical  models used  to simulate  and predict  the behavior  of these  systems.   The need  to optimize  the performance  of  such  systems  is the  common  feature  of  practical applications that range over such diverse areas as the design of large neurobiological   network   models,    the   numerical   modeling   of gravitational  waves,  and  trajectory  planning  for  spacecraft  and unmanned  autonomous vehicles  (UAVs).  Software  developed under  the auspices of  this project will  provide engineers and  scientists with instant  access  to  state-of-the-art  methods for  the  modeling  and optimization  of  complex   systems  involving  differential  equation constraints.  The  resulting improvements in the  efficiency, accuracy and robustness of these models will have a substantial impact in areas of  manufacturing  and  engineering  that   are  vital  to  US  global competitiveness.</AbstractNarration>

Accurate discretizations of differential equation constraints lead to very large sparse constrained optimization problems, where much of the structure reflects the discretization.  The research has advanced the state-of-the-art in several respects.  In the area of optimization, advanced new methods and software have been formulated and analyzed for the solution of challenging large-scale nonlinearly constrained problems with differential equation constraints.  Research has focused of the crucial role of regularization and stabilization in the formulation and analysis of modern sequential quadratic programming (SQP) and interior methods, which are generally considered to be the best general-purpose methods for nonlinear optimization.  Regularization and stabilization are vital tools for resolving the numerical and theoretical difficulties associated with ill-posed or degenerate problems.  Broadly speaking, regularization involves perturbing the problem so that a well-defined solution always exists.  Stabilization is designed to provide practical methods that can rapidly and reliably compute the solution of the problem.  New regularized and stabilized SQP and interior methods have been developed and applied to a number of practical applications involving differential equation constraints, including the calculation of the optimal trajectories of a space craft, the optimal cooling of a jet engine, the time-optimal control of a vehicle transporting a fluid container, and the construction of subcellular diffusion maps based on bio&shy;imaging data,  In the area of partial differential equations, much of our effort was focused on efficiently integrating adaptivity and parallelization into the PDE constrained optimization framework.
