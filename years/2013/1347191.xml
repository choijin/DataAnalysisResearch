<AbstractNarration>This research involves the development of a set of computational tools for addressing problems of image formation arising in fields ranging from medical imaging and non-destructive evaluation of the manufactured components to subsurface environmental remediation and civil infrastructure monitoring.  Common to these as well as many other problems is the need to characterize the internal structure of a region of space from data collected along the periphery. While common examples such as X-ray Computed Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging yield high resolution images, the problems of interest in this effort are far more challenging due to complications associated with the physics of the underlying sensing technology as well as restrictions concerning where and how data can be acquired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address these challenges, the work in this project exploits the fact that in many cases, the processing objective is the identification of specific regions of interest containing flaws or other anomalies. Through a multidisciplinary effort in engineering, mathematics, and computation, the investigators develop and study a powerful new class of innovative shaped based computational tools which combine variational Active Surface models, Level Set Methods, Boundary Element Methods, and Partial Differential Equations to detect/reconstruct geometric structures of interest directly from raw tomographic data in a general class of PDE-based tomographic modalities. This study has the potential to yield a substantial paradigm shift in extracting geometric knowledge from tomographic measurements for a diverse collection of societally important applications characterized by challenging physics and restrictive sensing scenarios. Of specific interest here are problems of geotechnical surface wave inversion, non-destructive testing, and impedance tomography for environmental monitoring.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This was an EAGER Award whose primary goal was to provide compelling proof-of-concept evidence and preliminary results in support of future research proposals to develop novel combinations of boundary element methods, variational active surface techniques, and level set methods that can be applied and customized to a wide range of geometric inverse problems. The project outcomes, divided into the categories of Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts, are briefly summarized as follows.  Intellectual Merit: The use of geometric inverse methods combing Active Contours, Level Set Methods, and Boundary element methods for three physical models were explored: the scalar Helmholtz equation, vector elastodynamics, and Poisson's equation.  Work on these problems focused on evaluating the trade-offs in two types of modeling methods for the forward problem in synthetic simulations: BEM and the Method of Fundamental Solutions (MFS). Results indicate that the latter is not nearly as well suited as BEM to the class of inverse problems under consideration. Lower dimensional Parametric Level Set (PaLS) representations were combined with BEM-based level set methods to substantially improve the performance of the latter.  Results from these two-dimensional synthetic testing scenarios clearly suggested a number of non-trivial ways in which to best blend PaLS and BEM-level sets.  Broader Impacts: Two postdoctoral research associates were brought into the collaboration. Both postdocs gained valuable experience collaborating in the context of a larger team including the three PI's, their graduate students, and collaborators. During the final year of the project, one these graduate students was partially supported to incorporate a more flexible class of disconnected boundary elements, specifically formulated to be easily yet robustly extracted from the level set representations being used, into the code libraries. The novelty and promise shown in these early 2D simulations of the developed approach was compelling enough to expand the research team and generate follow up proposals and research projects.  A long-term general program of research has thus been jump-started by both the mathematical analysis, the integrated numerical algorithms, and the computational code libraries that were generated.
