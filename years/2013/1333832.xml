<AbstractNarration>The goal of the 2013 Radiation and Climate Gordon Research Conference (GRC) is to bring together researchers working in the fields of in-situ and remote sensing observational techniques, synthesis of observational datasets, and numerical modeling across a wide range of scales, to address critical outstanding issues of cloud-climate interactions. The conference will feature a broad range of topics, including grand challenges in atmospheric radiation and climate, climate responses to radiative forcing across timescales, interactions of radiation and the surface, interactions of radiation with cloud-scale and planetary-scale dynamics, novel observations for model evaluation, challenges in remote sensing, and the challenges of understanding ice cloud formation and optical properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GRC will be held at Colby-Sawyer Colleg in New Hampshire, July 7-12, 2013. This will be preceded by the second associated Graduate Research Seminar (GRS) on July 6-7, 2013. Together, these meetings will focus upon cutting-edge research on outstanding issues in climate change, particularly those in which the interactions between radiation, clouds, and the climate system play a major role. Understanding the role of clouds in the climate system continues to be of great importance and scientific progress in this area has significant broader impacts. One of the GRC's main goals is to bridge the gap between established scientists and those just entering the field and to encourage intensive discussion of key scientific topics. To facilitate these interactions, GRCs are characterized by plenty of time for informal discussions outside the lecture theatre.  NSF funds will be used for participant registration with preference to post docs and/or graduate students, with an eye to increasing participation in the meeting by women and under-represented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
