<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Andrei Kutateladze of the University of Denver is developing novel photoassisted synthetic pathways to complex heterocycles.   Underutilized by the synthetic community, photochemical reactions hold unparalleled promise for building prohibitively strained carbocyclic and heterocyclic scaffolds, offering expeditious access to difficult synthetic targets not accessible via ground state chemistry. This project aims to fill this void, developing new photoassisted methodology for the synthetic chemist's toolbox.  Photochemistry constitutes a greener chemistry because it uses light as a key reagent.  UV LED irradiators will be combined with high throughput synthetic instrumentation to enhance the modern infrastructure for synthesis.  This program provides broad and extensive training for graduate and undergraduate research students, combining demanding synthetic work, photochemical and photophysical experiments, and computer-assisted molecular modeling.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on the development of a new photoassisted synthetic methodology which will yield topologically diverse polyheterocyclic scaffolds decorated by various functional groups and carbo/heterocyclic pendants rigidly or semi-rigidly held in a unique spatial configuration by these novel core frameworks. Topologically diverse scaffolds are realized via key photochemical steps, most prominently the intramolecular cycloaddition reactions of azaxylylenes and quinomethanes generated via excited state intramolecular proton transfer.   An experimental and theoretical mechanistic study will be carried out to assess the involvement of azaxylylene triplet species.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Complex heterocycles embedded in extended three-dimensional molecular architectures have many applications in various fields of science, most critically in biomedical applications (think penicillin).  Yet, they are difficult to synthesize and diversify.   The intellectual merit of this research work is related to fast access to complex polyheterocyclic molecular architectures in a very few experimentally simple steps from inexpensive and abundant chemical feedstock.  In this research we utilized light as an environmentally benign "reagent" to circumvent the limitations of the ground state chemistry and to develop fundamentally new synthetic methodology based on a photophysical phenomenon called excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT).  We found that the movement of a single proton from the amide nitrogen atom to the excited carbonyl moiety in readily available photoprecursors &ndash; aromatic amido ketones &ndash; generated triplet azaxylylenes, critical intermediates capable of addition to various unsaturated molecular pendants to furnish cyclic molecular architectures incorporating nitrogen atom(s), i.e. the sought after complex nitrogen heterocycles.   Moreover, such primary photoproducts necessarily possess various reactive functionalities introduced at the photochemical step because ultraviolet photons that we use pack a lot of energy.  We were able to follow the primary photoreactions with experimentally simple postphotochemical modifications to further increase molecular complexity and outfit the core structures of the primary photoproducts with various beneficial molecular prosthetics, i.e. additional heterocyclic moieties or other chemical functional groups, which potentially could form promising pharmacophores.  With the aid of specialized computer programs, we were able to numerically assess the complexity of the products of these photochemical cascades.   It is important to emphasize that these complex polyheterocyclic molecular architectures reached complexity comparable with that of taxol &ndash; a very complex anti-cancer reagent.  It is instructive that our methodology allows for accessing such complexities in mere 3-5 experimentally simple steps (compare this with the first total synthesis of taxol, which required 46 steps).  Besides potential applications of this fundamental research in biomedical field or materials science, the broader impact of this project has to do with training the next generation of organic chemists.   This grant partially or completely funded training of four graduate (PhD) students, three research associates, and provided opportunities for undergraduate students to gain laboratory experience while working on a multi-faceted research project which combines dealing with state-of-the-art analytical equipment, modern computational chemistry, and experimental synthetic chemistry and photochemistry.  Two members of the team came from underprivileged groups.  This project called for and helped develop in the involved students a broad set of experimental and theoretical skills needed for a modern sophisticated organic chemist, prepared for working in academia or industry.   All undergraduate students, who worked with PI in the last 10 years have entered highly ranked graduate programs or medical schools.   The culture in the lab, with weekly research meetings and also a separate journal and mechanism club, is conducive to perfecting their critical thinking, presentation skills and other components of professional growth.
