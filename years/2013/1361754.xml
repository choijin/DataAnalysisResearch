<AbstractNarration>Our mathematical understanding of instantaneous rates of change stems from the invention of calculus by Newton and Leibniz in the 1680's and, by now, we have become accustomed to that notion in our daily lives. For instance, a quick look at our car's speedometer lets us know our speed at any given moment in time and a radar or GPS system can tell us how fast a storm is approaching or an airplane is flying at any given moment in time.  There are, however, certain interesting mathematical contexts in which the notion of instantaneous speed cannot be taken for granted. That notion needs to be developed in an intrinsic fashion as to retain the natural properties and interpretations we are used to. Some of those properties can be expressed in the form of the so-called Sobolev or variational inequalities which relate position and speed at different scales. The pursue of natural notions of instantaneous speed in various mathematical contexts, as well as their variational inequalities and applications, stands as an increasingly active and exciting area of research in Analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric and measure-theoretic objects can be associated to convex functions. The interplay between properties of these objects models the behavior of solutions to certain elliptic and parabolic PDEs as well as quasi-conformality of mappings with convex potentials, geometric features of some quasi-metric spaces, associated potential theory, etc. The research activities supported by this grant aim at developing such topics by means of a first-order calculus based on variational inequalities for the Monge-Ampere quasi-metric structure.</AbstractNarration>

The PDEs involved are modelled after the mathematical frameworks that describe, for instance, the transference of heat through matter, the propagation of a gas through a uniform medium, or the concentration of a chemical substance within a homogeneous fluid. When the models above need to account for nonuniform or inhomogeneous media (such as in the case of heat transfer through a rod made out of different metals, or a chemical substance released on a fluid composed of a mix of several fluids), the description becomes more complicated and it often leads to the concepts of degenerate PDEs and/or nonlinear PDEs. This project concerned the nonlinear PDE known as the Monge-Ampere equation as well as its linearization, which is a degenerate PDE that finds applications in fluid mechanics and optimal mass transportation.  The outcomes from this project include ten original-research articles published in peer-reviewed journals. The findings have been disseminated in a number of national and international conferences and seminars.     Broader impacts: An integral part of this project has been the development of human resources. In particular, the mentoring of PhD students and the implementation of related mentorig activities that provide graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty with opportunities for professional development.  Central among such opportunities lies the "The Graduate Students and Postdocs Exchange Program." Within this program, started in 2010 in collaboration with Prof. Virginia Naibo from Kansas State University, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from other universities in the Midwest are invited to deliver talks in the Analysis Seminar at KSU. In turn, arrangements are made so that the Departments of Mathematics at those universities host some of our KSU graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.     This program stands as a highly beneficial initiative for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows as it provides them with the opportunity to enhance their resumes, practice their delivering-talks skills, interact with faculty members, grad students, and postdocs from other Departments, thus extending their professional network.
