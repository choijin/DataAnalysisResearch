<AbstractNarration>This award will support investigators from a consortium of 50 herbaria at universities, botanical gardens, and natural history museums across the U.S. to digitize their collections of macroalgae.  When they have finished, high resolution images and information about when and where each specimen was collected will be openly accessible for more than a million specimens through the consortium's web portal and the iDigBio web resource.  Macroalgae are the foundation of marine, estuarine and freshwater benthic ecosystems providing food, substrata and protection for a myriad of other aquatic organisms. Many macroalgal species are sensitive to environmental change.  The data provided through the portal will allow researchers and the public at large determine how macroalgal biodiversity and our aquatic ecosystems have changed over the past 150 years as a result of climate change, bioinvasions, and a wide range of human activity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of macroalgal species, including kelp, nori, and others are grown extensively via aquaculture or harvested from the wild for human food and for extraction of colloids used in cosmetics, food products, and pharmaceuticals. The consortium's web portal will provide opportunities for the public to learn about the economic and ecological importance of macroalgae.  Tools will be provided for citizen scientists to contribute to the project by helping transcribe some of the ancillary details from specimen labels into the database.  Interactive exhibits and educational modules will be developed by the education departments of the museums in the consortium where hundreds of thousands of visitors will experience them each year.  The project will also provide integrative training in collections and informatics research for undergraduate and graduate students through participation in the digitization effort and through internships at one of the museums.  This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2013 the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill Herbarium (NCU) joined the Macroalgal Digitization Project.  As the largest phycological collection in North Carolina, NCU was designated as an imaging, databasing and georeferencing hub for six smaller collections:  Louisiana State University, University of South Carolina, Texas A &amp; M University, University of Alabama, Florida Museum of Natural History, and the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.                         Louisiana State University LSU 59 specimens   University of South Carolina, Columbia USCH 845 specimens   Texas A&amp; M University TAES 851 specimens   University of Alabama UNA  2401 specimens   Florida Museum of Natural History FLAS 3067 specimens    University of North Carolina, Wilmington WNC  6651 specimens    Duke University DUKE  17825 specimens    University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill NCU 50066 specimens            Total                                                             81765 specimens        Digitization of specimens opens the door to many benefits:  open access to important data for researchers and students worldwide, broader views of biodiversity that clarify global patterns (important for economic, scientific, and conservation reasons), collaboration within-country and internationally, and safeguarding minimum value of collections worth millions of dollars against the risk of catastrophic loss.   The Project has brought to light specimens spanning 218 years:  the oldest specimen is held by DUKE  (Chara vulgaris, collected by L. J. Wahlstedt on 28 July 1800 in Sweden)  and the newest is held by NCU (Johansenia macmillanii, collected by Paul W. Gabrielson on 27 July 2018 from Vancouver Island, Canada).  For the phycological collections at LSU, FLAS, TAES, UNA, USCH and NCU no catalog had been produced until the advent of the Digitization Project.  Dr. Richard B. Searles, Curator of the Phycological Herbarium at Duke University (DUKE), used an Excel spreadsheet to catalog of about 75% of their collection.  Searle?s early cataloging of DUKE was an excellent foundation upon with to build the data in macroalgae.org.    A primary goal of the Macroalgae TCN was to "daylight" collections which had been underutilized by the scientific community.  As the phycological collections of LSU, FLAS, TAES, UNA and USCH are quite modest and those herbaria do not focus on algae, even the curatorial staff at those herbaria were not familiar with the taxonomic, geographic or temporal scope of the specimens in their holdings.  Once NCU had finished cataloging a collection, we provided a summary report to that collection, detailing the number of specimens, the number of families &amp; genera, the geographic scope, the oldest and most recent specimens, and short biographies of the most prolific collectors.   "University of Alabama Herbarium (UNA) Algae Collection:  An Overview" was written by Kevan Schoonover, a UNC-CH undergraduate, and published in the on-line Phycological Newsletter 51(1): 21 of the Phycological Society of America in 2015.  Schoonover was an undergraduate student at UNC-CH at the time, and was responsible for imaging, cataloging, and georeferencing the ca. 2,400 specimens of UNA.  Kevan was particularly excited to find 63 specimens collected by "Her Deepness" Dr. Sylvia Earle in the 1970?s.  All were from the Dauphin Island Sea Lab and were collected throughout the Gulf of Mexico.   As NCU is a department within the North Carolina Botanical Garden, we wanted to educate Garden members about the Macroalgae Digitization Project.  NCU Curator Carol Ann McCormick published "Make Room for Harvey!" in the Summer 2014 print newsletter of North Carolina Botanical Garden, and several Garden volunteers joined our team of University undergraduates and Herbarium staff to complete the work of the Project.   The cataloging efforts at NCU have been particularly gratifying as this collection represents the life-work of Dr. Max Hommersand who came to UNC-Chapel Hill as an Instructor in 1959.  He retired from teaching in 1998, but continues as Professor Emeritus and Curator of NCU?s phycological collection.  Hommersand collected over 37,000 of the ca. 50,000 specimens currently cataloged in NCU?s phycological collection, and we continue to mount, accession, catalog and image specimens he collected.  When we started the project in 2013, Dr. Hommersand said that we should look for his very first collections made when he was a teenager in California.  Macroalgae.org collection # NCU-A-0038276 was collected by eleven year old Max Hommersand on 3 March, 1941 from Bird Rock, San Diego County, California.  By November 18, 1944, at the age of fourteen, Hommersand had decided to use collection numbers, so macroalgae.org collection # NCU-A-0026630 is Hommersand #1, Rhodymeniocolax botryoidea Setchell from Casa de Manana Cove, San Diego County, California.  In June, 2018 Dr. Hommersand returned to California for the Phycological Society of America meeting and together with his former grad student, Dr. Wilson Freshwater (now Curator of phycological collections at WNC), gave a paper entitled "Morphology and molecular systematics of the Dasyptileae, a new tribe in the Callithamniaceae (Ceramiales) containing Dasyptilon and Plumariopsis".
