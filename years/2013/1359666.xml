<AbstractNarration>Stimulated by 2006 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations that required large firms to report their compensation peers, a set of recent papers have concluded that many companies favor "aspirational" peers (i.e., larger companies and with better paid CEOs than the focal company). Research on the use by companies of aspirational peers has focused on the prevalence and average overall level of bias, and has attempted to explain bias in terms of organizational and CEO characteristics rather than in terms of the networked environment. However, public corporations are tied to one another in networks along various dimensions, including similarity in industry and size, board interlocks, the sharing of compensation consultants, and the network of asserted compensation peers used by companies in the setting of executive compensation. The proposed research tests the theory that pressures for legitimacy and rationalizations of practices of contested legitimacy occur through mechanisms of local comparison, which involve both information transfer and the mimicry and co-evolution of controversial practices. Using stochastic actor oriented network analytic methods, the proposed research will estimate the effects of social influence and social comparison on the evolution of compensation networks in the post-2006 period, when the network is newly visible both to researchers and to the corporations themselves as a consequence of the new SEC rules. These questions are addressed through the analysis of a unique database that contains information on compensation peers for the universe of companies that have reported this information since the new regulations came into effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project is the new understanding it promises about the dynamics of compensation peer networks of publicly traded corporations and the illumination these dynamics offer on the diffusion and modification of controversial organizational practices. A longstanding literature on the diffusion of innovations and organizational practices treated the practices in question as relatively fixed and studied the rate and extent of diffusion through the population. More recently, scholars have focused on the fact that many organizational practices are controversial, and as a consequence they advance, evolve, and retreat in response to environmental pressure and the conflicting interests of organizational actors and stakeholders. This recent literature emphasizes characteristics of organizations (e.g., the "fit" of the practice with the organization and organizational actors along various dimensions) that potentially explain the adoption, adaptation, or relinquishment of controversial practices. In contrast, the impact of organizational networks on the spread and evolution of controversial practices is relatively unexplored. The proposed research contributes to the filling of this gap. In the process it may provide an explanation for how the overall upward compensation bias in executive compensation peer groups is maintained and whether it is likely to persist into the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of the proposed research include the training of undergraduate and graduate students and the potential value of the proposed research for public policy. The project will also allow the continued collection of longitudinal data on compensation peers on a scale that does not elsewhere exist. After the project is concluded, these data will be made available for other researchers and also accessible for a non-technical audience. Using Javascript and HTML5 the query results can be visualized as a network, and network descriptives will be presented in a table. Publishing the data through such an infrastructure allows the data to be used for education purposes, and it allows non-technical audiences to explore this rich data source. The algorithm used to identify and extract peers from corporate annual reports in the electronic archive of the SEC can easily be generalized to extract systematic and previously unavailable data items in a wide variety of contexts. Instructions will be provided to allow researchers to use the algorithm for such purposes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The disclosure of compensation peer groups is intended to provide shareholders with valuable information that can be used to scrutinize CEO compensation.  Compensation consultants and watchdog organizations have established general principles for selecting peers, the most important being that peers should be companies of similar size, market capitalization, and industry profile.  However, research suggests that there are substantial incentives for executives and directors to bias the compensation peer group upward to allow the CEO to extract additional rent. When companies choose compensation peer groups whose CEOs are better paid than would be the case with a neutrally chosen peer group, the focal CEO appears to be underpaid in comparison, which generates an argument for an increase in compensation for the focal CEO.  A number of studies have found evidence that CEO peer groups are biased, though some have argued that what appears to be bias is actually just a reflection of the talent of the focal CEO.     We define bias as the difference in pay between the median CEO in the peer group selected by the firm and in neutral peer groups that we construct. We leverage the idea that reciprocated peer nominations are unlikely to be biased in order to construct counterfactual peer groups, which allows us to measure the bias of disclosed peer groups.  Specifically, we estimate a model that predicts reciprocated peer nominations, and we use the estimates from this model to identify and select peers that are likely to nominate the focal firm as peer.  Using eleven years of comprehensive data on compensation peer groups that was collected as part of this project, we demonstrate that the average firm uses an upwardly biased peer group, and that this bias cannot be accounted for by CEO talent.  We also find that upward bias in compensation peer groups is highly predictive of higher CEO compensation -- suggesting that there is a strong incentive for CEOs to strategically select peers.  Figure 1 shows the bias as a percentage of the compensation of the median peer in a neutrally chosen peer group. As Figure 1 shows, the size of the peer group bias has been diminishing over time since the 2006 SEC requirement that firms disclose their compensation peer groups in their corporate reports.  This may be a consequence of the requirement for periodic say on pay votes on executive compensation in the 2009 Dodd-Frank Act along with the greater scrutiny of compensation practices by watchdog agencies such as Institutional Shareholder Services.  However, Figure 2 shows that the predictive effect of bias on pay has gone up, which offsets the consequences of the decline in bias shown in Figure 1.     We also demonstrate that ambiguity about the membership in a neutrally chosen peer group is being used strategically by firms to increase the size of peer group bias.  When it is relatively obvious whom the firm should be choosing as peers, the bias tends to be smaller.  Conversely, peer group bias is larger when firms have more discretion due to the set of plausible peers as well as the spread of the pay of their CEOs being relatively large.  Figure 3 shows the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile of peer group bias expressed as a percent of the median pay of a neutrally chosen peer group.  This figure shows that bias is generally larger when firms have more discretion in the choice a peer group.  When a company is doing very well, there is arguably less need to introduce bias into the peer group because the argument for high pay can be made easily.  When the company performs less well, the argument for high pay is more difficult to make.  Our results show that bias is generally larger when financial targets are not met and when firms have greater discretion in the selection of peer firms from the set of plausible peers. Taken together, the findings from this research call into question the practical impact of recent efforts to introduce greater transparency into the process for determining executive compensation.
