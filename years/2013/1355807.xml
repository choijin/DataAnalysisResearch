<AbstractNarration>The Department of Oceanography in the College of Geosciences at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) is recruiting academically talented graduate students with demonstrated financial need to become Oceanography Scholars. Scholarships will be awarded to a total of 22 new students admitted in three cohorts; the first two will be composed of five M.S. and four Ph.D. students each, while the third will contain five M.S. students.  Oceanography Scholars receive additional support from faculty research mentors and formal training in teaching pedagogies through courses and workshops offered by the university's Center for Teaching Excellence, Graduate Teaching Academy and the Department of Oceanography.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program is designed to educate scientists with interdisciplinary expertise in oceanographic processes to solve environmental, social and economically important challenges facing the nation by conducting research in their field. Doctoral graduates will enter the workforce directly from the program while M.S. graduates may either enter the workforce or matriculate into Ph.D. programs where they will build new knowledge to address scientific challenges that are relevant to both human and environmental sustainability.  Through targeted recruiting efforts, academically talented students with financial need will matriculate at TAMU, conduct research, and graduate prepared to address areas of high national need.</AbstractNarration>
