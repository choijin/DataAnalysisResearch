<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is funding Dr. Coran Watanabe from Texas A&amp;M University and Dr. Stephen Ealick of Cornell University to collaboratively  characterize enzymes of the azinomycin biosynthetic pathway both functionally and structurally.  Specifically, this project is directed at the evaluation of thioesterase-domain interacting partners and structural characterization of the iterative polyketide synthase (PKS) AziB, as well as  functional characterization of both AziA2, and the of azabicycle biosynthetic enzymes.  This project also aims at a structural understanding of the bacterial Type I iterative polyketide synthase (PKS) involved in the construction of the azinomycin naphthoate. While it was long thought that all bacterial aromatic polyketides are derived from Type II PKSs, it is now clear that this is not the case and the azinomycin PKS serves as a specific example. The azinomycin PKS will thus serve as a model system for this bacterial Type I iterative PKS class.  Experiments will elucidate the key role of an unusual non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) module of unprecedented domain architecture (C-PCP-C). The azinomycins also contain an aziridine ring system, the biosynthesis of which is poorly understood.  These studies should provide inroads into the route and mechanism of aziridine formation through the functional characterization of four enzymes of this pathway. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Natural products or secondary metabolites are compounds that are produced by a given organism but are not essential to the survival of the host.  Such compounds often possess potent bioactivities and serve as lead compounds for the development of therapeutic agents.  The biosynthesis of the azinomycins is under investigation here.  The azinomycins are a family of DNA crosslinking agents with demonstrated anti-tumor activity.  Understanding how nature constructs these strained ring systems should shed light on a fundamental mechanistic question in biosynthesis and  also pave the way for the engineering of the pathway genes for therapeutic purposes, in the longer term.  This project also includes an outreach component where both undergraduate and high school students will be exposed to natural products research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this research we used X-crystallography to study the three-dimensional structure of enzymes involved in azinomycin biosynthesis.  Azinomycins are potent antitumor agents with the ability to crosslink DNA.  Understanding the biosynthesis of azinomycins could lead to the development of new chemotherapeutic agents.  We determined the structure of AziG alone and in complex the product of its reaction, 5-methylnaphthoate.  AziG is a thioesterase required for the biosynthesis of azinomycin.  Prior to our studies, its function was unknown; however, the structural studies in combination with biochemical studies, carried out in the laboratory of Dr. Coran Watanabe at Texas A&amp;M University, demonstrated that AziG is involved in chain elongation and cyclization.  To determine the structures of AziG and the AziG product complex, we first used purified AziG to grow single crystals of AziG.  Crystals of AziG complexed with 5-methylnaphthoate were prepared by soaking preformed crystals of AziG in solutions containing 5-methylnaphthoate.  X-ray diffraction studies of AziG lead to the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms, while the structure of the 5-methylnaphthoate complex showed the details of the AziG active site.  Knowledge of the amino acid residues located in the active site allowed us to propose a mechanism by which AziG carries out its biochemical function.  The roles of individual amino acids were probed by preparing AziGs in which an active site residue was mutated and then testing the enzymatic activity.  Comparison of the structure of AziG with other enzymes of known structure confirmed the thioesterase activity of AziG and suggested that the azinomyzin biosynthetic pathway is an evolutionary hybrid of related bacterial and eukaryotic pathways.
