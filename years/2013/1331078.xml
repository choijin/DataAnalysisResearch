<AbstractNarration>This study examines the important role that biological understanding of the tropics has played in the development of US multinational firms seeking to promote economic growth and the free movement of commodities and commerce with Latin America and West Africa.   Using the case of rubber and coffee plantations, this historical study documents the close relationship between American business and the development of American scientific research and understanding in tropical biology and medicine.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The findings will be widely distributed using an interactive website</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project addresses a  transformational moment in LiberiaÆs past, a 1926 Harvard  scientific expedition to the country's interior.  In 1926, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Company secured a ninety-nine  year lease for up to one million acres of land from the Liberian  government to establish one of the worldÆs largest rubber plantations.  To help the company understand the conditions and challenges it faced,  Firestone sponsored a Harvard team of scientists and physicians to  conduct a four-month-long biological and medical survey of LiberiaÆs  interior.  Loring Whitman, a Harvard medical student, served as the  expedition's official photographer.  The motion picture footage and photographs taken by Whitman, along with the expedition documents, further our understanding of the ways American scientific and medical research was shaped by and helped advance the efforts of American multinational firms, such as Firestone, in enhancing their overseas production in rubber and other tropical commodities after the First World War.  In particular, the project points to the historical significance of industrial plantations as sites where ecological and evolutionary understandings of disease first emerged.  In addition, the project created a free and accessible digital resoource that makes these expedition materials publicly available for the first time in Liberia. The motion picture record  Whitman gathered is the earliest known   surviving motion picture footage  of Liberia. The moving images, along   with hundreds of still photographs  taken, give a view of Liberia shaped   by  an early-twentieth-century Western world view of the American    scientists. At the same time, the footage and photographs offer a    valuable historical record of the peoples, cultural traditions, and    landscapes of Liberia at a time of rapid economic, cultural, and    environmental change.  Through a collaborative partnership between the Liberian Center for National Documents and Records Agency (CNDRA),  the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University, Indiana University Liberian Collections, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the team developed a public history website, A Liberian Journey: History, Memory, and the Making of a Nation .  A Liberian Journey is meant to inform, raise questions, and invite stories about a transformational moment in LiberiaÆs past by making historical sources available  for the first time in one place related to the 1926 Harvard expedition. The website features an exhibit on Chief Suah Koko&mdash;a noted woman leader in LiberiaÆs history&mdash;along with digital collections containing nearly 600 photographs, more than two hours of motion picture footage, oral histories, and documents linked to an interactive map.  President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, speaking at the ceremonial launch of A Liberian Journey, remarked:  "I hope the website will help Liberians to be enlightened, informed and more conscious of who we are and what we can do and the partnership that it represents over the many years."  In retracing the itinerary of the Harvard expedition in Liberia, the project team also filmed oral histories with paramount and town chiefs, scholars, government officials, and local people in Liberia, prompted by their interactions with the footage and photographs.  Some of these materials form the basis of a feature-length documentary, The Land Beneath Our Feet, in post-production that weaves together rare motion picture footage shot on the Harvard expedition with the journey of a young Liberian man seeking to understand how the past has shaped land rights issues in Liberia today.
