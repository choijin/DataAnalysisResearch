<AbstractNarration>Dr. Caroline Funk and a collaborative, multidisciplinary team of six federal agency and academic colleagues from across the United States will conduct one year of field research and laboratory analyses centered on Kiska Island, Western Aleutians, Alaska. They will research human impacts on resources and environmental/ecological histories by studying the prehistoric Aleut archaeological record and the environmental history of Kiska Island. The team will work to develop an environmental/ecological history of the area and a history of human use of Kiska Island, to identify potential areas of human impact on the environment, and to contribute to global debates about long-term human intersections with coast/island environments. These broad objectives are accomplished by cooperative research in the anthro-, geo-, and biosciences to answer a series of questions: how did prehistoric Rat Islands Aleut live within and conceive of their landscape and how did the environment shape Rat Islands Aleut culture? What physical and climatic conditions and events did Rat Islands Aleut, the environment, and indigenous plant and animal species endure? What role did humans have in shaping the form and characteristics of landscapes, seascapes, and non-human species? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand the interactions between Aleuts and their environment, variations in plant and animal species present in archaeological sites are compared to known or our newly defined climate trends, seismic records, volcanic events, and events and processes in Kiska Island Aleut prehistory. Field work includes archaeological survey aimed toward locating new archaeological sites, testing known and newly discovered sites, and geo-survey to map geomorphological and geological features.  On and off site coring provides pollen and plant macrofossil data and lake coring provides high resolution tephra data. Island intertidal survey sets baseline data for modeling the regional food web. Laboratory analyses are performed on all materials collected during fieldwork, creating the multidisciplinary, comparative data sets necessary to test our hypotheses about recursive human/environment impacts. Lithic and organic artifact analyses and faunal analyses provide data about Aleut identity and resource use. Lithic artifact sourcing (XRF) may grant insight into Aleut contacts outside of the Rat Islands group. Pollen and plant macrofossils provide information about Aleut plant use and paloeclimate. Sea mammal population characteristics as measured by isotope and trace element analyses performed on archaeological specimens provide information about prehistoric subsistence harvests and marine ecosystem dynamics when combined with the new food web models. Geological tephrastratigraphy development and geomorphological studies provide information about large-scale environmental events that may have impacted humans and their resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research contributes valuable data regarding human and large-scale environmental event impacts to studies of the North. Entirely new environmental and human histories of Kiska Island and Rat Islands Aleuts developed from our synergy of anthropology/archaeology, bioscience, and geoscience link to regional and global data sets to expand understanding of the form and function of island ecosystems and human relationships with them.  The work aids in restoration ecology and land management decisions, while advancing socionatural and identity theories about small-scale society impacts on their landscapes. A project website, public talks, and scholarly articles and presentations ensure that the work is broadly disseminated in Aleut, public, land management, and scientific communities.</AbstractNarration>

The research advanced knowledge about the occupation of Kiska Island, Alaska by Aleut ancestors, expanding our understanding of the density, duration, and variability of pre-AD 1700s life on the island and in the western Aleutians more generally. The project expanded the Aleutian food web model geographically by adding to it marine intertidal species data from the western Aleutians, and through time by adding to bird, marine mammal, fish, and invertebrate population health data derived from isotope studies and the analysis of excavated archaeological assemblages. The project resulted in the first pollen core analysis for the region, providing new data about the development of soils in the region, and subsequent climate and human impacts on local soil characteristics and plant populations. Comparing data from the multiple approaches to researching humans and ecological conditions allowed the project researchers to better understand intersections between human activities, non-human marine and terrestrial resource populations, plant populations and soil conditions, and large-scale climate or volcanic events.</p> <p>Project research included four weeks of field research in Summer 2014 and subsequent laboratory analysis in multiple institutions: SUNY University at Buffalo, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, Hamline University, and independent research laboratories. All archaeological materials have been curated to museum standards and placed in the University of Alaska Museum of the North Archaeology Collections. Marine ecology samples and peat cores are in long-term storage at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.</p> <p>The research project successfully fulfilled the stated broader impacts goal of increasing public access to, Aleut/Unangan access to, and student participation in active scientific research. &nbsp;Project activities and results were posted on the public access project website and on a globally accessed blog forum viewed by people from 37 countries. Multiple research papers/research posters were presented by project scientists and students from 2014-2017 at national and international conferences and by invitation at universities (e.g. University of Alaska, Anchorage, SUNY University at Buffalo, Hamline University). The research project was presented to an audience of ~ 100 people at the Aleut Corporation Village Seminar in 2015. Twenty-nine undergraduate students and six graduate students participated in field and/or laboratory research during the project. Student participants include people from diverse ethnicities, educational backgrounds, and gender identities. All are now trained and experienced in theoretical and methodological research processes. Three of the graduate students are engaged in PhD research based in project data. All three of these students have been senior authors on research presentations.</p> <p>Project analyses were completed in early Spring 2017. Three forthcoming articles are expected for Summer and Fall 2017:&nbsp; &ldquo;Japanese World War II Encampments on Kiska Island, Western Aleutians, Alaska&rdquo;, &ldquo;Qax^un land and sea management: Prehistoric human impacts in the Western Aleutian Islands, Alaska&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Qax^un in the Rat Islands: 4,200 &ndash; 300bp&rdquo; authored by the PI and members of the research team.
