<AbstractNarration>There has recently been a significant increase in the application of the methods of algebraic geometry to problems outside of mathematics.  The resulting interdisciplinary work necessarily entails much interaction between experts in algebraic geometry and those from other disciplines.  The PI will run a workshop July 29-31, 2013 focused on introducing non-experts to two fundamental tools rooted in algebraic geometry:  numerical algebraic geometry and toric geometry.  Authors of recent books in these two areas will give lectures:  Frank Sottile and Jonathan Hauenstein for numerical algebraic geometry, John Little and Hal Schenck for toric geometry.  These lectures will serve as a rapid introduction to the methods and software from these two areas, focused on the value for problems coming from applications. This meeting will take place at the Pingree Park mountain campus of Colorado State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical problems in application areas can sometimes be converted into a certain type of problem, the polynomial system.  For years, there was no efficient way to solve polynomial systems, so researchers had to find different, sometimes less desirable, formulations for their problems.  However, with recent developments in numerical algebraic geometry and toric geometry, it is now reasonable to solve relatively large polynomial systems directly.  These new computational tools open the door to study problems that were previously too difficult to consider.  For example, in kinematics, the introduction of numerical algebraic geometry has already resulted in the ability to solve long-standing problems and to discover new mechanisms with special properties.  The workshop supported by this award will help to expedite the use of these powerful new tools by the researchers who need them.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award provided support for a pair of tutorials that took place July 29-31 at the Pingree Park mountain campus of Colorado State University. The tutorials were on two popular and practically useful subareas of applied/computational algebraic geometry: Toric Geometry and Numerical Algebraic Geometry.  These tutorials consisted of several hours of lecture time and ample time for problem sessions, supervised by the tutorial leaders.  The leaders were John Little (Holy Cross College) and Hal Schenck (UIUC) for Toric Geometry and Jon Hauenstein (Notre Dame) and Frank Sottile (Texas A&amp;M) for Numerical Algebraic Geometry. Participants were bussed from CSU's Fort Collins campus about 40 miles into the mountains, where they stayed in rustic cabins for the tutorials and spent much time in close quarters with virtually no connection to the outside world, aiding in the development of a tight-knit community.   The tutorials were attended by nearly 50 researchers from a variety of disciplines, many near the beginning of their careers.  The broader impacts of the meeting supported by this award lie in the training of nearly 50 young researchers in new, non-standard, practically valuable methods.  The two tutorial topics were specifically chosen due to their previous uses in applications and potential for future applications.  As a result, there is a very real possibility that this meeting could result in value outside of mathematics.  Also, professional development topics were discussed formally and informally, and the participants had the opportunity to develop mentoring relationships with the several senior leaders. The intellectual merit of the meeting supported by this award lies in the future publications that derive from the mathematics conveyed during the tutorials. While no new mathematics was developed during the tutorials, the techniques and theory described will likely have value for some of the participants as they approach new problems within and outside mathematics in the future.
