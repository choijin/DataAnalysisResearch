<AbstractNarration>This project is taking advantage of the previously-untapped synergy between extremely rapid microwave-assisted organic synthesis (MAOS) techniques and new pedagogical approaches to develop and evaluate a student-centered instructional approach for the sophomore-level organic laboratory. With the laboratory time gained through the use of MAOS, students now use a laboratory period for experimental design, analysis, debriefing, troubleshooting, and optimization, allowing for inquiry cycles that are both reflective of typical scientific practice and effective in promoting desirable cognitive outcomes. This approach has transformed organic laboratory instruction at Allegheny College, St. Mary's College, and Queensborough Community College, shifting the focus from verification to experimental design and collaborative construction of knowledge. Laboratory modules being developed and refined include an array of content designed for easy adoption and implementation, including student lab companion materials, pre-lab activities, and case studies; reagent and instrument prep sheets; instructor's guides; spectra of relevant compounds; and assessment rubrics. The project team is evaluating student thinking during lab, content learning, and attitudes toward science associated with the new instructional approach via analyses of pre- and post-treatment survey responses, classroom observations, student and faculty interviews, and student laboratory reports.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A new curriculum has been developed for the two-semester sophomore organic instructional laboratory sequence featuring microwave-assisted organic synthesis (MAOS).  The short reaction times afforded by MAOS techniques, combined with rapid HPLC methods, allow for re-envisioning the laboratory period to include value-added components, such as experimental design, team debriefing of results, and process optimization.  The laboratory materials are inspired by principles of guided inquiry and student-centered pedagogy.  In lieu of a "cookbook" procedure, investigations are motivated by case studies and the entire curriculum is supported by technique primers that include instructional videos, so that students can more effectively prepare for the technical aspects of lab beforehand.  These materials are freely available at http://miblabs.omeka.net.  Assessment of the new curriculum was carried out using several methods.  Administering the Attitudes Toward Science Inventory (ATSI) at the beginning and end of each semester showed that students in the treatment labs emerged with more positive attitudes about the usefulness of science and their own enjoyment of science, and these findings were supported by anecdotal evidence gleaned from interviews by an external evaluator.  Laboratory observations and analysis of lab reports further demonstrated a shift toward more critical thinking in the treatment labs.  We have shown that this curriculum results in significant attitudinal gains as compared to a conventional organic laboratory curriculum.  It is reasonable to assume that enhancing a student's attitude about science will contribute to persistence and grit.  A growing body of evidence suggests that active learning strategies are particularly helpful for students from underserved populations.  Therefore, laboratory curricula such as ours are likely to provide more inclusive learning environments that may well translate to greater diversity among science majors.  Even for those students who do not major in the physical sciences, having a positive experience in the instructional lab can be an important factor for developing inclinations that contribute to long-term scientific literacy.
