<AbstractNarration>The unPAK project (undergraduates Phenotyping Arabidopsis Knockouts) uses the plant Arabidopsis thaliana to examine how and when differences in DNA sequences lead to differences in traits related to survival, growth, and reproduction.  It will detect effects, if any, of mutation in a comprehensive collection of mutants generated by the SALK Institute, and will then compile results in a comprehensive database. To examine the interaction of genetic and environmental effects, unPAK's experiments are replicated within and across multiple growth facilities and labs, and a subset of experiments deliberately manipulate soil factors, moisture, and temperature to see how these important ecological factors interact with genetics. &lt;br/&gt;   unPAK will survey enough mutant lines to reach coverage of a third of the A. thaliana genome (approximately 9,000 genes). All data are uploaded into a public database at arabidopsisunpak.org, and the unPAK project links its database of observed traits to existing genomic databases. Evidence produced by unPAK will enable testing central hypotheses about the relationship between genomic features and important plant characteristics. For example, the data can be used to test whether the effects of mutation are predicted by gene attributes such as molecular signatures of selection in the past, gene function, gene family size, or by patterns of variability in natural populations.&lt;br/&gt;  unPAK is centered around participation of undergraduate researchers in the lab and the classroom, educating and training undergraduates integratively in genetics, ecology, evolution, and bioinformatics. The network extends across diverse post-secondary institutions, with over 100 undergraduate apprentices participating across 13 laboratories in 3 years.  Greater than 20 course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) will be supported by the program, reaching over 600 students. Any discoveries about the influence of particular genes on fruit production, survival, or life history will have significant broader impacts in potential application to crop species.&lt;br/&gt;   As a final part of the project the unPAK research network itself is being studied. Using mixed-methods approaches from the social sciences, researchers are documenting interactions among network participants to analyze changes in network structure over time, and to investigate factors that influence student participation and outcomes, including students? accrual of human, cultural, and social capital.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The Undergraduates Phenotyping Arabidopsis Knockouts (unPAK) network is a group of faculty at primarily-undergraduate institutions studying the genotypes and phenotypes of a series of knockout lines of A. thaliana called SALK mutations.  By performing phenotyping experiments on SALK lines, the unPAK network seeks to uncover the genetic roles played by the overwhelming majority of genes in the A. theliana  genome (~97%) without a clearly-defined phenotype. In the process of this work, the network needed to screen the SALK lines by dual target PCR to establish which lines contained a true single mutation since the T-DNA mechanism used to generate the lines was susceptible to generating off-target mutations.  The network found that about 50% of the SALK lines had off-target mutations that made them unsuitable for accurate phenotyping.     The unPAK database (http://arabidopsis.biology.cofc.edu) is a public repository for the data generated by the network that can be used by the A. thaliana community in designing experiments to specifically examine a particular gene of interest with respect to its putative phenotype and genomic and phenomic properties.     Importantly, the work of unPAK is done largely through the work of undergraduates.  Thus far, unPAK has provided independent research opportunities for ~25 undergraduates at Hampden-Sydney and research access for ~100 additional students through the use of unPAK materials adapted to course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) done in Genetics and Cell Biology classes.  By crowdsourcing the data gathering and analysis of unPAK among undergraduates, the network is an invaluable means for the training of the next generation of scientists.  These trainees have received experience with experimental design and implementation, analysis of data, and dissemination of findings via oral and written modes.  They have also demonstrated a sense of engagement and project ownership with their unPAK work that promotes retention in the sciences in particular and STEM-based careers in general over the long run.
