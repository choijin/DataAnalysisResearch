<AbstractNarration>The Luquillo Long Term Ecological Research project has examined environmental drivers of biodiversity dynamics and biogeochemical cyles in a tropical, montane forest for over 28 years. This proposal funds planning meetings to bring project participants together to develop future research directions that arise from syntheses of their long-term data, are motivated by strong linkages to ecological theory, and that are widely applicable to other tropical, forested, montane regions. The resulting research agenda will be broadly applicable across LTER sites as it will encompass ecosystems that include a complex mixture of pristine and highly urbanized and suburbanized habitats. A second goal will be to design research to understand ecological dynamics in light of disturbance regimes that are dominated by changes in both land use and climate.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed planning meetings will include graduate students and postdoctoral researchers together with research scientists and information managers. Engaging early-career students and researchers in the process of research design and proposal development is an important aspect of comprehensive education and training. Students will be recruited from under-represented groups, which are abundantly represented in Puerto Rico. Over a longer term, the research directions developed will strengthen the Luquillo Forest's connections with other major projects in Puerto Rico, such as NEON, STREON, IGERT, CZO, and ULTRA-Ex. Moreover, the project's Schoolyard program reaches teachers and hundreds of middle and high school students through field research and web-based middle school curricula.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this project were to synthesize and integrate ecological understanding derived from long-term research in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico, and to convene a number of research-development meetings, organized around a conceptual framework and projects that we expected to form the basis of a Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) renewal proposal.  As such, we convened 3 general meetings and 3 thematic (biodiversity, modeling, and succession) workshops.  Scientific Merit.--We refined a conceptual model to guide future research  along gradients in the Luquillo Mountains that  included climatic drivers (e.g., hurricane frequency, drought intensity and frequency, gradual temperature increases) and integrated responses of the biota, ecosystem processes (e.g., decomposition), and biogeochemical cycles.  In addition, we (1) re-designed a manipulative experiment to explore the effects of increased hurricane frequency on the dynamics of populations, communities, biogeochemical cycles, and ecosystem functions, and (2) designed a manipulative "drought experiment" to explore how extended dry periods will affect the structure and function of tropical forest ecosystems.  Our activities strengthened the predictive ability of ecological  research, and integrated it with research in atmospheric sciences and  geosciences.  Finally, our efforts  contributed significantly to the submission of a successful proposal to the LTER Program.  Broader Impacts.--This grant supported interactions among graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, scientific staff, and faculty members, who collectively represent a large number of institutions, including both research-intensive universities and predominantly teaching colleges, as well as units in the US Forest Service, US Fish and Wildlife Service, the Smithsonian Institution, and Department of Energy.  Meetings engaged modelers, geographers, atmospheric scientists,  biogeochemists, and plant, animal, and microbial ecologists.  This project thus  contributed to the integration of sub-disciplines within environmental  biology and to the integration of disciplines within the broader field of  environmental science.  Our various meetings and workshops brought together long-term collaborators from the Luquillo LTER program with many (~25) other students, postdoctoral fellows, staff members, and faculty members, including individuals from the mainland US,  Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.  Moreover, participants included many scientists involved in applied disciplines such as management and conservation. This enhanced the network of interactions among participants and contributed to transdisciplinary collaboration.  We were highly successful in recruiting participants at our meetings and workshops who are members of groups that are underrepresented in science, including women (~20 participants) and Hispanics (~10 participants). In addition, we successfully recruited a number of graduate students and post-doctoral associates to participate in workshop activities, thereby enhancing the infrastructure of science.  In particular, the Biodiversity Workshop introduced many students, faculty members, and staff scientists to software tools and approaches for using species distribution modeling to understand the responses of populations and communities to salient environmental gradients as well as to global change drivers.
