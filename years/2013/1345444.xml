<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will offer breakthrough Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technology in a high-performance computing cloud environment. Looking towards eliminating the need for physical testing, it is now common practice in the energy, automotive, aerospace, chemical process industries, among many others, to use CFD to predict turbulent gas and liquid flows within and around solid objects. The new CFD approach pursued in this project has distinct advantages over both traditional RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes) modeling, as well as currently-available Large Eddy Simulation (LES) technology, in efficiently capturing the physics of turbulence ? the single, most complicated phenomenon in fluid engineering. Specifically, the first application proposed here will solve one of the most complex fluid engineering problems, namely flows about rotating/moving bodies, which will undoubtedly advance current design capabilities for next generation energy, automotive and aerospace-related technologies. Moreover, by offering this innovative CFD software in a cloud application, this project will provide unique accuracy and reliability to a wide range of CFD users, including small and medium-sized businesses for which large scale computing in CFD has heretofore been too costly or technically difficult to pursue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is far reaching. The benefits to all segments of industry include cost &amp; time savings in product development, better engineering, enhanced safety and the exploration of advanced concepts that are too difficult or dangerous for physical experiments. Since high-end CFD software requires access to High Performance Computing (HPC) systems and annual licenses are relatively expensive, small and medium size businesses seldom possess the expertise or resources to utilize them. This project harnesses the affordability of cloud computing by fostering diverse new applications that these companies can use to solve a vast array of practical flow problems dominated by turbulence, thereby leveling the playing field and promoting innovation. Although the focus is on energy and automotive applications that will be employed for validation and go-to-market purposes, flows of interest include those encountered in the development of wind/hydro turbines, ground vehicles, rotorcraft, wave and ocean current power generation devices and many other applications of direct relevance to a wide range of industries. Furthermore, development of this unique technology in a cloud will provide affordable opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers to engage in the solution of complex scientific problems.</AbstractNarration>
