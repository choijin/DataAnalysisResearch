<AbstractNarration>The rights mobilization literature suggests that a high risk of harm generally inhibits social movement activism, yet this does not appear to be the case for undocumented youth who have mobilized for social change. To understand theoretically what has allowed these youth to organize despite the threats they confront, this research explores the social movement activism of undocumented Asian and Latina/o youth advocating for immigration reform. A theoretic model of legal mobilization is proposed and tested based on data gathered from in-depth interviews and participant observation of three community-based organizations over a period of two years. Recent developments in the national landscape regarding immigration and immigrant rights point to the need for an understanding of the inner workings of legal mobilization among members of marginalized populations, and how such activism does or does not relate to conventional understandings of mobilization among members of similarly situated groups.</AbstractNarration>

Despite the potential for removal from the state as a result of their participation, activists has not been deterred, but rather, have increased their involvement in planning actions and engaging in more radical approaches to organizing.

Drawing upon legal scholar Kimberl&eacute; CrenshawÆs conceptualization of intersectionality, we argue that activists also invoked a narrative of intersectional identities, which they leveraged in a strategic fashion. Foregrounding undocumented status, activists also highlighted the overlap between the immigrant experience and queer, people of color and working class narratives. This approach in turn facilitated coalition building with other communities, working to make the immigrant rights a broader, far-reaching national issue.       We continue on to argue that undocumented youth activistsÆ emphasis on intersectional identities is also accompanied by a heightened, more nuanced understanding of the law. As "extra-legal" subjects, it would follow that undocumented community members would see themselves as subjects of the law, rather than active agents and participants in its making. However, participants in the study displayed a thorough knowledge of the law and legal processes that they used to advocate for increased rights. Previously shut out from the formal legal system, many undocumented youth interviewed have pursued careers as attorneys, testified at senate hearings and participated in acts of civil disobedience.
