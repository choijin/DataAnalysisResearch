<AbstractNarration>Linguistic code switching (LCS) is the practice of switching back and forth between the shared languages of bilingual or multilingual speakers. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in geographic regions with linguistic boundaries or where there are large immigrant groups. Various levels of language (phonological, morphological, syntactic, semantic and discourse-pragmatic) may be implicated in LCS in different language pairs and/or genres. Computational algorithms trained for a single language quickly break down when the input includes LCS. A major barrier to research on LCS in computational linguistics (CL) has been the lack of large, accurately annotated corpora of LCS data. In this project, a large repository of LCS data is collected and a large annotation infrastructure is developed. It is consistently annotated in different modalities (speech and text), at various levels of linguistic granularity, and across different language pairs reflecting different linguistic typologies (Standard Arabic and Dialectal Arabic, Arabic-English, Spanish-English, Chinese-English, Hindi-English). The focus of the effort is on intra-sentential LCS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This infrastructure and unified large LCS data resource is eagerly awaited by the CL research community, since annotated LCS data provides a natural test-bed for adaptive learning algorithms and the handling of diverse data sources, as well as a framework for genuine multilingual processing. It will also be of benefit to sociolinguistic and theoretical linguistic researchers, and provide a platform for collaborative interdisciplinary research. Finally, research on LCS helps overcome biases against multilingual speakers by demonstrating the creativity of such speakers in exploiting their verbal repertoires. Such a result is particularly important for K-12 education and testing policies in the USA with its diverse immigrant population.</AbstractNarration>

Addressing Linguistic Code Switching head on allowed us to develop more robust enabling technologies in the single language space by trying to accommodate less amounts of training data. We have also been able to note patterns in the usage of code switching that are leveraged by our machine learning models indicating that indeed linguistic code switching is not random.   Having such large amounts of annotated data that is consistently annotated across several language pairs has also inspired other scientists to adopt our guidelines for other language pairs propelling research in this area even further.   Large amounts of annotated data help with developing and testing various algorithms allowing for a healthy scientific exploration of that space while the challenge of data is less of an impediment.   We also created a very nice collaborative environment for researchers to exchange data and ideas in the context of the workshops we organized.   We established standard data sets for the community which serve as both a way for comparison of the various developed algorithms but also allowed us to expose some of the issues with the guidelines and annotation decisions taken up by our group as we iterated through the annotations as they were being tested in the context of the algorithms leveraging them hence yielding a more robust extrinsic evaluation of the quality of the annotations.
