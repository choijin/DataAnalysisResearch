<AbstractNarration>The conference Texas-Oklahoma  Representations and Automorphic forms IV will take place on March 23-24, 2013, at the University of North Texas.  Additional information can be found on the confernce website: http://www.math.unt.edu/~richter/TORA/TORA4.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last century, the theories of automorphic forms and  representations have grown enormously. Important applications impact various fields of research, ranging from number theory, coding theory, algebraic geometry, and topology to Kac-Moody algebras and quantum field theory. The interplay of automorphic forms and representation theory has been especially fruitful, and many surprising and deep results have emerged. The TORA conference series will emphasize the interplay between automorphic forms and representations, both in the classical and adelic languages, and related topics like analytic number theory and harmonic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TORA mathematics conference series consists of semi-annual meetings hosted by the University of North Texas, Oklahoma State University, and the University of Oklahoma on a rotating basis. This award provides support for three weekend conferences, one at the University of North Texas in Spring 2013 (TORA IV), one at Oklahoma State University in Fall 2013 (TORA V), and another at the University of Oklahoma in Spring 2014 (TORA VI). Each conference will feature two or three prominent guest speakers from outside the Texas-Oklahoma region, in addition to other participants including students, post-doctoral researchers, and junior faculty. Regional graduate students and  researchers will also give talks describing their work. These conferences will facilitate collaborations and interactions among the students and researchers in the region who work in the areas of Automorphic Forms, Representation Theory, and Number Theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Texas--Oklahoma Representations and Automorphic forms (TORA) series is a new conference program launching collaborations in the Texas--Oklahoma region among mathematicians working in number theory, modern algebra, and related fields.  This series of meetings has built a focused community of support, exchange, and mentoring for students and faculty at all career levels at various universities in the Southcentral United States working in fields related to automorphic forms and representation theory.  Two meetings were held each year in rotation by Oklahoma State University, University of Oklahoma, and University of North Texas.  During each meeting, two prominent guest speakers and a graduate student plenary speaker from outside the Texas--Oklahoma region presented new research results.  Regional researchers and graduate students also gave talks describing their work.  Junior mathematicians and graduate students received career and professional advice and training in communicating research results.  Both junior and senior mathematicians in the area have formed long-term relationships and collaborations.  TORA IV was held at the University of North Texas March 23-24, 2013.  The 63 participants of the conference included 28 tenure/tenure-track faculty (2 female), 9 junior faculty (2 female), and 26 graduate students (12 female).  There were 16 regular talks (ranging from 20-50 min) and 15 Speed TORA talks (5 min) on various aspects of automorphic forms and representation theory.  The plenary talks were given by Ken Ribet (UC Berkeley) and Nolan Wallach (UC San Diego), and the invited graduate student talk was given by Susie Kimport (Yale University).  The organizers received extremely positive feedback about TORA IV: several graduate students expressed their appreciation for the opportunity to speak on their thesis results, and they commented on benefiting from discussions with peers and faculty from nearby institutions. Many participants also indicated their desire to attend future TORA meetings.       Last Modified: 09/01/2014       Submitted by: Olav K Richter]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
