<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Eric D'Hoker, Michael Gutperle, and Per Kraus in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at UCLA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decades after its discovery, string theory remains a vibrant subject, continuing to shed light on fundamental problems in physics. The basic principles of string theory remain mysterious, as does its precise role in explaining observable physical phenomena, yet its power as a conceptual and computational tool is now well established and being applied to a wide range of topics, from pure mathematics to particle physics and condensed matter.  In their research, Professors D'Hoker, Gutperle, and Kraus seek to advance the understanding of the precise formulation of string theory;  to shed light on fundamental problems involving black holes and quantum gravity;  and to apply techniques of gauge/gravity duality to novel situations in quantum field theory, including those relevant to condensed matter physics.&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;This project is aimed at having significant broader impact.  Professors D'Hoker, Gutperle, and Kraus will be conducting research in a highly collaborative manner involving graduate students and postdocs, thereby providing critical training for physicists in the early stages of their research careers.  Professors D'Hoker, Gutperle, and Kraus also plan to disseminate the results of their research by presenting seminars, colloquia, and public lectures, including at high schools and summer schools.  Additionally, they are involved in advancing education, outreach, and interdisciplinary collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
