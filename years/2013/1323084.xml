<AbstractNarration>This project team is building on the results of a TUES Type 1 award that created new learning materials for a project-based course that provides greater access to introductory statistics for large numbers of students primarily not in STEM-intensive majors. The approach features training in flexible application of knowledge, opportunities to analyze data in real world contexts, and education about statistical concepts through computing. In this Type 2 effort the principal investigators (PIs) are adapting and fine-tuning the current materials to add flexibility and seamlessness so that they are usable across a wide array of institutional settings and easily modified to meet the needs of students with different levels of preparation, learning styles, and interest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in its focus on the need of students outside of traditional STEM disciplines to have conceptual and analytical tools at their disposal to grapple with "big data" applications in their fields of inquiry. Moreover, the initial course materials have been piloted by nine different instructors and 350 students. Short-term and long-term learning gains for students are also being assessed at both the transition to college and post-graduation levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs are pursuing the broader impact of their efforts along two dimensions: first, by implementing and assessing their project-based model for learning in five partner institutions including universities, community colleges, and in a small number of cases, secondary school settings; and second, by conducting summer workshops for new faculty from varied disciplinary backgrounds to become prepared to teach using this project-based model.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Passion-Driven Statistics<em> </em>is an evidence-based curriculum that promotes multidisciplinary inquiry based on large data sets, supports the flexible application of new analytics knowledge and skills, teaches modern computing tools, provides support for students at all skill levels, and frames the curriculum as the basis for understanding a complex world. Key innovations include: 1) project-based learning promoting choice and intrinsic motivation; 2) opportunities for multidisciplinary inquiry; 3) analysis of large data sets in real world contexts; 4) programming as a window into data-driven reasoning and communication; and 5) intensive, student-centered one-on-one support that capitalizes on evidence-based strategies to promote student success. What resources each student needs are dictated by their research question and results at each stage of their work, allowing students to creatively pursue questions of greatest interest to them and providing skills, confidence, and inspiration to pursue advanced opportunities. Rather than focusing on rules associated with traditional lists of statistical tools, the curriculum is organized to focus on the decisions and skills involved in statistical inquiry. Basic themes such as measurement and descriptive and graphical representation are covered, as well as more specific inferential methods needed to test hypotheses and explore the empirical structure of data. All, however, are introduced as the students&rsquo; research questions dictate. In this way, students are provided with opportunities to learn to select the tools that are most appropriate to address their research question(s) and to engage in statistical decision making. Using leading statistical software (e.g. R, SAS, Stata, Python, SPSS, etc.) students are exposed to a variety of statistical methods and learn to choose and use them flexibly as they are needed. During the project period the curriculum was found to enroll higher numbers of under-represented minority (URM) students compared to a traditional introductory statistics course. Further, while URM students have considered the Passion-Driven Statistics material more difficult than non-URM students, they have also demonstrated similar levels of increased confidence in applied skills and interest in follow up courses, and were found to be twice as likely as non-URM students to report that their interest in conducting research increased after completing the curriculum. Compared to students enrolled in a traditional introductory statistics course, those completing Passion-Driven Statistics have also been shown to be significantly more likely to report an increase in confidence between a pre and post course survey with regard to choosing the correct statistical test, managing data, and writing syntax or code to run statistical analyses. Passion-Driven Statistics students are also more likely than students in the traditional course to show an increase in their interest in pursuing advanced course-work in statistics. Overall, when compared to both traditional introductory statistics and introductory programming courses, Passion-Driven Statistics has been shown to attract students from a much wider range of academic backgrounds as measured by both demographic factors and Math SAT scores. The curriculum has been disseminated across diverse post-secondary and secondary educational settings (i.e. liberal arts colleges, large state universities, regional state colleges/universities, community colleges, high schools and high school enrichment programs) and its resources have been made freely available to everyone (<a href="http://passiondrivenstatistics.com/">http://passiondrivenstatistics.com</a>). The curriculum&rsquo;s broader impact can be seen in the recruitment and retention of women and underrepresented students, thus creating a larger, more gender and ethnically-balanced population with the kind of data skills needed to communicate across industry sectors, disciplines and audiences.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/02/2018<br>      Modified by: Lisa&nbsp;Dierker</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
