<AbstractNarration>Evolution is driven, in part, by changes in the function of molecules that control the physiology of the organism. Studying these changes is crucial for understanding the unique adaptations developed by organisms to survive the test of time. One molecule whose change over time can influence evolution is a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH activates reproduction to ensure the propagation of all vertebrate species. In invertebrates, GnRH is assumed to also activate reproduction although consistent support for such an assumption is lacking. It is hypothesized that invertebrate GnRH is not universally important to reproductive activation in invertebrates. Instead, invertebrate GnRH may assume a wide range of functions in neural, motor, and metamorphic control. The project investigates non-reproductive function of GnRH and a related peptide in an invertebrate animal, the sea slug Aplysia californica. These studies may reveal non-reproductive roles of GnRH critical to the survival of invertebrate species.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To study the non-reproductive function of GnRH and the related peptide, adipokinetic hormone, a combination of whole organism studies and molecular and biochemical techniques will be used.  The investigators will address the following aims: 1) Examine the role of GnRH in metamorphic development, 2) Perform in vitro functional analysis of GnRH receptor isoforms, investigate their distribution, and 3) Investigate the function of adipokinetic hormone. The work challenges a vertebrate-centric notion that invertebrate hormones essentially function as their vertebrate counterparts. This conceptual shift is important for advancing our knowledge on how changes in hormone function contribute to the survival, adaptation, and evolution of metazoans. For broader impacts, this project will provide Dr. Tsai with opportunities for: (1) undergraduate training, (2) minority recruitment, (3) inter-departmental and trans-Pacific collaborations, (4) information dissemination via the development of a novel website that uses humor and cartoons to engage K-12 students in comparative reproduction, and (5) outreach activities to showcase sea slugs to middle school students.  Data collected from these studies will be shared through peer-reviewed publications and the Invertebrate Brain Platform http://invbrain.neuroinf.jp/modules/htmldocs/IVBPF/Top/index.html.</AbstractNarration>

It was generally assumed that the functions of hormones were highly conserved during evolution. In other words, the function of a vertebrate hormone should be similar to its invertebrate counterpart. The goal of our proposal was to dispute this assumption by demonstrating that a highly conserved reproductive hormone essential for the propagation of vertebrate species does not serve the same function among invertebrates. Using a molluscan model, the sea hare <em>Aplysia californica</em>, we show that the hormone of interest, called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), does not assume a reproductive role. In addition, a close relative of GnRH, called adipokinetic hormone (AKH), has assumed a novel role in volume regulation. The overall intellectual impact of the project is the demonstration that hormone functions do not remain static over the course of evolution. Instead, even a hormone critical for the propagation of vertebrate species can diverge functionally among invertebrates. Our results challenge the conventional dogma that structurally conserved peptides are invariably conserved in their functions. Our research was accompanied by broader impacts in the form of graduate and undergraduate student training, website development, international collaborations, and outreach activities. In total, this award has supported the publication of 6 peer-reviewed manuscripts, 6 trainees (4 graduate students, 1 undergraduate student, and a postdoctoral fellow), and broader impact activities including the development of a website and several outreach activities including the recruitment of underrepresented students.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/01/2020<br>      Modified by: Pei-San&nbsp;Tsai</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1352944/1352944_10402824_1601589002339_Tsairesearchcartoon--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1352944/1352944_10402824_1601589002339_Tsairesearchcartoon--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sea slug GnRH"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1352944/1352944_10402824_1601589002339_Tsairesearchcartoon--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sea slug GnRH"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dr. Tsai's NSF-supported research is depicted in this hand-drawn cartoon, in collaboration with Dr. Leif Saul.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Pei-San Tsai and Leif Saul</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Pei-San&nbsp;Tsai</div> <div class="imageTitle">Sea slug GnRH</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
