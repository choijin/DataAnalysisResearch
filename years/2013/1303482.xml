<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2013 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Max Glick is "Cluster Algebras and Discrete Dynamical Systems." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Minnesota, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Pavlo Pylyavskyy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This work employed methods from discrete mathematics and algebra towards the study of dynamical systems of a generally geometric nature.  Together with collaboratos, I carried out numerous projects in these areas, resulting in the writing of 4 papers, 2 of which have already been published.  I also supervised a successful undergraduate research project during the 2014 Minnesota Combinatorics REU.  Lastly, I was a presenter at a 2016 summer school in Montreal introducing my research area of cluster algebras to a graduate student popoulation.  There are plans to collect lecture notes from all the presenters into a textbook.  A main example appearing in and inspiring this work is the pentagram map, first studied by R. Schwartz in 1992.  In its simplest form, the pentagram map refers to the following iterative procedure: begin with a (not necessarily regular) pentagon, draw a star connecting its 5 vertices, and then begin again from the smaller pentagonal region cut out in the center of the star.  A similar definition can be made for polygons with a larger number of sides.  Although the pentagram map is simple to define, it exhibits rich long-term behavior some of which has only been proven in the last 5 years.  Our main contribution is in strenghtening the bond between two areas.  The first is a series of generalizations of the pentagram map to higher dimensions and various other settings, carried out in the past 5 years mostly by M. Gekhtman, M. Shapiro, S. Tabachnikov, and A. Vainshtein and also B. Khesin and F. Soloviev.  The second is the theory of cluster algebras initiaed by S. Fomin and A. Zelevinsky in 2002.  We greatly expanded the collection of pentagram maps known to possess a cluster algebra structure.  We believe such a connection explains why only some the newer pentagram maps exhibit the same sort of behavior as the original.
