<AbstractNarration>What are the radial profiles, shapes, extents and orientations of the dark matter halos that surround galaxies? This fundamental question is particularly difficult to address in the outskirts of galaxies where there are few visible tracers. Perhaps the most promising approach is to use stellar debris from the destruction of satellite galaxies, and the most promising place to try this approach is the Milky Way - the one galaxy in the Universe where a halo's 3-dimensional structure (rather than a 2-dimensional projection) can be directly probed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a combined observational and theoretical approach to providing a new and powerful perspective on accreted halo substructures, and, in particular, poorly-studied stellar clouds. The observational program focuses on obtaining radial velocities for stars in known stellar clouds, and making connections between debris structures - from the Solar vicinity to the outer Galaxy, and from one side of the Galaxy to another. Such connections will yield the first comprehensive maps of these stellar debris structures on Galactic scales. Interpreting these maps with a systematic suite of simulations will fill in our missing knowledge of the Galaxy's accretion history and matter distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support the training of one minority student in their transition from undergraduate to graduate school through participation in Columbia's "Bridge to the PhD" program. It will also enable the PIs to actively engage students, amateur astronomers and the general public in building an understanding of the history of our home galaxy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Milky Way is known to be a cannibal, tearing apart and devouring hundreds of satellite galaxies over its lifetime. We can see signs of this appetite in the distorted shapes of some of the Milky Way?s current entourage of satellite systems, as well as occasionally in long streams of stellar debris emanating from them.  Particularly notable examples include the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy and the Palomar 5 globular cluster. We can also see remnants of half-digested objects littering the sky in the form of streams of stars which do not have a clear source, presumably because the original object has already been entirely destroyed by the Milky Way.   This award from the National Science Foundation has supported a research program looking into the origins and nature of structures orbiting around the Milky Way that are apparent in the form of amorphous clouds rather than known satellites or collimated streams. During this research program we have looked more closely at three such structures - known as the ``Triangulum-Andromeda I and II?? and ``A13?? stellar clouds. We have mapped how the stars within these clouds are moving, looked at their chemical compositions and analyzed the different types of stars that are members (or their ``stellar populations??). We have also built numerical models of how these clouds may have formed.  Our results all point to a conclusion that we did not anticipate - that these particular structures, rather than being the remnants of a long-dead satellite galaxy are more likely to have been formed by one of the current satellite systems kicking stars out of  Milky Way?s own Galactic disk! We came to this conclusion because: (i) the stars in these clouds all seemed to moving in the same sense that our own Sun orbits the Galactic center; (ii) the stellar populations in these clouds more closely resemble those in the disk of our Galaxy rather than in its satellites; and (iii) despite the fact that these clouds sit significantly beyond what was previously thought to be the edge of the disk, we were able to successfully create similar structures in simulations of satellite galaxies harassing their hosts.  Our results represent the first indication of stars formed in our disk at such extreme distances from the center of our Galaxy and above and below the Galactic plane. As such, they add some exciting new data to aid the growing field of ``Galactoseismology??, which looks at how the reaction of our Galactic disk to external influences might be interpreted.
