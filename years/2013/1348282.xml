<AbstractNarration>A workshop will be convened on Life Performance of Polymer based Engineering Materials (LPPEM): The Interaction between Mechanics and Chemistry.  Polymers are currently used in a large number of engineering applications, where failure of the polymer based materials can have significant consequences.  The time dependent properties of the polymer is typically the critical aspect in these advanced engineering applications.  The interplay between chemistry and mechanics is a key challenge in predicting the life performance of these materials.  The objective of the LPPEM workshop is bringing together researchers from the mechanics and chemistry communities to identify the needs and knowledge gaps required to advance the methodologies in both experimental and computational fronts. Bringing these often disparate disciplines together will be intellectually challenging and should stimulate the development of new research ideas and approaches at the domain interfaces: ideas and approaches that may also have value inside the individual research domains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of improved, rational and robust methods for predicting the life performance of polymers and polymers composites will have important benefits for the US technical infrastructure, including both (i) improved utilization of existing materials in new applications and (ii) effective design and more rapid deployment of new materials.  By elucidating research challenges and opportunities, the LPPEM workshop will begin the process of identifying potential approaches for the more rapid development, deployment and validation of the life performance of polymeric materials that are increasingly important for advanced engineering applications in the 21st century.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Workshop on Life Performance of Polymer Based Engineering Materials: The Interaction Between Mechanics and Chemistry     Polymer and polymer composites are important materials that are used in critical applications in a variety of advanced engineering applications.  In many of these applications the polymer experiences a wide range of mechanical, thermal and environmental stresses that occur over the design lifetime of that component.  The assessment of life performance is more difficult for polymers than more traditional engineering materials like metals, because polymer are organic materials that more easily undergo chemical reactions at room temperature. It is particularly challenging to provide a robust assessment of the ability of a new polymer or polymer composite that may have only been in existence for a year or less to reliably perform in applications that require several decades of superior performance.  The failure of polymers or polymer composites in applications where they experience complex mechanical and environmental exposure have results in some of the most spectacular and costly product failures, e.g. ceiling failure in the Big Dig in Boston, the Firestone - Ford Explorer tire failure, Dow Corning breast implant failure, etc.   It is important to begin developing more scientifically based methods for rational prediction of life performance of polymer based engineering materials in order to mitigate against these unplanned material failures.  A workshop was help in April 2014 in Washington, DC where twenty six experts from academia, industry and government discussed the current state of the art in life prediction methods for polymeric materials, identified some of the underlying physical processes that affect polymer behavior especially under environmentally challenging conditions and proposed future research and educational activities needed to develop a more scientifically sound basis for estimating the life performance of polymer and polymer composites.
