<AbstractNarration>Recent national reports in STEM education outline a series of research-based recommendations for improving student learning and success for all students in STEM disciplines. These reports (e.g., Vision and Change in Biology Education, AAAS, 2011) call for systemic and institutional transformation efforts in undergraduate STEM education. Specifically, improved models for faculty development and program reform are needed to ensure that evidence-based reform methodologies become widespread instructional practices as opposed to isolated practices. These reforms are needed to continue to improve student learning and success, particularly for underrepresented minority student populations for which evidence-based reforms have shown to have the largest impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a comprehensive model for faculty-led teaching and learning reforms in foundational science and mathematics coursework. This effort will adapt a faculty learning community (FLC) structure as the basis for its model. Four FLCs called FLOCKs (Faculty Learning for OutComes and Knowledge) will be formed, one each in Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics. Each FLOCK will develop expertise to plan, implement and assess reform of a year-long gateway course series (e.g., CHEM 1A &amp; 1B), guided by the literature, professional development experiences and discipline-based education experts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FLOCK members will regularly engage colleagues in discussions of the literature, plans for reform and outcomes achieved to help spread the use of more effective pedagogies. Finally, FLOCKs will work with institutional leaders to develop a sustainable operating model, including addressing faculty workload and promotion and tenure policies that may be barriers for reforms. FLOCKs will be coordinated across the disciplines by a steering committee comprised of FLOCK leaders and representatives from campus support units and stakeholder departments. An advisory board of external experts will guide FLC development and program reform efforts. The effort will receive strong support from campus leaders as it promises to help meet targets for improving student retention and graduation rates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the last ten years, STEM education research has outlined a series of research-based recommendations for improving student learning and success for all students in STEM disciplines. These reports (e.g., Vision and Change in Biology Education, AAAS, 2011) call for systemic and institutional transformation efforts in undergraduate STEM education. Specifically, improved models for faculty development and program reform are needed to ensure that evidence-based reform methodologies become widespread instructional practices as opposed to isolated practices. These reforms are needed to continue to improve student learning and success, particularly for underrepresented minority student populations for which evidence-based reforms have shown to have the largest impact.     This project developed a comprehensive model for faculty-led teaching and learning reforms in foundational science and mathematics coursework. Within this project, faculty from five different departments formed a cross-disciplinary learning community. Within this community, they developed expertise to plan, implement, and assess reform of one-year-long gateway course series (e.g., CHEM 1A &amp; 1B), guided by the literature, professional development experiences, and discipline-based education experts.     The team members worked with institutional leaders to develop sustainable practices that support instructors in adopting and implementing new effective teaching practices.  This project ultimately helped more than 30 university instructors from five departments within the College of Science and Mathematics at California State University Fresno to work together on improving their pedagogical approaches; they did so in order to redesign ten introductory courses for science majors in Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Mathematics, and Earth and Environmental Sciences.  By working in a cross-disciplinary team, faculty increasingly began to share pedagogical practices and content expertise to improve their course, they developed strong within- and cross-disciplinary near-peer mentoring teams, leading to a strong sense of community that helped the College develop new courses and redesign courses. These course redesigns significantly improved student success at an institution with a diverse, majority first-generation-college student population.  The main outcomes of the project were: (1) ten new or redesigned introductory courses that improved the learning experience and course outcomes for more than 500 science students each semester; (2) a strong, cross-departmental network of instructors that use each other?s pedagogical and content expertise to improve their courses; (3) the launch of new pedagogical initiatives that are proven to improve student success at institutions with a diverse student population (such as near-peer mentoring, problem-based learning, course-based research projects); (4) launch of new professional development initiatives that help instructors to improve their pedagogy and to improve their courses, including pedagogy courses for undergraduate and graduate students who serve as learning assistants and teaching associates in introductory science courses.  The project not only led to sustainable practices that support faculty development, but it led to students participating in those professional development opportunities in their role as classroom instructors.  In this way, this project not only allowed faculty to break out of their disciplinary silos to collaborate, but also broke down the silos that separate faculty and students, empowering senior undergraduate and graduate students to become instructional peers to faculty in introductory science courses, and to receive the same kind of professional development so often reserved for faculty.
