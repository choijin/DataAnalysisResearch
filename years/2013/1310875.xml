<AbstractNarration>The discovery of planets around other stars, in startling numbers and sometimes with surprising physical properties, is one of the more noteworthy achievements of observational astronomy over the last two decades.  Most exoplanet discoveries are made by observing with great precision the Doppler shift of the star around which the planet orbits, and seeing the very small recoil velocity as the mass of the planet pulls the star a small amount from its average position.  The less massive the planet, the smaller is this stellar motion, and the more difficult are the measurements.  So observing planets as small as our earth is a particularly challenging task that can only be done with spectral calibration of extreme precision.  This project will build such a calibration system that will enable detection of terrestrial-mass exoplanets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology employed is a near-infrared (NIR) laser frequency comb with field-tested technology, capable of improving radial-velocity calibration by a factor of 5 or more.  A complete telescope-ready subsystem will be made and then deployed in 2015 on the 10 meter Hobby-Eberly Telescope.  An immediate science program of surveying low-mass and low-temperature M stars takes advantage of the carefully stabilized spectrograph's sensitivity to near-infrared light, along with velocity precision better than a meter per second from the new calibrator.  This program will help resolve a fundamental but still unanswered question:  "are there planets like our own around other stars, and how common are they?"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is addressing a topic listed as one of the three most important research areas by the Astro 2010 decadal survey in which the astronomical profession prioritizes research directions for the next 10 years.  There is certainly wide public interest in the questions to be answered, and an active program of outreach and educational activities will be supported as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this project is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>

Complemented by photometric measurements of the transiting exoplanet, one can obtain the mass and radius (and density) of the exoplanet, which are critical parameters for classification and assessment of habitability.  While the RV technique has been used extensively, the highest precision measurements have been limited to the visible region of the spectrum &lt;700 nm, and not the infrared. Thus, 70% of the stars in our galaxy&mdash;M-dwarfs, which primarily emit in the near infrared (NIR)&mdash;have largely been outside the most efficient spectral grasp of the current generation of proven RV instruments.  Due to their proximity, abundance, and small radius and mass, M-dwarfs are very attractive targets in the search for habitable zone rocky planets with NIR spectroscopy. The habitable zone of an M-dwarf  is close-in to the star, such that an orbiting Earth-mass planet within this zone induces an RV shift on the order of 1 m/s.  This is ten times larger than the RV signature of Earth around the Sun, and significantly increases the detectability of such an Earth-mass planet.   Within this context, this project has focused on the developement of advanced laser frequency comb calibrator for near infrared precision RV spectroscopy. We have developed and delivered a 30 GHz optical frequency comb spanning 700-1600 nm built on integrated electro-optic (EO) modulators and high-efficiency nano-photonic nonlinear waveguides to provide a robust calibrator for long-term operation at the telescope.
