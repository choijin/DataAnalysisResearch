<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to devise new statistical methods for identifying genetic variants associated to disease resistance and other traits in plants, livestock, and model organisms such as fruit flies and mice.  Specifically, the research will focus on mixed model association methods, a class of methods in which association statistics are computed by considering all genetic variants simultaneously in order to increase power to detect true associations and to avoid false-positive associations.  Although mixed model association methods have previously been applied to studies in these species, existing methods are based on statistical assumptions that are unlikely to hold in real data sets, particularly in the large whole-genome sequencing data sets of the future.  The new methods produced by this research will address those limitations.  The investigator will use the research activities in this project to help teach and train numerous students, including those from underrepresented groups. The project will release publicly available, open-source software implementing the new methods.  Making these statistical methods and software widely available to other researchers is likely to lead to new scientific discoveries and insights when the methods are applied to large whole-genome sequencing data sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will produce new mixed model association methods and software for application to complex trait association studies in plants, livestock and model organisms that will address limitations of existing methods, increasing power while controlling false-positive associations.  Specifically, the methods developed will account for general genetic architectures, moving beyond the "infinitesimal" genetic architecture with all markers associated that underlies existing mixed model association methods; will account for non-randomly ascertained traits; and will enable pooled analyses of rare variants in a mixed model framework.  All of these new features are expected to increase statistical power to detect true associations.  The broader impacts of this project will include: enhanced computational infrastructure for conducting mixed model association mapping via the continued release of open-source software; multi-disciplinary synergy from research, collaborations and conferences that will bring together plant, livestock, model organism and human geneticists; and increased participation of underrepresented groups via the HSPH Summer Program in Quantitative Sciences.  Software produced by this project will be available at http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/alkes-price/software/.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Our research program on resources for mixed model association mapping of complex traits has provided computational infrastructure for other scientists to maximize the value of their research.  This is reflected in 11 publications arising from our research program (Loh?Price 2015a Nat Genet, Bulik-Sullivan?Price,Neale 2015 Nat Genet, Hayeck?Price 2015 Am J Hum Genet, Loh?Price 2015b Nat Genet, Tucker?Price 2015 Am J Hum Genet, Hayeck?Price 2017 Am J Hum Genet, Loh?Price 2018 Nat Genet, Palamara?Price 2018 Nat Genet, Kichaev et al. 2019 Am J Hum Genet, Schoech?Price 2019 Nat Commun, Hujoel et al. in press Nat Genet), as well as 10 open-source software packages arising from our research program: BOLT-LMM, LDSC, LTMLM (implemented in LTSOFT version 3.0), BOLT-REML, FAMBLUP, LT-Fam, ASMC, FINDOR, GRM-MAF-LD, LT-FH; these software packages are already being widely used.    Examples of project outcomes include an efficient Bayesian mixed-model method that increases association power (Loh?Price 2015 Nat Genet; BOLT-LMM software); a mixed model association method that accounts for sample ascertainment in case-control studies (Hayeck?Price 2015 Am J Hum Genet; LTMLM software); a multiple variance component extension of our fast variance component methods (Loh?Price 2015b Nat Genet; BOLT-REML software); a mixed model association method that accounts for sample ascertainment in case-control studies with related samples (Hayeck?Price 2017 Am J Hum Genet; LT-Fam software); an extension of our powerful mixed model association methods for extremely large data sets (Loh et al. 2018 Nat Genet; BOLT-LMM software); a mixed model method to infer rare variant architectures across a broad set of complex traits (Schoech et al. 2019 Nat Commun; GRM-MAF-LD software); and a method for combining case-control status and family history of disease to increase the association power of mixed model association methods (Hujoel?Price in press Nat Genet; LT-FH software).      Broader impacts include substantial upgrades to the advanced statistical genetics course taught by the PI in Spring 2019 (EPI511; we have made the course slides freely publicly available at https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/EPI511 as an educational resource for the broader scientific community) and providing roughly half of the annual required funding which supported ~10 underrepresented minority undergraduate students annually, in the Harvard Chan School?s Summer Program in Quantitative Sciences, during years 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, broadening the participation of underrepresented groups.
