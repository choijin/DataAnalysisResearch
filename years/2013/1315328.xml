<AbstractNarration>This project establishes a multimedia-based virtual classroom with a virtual lab teaching assistant for the education of cyber physical system (CPS) security. Such a virtual classroom helps college students in resource-limited rural areas to learn the latest CPS security knowledge via an on-line peer-to-peer learning environment with other students from larger schools. This project includes three novel contributions: (1) all learning materials embrace an application-driven learning approach, with examples from diverse areas such as healthcare, renewable energy, and industrial controls used as the basis for CPS attack analysis; (2) with the help of a multimedia company, the project is building interesting virtual classroom lectures; and (3) to meet the open access lab requirements, the project is building interactive virtual lab helper software to enable remote students to conduct virtual hardware lab experiments and obtain help using multimedia tools. The design encourages innovative learning in several ways: developed labs require an iterative process with idea incubation to force students to follow a more mature creative design process; all labs intentionally include some ambiguity to encourage the search for multiple answers to a single problem; and the 3E (Explain-Exploit-Explore) based pedagogy is adopted for all CPS security labs/projects. The basic level labs emphasize concept explanations. The intermediate level senior projects require students to exploit previous knowledge to perform a multidisciplinary CPS security task. The advanced-level labs require independent exploration to reach creative solutions.  The resulting teaching methodologies can be extended to other rural colleges and this project uses a proactive dissemination plan to achieve this aim.</AbstractNarration>

Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this Report are those of the PI and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation; NSF has not approved or endorsed its content.</p> <p>1. Intellectual Merits: It mainly includes the following 5 aspects: (1) Cyber-physical system (CPS) knowledge training: CPS exists everywhere in the society. This project has provided the computing students with a solid foundation on CPS architecture. (2) Deep understanding of all kinds of CPS attacks: We offered 3 courses to give students the comprehensive and profound knowledge on modeling CPS attacks.&nbsp;(3) Effective solutions to overcome CPS attacks: We have educated our students on the pre-attack schemes (mainly using attack prevention methods), in-attack solutions (minimize system loss via countermeasures), and post-attack solutions (using prediction scheme to predict future attacks). (4) Train more undergraduate students to pursue this career: We have motivated more undergraduate students to seek the career opportunities in cyber security in the government or private sectors. (5) Train more graduate students to perform this research: We have offered a course for MS/PhD students to improve their research skills in CPS security.</p> <p>2. Broader Impacts: Our development has been disseminated to other communities through the following a few approaches: (1) Our in-campus teaching activities: We have developed and offered 3 courses at UA for both undergraduate and graduate students. (2) Remote education of rural area students: We have worked with the co-PIs in rural area college students to use e-learning tools to teach them the CPS security knowledge. (3) Posted website course materials: We have built detailed course websites (<a href="http://feihu.eng.ua.edu/NSF_CPS/2017.htm">http://feihu.eng.ua.edu/NSF_CPS/2017.htm</a> ; <a href="http://feihu.eng.ua.edu/NSF_CPS/year1/CPS.html">http://feihu.eng.ua.edu/NSF_CPS/year1/CPS.html</a> ; <a href="http://feihu.eng.ua.edu/NSF_CPS/year2/year2.html">http://feihu.eng.ua.edu/NSF_CPS/year2/year2.html</a> ). (4) Educational conference articles: The PI has published a few conference papers which discussed our CPS security education pedagogy. (5) NSF PI meetings: The PI has been to the NSF PI meetings a few times to let other schools know our project outcomes.</p> <p>3. Summary of project outcomes: This multi-institutional project has achieved the following 6 outcomes: (1) A semester-long course for undergraduate students: We have developed and offered 15 weeks of lectures for upper-division undergraduate students on basic CPS security methods. This course was offered for ECE/CS students at UA. The materials consist of slides, reading materials, quizzes/exams, homework assignments, etc. (2) A semester-long course for graduate students: We have offered the course on advanced CPS security for graduate students. Students need to have certain foundation on applied cryptography. (3) Developed and adopted a set of hands-on class labs/mini-projects: The PIs have collaborated to develop and offer over 7 labs/mini-projects on CPS security. Some labs are about the hardware (circuit) based security implementation via microcontroller programming; a few labs need the knowledge of machine learning algorithms; a few are based on SCADA emulation tools. (4) Investigated an effective remote education method for rural area college students: We have worked with a rural area college to test the effective remote education methods. Those students participated in the on-line multimedia education. We have used the Blackboard learning tools at UA to achieve the remote teaching. It is an outstanding student-instructor interaction system. (5) Trained senior design and other student teams: We have also trained more than 5 senior design teams in this project. They have learned the hardware/software integration during CPS security/privacy design. The students closely worked with each other to design the circuits and debug the software codes. (6) Enhanced PhD research skills via Independent Studies: We have also offered an <em>Independent Studies</em> course for PhD students. They have mastered a set of advanced research methods to analyze the risks of the potential attacks in smart grid and medical device.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/25/2018<br>      Modified by: Fei&nbsp;Hu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1315328/1315328_10277948_1540492800642_pic0-bigtask--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1315328/1315328_10277948_1540492800642_pic0-bigtask--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Project Tasks"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1315328/1315328_10277948_1540492800642_pic0-bigtask--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Project Tasks"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This image shows all the major tasks we have achieved in this project.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Original</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Fei&nbsp;Hu</div> <div class="imageTitle">Project Tasks</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1315328/1315328_10277948_1540492866276_pic0-CPSsecurity--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1315328/1315328_10277948_1540492866276_pic0-CPSsecurity--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CPS security concept"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1315328/1315328_10277948_1540492866276_pic0-CPSsecurity--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CPS security concept"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This picture shows the concept and components of a typical CPS security system.</div> <div class="imageCredit">original</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Fei&nbsp;Hu</div> <div class="imageTitle">CPS security concept</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
