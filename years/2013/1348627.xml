<AbstractNarration>Face recognition is critically important for social interaction, and adults are experts at quickly and accurately detecting faces and recognizing the people around them. This involves special strategies for processing visual information about faces that are not used to recognize other objects. For example, horizontal edges are more useful for recognizing faces than vertical edges. Children are still developing expertise for face recognition, and therefore may not use the same strategies or information as adults. To date, most descriptions of how children process faces are underspecified. The goal of this research is to determine how children learn to use specific types of visual information by investigating how particular features contribute to face recognition at different ages between 4 and 10 years.  Dr. Balas will compare face recognition in children and adults by asking participants from both groups to discriminate faces from other objects when specific visual information has been removed or disrupted. In some tasks, participants will arrange facial features (eyes, nose and mouth) inside a face pattern so Dr. Balas can assess how children's understanding of facial geometry develops. Other participants will complete tasks that require them to quickly label images as faces or non-faces, in some cases while Dr. Balas records the electrical activity of their brains using electroencephalography (EEG). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will help us understand how the machinery for visual recognition develops during childhood, and will improve our ability to characterize deficits in visual social perception. As part of the educational and outreach goals of this proposal, Dr. Balas will mentor high school students through North Dakota's Governor's School program and will also participate in the NSF-funded NATURE program at NDSU. This program is designed to introduce Native American students to research, and involves working closely with local students and faculty from the Tribal College system. Dr. Balas will also share the goals and results of his research with educators and children at local day-care centers and schools.</AbstractNarration>

There are many ways to try and describe what someone looks like, but we chose to focus on visual features that we know your brain uses to help you recognize people and detect faces in the world around you. In particular, we know that your brain measures things like edges and lines to help you recognize people and objects, and different brain cells tell you when you're seeing edges and lines at different angles: Some cells respond to horizontal edges, some respond to vertical ones. It turns out that adults are good at detecting and recognizing faces when they have information about horizontal edges, and have a much more difficult time if you only let them see the vertical edges that make up a face. This is one example of something we wanted to study in children. Do kids also have that same preference for using horizontal edges to recognize faces, or is that something they have to learn over a long time? We also used techniques from computer vision to find other ways to describe what information might be good or bad for recognizing a face. For example, by building a computer vision system that tries to learn how to tell faces apart from other objects (like cars or houses), we can find out what parts of face images have more or less information that tells you what they are. Adults definitely do much better when they have "informative" parts of a face, but have kids learned the difference between an informative part of the face and a part that's not so informative? For all of these different descriptions of what information is in a face, we measured how well children and adults could detect and recognize faces in computer games designed to measure their speed and accuracy.

This means that in some ways they've already learned to be mature face recognizers. However, we also found that there is very slow development of children's ability to use less-than-perfect information to help them with these tasks. Everybody prefers to use the best features to help them recognize and detect faces, but adults have learned how to use some of the worst features to do something.
