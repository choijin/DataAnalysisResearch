<AbstractNarration>Objective: &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this program is to demonstrate multifunctional single molecule devices, whose transfer characteristics are tailorable, dynamic, and complex, beyond the scope of conventional solid state devices.   The transformative aspect of the program is to realize the motivation of the field of molecular electronic devices - the ability to tune device function by chemical design and synthesis, which will elucidate long-standing issues in molecular electronic device operation and design.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the program is to proposal lay a solid foundation to the fundamental understanding of molecular device function by chemical design and synthesis.  This will lead to the design molecular devices by rational design, and the development of multifunctional single molecule devices. This transformative approach offers vast possibilities for technological development based on the diverse electronic functions of the component molecules, tailored by chemical design and synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the program are to advance discovery of the molecular electronics field while training graduate students and involving undergraduates in a multidisciplinary project at the intersection of engineering, physics, and chemistry.  The program will implement an integrative research and education environment through a Summer Outreach Program designed to involve undergraduates and graduates from other institutions, through a well-established Yale-New Haven partnership in education program called the Yale-New Haven Teachers institute (YNHTI), that educates high school teachers through monthly seminars during the summer, and to institute a new program that will actively recruits K-12 students for summer research experiences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Single molecule electronic devices in which individual molecules are  utilized as active electronic components devices has been an area of  intense interest over the last few decades.  The  ability to understand, control, and exploit charge transport at the  level of single molecules has become a long-standing desire of  scientists and engineers from different disciplines for future potential  device applications. The fundamental motivation of the field is to tailor device function by chemical design and synthesis.  However, to understand how the structure of the active molecular element mediates electronic transport is a long outstanding challenge of the field.  A deeper insight into the fundamentals of transport, energetic and  molecular orbital structure was gained with the development of  3-terminal single molecule transistor devices. In this work, we demonstrated that the orbitals in molecular electronic devices can be controllably tuned by chemical substitutions onto the core molecule.  This is analogous to the "doping" done in conventional semiconductor devices, although the electronic transport in molecular devices is inherently different.  We deomonstrated the equivalents of "n" and "p" type devices, the basic essential elements of modern "CMOS" device technology.  The knowledge gained from this work will impact the design and functionality of future molecular electronic devices.  In addition, this work will impact other potential future electronic devices at very small length scales which utilize coherent transport.
