<AbstractNarration>Abstract for DMS-1311553&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Wayne will study how methods such as invariant manifold theory and the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory, which were originally developed to understand finite dimensional dynamical systems, can be adapted to yield insight into the qualitative and quantitative behavior of solutions of partial differential equations. He will concentrate primarily on equations arising in physical applications such as fundamental fluid equations, e.g the Navier-Stokes equation, the equations for vortex sheets, and equations from nonlinear optics.  His research will focus on four main problems: (A) Metastable behavior in two-dimensional fluids; (B) Periodic solutions of the vortex sheet equations; (C) Breathers in periodic media; and (D) Normal forms and invariant manifolds in dispersive Hamiltonian systems.  Dynamical systems methods have yielded many insights into the qualitative behavior of finite dimensional systems for which no closed form solutions exist.  The existence theory of many of the infinite dimensional systems to be studied is now well established and this research will attempt to derive more detailed information about the behavior of the solutions on various physically relevant time scales, as well as illuminating the origin of these time scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The differential equations that Professor Wayne will study arise in a variety of different physical contexts and are characterized by the fact that while the equations themselves are well known, they are too complicated to solve explicitly except in very special or physically unrealistic cases.  Nevertheless, applications require at least a qualitative understanding of the behavior of their solutions and this research project will aim to develop such an understanding for the systems described above.  As an example related to point (C) in the preceding paragraph, consider light pulses of the types that are used in fiber optic cables currently used for telecommunications.  In a homogeneous medium, such as  glass, such pulses rapidly spread out or disperse.  However, in periodic media, like certain crystals, such pulses may become trapped.  Trapped pulses are of great current interest because of the hope that they might serve as the basis for a purely optical computational system. Professor Wayne's research will examine the conditions that the medium must satisfy in order to support these ``trapped'' pulses as well as investigating how common such media are likely to be.  The other three projects will also aim to develop new fundamental insights into these important physical systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In understanding the behavior of a physical system it is important to understand not only what happens, but also the time scales on which various events occur.  Understanding the time scale on which a particular physical phenomenon happens may either allow one to average over the effects of this phenomenon and replace the differential equations that describe the system with simpler equations, or to ignore particular effects, if the time scale on which they occur is much longer than time scale of interest in a particular context. While many techniques exist for analyzing either very short, or very long, time scales, there are fewer mathematical methods available for analyzing intermediate time scales.   Metastable states are an example of the sort physical phenomenon which often occur on these intermediate time scales, and the understanding of the origin and evolution of these states has been one focus of the research supported by this grant.  In particular, my research focussed on connections between metastable states which occur in fluid systems and those which occur in weakly damped systems of nonlinear oscillators.  In this latter type of system I have shown that there exist families of periodic solutions for the undamped system which are destroyed by the damping but which can still be used as a sort of framework for the metastable states by showing that the damped system evolves in a way to remain close to the  (formerly) periodic states, but  with a frequency which changes in a very slow, and computable, way. A second focus of this research has been on the rigorous derivation of simplified approximate equations which again hold on these intermediate time scales.  There are many important physical systems for which the underlying differential equations are so complex that it is difficult to solve them even with the aid of computers. One famous example is the water wave equation.   In such cases, accurate but simple model equations often yield important insight into the behavior of these equations.  While non-rigorous approximations have existed for such problems for many years, only in the last few years has it been possible to rigorously establish the validity of such approximations.  Time scales are again an important aspect of this problem since these approximate equations typically describe the underlying physical system for a very long, but finite time and extending this time as much as possible has again been one area of emphasis for my research. A third area of focus of this research has been to try and understand the stability of special vortex solutions in rotating, three-dimensional fluid layer heated from below.  Such a system of differential equations could be considered a very simple model for the atmosphere.  We found that once such a vortex is established, it is quite stable, regardless of how large the initial vortex is.   Throughout the research supported by this grant I have also focussed on including PhD students and post-doctoral fellows in my research program.  Four different PhD students received support from this grant and  I also served as the principal faculty mentor for two post-doctoral fellows.
