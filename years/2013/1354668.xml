<AbstractNarration>Researchers involved in the Empirical Studies of Conflict Project are engaging in intellectual arbitrage, applying methods with a long history of succes in analyzing non-violent social and political interactions to environments suffering violent interactions.  A variety of theoretic models are used to generate predictions, which are then tested in a variety of ways.  With regards to theoretical perspecitves, the researchers encompass those who use game theory, agent base modelling, sociological, and psychological approaches.  With regards to methodological approaches, the researchers use econometric approaches using observational data, randomized-controlled trials, including lab and field experiments, and indepth case studies.  By interacting with scholars from a variety of backgrounds as well as policy-makers, these researchers are able to push the frontier of their respective fields and challenge common "wisdom" in this area.  For example, they were able to show that modest, targeted aid projects in Irag were more effective in reducing violence than larger programs.  Likewise, they have shown that poor individuals in certain countries tend to be more negative towards non-state groups than their middle-class peers.  This workshop will allow for continued innovations in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will addresses issues that are central to national policies on terrorism, insurgency, political instability, and international development.  By addressing both the causes of these factors as well as examining the success or failure of current policies, the researchers will provide key input to policy-makeers who spend billions of tax dollars on aid interventions, military assistance, and military interventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in substate conflict demonstrate the value of applying advanced theoretical and empirical methods of political economy to this area of study.  During the two-day workshop economists and political scientists who possess these skills will review preliminary findings, discuss methodological challenges, and share best practices.  In addition, these junior and senior scholars will interact with promising graduate students as well experts from the U.S. military, USAID, World Bank, NGO's, and the tech-industry.  This interdisciplinary, cross-boundary meeting will spark collaborative projects, bridge different research methods, expose students to new research, train emerging scholars, and expose practioners to research-based techniques.  This will allow researchers and others to provide policy-makers with prescriptions in dealing with conflict in fragile states.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Science Foundation provided support for a meeting of the Empirical Studies of Conflict (ESOC) project. We held our annual research meeting at the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) in Washington, DC. The theme of our two-day meeting was "Engaging Fragile States". We hosted 114 attendees over two days.  The first day of the meeting focused on policy-oriented research, fostering dialogue with practitioners and members of the policy community in Washington DC. Seminar, plenary, and discussion sessions included "Perspectives on Bridging Research and Policy" and "Policy Approaches to Fragile States".  Speakers from the US Department of State, US Department of Defense, World Bank, International Growth Centre, US Institute of Peace and other organizations addressed the group.  The second day was an academic conference; researchers presented papers with an emphasis on more basic (as opposed to policy-oriented) research. Fifteen academics papers were presented and actively discussed, in parallel sessions.  Intellectual Merit  This meeting is part of a coordinated effort, including a website, which has successfully increased the use of empirical methods in studies of subnational conflict by exposing young researchers to higher quality data and innovative methods. ESOC researchers include political scientists and economists who employ methods ranging from interviews, to randomized trials, to econometric studies, as appropriate for evaluating specific governance and development efforts in unstable regions. Effective studies in this area also require researchers to have a good understanding of the realities facing policymakers, military actors, and local citizens. The meeting provided young researchers with insight into the decision-making processes and real-life contexts in which their research could be used by practitioners.  In addition, exposing political scientists and economists to the latest methods from other disciplines fosters innovation in this rapidly growing field.  Broader Impact  This interdisciplinary meeting linked research on security issues to the needs of policymakers.  It is hard to overstate those needs. The American Government and our allies are struggling to understand how to protect ourselves and our allies from terrorism, and foster international stability by rebuilding social and economic order in conflict and post-conflict regions. This need is growing more critical as we lighten our footprint in unresolved conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, and look to build stability with small military footprints (or none at all) in Syria, Libya and other conflict-cursed environments.  Given the gravity of the human suffering in conflict-ridden regions, the personal sacrifices made by many military, diplomatic, and aid professionals, and the financial cost of aid interventions, we feel that academics have a duty to employ our talents to study and evaluate these interventions. While most policymakers embrace an approach that combines security provisions (by U.S. forces and allies), economic development and political development, neither the general strategy nor the particular tactics have been methodically evaluated, with exception of a few recent studies, including some by our team.  The meeting allowed the latest security research to be disseminated to researchers and policy practitioners. In addition, the meeting facilitated conversations between the two communities to build and sustain connections. By giving practitioners from the World Bank, USAID, Department of Defense and Department of State in-depth exposure to cutting edge research, we were able to give them a framework to conduct rigorous analysis of the enormous amounts of data they collect.  ESOC meetings provide a way to disseminate research, foster new research by others, and connect in meaningful ways with the military/policy community.  We believe that these efforts raise the standard for security studies and create more sustained opportunities for academic and policy engagement.
