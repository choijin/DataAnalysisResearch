<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Texas Christian University provides seven undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in research on topics in atomic, molecular, bio, chemical, and statistical physics, as well as astronomy and planetary science. In addition to participating in research with an experienced mentor, the REU students will engage in weekly activities to ensure not only that their research stays on track but that they have an engaging collegial and scholarly experience. By the end of the program, every student will have given a formal presentation about their work; prepared a conference poster and a 10-page report. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will have a number of broader impacts. The site has a strong plan to recruit undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in physics and astronomy and has at its goal to recruit students from non-research focused institutions. The project plans to be informed by both short term and long term evaluations and is guided by an advisory committee.</AbstractNarration>
