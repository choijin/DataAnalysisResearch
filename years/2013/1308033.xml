<AbstractNarration>The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Gamma-ray Observatory is a wide field-of-view, continuously operating, teraelectronvolt (TeV) gamma-ray telescope that will explore the origin of cosmic rays, study the acceleration of particles in extreme physical environments, and search for new TeV physics.  When HAWC begins operations in August 2013 with 100 Water Cherenkov Detectors it will be the most sensitive wide-field detector in the TeV range, with an approximately five times increase in sensitivity over the previous generation of detectors.  During the first year of operation, HAWC's sensitivity will steadily increase as the full 250 detectors are gradually brought online.  HAWC will monitor the northern sky and make coincident observations with other observatories including VERITAS, HESS, Magic, IceCube and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope for multi-wavelength and multi-messenger studies of the high-energy sky.  HAWC will observe Galactic sources in the TeV energy range, detect diffuse emission from regions of the Galactic plane, observe known TeV active galactic nuclei and the brightest known gigaelectronvolt (GeV) gamma-ray bursts, and with its significant increase in sensitivity it is poised to discover new high-energy phenomena in the Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Maryland group has a significant leadership role in HAWC.  This award will enable the University of Maryland group to continue work in the construction, operation and science of HAWC including reconstruction and simulation software, maintenance of the multi-Petabyte data archive, and science analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: HAWC is an all-sky instrument that will serve as a TeV "finder" telescope for ground-based observatories, and it can be used to extend measurements of satellite-discovered sources to TeV energies.  HAWC will build on the strong outreach record of Milagro to bring this exciting field of research to students and the general public.  Since HAWC is a joint Mexican-American project, it presents an opportunity to attract Hispanic-American students to science and astroparticle physics.</AbstractNarration>

During this grant, the Maryland group led the development and deployment of the HAWC detector, which was completed on time and on budget in March of 2015.&nbsp;HAWC is a second generation Very High Energy (VHE), wide-field continuously operating gamma-ray telescope that is being used to explore the origin of cosmic rays, study the acceleration of particles in extreme physical environments, and search for new physics. HAWC consists of 300 large water Cherenkov detectors (WCDs) located at an elevation of 4100m asl inside the&nbsp;<em>Parque Nacional Pico de Orizaba</em>, in Mexico. &nbsp;Inside these WCDs light sensors detect the flashes of blue light produced when air showers hit the array. Using timing and shower shape, we can pick out gamma-ray induced showers and make maps of the high energy sky. &nbsp;HAWC is sensitive to gamma rays at energies near a TeV (this is approximately 1 trillion times the energy of visible light and 10 million times the energy of a dental x-ray).&nbsp;HAWC is now the world&rsquo;s most sensitive wide field-of-view, continuously operating, TeV gamma-ray telescope. HAWC continuously observes the overhead sky, sweeping out more than half of the entire sky over the course of a day.&nbsp;With HAWC, will &nbsp;are searching for new TeV physics including dark matter an providing a daily unbiased monitoring of variable galactic sources as well as nearby AGN.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; HAWC&rsquo;s observations are complementary to IACTs, X-ray and gamma-ray satellites, neutrino telescopes and even gravitational wave detectors and play an integral role in current and planned multi-wavelength and multi-messenger campaigns.&nbsp;Even though HAWC&rsquo;s instantaneous sensitivity to point sources is lower than IACTs, its wide field-of-view and continuous operation give a much higher exposure, which leads to significant advantages when studying variability, extended sources and gamma-ray sources that extend beyond 10 TeV.&nbsp;HAWC continously monitors the same sky as is observed by other wide field of view observatories, such as Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST), IceCube and LIGO. HAWC issues prompt notifications to these and other observers such as VERITAS, HESS, and MAGIC, so they can make multi-wavelength and multi-messenger observations.&nbsp; (MOUs have been signed with each of these collaborations). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Recent HAWC results have provided a new look at the high energy sky, discovering new TeV sources, providing a first look at the Galaxy above 50 and 100 TeV, shedding light on dark matter, and playing a key role in multi-wavelength and multi-messenger campaigns.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Jordan Goodman is the principal investigator and US spokesperson for the project and Andrew Smith is the project manager. In addition, our post-docs and graduate students have played major roles in the development of the analysis and simulation software as well as hardware development. Maryland also houses the US HAWC data archive with over 4 petabytes of storage. (HAWC produces about a petabyte of data per year).</p> <p>The HAWC collaboration consists of 24 institutions and approximately 150 scientists from the US, Mexico and Europe.
