<AbstractNarration>The focus of this research project is to explore congestion management strategies and new tactics for their deployment, with special attention given to influencing the time-of-day and minute-to-minute actions of automobile drivers. Significant congestion on roadways is encountered in every metropolitan region of the United States. The time lost, energy resources wasted, and pollution created by traffic congestion are staggering when their perpetual nature is considered. As a consequence, many ideas and technologies for managing congestion and its ills, especially emissions from internal combustion engines, have been proposed and several have been put into practice around the globe. Among the most familiar are high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, traffic signal coordination, congestion pricing, and telecommuting.  The innovative aspect of this research is its exploration of new mathematical and computational tools to quickly generate and rank sophisticated mixes of congestion management strategies that vary by time and location across an entire metropolitan region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this research is successful, it will provide a heretofore missing capability for rapidly prototyping and screening spatiotemporal congestion management strategies that directly consider the impacts of emissions. Such a capability may significantly influence the transportation planning process in that a single engineer working with single decision leader will be able to generate and preliminarily vet complex congestion management strategies without having to perform a full time-consuming simulation of the network of interest. These strategies might consider all-day congestion pricing for a subnetwork; a mix of ramp metering and signal light timing on certain corridors; strict lane assignments and speed controls for another sub-network. The researchers will make use of the research findings to enhance the materials used in the undergraduate and graduate courses related to traffic assignment, road congestion management and transportation sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

It is our integration of statistical learning and dynamic game theory that allows us to accelerate the solution speed for noncooperative dynamic network congestion games.  The formalism employed to express dynamic network congestion games is the theory of differential variational inequalities (DVIs). For the games we consider each individual player?s best response problem is an optimal control problem (OCP); the best response OCPs are combined to create a DVI for each model considered. The principal classes of models considered are the following: differential Nash games expressing user equilibrium, and differential Stackelberg games expressing the controller?s responsibility to manage congestion and other externalities subject to the aforementioned DVI describing the behavior of drivers.   Because game theory pervades social science, engineering, mathematics, and complexity science, our model formulations and algorithms have wide, multidisciplinary impacts.
