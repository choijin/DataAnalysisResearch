<AbstractNarration>Microbiology research is currently undergoing a revolutionary transition from the study of primarily monocultures to the study of natural and synthetic microbial communities.  Microbial consortia play a key role in chronic medical infections and the human gut microbiome and have been implicated in many chronic medical conditions including ulcerative colitus. Microbial consortia are also used in water treatment plants, toxic site remediation and biofuel production. Understanding the behavior of microbial communities in response to a disturbance and their subsequent control remains an outstanding scientific challenge. This project will provide a first step toward the goal of developing analytic and modeling techniques that will allow rational design of synthetic microbial communities that are robust and controllable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are theories suggesting that diversification in a microbial community may enhance stability, robustness and increase efficiency; however a precise quantitative understanding of the advantages that a consortium provides for its members is needed. This project seeks to experimentally and theoretically determine the impact of specific metabolic interactions within a microbial community on emergent properties like enhanced stress tolerance or increased biomass production. The project will use tools of dynamical systems, like invariant manifold theory and stability of invariant sets, to analyze models of microbial communities. Methods of partial differential equations will be used to extend this analysis to interacting spatially segregated communities.  These models will precisely quantify the relationship between the number of defined microbial interactions and the magnitude of improvement on both consortia efficiency and enhanced tolerance. This will provide a systems biology basis for characterizing consortial behaviors and a scalable methodology to compare the benefits of membership in a microbial community to the costs for each individual. This information is fundamental to understanding microbial community persistence and will provide a rational framework for controlling both unwanted and desirable consortia. Prior research has yielded preliminary results on the conditions necessary for increased biomass production in specialized binary communities versus a monoculture and has demonstrated the existence of invariant manifolds that simplify the analysis for many types of microbial communities. This project extends this work by building experimental synthetic communities with well-defined metabolic roles, measuring the synthetic community's characteristics like biomass production and robustness to perturbations and constructing mathematical models for more complex and spatially segregated communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Microbial communities comprised of interacting species  are everywhere in nature.  These communities are more stable and more efficient than each species separately.  Emergent properties of microbial interactions are important in diverse areas including medical infections (e.g., diabetic ulcers), biofuels synthesis (e.g., biodiesel production), environmental nutrient cycling (nitrogen cycling in agriculture), and municipal wastewater treatment.  The main goals of our project was to engineer  tractable microbial communities comprised of strains with well-defined metabolic functions, characterize their interactions, and develop mathematical models that would allow predictions as to when such communities will be superior to monocultures.   We constructed a total of three engineered communities each with distinct interaction mechanisms that influence their efficiency. Two communities were engineered E. coli strains, that exchanged organic acids while a third community was engineered for the obligate cross exchange of an organic acid and an amino acid. Using these communities, we quantified the metabolic advantages and disadvantages of exchanging metabolic intermediates including the detoxification of different organic acid byproducts, which are commonly produced metabolites in many microbial communities.  Additionally, we tested how the ``cellular economics" of organic acid crossfeeding was influenced by the obligate exchange of an amino acid.   The measurements of growth rate, strain distributions, biomass yield on substrate, as well as organic acid and amino acid exchange rates from these consortia informed the development of a mathematical model that investigated questions of how transport rates of nutrients through the cell wall and presence of non-cooperating microbes affect the establishment of microbial communities.  We also studied how separation distance or closeness of different microbes affected the efficiency of the nutrient exchange and community growth. Our work has shown that when the nutrients diffuse slowly, clustering of microbes into groups does not always lead to maximal growth.   Experimental characterization of the engineered microbial communities has enabled insight into design principles important for engineering productive microbial consortia or disrupting harmful consortia. For example, the lactate-exchanging community showed a distinct enhancement in growth yield over wild-type E. coli and presents an excellent option to be used as a module within other multi-species consortia.  With growing interest in using microbial consortia for higher productivity, greater stability, and tighter control in bioprocess industries such as pharmaceutical production and biofuel production, we expect to see applications beyond the specific problems addressed in this project.
