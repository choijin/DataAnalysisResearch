<AbstractNarration>Slow slip and tremor are key processes in tectonic plate motion in subduction zones, one of which is positioned along the Pacific Northwest coast from Cape Mendocino up to Vancouver Island in Canada.  For the basic mechanics of subduction zones to be understood, slow slip must be made to yield its secrets.  Progress in this puzzle in the past decade has been and will continue in the future to be transformative.  To understand these processes, this project is analyzing the copious seismic and geodetic data that has been gathered over the past decade.  Different data types and analysis approaches are being integrated to determine more precisely where and when strain is accumulating and the role of slow slip in loading and releasing plate-interface stress.&lt;br/&gt;The potential interaction of slow slip with the hazardous locked portions of subduction zones mandates better understanding of slow slip phenomena.  For example, the next generation of Pacific Northwest seismic hazard maps will use our estimates of the updip limit of tremor as one way to estimate the downdip limit of megathrust rupture, refining estimates of the shaking across the west coast in the next great American earthquake.  In addition, it is possible that the slow slip being observed and interpret may reveal changes in the seismic hazard over time as motion changes pattern, accelerates and decelerates.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are involved in the operation of the regional seismic network and are active in various forms of outreach to educate the public about seismic hazard.  Episodic tremor and slip events is providing a golden opportunity to advance public awareness of the regional geological environment and seismic hazard through blogs, TV and newspaper interviews and NOVA documentaries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Washington has captured seven episodes of slow slip under northern Washington since 2004 with seismic arrays two with the EarthScope Array of (eight) Arrays, accumulating a rich dataset.&lt;br/&gt;Several approaches are being integrated to sift through the mountain of continuous recordings and our growing catalogs in search of key relationships.  The foci in this work is (1) delineation of the space-time progression of tremor by both beam backprojection and envelope correlation methods, (2) precise tracking of slow slip with LFE locations and recurrence, (3) systematic determination of tremor amplitude and its relation to tidal stressing and amount of slip, (4) integration of GPS and strainmeter timeseries with spatio-temporal constraints from tremor, and (5) comparison of emerging ivory-tower slow-slip models with observation.  These approaches allow refinement of the relation of tremor propagation patterns such as rapid tremor reversals and streaks to slip front propagation and low frequency earthquake generation, and thus yield constraints on the slip velocities, propagation velocities, and rise times of slow slip pulses.  As well, this study is teasing out how much slow slip extends updip from tremor, with implications for seismic hazard, and to assess the importance of tremor amplitude in scaling tremor duration to slow slip moment release.&lt;br/&gt;Currently in hand are growing caches of several types of geophysical data: multiple catalogs of tremor ranging from Cascadia-wide with 210,000 tremor locations to high-resolution locations collected by the Array of Arrays, as well as a burgeoning catalog of low-frequency earthquakes.  These provide views from the 1000 km to 100 m scales.  In addition, GPS, strain, and tilt-meter time series record deformation more directly.  Linking the above datasets is leading to characterization of the inferred propagation of slow slip fronts over a range of spatial and temporal scales.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Magnitude 9 megathrust earthquakes occur along the Cascadia subduction zone every several hundred years with most of the slip occurring offshore.  Down dip (east) of the rupture, at depths of 28-45 km, much of the plate-boundary slip occurs in the form of slow-slip earthquakes that progress along strike at rates that are about 10,000 times slower than regular earthquakes. Slow slip is observed on seismograms as fluctuations in high-frequency seismic energy, called tremor, that is similar at many stations.  It is also observed as magnitude 2 and smaller low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs), which repeat thousands of times on small patches, called LFE families.  The larger slow-slip events, which reach moment magnitudes of 6.5-6.9 and durations of several weeks, are also observed as several mm of displacement at GPS stations.  We find that the number of LFEs above a given size follows an exponential distribution with moment, which indicates that, unlike regular earthquakes, there is a characteristic seismic moment.  For the LFEs in northern Washington state the characteristic (average) moment is 2x1011 N-m, which corresponds to a moment magnitude of MW=1.5.  With standard scaling assumptions, this corresponds to an LFE source diameter of about 300 m, in rough agreement with the spatial distribution of relocated individual LFEs within a family.  In contrast regular earthquakes follow a power-law distribution with no characteristic scale size.  LFE slip only accounts for ~0.2% of the long-term average slip within the slow-slip zone, so it appears that over 99% of the slip happens through ductile deformation that does not generate observable seismic signals at frequencies above 2 Hz.  LFEs and tremor are likely caused by sparse asperities within the dominantly ductile matrix, and these asperities may be controlling the size of LFEs.   LFEs occur in tight clusters called families with dimensions of order hundreds of m, separate families locate in clusters separated by several km, and clusters of families are separated by 10 km regions that are devoid of observed LFEs. To model families, we consider two end-members: 1) a ductile matrix model in which slip happens quietly, in a ductile fashion, over most of the small patch, but also on asperities that generate tremor and LFEs that are located and isolated within the family patch.  Each asperity may rupture many times during a slow slip event, but the sum of displacements is assumed to equal the total geodetically observed slip.  2) The second model assumes that LFEs occur uniformly covering the entire patch and producing the same amount of summed slip during each slow-slip event, but the slip would be orders of magnitude less than the geodetically observed slip.  Large slow-slip events in northern Cascadia propagate hundreds of km along strike over periods of several weeks, while slip at a given point on the fault tends to rupture for about 5 days.  Tremor and LFEs are very sensitive to small stresses caused by solid Earth and ocean tides. This sensitivity increases over days as slip at a point on the fault accumulates. As the intrinsic coefficient of friction is thought to be very small (&lt;0.1) and the fault is very weak, our observations indicate that it gets even much weaker with time as slip accumulates.  Tremor and geodetically observed slow slip usually occur at the same place and time, with an important exception.  Slow slip consistently extends updip of the tremor limit by about 15 km in the vicinity of the Olympic Mountains, but not along strike to the north and south.  This may be related to different rock types at the base of the overriding plate being dominated by metamorphic sediments below the Olympics and basalt elsewhere.  Tremor occurrence rates in southern Japan are increased by a factor of three by nearby small earthquakes suggesting that stress caused by seismic waves from these events can trigger the tremor.  In the locations we examined, the converse is not observed -- slow slip does not significantly trigger earthquakes.
