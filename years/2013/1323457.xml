<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for young researchers to attend the ASME 2013 International Congress on NanoEngineering for Medicine and Biology (NEMB 2013) in Boston, Feb. 4-6, 2013. The general goal for NEMB 2013 is to bring together&lt;br/&gt;leading experts in biology, medicine, nanomaterials, and engineering so as to review experimental methods, synthetic methods, results, models, computations, analyses and innovative methodologies for quantifying and treating medical disorders using engineering approaches. These are emerging areas that are of greatest importance not only for mechanics and materials but also for engineering and science in general, and for the development of new technologies in particular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combination of engineering and biology with a strong focus in medicine will be a hallmark of the planned event. We will actively involve a large community of participants, and provide an exciting forum to exemplify the intellectual merit of mechanics of materials&lt;br/&gt;in the solution of pressing problems in biology and medicine. Specific research areas to be covered include manufacturing and materials for nanomedicine, biology and nanoengineering, nanotechnology and public health, bioinspired materials and structures, and the application of mechanics principles to detect and treat cancer. Key intellectual questions include multiscale coupling of mechanical systems, linking chemical to continuum mechanical concepts, or the mechanics of adhesion and in the context of nanoparticles for cancer treatment, such as cell uptake. These are emerging areas of mechanics that will receive considerable attention through this event. This award will specifically enable support for student participants, student awards (oral and poster presentations), and networking opportunities for young researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The second International Congress on Nano-Engineering for Medicine and Biology (NEMB 2013) was hosted by ASME from February 4-6, 2013, in Boston, MA.  The conference featured a series of workshops on February 3.  The conference was funded in part through a $15,000 grant from the National Science Foundation.     Intellectual merit: The field of nano-engineering is advancing tremendously over, and is forming the foundation for a new generation of nano-engineered treatments for disease. Similarly, the latest wave of nano-engineering innovations is presenting tools that can be applied to more fundamental study of biological phenomena, enabling discovery that may eventually lead to new cures for disease.     The conference aimed to bring together leading experts in biology, medicine, nano-materials, and engineering so as to review experimental methods, synthetic methods, results, models, computations, analyses and innovative methodologies for quantifying and treating medical disorders using engineering approaches.         Broader impacts: NEMB 2013 attracted over 400 participants, and featured plenary talks by Joanna Aizenberg (Harvard), Albert-L&aacute;szl&oacute; Barab&aacute;si (Northeastern), Markus Buehler (MIT), Sam Gambhir (Stanford), Huajian Gao (Brown), Don Ingber (Harvard), Rakesh Jain (Harvard), Robert Langer (MIT), C.T. Lim (National University of Singapore), Chad Mirkin (Northwestern), David Mooney (Harvard), and Viola Vogel (ETH Zurich).     Additional features were a panel discussion held with several leading policy experts; student and post-doctoral podium and poster competitions; a series of renowned keynote speakers; and two sessions designed to function as a debate on the role of targeting in nanotherapeutics for cancer.     The conference was organized into 9 tracks (see http://www.asmeconferences.org/NEMB2013), each run by 3-5 track chairs, and each featuring several double-length keynote talks.  The track chairs and organizing committee had ample representation from the BED, particularly from the Biotransport and Tissue &amp; Cellular Engineering technical committees.     Key scientific questions include multiscale coupling of mechanical systems, linking chemical to continuum mechanical concepts, and the mechanics of adhesion and in the context of nanoparticles for cancer treatment, such as cell uptake.  These emerging areas of mechanics received considerable attention through the NEMB conference, including several mainstream press releases.     Consistent with the ASME mission, the NEMB conference focused on opportunities for professional development for young investigators and the participation of groups underrepresented in science and engineering. Student and post-doctoral paper competitions were held. The funds provided will support attendance for graduate students, post-doctoral students, and young investigators. The funding enabled all workshop registration fees to be waived for graduate students, post-doctoral students, and young investigators.  Approximately 80 people attended the workshops.
