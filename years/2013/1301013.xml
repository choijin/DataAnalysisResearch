<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this proposal is to investigate an ultra-low power, miniaturized, spintronic nanowire strain sensing device with an ultra-high sensitivity. This concept leverages two different physical phenomena: (i) stress induced magnetization rotation in nanoscale magnetostrictive materials; and (ii) change in the magneto-resistance of a "spin-valve" heterostructure nanowire consisting of magnetically-hard/spacer/magnetically-soft layers, which is induced by a rotation of the magnetization orientation of the soft layer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this could lead to a miniature strain sensor with an active area of 0.1mm x 0.1mm and with a sensitivity exceeding state-of-the-art, while consuming 2-3 orders of magnitude less power. Such a device could strongly impact several areas such as structural health monitoring, pressure, flow, acoustic and seismic sensing. This project will provide a strong multidisciplinary experience and mentorship for PhD students and will be leveraged to enhance innovative workshops on sensing and energy harvesting for high school students through the Math-Science Innovation Center. Under-represented K-12 students will be hosted for a month in summer under VCU's Richmond Area Program for Minorities in Engineering (RAPME) program and trained in nanofabrication under this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this proposal was to investigate spin and charge transport in dielectrophoretically (DEP) assembled single nanowire devices in order to demonstrate an ultra-low power, miniaturized, spintronic nanowire sensing device.  Intellectual Merit: Under this grant, the three investigators? research groups have carried out a multi-year collaboration to accomplish:  1. Growth of homo- and      heterostructured semiconductor and metallic nanowires (~50 nm diameter) and      their assembly using dielectrophoresis (DEP) to achieve devices at the scale      of a single-nanowire.  2. Spin transport investigation      in the nanowire heterostructure "spin-valves" to demonstrate      spin relaxation lengths at room temperatures due to carrier confinement in      a single subband that suppresses D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation.  3. Demonstration of ultra-sensitive sensing devices based      on single nanowires; specifically a single nanowire magnetic field sensor      and strain sensor.     Broader impact: Work performed under this grant has demonstrated a pathway to develop single-nanowire based miniaturized, ultra-low power magnetic field and strain sensors.  This project has resulted in four journal papers and one book chapter, apart from many invited and contributed conference talks.
