<AbstractNarration>This award to the University of Colorado at Boulder, by the Instrument Development for Biological Research program, in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Biological Sciences Directorate),is jointly funded by the Biomaterials Program in the Division of Materials Science (Math and Physical Sciences Directorate). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a tool used for imaging, measuring, and manipulating matter at the nanoscale, and gathers surface information by using a mechanical probe called a cantilever. Applications of AFM in biology include understanding the folding and unfolding of individual proteins. Protein function requires proper folding, and misfolding can lead to diseases such as Alzheimer's. In folding studies, force stability is critical since the folding and unfolding rates are sensitive to sub-piconewton (pN) changes in force. This project merges cost-effective micromachining of cantilevers with a novel optical detection to achieve a 1,600-fold increase in temporal resolution at 1 pN. The proposed developments will benefit the fields of biology, as well as materials science. Project activities will provide excellent interdisciplinary training for undergraduates as well as graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The twin goals of this project are to develop a next generation AFM for biological measurements that achieves (i) world-leading short-term force precision coupled with state-of-the-art force stability and (ii) extend its imaging capability beyond topography to map chemical composition with enhanced resolution. The first goal will be demonstrated in the context of protein folding assays. To provide a 10-100-fold improvement in force stability, a novel differential detection system of cantilever motion will be developed. This system will use a tiny spot size (~2 ìm) to enable detection of ultra-small (L = 10 ìm) cantilevers, which have been modified by a focused ion beam for improved performance. These cantilevers enable world-leading force precision coupled with sub-pN stability over long periods (100 s). The second project goal focuses on chemical characterization of materials using a new Raman imaging modality that offers 3.5-nm resolution. By scattering multiple laser beams off the AFM tip, the proposed AFM will synergistically merge this exciting imaging modality with the world-leading tip-sample stability and builds upon a strength of the PI?s lab: integrating multiple lasers into an AFM. Initial studies will focus on DNA wrapped carbon nanotubes. Results will be disseminated via papers, presentations, and patents. Biological research communities that will benefit from this project include single-molecule biophysics, membrane protein biology, cellular structure, protein folding, as well as other disciplines (e.g., physics, material science, &amp; nanotechnology). Collaborations with AFM manufacturers (including Asylum Research and Molecular Vista) will facilitate adoption by a wider user base.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Over the last 25 years, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been increasingly applied to study diverse systems in biology, from imaging individual proteins and arrays of membrane proteins to whole cells. Beyond imaging, AFM can mechanically unfold individual proteins, tear protein-ligand bonds, and even rupture cell-cell junctions and thereby elucidate the energetics and folding pathway and the basis for molecular recognition. Like any measurement platform, AFM benefits from improvements in its core measurement: force. In this project, we increased the force precision, stability, and temporal resolution of bioAFM. Complementing these metrological advances, we significantly increased the rate of acquiring high-quality data by developing (<em>i</em>) a robust site-specific coupling scheme, (<em>ii</em>) a protein construct for easily investigating diverse globular proteins, and (<em>iii</em>) an automated algorithm that aligns the AFM tip above a molecule?s attachment point to the surface. We demonstrated these improvements in several distinct systems: membrane proteins, globular proteins, DNA, and protein-ligand complexes. As a result, we achieved a 75-fold improvement in the yield of high-quality data in our globular protein-based assays and a 3-fold improvement in the precision and accuracy of DNA-based assays, enhancements that add to our improvements afforded by using modified AFM cantilevers, as described next.</p> <p>We developed a robust method to modify a short (<em>L</em> = 40 &mu;m) commercial cantilever using a focused ion-beam (FIB). Removing a large section of the cantilever led a 10-fold reduction in the hydrodynamic drag, improving short-term force precision. We achieved a 10-fold reduction in stiffness by thinning the remaining beams, facilitating excellent long-term force precision. A transparent capping layer patterned at the end of the cantilever allowed us to retain a cantilever?s high reflectivity while avoiding the detrimental effect of gold on force stability. As a result, we achieved sub-pN force precision and stability over five decades of time (0.001?100 s). In subsequent work, we improved the time resolution to 1 ?s using ultrashort cantilevers (<em>L</em> = 10 &mu;m) albeit with reduced force stability. We concluded by developing a third generation FIB-modified cantilever that provided 8.5 ?s resolution coupled with sub-pN stability over 100 s. Importantly, these cantilevers are not too hard to make for routine use; undergraduates in the lab make 2-3 modified cantilevers per hour and the cantilevers could be re-used over multiple days. Two companies have leveraged the concepts developed in this project by releasing AFM cantilevers using a small gold patch at the free-end of the cantilever to improve force stability.</p> <p>The biological impact of these metrological advances is best illustrated by our recent study of bacteriorhodopsin. As background, bacteriorhodopsin is the prototypical membrane protein and a homolog of the biomedically important G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). In our work, we studied the mechanical unfolding of bacteriorhodopsin using modified cantilevers with a 100-fold higher time resolution and a 10-fold higher force precision than prior work. These advances allowed us to detect 14 intermediates in the unfolding of a particular pair of transmembrane helices. In contrast, studies over that past 17 years resolved only 2 intermediates in this same helix pair. In our work, intermediates separated by just 2 amino acids and with lifetimes as short as 8 ?s were resolved. A key implication of our work is that the mechanical response of the cantilever has hidden protein-unfolding intermediates, an important result likely to impact many, if not all, protein-folding studies done with AFM (and other single molecule force spectroscopy modalities). Identification of such intermediates and characterization of their dynamics, of course, is an essential prerequisite to developing an accurate protein-folding model.</p> <p>Like many issues being addressed by future employers (<em>e.g.</em>, national labs, academia, industry), the challenges of this project required expertise beyond a single discipline and proved a fertile training ground for high-school, undergraduate and graduate students. Four high schools students participated and presented work related to this grant at regional and state science fairs. To help illustrate our science to additional HS students, we developed a unit focused on protein folding for a Denver-based school, explaining both the basics of AFM and protein folding and then had the students do activities on Foldit, a protein folding program. At the undergraduate level, 9 undergraduates participated, including one female and one URM. Four of these undergraduates have been authors on multiple papers, and two of them first author. Two graduate students contributed and the one, who has graduated, has been hired by Intel. An excellent illustration about how this project developed a diverse skill sets in its personnel including state-of-the-art instrument automation, nanofabrication, optical techniques, and biological sample preparation that is sought after by industry. Four post-docs have contributed to this project, two supported by external fellowships. Two post-docs have moved onto permanent jobs, one in a biotech startup and the other into academia.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/20/2018<br>      Modified by: Thomas&nbsp;T&nbsp;Perkins</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353987/1353987_10315157_1542761796331_Perkins_ACSNano_CoverArt_F_3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353987/1353987_10315157_1542761796331_Perkins_ACSNano_CoverArt_F_3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Modified AFM cantilevers"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353987/1353987_10315157_1542761796331_Perkins_ACSNano_CoverArt_F_3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Modified AFM cantilevers"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Illustration of two cantilevers pulling on a polyprotein (gold).
