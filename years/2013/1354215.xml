<AbstractNarration>Plants are exposed to many pathogens and consequently evolved a sophisticated immune system. On the other hand, pathogens evolved sophisticated mechanisms to overcome the plant immune system. In this project, the investigators will take advantage of genetic diversity in pathogen populations and in crop plants to identify pathogen genes and plant genes that determine the outcome of plant-pathogen interactions. These genes can be expected to provide new avenues towards novel approaches in crop disease prevention and control. The project will also offer multiple opportunities for training students in an interdisciplinary and international context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators previously gained new insights into molecular plant-microbe interactions by comparing strains of the tomato pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pto) with each other. In particular, they identified the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) flgII, which is an epitope within the flagellar filament structural protein (FliC) and which triggers an immune response in tomato and other Solanaceae. To identify additional PAMPs, an international strain collection of Pto and of its close relatives will be expanded in the current project by isolating bacteria from rain, surface water, and crops. Genome sequencing and population genomic analyses will be performed. Pathogen emergence, spread, and crop adaptation will be investigated and new PAMPs and other genes involved in pathogen - plant interaction will be predicted based on signatures of natural selection. Candidate genes will then be tested for their role in pathogen - plant interaction using biochemical and genetic approaches. Such approaches will also be used to identify the tomato receptor of the previously characterized PAMP flgII and, possibly, tomato receptors of other PAMPs that may be identified in the current project.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>All organisms on earth are members of communities that consist of many other organisms including some that are being beneficial to the organism and some being detrimental. The challenge for each organism is to accurately distinguish between these two groups. The organisms? immune system plays the key role in doing this in regard to microorganisms. This project investigated how the tomato immune system identifies detrimental microorganisms, in particular, bacterial pathogens. It was already known that almost all plants have a molecular receptor to recognize the presence of high numbers of bacteria by specifically binding to a region of the bacterial flagellum and that this receptor triggers a plant immune response to defend against the invading bacteria. In this project, a second receptor unique to tomato cultivars, and some tomato relatives, was identified and characterized. This receptor specifically recognizes a separate region of the bacterial flagellum compared to the already known receptor and is thus active even if bacteria evolved to overcome recognition by the first receptor. This second receptor is thus a sort of a back-up security system. This second receptor, called FLS3, may now be used in crop plants to make them more resistant against bacterial pathogens. Besides investigating this specific receptor, the project also focused on how crop pathogens emerge from bacterial populations. Similar to the emergence of new human pathogens, such as new strains of the Flu virus or the Ebola virus, new crop pathogens emerge from the environment regularly and can cause severe crop losses. Little is yet known about the origin of emerging crop pathogens. In this project we compared crop pathogens with close relatives that live in the environment without causing crop diseases and identified some features specific to crop pathogens. This knowledge may be used to adapt agricultural practices to reduce the likelihood of crop pathogen emergence and to respond to new crop pathogens faster and more efficiently. One key aspect in the response to crop pathogens is their quick detection and their precise identification. Therefore, part of this project also focused on the development of a new web service to precisely identify bacterial plant pathogens based on their genome sequence and to develop and apply methods for identifying plant pathogens directly in plant tissue without the need for culturing them first.
