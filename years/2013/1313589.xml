<AbstractNarration>This Rapid Response Research Grant (RAPID) will investigate decision making processes within the emergent multi-organizational network that is undertaking post-Hurricane Sandy debris removal operations in the State of New York. The research is expected to contribute to an expanding body of research on how organizations improvise: that is, how they take creative and useful action under time constraint, with little or no possibility of undoing previous actions. This work will discover and examine relationships between degree of organizational improvisation and overall organizational performance, focusing specifically on tradeoffs between efficiency, effectiveness and distribution of effort by debris removal teams in the field. Detailed performance data will be extracted from records of loads hauled (as collected using existing computer-based systems), supplemented with questionaire data and cost estimates. The work will employ and extend methods drawn from research on queueing networks to analyze debris removal activities, supplemented by statistical- and simulation-based methods for characterizing the behaviors of individuals and groups within these networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will include outreach to practicing professionals concerning the methods and results of this research. It will produce validated data sets for addressing improvised behavior within complex queueing networks, along with results that will be broadly disseminated through publications and presentations in academic and practitioner venues. Finally, this work is expected to contribute to society's ability to plan for and respond to large-scale disasters, particularly by improving understanding of the determinants of debris removal performance.</AbstractNarration>

Among the emergent protocols are those associated with the identification, segregation and disposal of debris caused by high-wind events. This study collected highly perishable data on debris removal operations in New York State, particularly in coastal communities. The focal point of this work, Long Island, represented a flash point for NY debris removal operations: debris volumes were fairly high and in some cases difficult to access (as was the case on Fire Island).   Through interactions with Federal, state and local officials, this work sought to describe the evolution of the debris removal operations on Long Island, along with the evolution of the organization that formed to execute those operations. This dual network design problem is here described as 'network improvisation', owing to the fact that planning and execution activities for both organizational and operational networks occurred nearly simultaneously.  The data for this study, consisting of logs of field work, meeting minutes, and other sources, suggest that an ability to adapt was key to mission execution, but that processes of adaptation were strongly constrained by regulatory and policy practices.  The work identified a number of implications for debris management in urbanized (particularly coastal) communities. These include the need to revisit standard operating procedures developed for less urbanized, inland areas (e.g., the southeast US) in light of the relatively high population and infrastructure density of the northeast. Additional concerns include the need for a readily deployable workforce accustomed to performing debris removal work in urbanized settings.
