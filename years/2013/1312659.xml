<AbstractNarration>Lu&lt;br/&gt;1312659&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The goal of this project is to investigate electronic structure models and their connections to macroscopic models from an applied mathematics perspective.  The electronic structure models, in particular the density functional theory (DFT), are widely used to model materials and chemical systems from first principle.  These models give rise to many interesting and challenging questions to applied mathematicians.  The principal investigator focuses on the following aspects in this project:&lt;br/&gt;1.  Derivation of continuum theory of solid materials from electronic structure models.&lt;br/&gt;2.  Mathematical analysis of electronic structure models in the presence of the exchange-correlation energy.&lt;br/&gt;3.  Construction and analysis of force-based multiscale methods for electronic structure models.&lt;br/&gt;4.  Development of the frozen Gaussian approximation for electron dynamics in crystals and waves in periodic structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Electronic structure models are fundamental and indispensable tools in physics, chemistry, and material science.  Further progress in this area needs better mathematical understanding of these models.  This project develops more accurate models of materials from the quantum mechanical level.  The understanding of mathematical properties of these models leads to more efficient algorithms to help extend the applicability of first principle calculations to macroscopic systems.  Beyond the field of quantum chemistry, the proposed research contributes to related areas of applied mathematics, for example, applied nonlinear analysis, multiscale modeling and simulations, and numerical analysis.  The investigator plans to combine research with education activities, including curriculum development to prepare students for interdisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Under the support of this project, the principal investigator has advanced the mathematical understanding of elelectronic structure models. The electronic structure models have become indispensible scientific workhorse in a variety of disciplines, including physics, chemistry, materials science and related fields. Towards a better understanding of the models from the mathematical point of view, the PI has worked with graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and collaborators on several aspects in this projects.  The main research achievements include  Better understanding of the mathematical properties of the electronic structure models; Better theoretical understanding of and algorithmic design of coupling between microscopic and macroscopic models;   Improved description and asymptotic analysis of electron dynamics with background periodic media.    While most works done in this project are on the theoretical aspects, the better mathematical understanding leads to practical algorithmic improvement for computational chemistry and materials science.   The PI has organized multiple minisymposia and conferences during the project period to better connect applied mathematicians to experts working in the area of electronic structure models. These activities help build stronger ties between the communities and enable researchers from different disciplines to exchange ideas and fertilize collaborations.   On the educational aspects, this project provided training opportunites for several graduate students and postdoctoral scholars. The PI also collaborated with several junior researchers in applied mathematics on the topics of this project.         Last Modified: 08/28/2016       Submitted by: Jianfeng Lu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
