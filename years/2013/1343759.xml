<AbstractNarration>This EarthCube enterprise conceptual architecture approach looks to develop a data-driven and human-centric EarthCube enterprise architecture for achieving the goal of EarthCube as a community-driven activity to transform the conduct of geoscience research and education. The proposed EarthCube enterprise architecture will have geoscientists and domain experts at its center and facilitate them to communicate and collaborate through data sharing, and ultimately bring geosciences forward in a holistic fashion. This project seeks to design a conceptual architecture that can bring geoscientists, computing scientists, and social scientists together to collaborate on networks of data, technology, applications, business models, and stakeholders. The design approach is guided by the following principles. It designs a new architecture as well as operational procedures for achieving the architecture based on comprehensive review and assessment of current enterprise architectures. Second, it suggests several important mechanisms to cross the disciplinary chasms, as EarthCube seeking to harmonize the geosciences communities? diverse approaches. Third, it proposes methods for forming collaborative networks of data, tools, standards and people as supported by geoscience cyberinfrastructure technology. Finally, the proposed project incorporates the concept of collaborative networks for maturing the conceptual design of the EarthCube enterprise architecture by including academia, agencies, industry, and other organizations as autonomous participants that continuously seek common ground for collectively improving geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed EarthCube enterprise conceptual design will be validated through the EarthCube workshops, research coordination networks, building blocks, and other venues. The Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) will provide validation from many NSF and non-NSF funded projects. The project will be sustained and make a long standing impact in geoscience communities as well as the geoscience cyberinfrastructure communities with a scalable, interoperable, sustainable, and evolvable conceptual architecture</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Overview</strong>: With a three-year development, the EarthCube DAsHER Conceptual Architecture (CA) was designed to support EarthCube to facilitate communication and collaboration in pursuit of collaboration within the geosciences. This EarthCube CA is developed by leveraging several popular frameworks (i.e., Zachman, Gartner, TOGAF, FEAF, and DoDAF) that have been demonstrated to be efficient in practice for several geoscience projects within the NSF's Spatiotemporal Innovation Center. The EarthCube CA comprises three major components: 1) overview of current geoscience resources and architectures; 2) capabilities of the envisioned EarthCube; and 3) alignment of the proposed CA with the geoscience's community. This project CA design follows a spiral developments approach (Figure 1): 1) spiral one analyzed geoscientist workshop reports, and roadmaps for EarthCube architecture requirements; 2) spiral two designed the overall architecture and overview; 3) spiral three designed the detailed conceptual architecture and solicited community feedback; 4) spiral four completed a draft conceptual architecture with community feedback addressed and integrated. The final design is a four-volume report with different views of the EarthCube conceptual architecture from multiple perspectives (Figure 2). Volume one is an overview of EarthCube and architecture requirements for the initial development. Volume two is the presentation of the architectural design components and viewpoints. Volume three is the dictionary that presents the taxonomies used in this EarthCube CA. Finally, Volume four describes an example of how this conceptual design architecture was used to develop a Polar cyberinfrastructure portal (The design documents are available for editing on our wiki website - <a href="http://dasher.cloud.gmu.edu/wiki/">http://dasher.cloud.gmu.edu/wiki/</a>). The report could be used as a conceptual framework for building EarthCube and other geoscience cyberinfrastructure.
