<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL&lt;br/&gt;The study of bent-core molecules is currently a principal driving force in the advance of the basic science of liquid crystals, uncovering a host of exotic new soft matter structural themes and unexpected behavior, including the appearance of spontaneous polar ordering and chirality. This project, suppported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry and Condensed Matter Physics Programs will first pursue an important emerging new direction for exploration of the bent-core theme: orthogonal ferroelectric smectics, in which the liquid crystal molecules are oriented perpendicular to the layer planes in lamellar phases. The work focuses on design, synthesis, and characterization of new bent-core smectics, with the long-term goal of developing an understanding of the molecular structure-supramolecular property relationships in this highly interesting self-assembling soft matter system. Based upon the history of the liquid crystal field, the discovery of new soft-matter phenomena in the course of this research could lead to new applications with significant impact on the economy and jobs creation. Education and training of undergraduates and graduate students is also an important aspect of the work, and a strong K-12 and undergraduate outreach activity is integrated into the program. In all of these education and outreach activities, a key focus is increasing diversity (gender and ethnic) at the undergraduate, graduate, and faculty levels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON TECHNICAL&lt;br/&gt;Liquid crystal science has revolutionized modern society, driving the creations of critically important, and perhaps the most visible, components of smart phones, other portable computers, and televisions. The liquid crystals themselves are mixtures of organic molecules with carefully selected combinations of properties, enabling the magic of modern flat panel screens. Perhaps the most fundamental scientific issue in this regard is the relationship between the structure of the molecules, and the properties of the liquid crystal phases, which are necessarily composed of large numbers of molecules, and which self assemble to form useful materials. This project seeks to understand these structure-property relationships in a liquid crystal system at the frontiers of the field, allowing the creation of new materials enabling innovation of advanced devices such as holographic projectors and ultrafast switches for the internet.&lt;br/&gt;Based upon the history of the field, the discovery of new liquid crystal phenomena in the course of this research could lead to such new applications, with significant impact on the economy and jobs creation.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Liquid crystals are the basis for the display devices (LCDs) that enable the portable computing revolution, ranging from the latest "QLED" TVs, to tablets, smartphones, projectors, and laptop computers. These advanced display technologies are built on a broad foundation of basic science in which the design and synthesis of new molecules, characterization of new phases, and exploration of the physics of new phenomena have played key roles.    This project explores a novel and potentially useful liquid crystal phase first created by design in 2010 &ndash; the SmAPf (layered, orthogonal, polar, and ferroelectric) fluid phase.  Over the subsequent several years, the behavior of this phase was shown to be highly unusual, providing novel electrooptical phenomena with potential applications in information display &ndash; specifically holographic projection; imagine a head set that looks and feels like a typical pair of sunglasses, but plays true 3D holographic video or augmented reality visible by the wearer.    Studies over the next several years demonstrated the truly novel character of the SmAPf, and uncovered additional previously unknown liquid crystal phases from the same structural class, making the SmAPf an exciting platform for liquid crystal science.  The present grant was directed towards developing an understanding of how the structure of the liquid crystal molecules effects the formation (or not) of the phase.  In liquid crystal science, this is termed the "structure space" of the phase, and in the process potentially discover new phases and phenomena.   Over 40 new liquid crystalline materials were prepared and characterized by a range of modern methods, leading to a dramatic increase in our understanding of the potential, and elucidating some limits, on what can be accomplished in this system.  Two completely new structural classes of SmAPf liquid crystal molecules were designed, created and characterized during the project.  This work provides verification of the current model for the fundamental scientific reasons for the formation of the phase, and also serendipitously leading to the discovery of a liquid crystal phase never seen prior (the SmEPf &ndash; a new polar and ferroelectric variant of the SmE, an interesting and complex variant of the layered liquid crystal phases.  The SmE is especially interesting since this phase seems to provide a path for creation of useful organic semiconductors based upon a small but substantial body of work begging for increased focus.   State of the art computational studies have also been accomplished and represent an important aspect of the goal of developing an understanding of the way molecular structure leads to supramolecular liquid crystalline order.  Also, the project has uncovered features of the structure-property constellation around the SmAPf phase, which are not currently understood by organic intuition or computation.  Addressing these issues has become an important goal of our work moving forward.  This is pure science, but as is always the case with liquid crystals, breakthrough applications represent an exciting potential outcome.   Finally, this project has brought together an international group of scientists working toward common goals.  A major requirement for any application, high quality "alignment" of the SmAPf phase, was achieved in collaboration with scientists at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden.  The computational project is a collaboration between Boulder scientists and a computational physicist and professor at the Indian Institute of Technology in Bangalore (a city with a long tradition of excellence in liquid crystal science).  We have learned much during the course of this research, and have uncovered additional exciting but poorly understood phases and phenomena.
