<AbstractNarration>Causes and consequences of early reproduction in mangroves invading salt marshes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worldwide, tropical mangroves are expanding their ranges into temperate salt marsh habitat. In some locations, mangrove seedlings reproduce much earlier than usual, only one to two years after establishing. This precocious reproduction may facilitate rapid invasion of mangroves into salt marshes by shortening generation times of the invading plants. Shorter generation time allows the leading edge of the mangrove invasion to move at an even faster pace than with climate change alone. This research will investigate the causes of precocious reproduction in invasive mangroves and the ecological consequences of precocious reproduction on mangroves invading salt marshes. Research methods include field and laboratory experiments and ecological modeling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will contribute to understanding of floral induction, which is well understood in Arabidopsis but is more complex in trees experiencing complex interactions of light quality and quantity, photoperiod, temperature and water stress. This system is ideal to test how rapid life history changes affect the success of an invasive species. The fellowship will broaden participation in biology by preparing a minority researcher for a scientific leadership position in academia, attracting diverse undergraduates to participate in research, and creating an educational exhibit from research findings. The fellow will receive training in physiological methods and ecological modeling, and will mentor undergraduate researchers, preparing her for a research and teaching career in biology. Results from this study will be developed into an exhibit for public display at the Smithsonian Marine Ecosystems Exhibit in Ft. Pierce, Florida.</AbstractNarration>
