<AbstractNarration>In this award, the Chemical Measurements and Imaging program of the Chemistry Division supports Dr. Rachel Martin and her students at the University of California at Irvine, to develop novel switched-angle NMR probe and methodology for studying the structure of membrane proteins in their native environment, building on her previous work in this area. In addition to developing experimental and instrumental tools that are optimized for studying oriented liquids, Dr. Martin's group will develop methods for preparing and optimizing model phospholipid membranes based on mixed lipid bicelles, which will facilitate solving the structures of membrane proteins.   These lipid membrane systems are lyotropic liquid crystals, and as such they also are themselves an interesting chemical system for study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Membrane proteins are essential for transport of everything that passes in or out of a cell, including nutrients, waste, signaling molecules, and even information. Due to their multi-functionality, these proteins are critical to understanding how cells grow and communicate. In order to understand the function of membrane proteins and find cures for diseases, the structure of the protein in its native environment, that is, embedded in a lipid membrane, is necessary. Despite their importance, there is a paucity of structural information about membrane proteins, because they are difficult to study using traditional techniques. The sophisticated experimental tools that Dr. Martin will develop will help generate the structural information about membrane proteins other scientists need to develop new pharmaceuticals, engineer biomimetic systems, and understand the differences between healthy biological processes and the development of disease states. Dr. Martin is committed to training a diverse and international workforce in issues ranging from scientific literacy to science policy through participation in her research program at UC Irvine.  The educational plan comprises several components, including training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as outreach to middle school and high school students in grades 6-12 in the framework of UCI's LEAPS program. The goals are increasing interest in science by hosting students in Dr. Martin's lab, and piquing interest in science via hands-on activities and interaction with undergraduate researchers. Dr. Martin's work comprises elements of chemistry, biology, and physics; she will engage students from the undergraduate to the postdoctoral level in her work, and train them in thinking and problem solving across disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>
