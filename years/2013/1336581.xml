<AbstractNarration>1336581&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ehrman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spray pyrolysis processes can be used to make unique materials not accessible via traditional precipitation or vapor deposition processes. Additional advantages include scalability and solvent free final product powders. Aerosol production of oxidation resistant materials such as silver and palladium has been demonstrated, but extension to lower cost base metals on an industrial scale has been challenging.  The objective of this project is to develop a mixed-phase spray pyrolysis route for producing multicomponent base metal powders with increased protection against oxidation, for printable electronics applications including hybrid integrated circuitry and metallization of solar cells. Spray pyrolysis will be used to achieve kinetic control of microstructure, enabling formation of particles that cannot be made by other means. The test bed will be particles that contain both copper and copper/tin alloy, but the processing approach will be broadly applicable to other material systems. A team consisting of student, faculty and industrial researchers from DuPont and the University of Maryland will conduct experimental and simulation based studies to overcome technical hurdles associated with mixed phase powder processing.  This team draws upon University of Maryland expertise in chemical engineering, materials characterization and aerosol technology and DuPont expertise in materials chemistry, powder processing, and statistical design of experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of this work will enable incorporation of low cost base metals into conductive pastes, leading to overall reductions in cost for solar cells, electronics and medical devices. Use of aerosol based production routes for metal powders will realize additional environmental and cost benefits over conventional precipitation-based processes. Elements of the value added by this project include: (1) fusion of industrial and academic perspectives (2) interactions between industry and university researchers and students that will allow participation at all stages from laboratory innovation to applications testing and (3) interjection of real world elements into activities and research experiences for pre-college and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Aerosol science focuses on researching the physical and chemical properties of small particles suspended in air or another gas. A major research area in aerosol science is to understand the dynamics of small particles in the air to better understand and improve air quality, aerosol science can also greatly improve our standard of living through controlled formation and modification of aerosol particles. For example, manufacturing processes guided by aerosol science can be termed as aerosol-assisted processes.&nbsp; These processes are continuous with short residence times, simple operating procedures, and facile equipment requirements. These advantages can significantly reduce the manufacturing cost of high value added materials.&nbsp; Because these processes typically result in solvent free products, environmental impacts are also reduced.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this project, we have successfully addressed one of the current bottlenecks in the applications of printed electronics, solar cell metallization, and interference packaging, which is the high raw material cost. Currently, silver is the most common metal used in conductive pastes. In 2016, 562 million ounces of silver were used globally for industrial applications including electronics, photovoltaic metallization, and solders (World Silver Survey 2017, Thomson Reuters). Therefore, considering the prices of silver and copper (Ag: 15 USD/oz, Cu: 0.0074 USD/oz, Precious and Industrial Metals, Bloomberg, Jun-12<sup>th</sup>-2017), the annual cost of raw materials can be reduced by more than 1 billion USD globally even if only 10% of the silver used in those applications is replaced by Cu. However, several challenges greatly limit the usage of Cu in practical applications. i) Cu is easily oxidized in the ambient air even at room temperature, which results in a high resistivity. ii) Up till now, oxidation approaches have utilized non-conductive organic molecules as the passivation layer.</p> <p>Our group developed oxidation-resistant Cu particles by spray pyrolysis, one of the aerosol-assisted processes and can be facilely scaled up in industry. The fabricated powders have a Sn- or Zn-enriched surface layers. By forming sacrificial oxide layers, further oxidation of powders is prevented. This can keep the particle conductive, as shown in Figure 1a. To assess the prospect of applying these oxidation-resistant powders, we generate wires and films by printing inks containing the powders, as illustrated in Figure 1b-c. The Cu-Sn wires are comparable in conductivity to Cu wires in an oxygen-free environment&nbsp;&nbsp;(Figure 1d). The Cu-Sn films also have higher conductivities compared with Cu film when all these films are heated at 300 <sup>o</sup>C in ambient air (Figure 1e).</p> <p>Aerosol-assisted processes can also be applied to fabricate other functional materials. For example, we developed a novel process, colloidal spray pyrolysis to manufacture anode materials (Sn-carbon) with controllable structures. Many high-performance anodes such as Sn, do not have stable aqueous precursor solutions. To facilitate the application of aerosol-assisted processes in generating anode materials, we generated Sn-carbon materials via <em>in-situ</em> solid-state reactions within 1 s, as shown in Figure 2a. It is a challenge since solid-state reaction has a mass transport limitation. Based on the theoretical analysis of aerosol dynamics and chemical kinetics, Sn-carbon anode materials are obtained and tested in the Li-ion batteries (Figure 2b-d). Our anode materials display superior electrochemical performance even after 1500 cycles (Figure 2e). The high cycling stability and capacity can promote the practical application of tin-based anodes (tin, capacity=994 mAh/g), considering the low capacity of current anode materials (graphite, capacity=372 mAh/g) and the huge estimated global energy-storage capacity of Li-ion battery (50 gigawatts by 2024, reported by Joe Ryan and Brian Eckhouse, Bloomberg, February 20, 2017).</p> <p>Another example of the application of aerosol-assisted processes is fabrication of photocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis. Advancement of society has greatly relied on the consumption of fossil fuels, resulting in CO<sub>2</sub> accumulation and climate change. A potential method for CO<sub>2</sub> removal is converting CO<sub>2</sub> to hydrocarbon products by some artificial processes such as photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to CH<sub>4</sub>. However, two main challenges limit the practical application of this process: i) The commercially available photocatalysts such as Evonik&rsquo;s P25 TiO<sub>2</sub> have low catalytic efficiency and ii) The conventional photocatalyst fabrication processes normally require sophisticated operating procedures, long processing times, and high instrumental investments. To address these issues, we developed a spray drying process, which is also an aerosol-assisted process. By this process, SnO<sub>2</sub> based photocatalysts can be generated by a one-step, low-cost, and efficient approach (Figure 3a). These photocatalysts exhibit superior methane yield, with 5 times that of P25 and 28 times that of SnO<sub>2</sub> under the same reaction condition. The methane product selectivity is &gt;99 % (Figure 3b-c).</p> <p>In summary, research funded by NSF CBET-1336581 has successfully addressed the issues in the information technology, energy storage, and global warming. Materials produced by aerosol-assisted processes we developed exhibit superior performance and are promising for applications including solar cell metallization, battery, and photocatalysis.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/10/2018<br>      Modified by: Sheryl&nbsp;H&nbsp;Ehrman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1336581/1336581_10262995_1518287500826_Fig3LiangNSF--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1336581/1336581_10262995_1518287500826_Fig3LiangNSF--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1336581/1336581_10262995_1518287500826_Fig3LiangNSF--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 3 (a) Schematic illustration of spray drying and the formation of SnO2 based photocatalysts.
