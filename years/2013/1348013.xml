<AbstractNarration>In most endangered language situations, speakers transition from speaking an endangered language to an existing majority language. In very rare situations, children learning both an endangered language and a majority language may create a new mixed linguistic variety with features of both languages. These unusual situations provide clues to social, psychological and linguistic mechanisms involved in the emergence of such novel communicative forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Linguist Carmel O'Shannessy of the University of Michigan will document a newly emerging language, Light Warlpiri, in a small indigenous community in northern Australia, focusing on the role of children and young adults in the development of the language. Light Warlpiri is a mixed language using Warlpiri, English, and Northern Territory Kriol (a local English-based creole). Although Light Warlpiri has recently emerged and is still stabilizing, it is also highly endangered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three striking features of Light Warlpiri make its documentation at this point in time especially important. First, the oldest speakers of Light Warlpiri are only about 35 years old, so relative to how long languages can exist, Light Warlpiri is young and can be observed as it grows. Second, the structure of Light Warlpiri is unusual - the verb structure is from varieties of English and Kriol, but with some radical innovations, and the noun structure - word endings - are from the traditional language, Warlpiri. Third, children learn both Light Warlpiri and the traditional language, Warlpiri, which is an uncommon language learning situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through audio and video recordings of staged and spontaneous language contexts, the project will track children's acquisition of Warlpiri and Light Warlpiri, providing insights into bilingual acquisition in a complex linguistic context, as well as insights into the interaction of language endangerment and language emergence. The project will add audio and video time-aligned data to an existing longitudinal corpus which was started in 2002, forming an open-access audio-visual corpus of children's and adults' language spanning approximately 15 years. The corpus will be used to produce a sketch grammar of Light Warlpiri, tracing the sources of grammatical features. The project will also create online activities in Warlpiri which Warlpiri youth and young adults can access from their cell phones, promoting Warlpiri maintenance and engagement with technology.</AbstractNarration>

The study of fricative sounds (e.g. f/v, s/z, sh) shows that again the speakers have amalgamated parts of the systems of the source languages, and in this case show considerable influence from one source, English, over another source, Kriol. Interestingly, the multilingual speakers of Light Warlpiri do not show influence of other languages in the sound system of Warlpiri when they speak it &ndash; they produce Warlpiri sounds the same way that older speakers of Warlpiri do.

The speakers bring complex verbs from Warlpiri ,which has quite a different verbal structure, into Light Warlpiri, and integrate the&nbsp;&nbsp;verbs into Light Warlpiri structure, showing fluid movement between their two systems. The importance of these and other findings is that grammatical patterns in this young, newly developing language show both great systematicity and conventionalisation at an early stage of the life of the language, and also great creativity by the speakers, who often do not copy attributes from the source languages, but re-analyse them to create entirely new systems.
