<AbstractNarration>The state longitudinal data systems provide the potential for a wide range of research studies to address practice and policy issues in STEM education. The PIs of this study from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University are coordinating a research collaborative to expand the use of individual-level administrative data from five sources, including social services, child care quality, and educational data, and to coordinate with efforts in the state of Virginia to expand the interoperability of data. They are structuring a research panel to conceptualize the best use of administrative data to test scientific models across a number of STEM education research agendas. The PIs are developing a design data interface and analytic tools to increase research capacity. Finally, they are coordinating data governance structures and processes to provide for procedures for system use by academic researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the technical infrastructure of state longitudinal data systems has had wide support and made considerable progress over the past 10 years, the potential for these data to be used by educational and social scientist researchers has not kept pace. This project informs the knowledge base of how state administrative data can be coordinated and integrated to address research agendas more systematically. Multiple policy and practice research questions that look at student persistence and learning trajectories, evaluation of interventions, and workforce development efforts have the potential to be informed by research communities that are more systematically leveraging integrated longitudinal data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Administrative data are collected for accountability purposes, but often contain a wealth of information that enable evaluation of state or local education policies or procedures.  Valid and timely use of these data can help inform decision-making, potentially improving services and/or cost efficiency.  While many administrative education longitudinal systems have been developed within the past ten years, using them effectively has been a challenge.  Successfully harnessing the promise of these systems requires strategic, potentially novel, research infrastructure development and collaboration between disparate data users, such as agency personnel, policymakers and academic researchers.  These actors often have different priorities and ways of thinking about and using data, which can complicate and temper the effective use of longitudinal administrative data systems.  This project was designed to facilitate productive use of administrative data to address STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math)-related research and policy questions that can help guide state education policy, program planning and evaluation.  The project focused simultaneously on building research infrastructure and a collaborative researcher-state agency community within which to utilize and refine the infrastructure, with the end goal of future research producing valid and useful information to enhance STEM teaching, learning, training and workforce development.  Working with state agency partners in one state and an advisory group of educational and psychology researchers, the research team developed tools and protocols to (1) facilitate researchers engaging more efficiently with the Virginia Longitudinal Data System (VLDS), a relatively new, federated, automated linkage system that draws from multiple state agencies in Virginia to create "on demand," individual-level datasets; and (2) to help agency partners increasingly benefit from researchers? experience using the VLDS.  A series of interactional activities were also undertaken to encourage and facilitate team- and research community-building.  A discovery phase first identified important gaps in researcher accessibility and efficient system utility.  The remainder of the project focused on helping to address these gaps while building synergistic university-agency research partnerships to iteratively improve both VLDS infrastructure and its use in data-driven decision-making.  Dissemination at national conferences has suggested ways project outcomes could be adapted for use by other state longitudinal data systems.  The project has resulted in the development of a raft of tools as well as one completed study and several ongoing research collaborations addressing policy concerns.  Using templates developed for this project, many of the tools can be  adapted (populated with other states' data) for use by other states with  PK-20 longitudinal data systems for broader impact.  Select infrastructure developed under this project includes:  (1) A suite of tools for researchers to orient them to the longitudinal data system and its data, including narrative descriptions, detailed navigational instructions to access data, new or enhanced metadata, data quality characterizations, recommendations and tables to assist with data checking, descriptions of key educational and STEM variables with recommendations for selecting, estimating, creating or using them (for example, attendance, retention, STEM course work, etc.), and statistical code for select data cleaning procedures and variable creation;   (2) A set of exportable tables for multi-level analyses that characterize schools, school divisions (or districts) and communities.   These multi-year tables are intended to help researchers plan studies, contextualize student achievement or other data, and facilitate multi-level modeling.  Tables includes information such as  School size (student population) across years School grades and structure across years Student demographics, including disadvantaged status (percentages) Student achievement and completion (percentages) School STEM assets (e.g., number of advanced math courses offered) Geospatial codes to enable ArcGIS mapping Community socioeconomic indicators Community health indicators Community geographical features;   (3) Development of indices or scales to compare high school STEM-related student experiences, such as several indices of math progression and engineering -related elective course taking;  (4) Reports and blogs that describe trends or data results for policymaker or other non-research audiences.  Our work on data quality and characterization, as well as data privacy protections, contributed to two review articles.  Further dissemination for academic and non-academic audiences will continue as research collaborations developed through this project  bear fruit.
