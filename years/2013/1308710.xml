<AbstractNarration>There are three sections to the proposal, each the continuation of a long standing collaboration.  Lee Mosher and the PI have short, medium and long term goals regarding the outer automorphism group Out(F) of the finite rank free group F.  These include proving that subgroups of Out(F) are either virtually abelian or have infinite dimensional second bounded cohomology and developing an analog for Out(F) of the Masur-Minsky summation formula that applies to mapping class groups.  Mark Feighn and the PI have been focusing on the  conjugacy problem for Out(F)  in the case that the elements in question have polynomial growth.  The intent is to complete this  important special case and then to the solve the full conjugacy problem by merging the techniques from the polynomially growing case with those already developed to solve the exponentially growing case.    John Franks and the PI use relative mapping class group methods  to study the dynamics of diffeomorphisms of surfaces.  One goal is to to extend their work on zero entropy area preserving diffeomorphisms of the sphere to surfaces of higher genus.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concerns the properties of, and the relationships between, three important groups: the outer automorphism group of a free group, the mapping class group of a surface, and the diffeomorphism group of a surface.  Topological and geometric methods are used to study dynamical systems and in return, ideas from dynamics are used to formulate and prove fundamental topological and geometric properties of outer automorphisms  and mapping classes.  There is currently a great deal of interest in the large scale geometry of the group of outer automorphisms of the free group and this proposal is well situated to make substantial progress on this front.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Handel and Franks work in the interface of dynamical systems and low dimensional topology with emphasis on area preserving smooth transformations of surfaces.  Entropy is a measure of the complexity or lack of predictability of transformations.  Consider, for example, a two dimensional sphere and a set of concentric circles with centers at the north and south poles.    Rotating each circle by a varying amount and fixing the north and south pole defines a "transformation" of the sphere.  The "entropy" of that transformation is zero.  The same is true if we change the centers of the circles to be on the equator instead of being at the poles.  However if we do the former transformation and then immediately  do the latter, then the resulting composite transformation has positive entropy.  It is chaotic in the sense that it is very difficult to predict where a point will end up if we do this composite transformation twenty times.    In the positive entropy case, much is known about the underlying structure of the transformation but much less is known in the entropy zero case.  Franks and Handel have been filling this gap, using relative mapping class group techniques which allow one to modify the transformation without losing critical information.  With support from this grant, they have extended their previous work on the two dimensional sphere to surfaces of higher genus.   Geometric group theory, in which one uses geometric and topological methods to study algebraic objects called groups, has three special and related families of groups:  the group of invertible square matrices of a given dimension n,  mapping class groups of surfaces and outer automorphism groups of finite rank free groups.  Matrix groups are  classical and mapping class groups have been intensely studied over the last forty-five years.  Less is known about outer automorphism groups  but interest in this subject has been growing over the last thirty years and has accelerated in the last five.   Relative train track maps are a combinatorial and graph-theoretical tool that is used by many researchers to study the outer automorphism group.  These were introduced by Bestvina and Handel and then developed by Bestvina, Feighn and Handel.  Feighn and Handel have now shown that relative train track maps can be algorithmically constructed and so can be used to solve problems of an algorithmic nature, such as the conjugacy problem.       Handel and Mosher continued their study of the large scale geometry of the outer automorphism group, completing a manuscript that will appear as an issue of the Memoirs of the American Mathematical Society.  They then applied techniques and results from that paper to complete another long term project.          Last Modified: 10/23/2017       Submitted by: Michael Handel]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
