<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to exploit and establish the theoretical foundations to support the design of next generation cooperative, clean and centralized heterogeneous wireless access networks, or, C-HetNet. The approaches include designing novel algorithms for spectrum efficiency, energy efficiency and quality of service based mobile association, multi-layer interference management and power control, network wide cooperation and dynamic resource allocation in the C-HetNet; and seeking the design principles of balancing and optimizing spectrum efficiency, energy efficiency and quality of service in the C-HetNet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expected to significantly advance the understanding in the heterogeneous wireless networks, which are expected to play a key role in meeting the future data capacity explosion and energy consumption escalation. The project will address the unique technical challenges in the C-HetNet and explore new solutions to spectrum and energy efficiency in mobile association, multi-layer interference management and power control, and dynamic cooperative resource allocation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The C-HetNet research activities have significant potentials to revolutionize wireless access networking technologies and wireless cross-layer design approaches. The research will provide a new wireless network paradigm to meet the ever-increasing wireless traffic demand and to address the needs on network cost reduction and global environmental protection; and will improve many application scenarios such as coverage extension, hotspots, and emergency network deployment for public safety, disaster rescues and medical applications. The research outcomes will be disseminated through publications and seminars and will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses taught by the PIs.</AbstractNarration>
