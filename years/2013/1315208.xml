<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop nanoparticle imaging agents for diagnostic applications in clinical pathology. Currently, fluorescent imaging agents are used to image cells and tissue samples in both solid (biopsy) and liquid (blood sample) forms and to identify markers that indicate disease state or progression. These imaging agents have several limitations, including poor stability and reduced brightness, especially over time. Nanoparticle imaging agents can provide brighter images over longer periods of time, potentially enhancing diagnostic ability. Further, nanoparticle imaging agents may permit multiple markers to be imaged simultaneously reducing the amount of blood/tissue required for analysis. This proposal will examine the potential of fluorescent nanoparticle quantum dots for pathological diagnostic imaging by (i) showing that nanoparticles can be produced in sufficient volume to meet market need, (ii) demonstrating that nanoparticles can be used to identify standard markers in blood cells and (iii) comparing their performance and stability to products currently used in the clinic. This research and development will thus validate the potential of nanoparticle quantum dots in the clinical pathology market, and could lead to enhanced diagnostic tools for earlier disease detection with reduced blood/tissue sample requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project primarily impacts the pathology imaging market, which could have substantial benefits to society. Although diagnostic imaging agents are a $2.86B market, nanoparticles represent just $183M of that market. There is thus tremendous opportunity to enhance nanoparticle market share. Currently, few fluorescent nanoparticle agents are used in pathology because of a lack of stability. These research and development activities will evaluate the potential of nanoparticle imaging agents to improve diagnostic capabilities of disease. The proposed product, the Multidot, exhibits superior stability to current nanoparticle imaging agents potentially elevating a commercialization roadblock. If successful, the Multidot should provide a brighter signal, increasing disease detection capability, and also permit multiple markers to be imaged simultaneously. The latter not only reduces the amount of tissue required for imaging, but could enable additional diagnostics based on pairs or groupings of markers, enhancing personalized medicine approaches. Together, these benefits, will enhance clinical care by providing new types of diagnostic imaging agents with superior performance to those currently employed.</AbstractNarration>
