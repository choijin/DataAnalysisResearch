<AbstractNarration>Abstract:  RouteViews is a system for systematically collecting data on the routes (the paths by which data gets from point A to point B) used by Internet traffic.  It has played a critical role in the study of significant events, such as large scale outages, that have taken place in the Internet.  The RouteViews data archives are the most widely used source of Internet routing data for the computer networking, network operations and network security communities.    They are also increasingly being used in studies of network topological growth and network economics.  However, access to the RouteViews data has been challenging to new users since the data is current structured as flat binary files with no simple interfaces for searching or accessing the data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will design and implement database access to the RouteViews data, and will develop simple interfaces and tools for accessing the data.  The resources used to acquire and store the data will also be expanded.  The project will open up the use of routing data to a broader community including undergraduate education.   It will work with the community to raise awareness about the potential uses of routing data in research and education, and will promote the use of the new access methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will expand routing data collection, will make it easier to access the collected data and will benefit  networking research, network operations and network security.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award focused on the development of resources related to Internet routing data collection, dissemination, and analysis.  Routing data is particularly useful in the areas of network measurement, and network security.  RouteViews is a research project which has been collecting global routing data since 1997.  The RouteViews data archives are one of the longest running archives of publicly accessible routing data in existence.  RouteViews offers support to both researchers and network operators.  This award allowed RouteViews to update and expand its data collection infrastructure.  RouteViews also supports the development of advanced routing data distribution methods through collaboration with the following groups: Colorado State University BGPmon, the Linux Foundation SNAS.io/OpenBMP, and CAIDA  BGPStream.  Each of these projects has produced new tools which simplify the task of accessing and interpreting routing data.  A significant activity of this award was the work done at Colorado State University on the BGPmon distribution architecture.  BGPmon is a flexible routing data collection and distribution system.  BGPmon can ingest data from gobgpd, MRT files, and other sources.  BGPmon also contains a database backend, which allows for query access, and for the generation of network analytics.  The query access allows for near real-time streaming of routing data.  The use of protobufs in the design of the system simplifies the task of transporting messages, and simplifies the task of converting messages into other formats such as XML or JSON.  This award also allowed RouteViews to do work supporting the use of the IETF BGP Monitoring Protocol.  The SNAS.io/OpenBMP project operates on BMP data.  RouteViews was able to contribue BMP data from the primary RouteViews router for testing and development.  This system also provides near real-time access to data, since BMP operates with no delays, and since SNAS.io/OpenBMP operates with very minimal delays.  SNAS.io/OpenBMP provides a scalable solution for the redistribution of BMP data to multiple clients.  The ability to consolidate and redistribute routing data is a noteworthy capability of this open source software solution.  These and other activities within the award have helped simplify and improve access to Internet routing data.  Accessing data in near real-time, and access the data using clearly defined API's, allows researchers to perform their work more simply and more quickly.  This should lead to new approaches for researchers who are working with Internet measurement data.       Last Modified: 07/21/2017       Submitted by: David M Meyer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
