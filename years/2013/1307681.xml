<AbstractNarration>The eleventh annual Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference is to be held April 6-April 7, 2013, at the University of Notre Dame. The conference includes a geographically diverse group of over 100 graduate students at various stages of their careers. There is a broad range of talks in the schedule: 24 graduate student 30 minute talks on expository and original research topics in geometry/topology; two plenary speakers, Dan Freed (UT Austin) and Burkhard Wilking (Münster); and six invited young faculty speakers, David Ayala (Harvard), Clark Barwick (MIT), Alessio Figalli (UT Austin), Fernando Galaz-García (Münster), Ana Rita Pires (Cornell) and Gábor Székelyhidi (Notre Dame). This conference will include a wide range of topics in topology and geometry: hyperbolic geometry, geometry of positive curvature, global analysis, 3-manifolds, homotopy theory, symplectic geometry, dynamics, knot theory, cobordism theory, category theory, Teichm#uller theory, 4-manifolds, dfferential topology, geometric group theory, algebraic K-theory, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference provides a venue for communication among young mathematicians from different geographic regions. Participants include graduate students at all stages of their careers. This is one of the few conferences in topology and geometry that is dedicated to graduate students. Student participants at this conference have the opportunity to learn about cutting edge research and to hone their communication and networking skills. Geometry and topology are fundamental mathematical fields with deep connections to many other areas of research, such as dynamical systems, physics, computer science, and mathematical biology. This conference serves to foster research and communication about research in these areas, and to enable and encourage graduate students in these fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information can be found at http://www.nd.edu/~conf/gstgc13</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The eleventh  annual Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference, took place on April 6--7, 2013, at the University of Notre Dame. The conference involved more than 190 graduate students of all levels from all over the country.  The conference consisted of:  Twenty-four graduate student 30 minute talks on expository and original research topics in geometry/topology;  Two plenary speakers who are both prominent in their respective fields and excellent expositors: Dan Freed (University of Texas at Austin) in topology and Burkhard Wilking (University of Muenster) in differential geometry;  Six invited young faculty speakers: David Ayala (Harvard University), Clark Barwick (MIT), Alessio Figalli (University of Texas at Austin), Fernando Galaz-Garcia (University of Muenster), Ana Rita Peres (Cornell University), and Gabor Szekelyhidi (University of Notre Dame).  The topic of this conference was broad: topology and geometry. There were talks in many subfields: K-theory, cobordism theory, Kahler geometry, Riemannian geometry, scalar curvature, Floer homology, coarse geometry, symplectic geometry, the Ricci flow, differential topology, string topology and optimal transport.  Both geometry and topology are growing mathematical fields with deep connections to many other areas of research, such as dynamical systems, physics, computer science, and mathematical biology.  This conference furthered research and communication about research in these areas, and enabled and encouraged graduate students in these fields.  Young mathematicians came from every part of the United States. Participants came from dozens of different schools, and included graduate students at all years of study. The conference facilitated communication and interaction among young mathematicians.    For those graduate students who were competitively selected to speak, the experience of presenting at a large conference allowed them to refine their speaking skills and grow into more effective communicators.  Because of the opportunity to meet other students in related fields, the environment encouraged collaboration both now and for the rest of the participants' careers.
