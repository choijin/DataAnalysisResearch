<AbstractNarration>Plant calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs or CDPKs) are a large family of plant protein kinases that act as calcium sensors to regulate a range of processes involved in regulation of growth, stomatal aperture, hormone signaling, and immune/stress signaling.  Hence, a solid understanding of the mechanisms that regulate these protein kinases is of fundamental importance.  The aim of this project is to further elucidate two recently discovered novel properties of CDPKs, tyrosine autophosphorylation and calmodulin (CaM)-binding, to better understand how these factors regulate CDPK activity and plant function. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goals of the project are to understand how posttranslational modifications of specific CDPKs modulates their function, and to define the role these modifications play in regulating plant growth, development and responses to environmental stimuli.  The approach will involve generating and measuring the activities of phosphosite CDPK mutants, determining their effect on CaM-binding, and using the directed mutants to complement CDPK null mutants to determine their effect on plant phenotype.  The project will center around two broad objectives to characterize the occurrence and regulatory role of: 1) autophosphorylation of CDPKs on Ser, Thr and Tyr residues, and 2) CaM binding to CDPKs.  Studies will involve recombinant proteins (and site-directed mutants) in vitro that will guide transgenic approaches to examine function in planta.  The results of the proposed studies may fundamentally alter two paradigms of CDPK regulation. In addition to providing traditional student training, the project will also include summer programs that provide opportunities for recruiting underrepresented groups and involve students in lab activities.  In addition, the new Professional Science Master's Program in Plant Biology/Biotechnology will engage students who are training for positions outside of academic research with a non-thesis research project.  Finally, all biological materials derived from the project will be made available to the research community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of this project was on calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPK) 28, one of a 34-member family of regulatory proteins in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and a protein encoded by multiple genes in all known plant species.  Previous research had shown that CPKs are involved in a multitude of critical cellular processes, including developmental, hormonal and metabolic regulation.  However, detailed knowledge of the mechanisms by which CPK28 activity (and, indeed the activities of all members of the CPK family) were known only in the most general terms when we began the project.  We used an approach of "biochemically informed molecular genetics" to gain more insight into: (1) how is CPK28 activity regulated; and (2) how do the mechanisms of CPK28 regulation integrate into plant growth and development.  Our approach was prompted by our novel finding that the Ca2+-regulatory protein, calmodulin (CaM), altered the pattern of CPK28 autophosphorylation.  Autophosphorylation stimulated by the universal signaling molecule Ca2+ was known to greatly alter CPK enzymatic activity, but the dependence of this modification on another Ca2+-dependent protein was unexpected.  Our initial approach involved using recombinant proteins produced in bacteria using cloned CPK28 and CaM genes so the interactions of the proteins could be strictly controlled since bacteria lack the genes encoding them.  By investigating the effect of CaM on autophosphorylation by CPK28 we defined for the first time key residues in the protein that are required for its activity.  We confirmed their roles by specifically mutating them and investigating their biochemical activities.  We used this information to formulate a novel and more detailed mechanism by which some members of the CPK family are activated.  Finally, we used this biochemical information to introduce specific CPK28 mutants into plants harboring mutations that eliminated native CPK28 activity to ask how they affect physiological processes in which CPK28 is known to participate.  Although our initial studies revealed no changes to normal Arabidopsis growth and development, studies by collaborators are continuing to determine what effect changes in CPK28 activity have on critical defensive responses to bacterial pathogens.  The mutant seed stocks we generated in these studies are being donated to the Arabidopsis Biological Research Center where they can be disseminated to additional investigators.
