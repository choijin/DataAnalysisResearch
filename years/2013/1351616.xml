<AbstractNarration>This effort is focused on better quantifying the emissions of aerosols and trace gases of global significance from combustion sources in Nepal and Bhutan. Very little information currently exists on emissions from sources such as brick kilns, garbage burning, and cooking fires. The broader impacts of this research include the development of a better understanding of the contribution of emissions from South Asia to the global burden of gases and aerosol important for predicting regional air quality and global climate change. This work is part of a larger international effort between the US, Nepal, Bhutan, Germany, and Italy to study atmospheric chemistry in South Asia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemical species to be quantified include: PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 &amp;#956;m), elemental and organic carbon, absorption by black and brown carbon, smoke markers, a suite of particle-phase metals and ions, CO2, CO, CH4, more than 90 diverse non-methane organic gases, SO2, NOx, NH3, HCN, acetonitrile, and many other types of aerosol and trace gases. The measurements will complement ongoing regional monitoring activities by filling a critical need for better source characterization. The results will help to assess the relative importance of South Asian combustion sources in influencing air quality and climate on a local, regional, and global scale.</AbstractNarration>

Key findings:  In the Nepal Ambient Monitoring and Source testing Experiment (NAMaSTE), emissions from many widespread and previously poorly characterized combustion sources were evaluated by their emissions of gases and particles, including detailed chemical speciation, optical properties such as light absorption and scattering, and particle size-resolved chemistry. The studied sources included zigzag and clamp-style brick kilns, cooking fires with wood and dung in traditional, chimney stove, and improved stove designs, crop residue burning, a biomass-fueled heating fire, garbage burning, diesel and gasoline generators, diesel pumps, and motorcycles before and after tune-ups.

Further improvements to emissions inventories are needed and efforts are underway to incorporate emissions data from other widespread combustion sources.

Our characterization of under-sampled combustion sources provides new data about emissions from regionally important combustion sources. These data have been used in to evaluate the relative strengths of anthropogenic and natural sources to ambient PM in Nepal, to develop more accurate emission inventories in South Asia, and develop more representative regional air quality models. This work benefits society by informing air pollution mitigation strategies. More broadly, our research products can help to improve the understanding of the health outcomes associated with human exposures to source emissions and ambient air pollution.  Our results have been disseminated to the scientific community through five open-access scientific articles (three published, two in review).  The University of Iowa team has delivered sixteen scientific conference presentations at local, regional, national, and international venues. Additionally, this research has contributed to two doctoral theses in Chemistry (one complete and one in progress) and two undergraduate Honor?s theses in Chemistry at the University of Iowa.  Broader impacts of this research include the training of three graduate students pursuing doctoral degrees in Chemistry at the University of Iowa and five undergraduate students. This research project has supported the career development of the involved researchers, by providing research, training, and mentoring opportunities.  In addition, this project has strengthened collaborations between the PI and the other PIs collaborating on this project across the University of Iowa, University of Montana, University of Virginia, Emory University, and Drexel University, as well as our international partners: the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) and Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS).
