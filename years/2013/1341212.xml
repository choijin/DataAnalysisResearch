<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER proposal is aimed at the development of an adjuvant intra-operative therapeutic method that will address several critical needs for treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as well as other cancer types to ensure clean surgical margins, prevent tumor recurrence, improve patients survival rates, and enhance their quality of life. This goal will be achieved through a novel plasmonic nanobubble (PNB) approach that combines intra-cellular application of four clinical modalities: encapsulated drugs (Doxil), gold nanoparticles (colloidal gold), near-infrared laser pulses of low energy, and X-rays. This method is referred to as quadrapeutics. The translation into clinical practice  will be achieved through the folowing objectives: 1) Optimization of the PNB generation and detection methods in vivo and validation of the use of PNBs for the intra-operative diagnosis of MRD in mice. 2) Adopt the PNB and quadrapeutic methods for intraoperative adjuvant therapy of microscopic residual disease in unresectable HNSCC tumors in a mice model.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was aimed at improving the outcomes of cancer surgery. Failure of cancer surgery to intraoperatively detect and remove microscopic tumours causes lethal recurrence and metastases, whereas removal of important normal tissues causes excessive morbidity.   We developed intraoperative technology using our unique plasmonic nanobubble (PNB), a non-stationary laser pulse-activated nano-event, which intraoperatively detects and eliminates residual microtumours in the surgical bed. In our proof-of-concept study, PNBs were generated in vivo in head and neck cancer cells by systemically targeting tumours with gold colloids and locally applying near-infrared low energy short laser pulses, and were simultaneously detected with an acoustic probe. In mouse models, single cancer cells and microtumours (undetectable with current methods) were non-invasively detected up to 4 millimetres deep in solid tissue in the surgical bed within 1 millisecond. In resectable tumours, PNB-guided surgery prevented local recurrence and delivered 100% tumour-free survival. In unresectable tumours, PNB nano-surgery improved survival by two-fold compared to standard surgery.   Our results show that PNB-guided surgery and nano-surgery can rapidly and precisely detect and remove microtumours in simple intraoperative procedures. The technology we developed, PNB nano-surgery can improve standard onco-surgery through: (1) Real-time intraoperative local detection of MRD in vivo with very high sensitivity and specificity; (2) Real-time guidance of surgery to precisely eliminate resectable MRD with minimal morbidity by resecting only PNB-positive volume instead of a larger volume; (3) Intraoperative selective elimination of unresectable MRD through the mechanical impact of lethal cancer cell-specific PNBs without damaging adjacent normal cells and tissues; (4) Prediction of the surgical outcome through the metrics of PNB signals. The developed technology is ready for clinical prototyping and trial.              Last Modified: 01/01/2016       Submitted by: Dmitri Lapotko]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
