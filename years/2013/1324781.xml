<AbstractNarration>This project is focused on improving the measurement methods for gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) in the atmosphere. Development will continue on a simple, calibrated system for passive sampling of GOM followed by thermal desorption. Mass spectrometric analysis will be used to identify specific GOM compounds in the environment. A variety of collection and pre-concentration materials and configurations will be tested. A field-ready calibrator for oxidized mercury compounds will be built that will allow for routine verification of GOM measurements by Tekran and other measurement systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gaseous oxidized mercury compounds are easily converted to methyl mercury, the form of mercury that is of most concern for human and ecosystem health. These compounds are also of concern because they can become efficiently taken up by ecosystems. This project will improve our understanding of the chemistry and fate of mercury in the environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mercury is a potent neurotoxin.  Most emissions of mercury are to the atmosphere, and the atmosphere transports mercury around the globe and facilitates chemical reactions that transform mercury into different forms. Mercury in the atmosphere, however, exists in concentrations that are too low to be a direct concern to human health (except in the vicinity of some mining or other industrial operations).  Mercury becomes a health concern after it deposits to trees, soils, ice, or water surfaces, is transported into aquatic ecosystems, and is converted to methylmercury by aquatic bacteria. Methylmercury is then bioaccumulated and biomagnified up the food chain. Humans can be impacted by mercury when they consume contaminated aquatic life.  The majority of mercury in the atmosphere is in elemental form, but elemental mercury can be oxidized to form mercury compounds that are more water soluble, deposit more quickly, and are more able to be converted into methylmercury, the form that can be taken up and accumulated by fish and other aquatic life.  Since different forms of mercury in the atmosphere have different ability to impact ecosystems, it is important that atmospheric measurements of mercury distinguish among these forms.    Elemental and oxidized mercury are measured in the ambient atmosphere by research groups and government agencies around the world. Unfortunately, oxidized mercury compounds are reactive and only semi-volatile, so handling them is a challenge, and development of suitable technology for calibration (i.e., verification of the accuracy) of oxidized mercury measurements has proven elusive.  This means that almost all measurements of oxidized mercury have been unverified.  To make matters worse, the verification that has occurred has shown that commercial mercury measurement instrumentation does not accurately quantify the amount of oxidized mercury in the atmosphere.    We have developed and deployed an automatic calibration device for atmospheric oxidized mercury.  This calibrator will allow those who measure atmospheric oxidized mercury to routinely verify the accuracy of their measurements. We deployed the calibrator in Reno, Nevada, and Mauna Loa, Hawaii, in conjunction with commercial mercury instruments.  We used it to routinely inject known amounts of oxidized Hg compounds (HgBr2 and HgCl2) into these instruments to determine whether they were reporting the amount of oxidized Hg expected. Our calibrator is the first of its kind and is able to provide known concentrations of oxidized mercury on a routine basis to make sure that we understand how well oxidized mercury instrumentation is working.  It is not a perfect machine and still needs improvement in several areas, but it is a great step forward for mercury research.    Another problem with commercial mercury measurement instrumentation is that, while it distinguishes between elemental and oxidized mercury, it is not able to determine the identity of the individual compounds that make up the total amount of oxidized mercury measured.  We developed a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer-based instrument that can clearly identify mercury halides, such as HgBr2 and HgCl2.  Mercury halides are thought to be some of the oxidized mercury compounds that exist in the atmosphere.  The instrument was able to quantify and identify as little as 90 picograms of these compounds in a laboratory setting. Unfortunately, the atmospheric collection portion of this instrument still needs work, so we have not yet been able to definitively quantify or identify oxidized mercury compounds in ambient air samples.  Atmospheric mercury measurements help scientists and regulators understand the sources from which mercury is emitted, how it is transported and transformed, and when and where it deposits back to the earth. Mercury measurements, especially those for oxidized mercury, have been fraught with uncertainty and error, however. This project has led to the development of new instrumentation that can improve mercury measurements and lead to a better understanding of the mercury biogeochemical cycle.
