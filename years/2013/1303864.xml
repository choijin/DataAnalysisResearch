<AbstractNarration>A better understanding of Arctic cloud and aerosol properties, structure and formation is essential to understand the specific response of the Arctic in the context of global climate change. A lack of coherent high vertical and temporal resolution observations of cloud particles, aerosols moisture advection (i.e. water vapor) and thermodynamics, creates large uncertainties in current model estimates of cloud properties and inhibits our understanding of cloud radiative and precipitation impacts on the surface. As a result, current weather and climate models poorly parameterize clouds over the Arctic and more specifically over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS). A reduction in this uncertainty is particularly important above the GIS, where clouds act as sinks and sources to the ice mass balance by modulating the surface radiation budget and available precipitable water. To gain the understanding necessary to reduce this uncertainty, a new autonomous multi-wavelength, polarized Raman lidar is proposed for development and deployment at the NSF&amp;#700;s observatory in Summit, Greenland. The new lidar observations will employ multiple wavelengths and polarizations to observe elastic and inelastic scattering from the Arctic atmosphere enabling regular retrieval of temperature, water vapor and extinction profiles. This combination of observational capability will create a coherent dataset of high-resolution thermodynamic, cloud and aerosol observations through the Arctic troposphere and lower stratosphere above Summit. Broadly, this addition to the NSF Observatory at Summit, Greenland as part of the larger Arctic Observing Network fits well within the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) implementation plan. Thus, this instrument will significantly enhance Arctic observing infrastructure and advance observations and understanding of change in the Arctic. The proposed instrumentation and observations are the first of their kind on the GIS and will expand the existing, although modest, network of such measurements across the Arctic. This project will also provide a unique experience and educational opportunity through the combination of fieldwork and subsequent data processing for graduate students at the University of Colorado.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="Paragraph">The technical goal of the ?High Resolution, Active Remote Sensing of Cloud Microphysics at Summit, Greenland with Polarized Raman Lidar? project was to design, build, test and verify a state-of-the-art lidar system (called the Summit Polarized Raman (SuPR) Lidar) capable of making continuous and coherent high vertical and temporal resolution measurements of temperature, water vapor, and cloud properties in the Arctic troposphere. Cloud microphysics have proven to be an important factor in the overall energy budget of the Greenland ice sheet (GIS) and these measurements will help advance knowledge in cloud formation and properties over the GIS. The scientific needs for this observational capability fit well within the Study of Environmental Arctic Change and specifically at Summit Greenland where a multi-sensor suite of instruments are deployed as part of the Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric state, and Precipitation at Summit (ICECAPS) project to improve our understanding of cloud physics in the Arctic. The project plan was to build and demonstrate the lidar capability in Boulder, Colorado and then deploy the lidar to Summit, Greenland for 3 years of operation in conjunction with the ICECAPS project. However, in 2015 it was determined that the deployment of the instrument to Summit was not feasible due to limitations in accommodating the proposed lidar at the site and the deployment was canceled. Though the goal of creating a unique observational dataset at Summit, Greenland was not possible, the first goal of building and demonstrating a state-of-the-art polarized Raman lidar suitable for polar deployments was still attainable. The revised project goal was to design and build an Arctic worthy container to house the lidar and make local observations in Boulder, CO. This will demonstrate the lidar?s ability to meet the measurement goals and be portable for future polar deployments.</p> <p class="Paragraph"><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></p> <p class="Paragraph">The measurement goals of the lidar were achieved (see attached figure) and portability of the system was demonstrated by shipping the system to Leeds University in England where the project Co-I, Dr. Ryan Neely, would maintain and operate the system for further measurement purposes. Tropospheric microphysical cloud properties are critical elements to understanding the polar climate system. A lack of coincident, high vertical and temporal resolution observations of cloud particles, water vapor, and temperature inhibits progress. Our lidar system provides such measurements enabling a new view of cloud microphysics coupled with thermodynamic and transport processes. This capability is designed for polar deployments and will be an invaluable asset to the polar atmospheric science community. In the future, the new lidar will have the capability to make significant contributions to the polar climate, cloud physics, hydrology, and climate modeling communities. Changes in polar cloud processes are of critical importance for assessing climate feedbacks and contribute to significant uncertainty in climate model projections. By better understanding cloud processes (specifically supersaturation conditions and the ice/liquid partitioning) the new instrument will be able to improve the understanding of the changing radiative properties of polar clouds. By examining the distribution of moisture sources and atmospheric transport, we will enhance knowledge of the controls on water balance at high latitudes, which also has consequences for ocean stability and sea ice formation.</p> <p class="Paragraph"><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p> <p class="Paragraph">The developed instrument will be a major advancement for extending the observational capability of the polar atmospheric science community. Housed in a portable shipping container that has been specifically modified for polar operations and designed for autonomous operations, this instrument will be available for deployments in remote locations of the polar regions.</p> <p>The project included training of students and professional development. Aerospace Engineering PhD student, Robert Stillwell, took on the systems engineering role and was responsible for the build, test and verify aspects of the project. Robert successfully demonstrated system performance on all six channels and developed data analysis procedures to compute the data products of temperature, water vapor mixing ratio, aerosol extinction, and aerosol backscatter from the lidar measurements. He successfully defended his thesis in August 2017. Robert was awarded a post-doctorate fellowship in NCAR?s Earth Observing Lab through the competitive Advanced Study Program and was recently hired on fulltime at NCAR as an instrument software engineer. Another PhD graduate, Rory Barton-Grimley, benefited from this activity through testing of equipment and gaining first-hand experience with operating the lidar system. Undergraduates have been exposed to the project through several parallel lidar activities happening in our lab. Provisions for career development, interdisciplinary collaborations, training in grant administration and writing, project management, and field work are in place through opportunities offered at the University of Colorado and professional organizations and meetings.
