<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stony Brook University is continuing a ten week multidisciplinary nanotechnology Research Experience for Undergraduates site involving four engineering departments and administered by the University's Center for Inclusive Education. The program integrates individual research projects tailored to each student's interests under the guidance of a faculty mentor with a coordinated group effort to address a specific scientific question or gain maximum insight into the application of nanotechnology and nanomaterials in health, energy and the environment. The laboratories involved provide research experiences for REU interns in all aspects of nanotechnology and nanomaterials development, including polymeric nanostructures for medical applications, batteries, catalytic surfaces for energy and environmental remediation, and development of nanosensors. The site approach integrates a comprehensive graduate education preparation model that has proven to be effective in successful transition of students into competitive graduate programs, and includes development of communication skills, an electronic portfolio created by each intern, and a symposium on the ethical and societal implications of nanotechnology. The site coordinators actively recruit highly qualified students from a diversity of academic backgrounds; promote recruitment at small regional colleges with limited research opportunities; and recruit students from underrepresented groups through contacts at minority serving institutions and through regional conferences.  To date, the site has supported 25 students directly over three years, augmented by 10 additional students through supplemental support.  Half the REU interns were female and nearly 30% were members of underrepresented minority populations. The project will also include research experiences for two high school teachers who will work side-by-side with the REU interns, and who will translate their experiences into curricula developments and education materials at the high school level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program gratefully acknowledges support from the Division of Engineering Education and Centers of the National Science Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conceptually, nanotechnology is a tool.  It can make remarkable things happen, but we are just beginning to understand its capabilities, how it works, and its potential impact on our lives and our society, for example in the revolutionary miniaturization of electronics and corresponding expansion of computing power.  But it is the new properties and materials being discovered which promise the greatest transformation in areas from medicine to energy to sustaining our environment and economies.  While new technologies are today being designed and built to enable us to understand nanoscale phenomena and ultimately to control them, a key challenge is how to inspire and prepare the next generation of scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs and practitioners to make and leverage these discoveries, in a responsible and ethical fashion, for the greater good of society.  That is the motivation behind development of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates site in Nanotechnology for Health, Energy and the Environment at Stony Brook University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program provides a multidisciplinary experience which fully integrates research and education, an approach shown to enhance learning and motivation, as well as enhance recruitment and retention of students from diverse backgrounds. Recruitment of students from underrepresented groups and from a full range of education levels are hallmarks of the proposed program, as they have been through the first three years of the REU site.  The project also provides opportunities for the professional development of young faculty in mentorship and leadership, and aids in development of a paradigm for the development of new learning and outreach tools and methods. The project has led to growth in collaborative activity between a research intensive PhD-granting institution and regional community colleges and smaller liberal arts colleges, in turn providing the basis for the development of new programs in research, development of teaching and assessment tools, and creation of new opportunities to enhance education at two year colleges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our REU Site on Nanotechnology for Health, Energy and the Environment at Stony Brook University has over the past three years of the project continued to respond to the need to provide experiential learning opportunities for undergraduates in the interdisciplinary field of nanotechnology.  Each year, eight students supported by the NSF funding participate in site activities, as well as several students who receive stipends via our partners (including Suffolk County Community College, the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and other campus programs). In addition, a local high school teacher each year  has been supported to work with the REU students in order to translate the results of the REU site into educational and training materials for secondary school students.  Outcomes which exemplify intellectual merit include providing an in depth, 10 week research experience for each REU site participant with a carefully chosen skilled research mentor in the field of nanotechnology applications responding to societal challenges in energy, environmental and health sectors.  Each participant has completed two professional development courses run concurrently with the summer program in research methods and graduate school preparation.  REU fellows participate in social and outdoor activities which leverage our beautiful local environment and exceptionally culturally diverse campus, a group trip to the Center for Functional Nanomaterials at Brookhaven National Laboratory (see attached image), and weekly lectures from leading scientists and educators.  Program evaluations (including interviews by our external evaluator) indicate that all fellows have clearly benefited from their experiences, gaining an appreciation for scientific research, better understanding the field of nanotechnology, and developing strong research and communication skills.  All of our fellows are either currently completing advanced studies in related fields, or in a few cases are employed in engineering and technical occupations which benefit from the skills learned in the REU program.  Most of the fellows have received other academic awards, have presented their research at national and international conferences, are coauthoring research publications for leading journals, and in general are clearly involved in a sustained and productive research enterprise.  Outcomes which exemplify our broader impact include our tremendous diversity of participants.  Over the past three years, 71.4% of our participants have been female (20 out of 28), which is an exceptional number for STEM-related research (especially research which is not strictly medical/biological).  Further, nearly 40% of our participants (11 of 28) from the past three years have been from minority (Black and Hispanic) populations.   In additional to the exciting diversity of our demographics, we have been able to include participants from first and second years of study (more that 50% of participants) and from a dozen different majors.  Many participants are from community colleges and small colleges with limited accessibility to opportunities to participate in research ? over the past three years these have included the Universidad Metropolitana in Puerto Rico, Suffolk and Nassau County Community Colleges, Northampton Community College, Queensborough Community and others, many of which also have large populations of students underrepresented in STEM disciplines. In addition, our RET teachers have been able to expand the impact of the program by developing classroom demonstrations, STEM teacher training materials, research classes, and enhanced curricula which demonstrate the value of nanotechnology as well as life-long learning.
