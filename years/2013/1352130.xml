<AbstractNarration>Bladderwort, an aquatic carnivorous plant, is among the fastest known predators, able to capture and ingest its prey in less than 1 millisecond. Bladderwort is also among the smallest suction feeders, sucking planktonic prey into millimeter-sized underwater traps.  Bladderwort are interesting not just for their speed and small size, but because their feeding mode is also the most common found in fish, from larva to adult.  Yet current understanding suggests that suction feeding is less suitable for small organisms such as fish larvae - small suction feeders experience water as viscous, which seriously limits suction speed and increases the energetic costs of suction.  Fish larvae are known to have a low success rate at capturing prey and hence suffer high mortality from starvation, which in turn is a main factor limiting recruitment and adult fish population size.This study aims to identify the lower size limit of suction feeding.  This study will lead not just to a better understanding of suction feeding in small organisms, but might also help to address the high mortality of larval fish.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To study suction feeding in small organisms, students will conduct experiments on bladderwort to discover how suction feeders as small or even smaller than larval fish capture their prey.  Students will build mathematical and robotic models to explore what limits capture success.  The goal is to identify the morphological features and flow mechanisms that allow small organisms to suction feed.  By combining data sets on bladderwort from Fresno State, students with data sets on larval fish and tadpoles from collaborating universities, this study will then compare the morphological and flow features of all three organisms to explore how far plants and animals have developed converging solutions.  The research within this study will be conducted at a minority-serving institution. It will be integrated not only into undergraduate and Master's thesis research projects, but also into several undergraduate courses to enable roughly 2000 students per year to conduct authentic research as part of their course work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Many large aquatic organisms use suction feeding to capture prey.  In this project we focused on small suction feeders with mouth diameters smaller than 1 mm. Hydrodynamic theory predicts that tiny organisms cannot use suction feeding because the effects of water?s viscosity make it impossible to generate strong suction flows.  We studied two types of small suction feeders: larval fish and the traps of a carnivorous plant, bladderwort, which uses tiny underwater suction traps to catch zooplankton prey.  Finding out what limits the success of small suction feeders is an important question because larval fish suffer extreme mortality (well above 90%) in the wild, and mortality does not drop much even in captivity, so starvation appears an important limiting factor in aquaculture and fishery management.  This project aimed to find out what causes small suction feeders to be unsuccessful. We found that first-feeding larval fish are indeed severely hampered: they generate only weak suction flows and more than half of their feeding strikes fail. In contrast, the traps of bladderworts generate strong suction flows.  The main difference between larval fish and bladderwort traps is that bladderworts generate up to 100 times stronger suction pressures and reach peak pressure 100 faster.  To test what would happen if the traps generated weaker pressures or took more time to reach peak pressure, we built mathematical and robotic models of the traps and tested the effects of pressure and on-set time on suction performance.  We found that bladderwort traps performs well because they generate strong pressures, not because they reach peak pressure quickly.  Our experiments on bladderwort traps found that they can generate suction flows that accelerate at rates of up to 5000 g (g = acceleration due to gravity) over a time period of less than 1 millisecond, making them the fastest suction feeders.  Bladderworts generate suction flows and pressures that are similar in magnitude to adult fish, whose mouths that are more than 100 wider than those of bladderwort traps.  In the future we will explore what prevents small animal suction feeders from generating similarly strong pressures as plant suction feeders.  This project involved 11 graduate students and 107 undergraduate students.  It resulted in 9 Master theses and 1 undergraduate Honor?s thesis, 11 publications in scientific journals, and 55 conference and seminar presentations with 35 graduate and 45 undergraduate student co-authors and 37 student presenters.  Within this project, 58 undergraduate students also developed outreach activities to engage K-8 students to teach the students biological concepts and methods of scientific inquiry; 16 of these undergraduate students then used these activities to engage more than 100 K-8 students in inquiry-based activities.  We also presented our results to the general public, and to amateur and professional carnivorous plant collectors through oral presentations and through a radio interview.  In the future, we will continue to collaborate with local schools and outreach centers to develop effective activities to teach K-8 students about biology.
