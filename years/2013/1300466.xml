<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award is to investigate the mechanics of stress, defects, and failure in thin silicon photovoltaic wafers using a combination of infrared photoelasticity and polarized photoluminescence inspection techniques.  Silicon wafers are the most common base material in solar cells, but due to stress and defects that arise during the crystal growth process, material losses during manufacturing remain a significant problem.  Under support from this award, the relationship between stress and defects in photovoltaic wafers will be studied directly using lock-in infrared photoelasticity.  Also, a new class of inspection techniques based on a lock-in polarized photoluminescence method, in which both intensity and polarization of emitted light is measured, will be developed and used to study the interaction of stress and defects with light absorbed or emitted by the material.  Finally, the relationship between stress and failure in these materials will be investigated using a series of imaging and fracture experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will support a collaborative effort between university and industry researchers.  The research could have significant impact in the solar energy industry, as it will help to explain the role of stress and defects in photovoltaic wafer failure, and could enable a pathway to rapid inspection and sorting of silicon photovoltaic wafers based on the probability of mechanical failure.  The results will also add to the fundamental understanding of the interaction of light with defects in crystalline materials.  In addition to the research objectives, the award will support graduate and undergraduate education and training.  The academic/industry partnership will be highlighted by the annual summer placement of a graduate research assistant in the industry facility to learn characterization and manufacturing methods. Undergraduate students will be involved through an engineering outreach event at the University of Illinois, and through research in the laboratory of the Principle Investigator.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project advanced the manufacturing science of silicon wafers for photovoltaic (PV) solar cells, of the type seen in rooftop solar panels.  The specific goals of the work were (i) to develop an imaging system that could be used to inspect silicon wafers during manufacturing, (ii) to understand the mechanical and optical properties of defects in the wafer material, and (iii) to combine imaging and simulations to predict the performance of the final silicon wafers after manufacturing.  The findings of the work could ultimately lead to more competitive solar cell manufacturing processes and more efficient solar cells in consumer applications.   The team consisted of two university researchers, two graduate students, one undergraduate student, and a scientist at SolarWorld Industries USA, the leading silicon PV manufacturer in the U.S.  The project supported one PhD thesis, one MS thesis, an undergraduate research experience, and numerous journal articles, abstracts, and presentations.  Several key scientific findings, described below, were a direct result of the project.   In addition to the scientific collaboration between the university team and the industry partner, the project supported an award-winning outreach activity on silicon solar cells, also described below, which reached hundreds of K-12 and community visitors during an open-house event.  The scientific research supported by the project led to major advances in understanding the mechanics of silicon PV materials.  The team developed advanced infrared imaging technology and new simulation methods to study these materials.  Based on this approach, the project team made several specific discoveries, including, first, an explanation for stress patterns in the wafers that were seen in infrared imaging.  Second, the team demonstrated the possibility of using infrared light to simultaneously measure both stress in the wafers, as well as photoluminescence, which provides an estimate for light absorption by the material. Importantly, these measurements were made over the full 15cm x 15cm scale of the wafers, and while resolving the polarization of the light.  Third, by combining these new imaging methods, the team discovered unique characteristics of certain crystalline defects in the silicon wafers, enabling a new level of inspection that could help manufacturers sort their wafers earlier in the production process.  Finally, by combining wafer-scale images with microscope images, the team created a method to more accurately predict the likelihood that the wafers would fracture during manufacturing and operation.
