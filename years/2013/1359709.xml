<AbstractNarration>The Plains Elevated Convection At Night (PECAN) experiment will investigate the evolution of nocturnal mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) and convection and their interactions with the evolving nocturnal stable boundary layer (SBL) environment. This proposal addresses two primary goals of PECAN: 1) To characterize the transition from surface-based to elevated nocturnal MCS structure and the interaction of cold pools generated by MCSs with the nocturnal SBL, and 2) to determine how the organization and evolution of surface-based and elevated MCSs are influenced by the stable boundary layer and the vertical profile of wind and stability above the nocturnal low-level jet (NLLJ). To rectify the present paucity of detailed, integrated observations of nocturnal MCSs and their SBL environments, the project will observe nocturnal MCSs and convection with mobile ground-based radars, mobile sounding systems, and mobile mesonets in concert with other ground-based and airborne observing platforms during PECAN. Multi-radar syntheses, data assimilation, and modeling will provide the integrated analyses of these combined observations to evaluate the detailed internal structure of nocturnal MCSs and the impact of static stability, pre-existing boundaries, and wind shear on nocturnal MCS evolution processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This project emphasizes the tightly coordinated observation of nocturnal MCSs and their SBL environments with an array of multiple mobile Doppler and dual-polarimetric radars in conjunction with mobile soundings and surface in situ observing systems. These observations will be integrated to obtain 3-D airflow syntheses, precipitation fields, and thermal structure of MCSs and newly initiated convection and their environments. Mobile radars are essential as they can provide enhanced temporal and spatial resolution and low-level observations over any area within the PECAN domain. C-band radars, with their ability to both penetrate heavy precipitation and sense clear-air inflow, are required. The mobile C- and X-band dual-polarimetric radars will provide microphysical information beyond the typical operating ranges and below base-scan altitudes of the polarimetric WSR-88D radars. The mobile sounding and surface observations complement the radar wind measurements by providing unique buoyancy and shear profiles both within and outside of precipitation, thus resolving internal MCS dynamics and characterizing the SBL environment that interacts with the MCSs. These data, in combination with other PECAN data from fixed and mobile ground-based radar, profilers, mesonets, and aircraft, are essential for interpreting nocturnal MCS evolution with respect to in situ environmental conditions and for providing input and validation of cloud dynamical-microphysical model simulations of MCSs. The scientific objectives of this project are to: (i) document the internal structure and evolution of nocturnal MCSs and convection; (ii) establish the environmental ingredients and related physical mechanisms that control nocturnal MCS evolution; and (iii) test hypotheses concerning MCS dynamical microphysical forcing and MCS-environment interactions within detailed cloud-resolving models. The research conducted here will advance fundamental knowledge of the internal MCS dynamics and interactions with the SBL and will enable better representations of both within cloud-resolving models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;Characterizing the morphology of nocturnal MCSs and the vertical profiles of temperature, humidity and winds ahead of and near the convective region in the cold pool are essential to helping improve the specificity and accuracy of diagnoses and short-term predictions of the geographical extent and duration of severe weather, heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and aircraft icing conditions. Additionally, these PECAN field observations will be essential for refining data assimilation systems and improving future operational numerical predictions of nocturnal MCSs and their SBL environments. The datasets collected here will also be used in university classes through graduate level. Several undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in the execution of a large atmospheric field campaign by being integrated into the data collection and post-field phase analysis. Lastly, the data collected here will be made available to other NSF and NOAA investigators identified as part of the PECAN project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It has long been known that the central United States has a nocturnal maximum in summertime precipitation, and that this maximum primarily reflects recurring, long-lived, large groups of thunderstorms known as mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). In addition to their integrated seasonal rainfall, nocturnal MCSs produce a large fraction of local warm season extreme precipitation events (e.g., flash floods). A substantial number of warm season derechos (severe, long-lived convective wind storms) have also been associated with nocturnal MCSs. Given their societal importance, it is unsatisfying that predictions of nocturnal convective systems have typically lagged in comparison to other kinds of precipitation systems. The Plains Elevated Convection at Night (PECAN, summer 2015) field project was designed to explain the evolution and structures of nocturnal MCSs and relate them to specific mechanisms and environmental ingredients.  We were actively involved in the planning, field preparations, and execution of the PECAN project. We succeeded in collecting a sounding (weather balloon) data record with a long time window (often &gt;6 hours) at very short time increments (sub-hourly launches) for at least a dozen cases.  These formed the backbone of subsequent studies on how low-level stability and the low-level wind profile evolve over time, and how these ingredients influence MCS maintenance overnight.  We studied PECAN MCS forecast errors in numerical weather prediction models.  This led to a peer-reviewed journal article.   We found the forecast errors to be strongly correlated with models' underrepresentation of low-level moisture. This in turn caused the models to form MCSs too far poleward in comparison to what was observed.  This information may be helpful to forecasters in assessing future forecasts of MCSs.    We studied the full suite of sounding (weather balloon) data from PECAN and found several novel aspects of the near-MCS environments.  This led to a peer-reviewed journal article.   In some cases the pre-convective environment evolved quite rapidly, especially when the primary source of instability was elevated.  Contrary to expectations, in other cases the nighttime boundary layer preserved a structure very reminiscent of what is observed during the afternoon (turbulently mixed) period. Most of the post-MCS soundings showed evidence of a surface cold pool, despite the nocturnal nature of the systems being sampled.  This finding suggests that many PECAN MCSs are not especially different from well-understood afternoon MCSs, a concept that proved to be very important in our subsequent numerical modeling studies.    We performed both idealized and realistic simulations of the most impressive MCSs from PECAN in order to isolate the key dynamical processes and mechanisms at work.  This led to 2 peer-reviewed journal articles.  All of the simulations produced at least modest surface cold pools, with stronger outflows occurring in environments with more instability. As these surface outflows emerged, the lifting of near-ground air occurred, causing each simulated nocturnal MCS to ultimately have the classical appearance of many afternoon squall lines. This pathway of evolution occurred both in fully realistic simulations and horizontally homogeneous idealized simulations.  As a group, the simulations imply that a wide range of nocturnal MCS behaviors may be self-organized (i.e., not reliant on larger-scale features external to the convection).  This information may be helpful to forecasters in assessing the higher potential for nocturnal MCSs to produce severe winds in environments that have previously been thought of as rather benign.
