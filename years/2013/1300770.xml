<AbstractNarration>M. Scott Shell of the University of California Santa Barbara is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models, and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division to develop broad-based multiscale algorithms for systematic coarse-graining.  The project is cofunded by the Interfacial Processes and Thermodynamics program in the Division of  Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET).  Major advances in theoretical ideas and numerical techniques are essential to enabling quantitative modeling of many large length and time scale problems. This work leverages a new theoretical concept called the relative entropy that quantifies the information lost during coarse-graining and that provides a general statistical mechanical approach to multiscale problems.  This PI is using this framework to create robust algorithms that offer new coarse-graining paradigms, including the ability to address high-complexity many-parameter models, multi-body interactions, transferability, and design of CG architectures.  These algorithms are being implemented into a freely-available, community-developed coarse-graining package.  Dr. Shell is also using this new generation of techniques to model and understand the early structures, thermodynamics, and molecular mechanisms governing the self-assembly of the diphenylalanine peptide into hollow nanotubes.  The project is being closely integrated with several educational activities targeting a range of students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atomic-resolution simulations of biological molecules, materials, and many other systems offer major insights into their behavior and useful predictions of their properties.  However, such approaches are severely limited by computational expense to the smallest and simplest of systems.  To extend modeling to more complicated cases, it has long been customary to pursue coarse-grained models that remove a fraction of atomic detail while greatly reducing the computational demands.  This strategy can be successful if one can identify, historically by trial-and-error or rational insight, the "right" way to coarse-grain.  Dr. Shell has introduced a new approach that automates this process in a physically insightful way, by quantifying and minimizing the information loss due to coarse-graining.  His group is developing powerful new and general algorithms that produce optimized and accurate coarse-grained models, enabling a new level of sophistication in simulating complex systems.  In particular, he is using these approaches to understand a recently discovered designer peptide that self-assembles into hollow nanotubes with a fast-growing list of applications in nanomaterials and energy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The general aim of this project has been to significantly extend the capabilities of molecular simulations through the development of a powerful "coarse-graining" platform.  Computer simulations at atomistic resolution have become indispensable tools for providing a nanoscale picture (often inaccessible to experiments) that informs our understanding of many complex systems, spanning biology to synthetic materials.  However, such simulations are starkly limited by computational capabilities, only able to tackle the smallest of systems and over very short time scales.  Even with tenfold computing improvements, the limitations will still be significant.  Our approach allows makes it possible to break this scale barrier by "coarse-graining" the molecular representation, using much fewer and faster-to-simulate "pseudoatoms" in place of entire groups of atoms.   Usually, such coarse-grained models lose some of their accuracy and predictive ability, owing to the significant simplifications that they make.  Work on this project has uncovered exciting new ways to accomplish coarse-graining without paying a major price in model accuracy, but while maintaining the speed and size of the advantages of coarse models.  This advance has been enabled by a theoretical framework developed in our group that measures the quality of coarse models by quantifying the information that they lose.  In turn, this approach provides a systematic strategy for refining and improving models of different designs, orienting towards the most accurate ones.  Intellectual merit.  We have use made several significant advances. (1) We developed and refined a robust numerical coarse-graining algorithm based on our theoretical framework that allows the development of highly complex coarse models, with even thousands of parameters.  (2) We have developed very accurate coarse models of peptides, which in turn allow us to understand many aspects of interesting emerging materials formed by the self-assembly of synthetic peptides.  (3) We used these coarse-grained peptide models to develop a new understanding for how attached polymers can be used to sensitively modulate the stability of surface-tethered peptides.  (4) In collaboration with a group at Penn State, we extended our theory to provide a rigorous understanding for the trade-offs that coarse-graining makes, and in particular for how information is lost as a function of resolution.  (5) We introduced a new paradigm for dramatically improving the utility and transferability of coarse models by including so-called "multibody" interactions.  We showed how this approach allows for a dramatic reduction in computational expense by removing the need to simulate the many water molecules surrounding a given biomolecule of interest.   (6)  We applied this same approach to enable coarse models to capture liquid-liquid phase equilibrium, one of the most challenging physical phenomena for such models to get right.  (7) Finally, we have developed coarse protein folding models with very high structural accuracy.  Broader impacts.  Multiscale techniques are pivotal to the next generation of modeling efforts.  This significance and impact of this work is a versatile new approach to coarse-graining that will ultimately enable the study of many previously challenging or even impossible problems.  Our work has been widely reported to the simulation community and many of its members have now used these ideas to advance their own modeling work.  A version of our coarse-graining algorithm has also been incorporated in an open software package.   On the educational front, the Shell group has mentored several undergraduates in the area of simulations, of which many have gone on to top graduate programs.  The group has also founded a campus-wide seminar series for graduate students in the areas of modern simulation advances.  PI Shell has also been very active in outreach and other educational activities at UCSB, regularly delivering workshops on science communication and participating in student-faculty mixers.  Prof. Shell is also active in department and campus administrative efforts, particularly those seeking to improve diversity and inclusion.  He sits the Graduate Division Dean?s Diversity Advisory Board and is involved in a number of ongoing related training workshops for faculty and students.
