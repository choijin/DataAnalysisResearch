<AbstractNarration>As power dissipation on a single-chip is increasing at an alarming rate due to massive integration of digital circuits, multicore design has become the only technique to scale performance. Multicores with tens to hundreds of cores are already available in the marketplace and future projections call for thousands of cores on the chip. To achieve scalable computing performance from the multicores, the communication between cores should also scale in bandwidth while significantly reducing the power consumption. Scaling the performance of the on-chip communication fabric, called the Network-on-Chip (NoC), has proven to be a significant challenge with traditional metallic interconnects due to fundamental signaling issues such as power dissipation, electromagnetic interference, crosstalk and reflections. Several studies and roadmaps have indicated that disruptive technology solutions such as photonics have the potential to alleviate the critical bandwidth, power and latency challenges of future multicores. This research seeks to exploit the unique advantages of photonic interconnects and 3D stacking technologies to develop scalable, energy-efficient, bandwidth-reconfigurable and reliable NoCs for future multicores. There are three goals of the proposed research: first, it will investigate and develop 3D stacked photonic NoC architectures and topologies that maximize performance and improve energy-efficiency; second, it will develop runtime reconfiguration techniques that can adapt the network to the communication needs of the application, thereby improving performance on a per-application basis; and third, it will result in an extensive modeling and simulation framework to be used for designing and validating future photonic NoC architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has far reaching broader impacts. This research is uniquely positioned to leverage two emerging technologies namely photonics and 3D stacking to meet the multicore challenge and will significantly benefit society. The proposed research is essential to continue the growth of computing performance that our society depends upon, and will result in digital devices ranging from smartphones to laptops with faster response time and improved reliability. By investigating the design of energy-efficient and high-bandwidth photonic-3D NoC architectures, this proposal describes a transformative and viable approach to combine technology, algorithm and applications' research to enable building scalable multicores. The cross-cutting nature of this research will foster new research directions in several areas, spanning technology/energy-aware NoC design, novel computer architectures, and cutting-edge modeling and simulations tools for emerging technologies. This research will also play a major role in education by integrating discovery with teaching and training. Several graduate students will be directly involved with all phases of the project from which the core parts of their dissertations and theses will be derived. It will also benefit a wider audience of graduate and undergraduate students by incorporating the new research into several courses on computer architecture and parallel processing taught by the PIs. Finally, the results and findings of the proposed research will be disseminated to researchers, engineers and educators through technical publications and presentations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>As on-chip power consumption becomes the most critical barrier, we need disruptive technology solution such as silicon photonics that can scale in capacity and reduce power footprint while delivering scalable bandwidth. Photonic interconnects can provide high interconnect bandwidth by combining multiple wavelengths, provide minimal access latencies, and high power-efficiency that remains independent of capacity and distance for on-chip communications. In this project, we have explored several aspects of utilizing photonics for NoCs. In R-3PO, we designed a 3D stacked photonic architecture where multiple layers enabled higher bandwidth density, simplified layout design, and reduced network power [1]. Unlike a global crossbar, we developed a decomposed crossbar architecture on multiple photonic layers with optical vias to prevent waveguide crossings and reduce power consumption. As multicores run diverse scientific and commercial applications, networks that can adapt to communication traffic will yield substantial performance gains while optimizing the resources such as wavelengths and waveguides. In R-3PO, we implement a reconfiguration algorithm that uses hardware counters to track link and buffer utilization to decide which links to reconfigure and adapt network bandwidths based on application demands. In PROBE, we tackle the static power consumption of external laser by predicting channel utilization and scaling the number of wavelengths and waveguides [2]. In PULSE, we extend the performance and reduce power consumed in shared-memory multicores that use snoopy-based cache coherence protocols by multicasting transactions to select cores that cache the block instead of broadcasting to all nodes [3]. In CLAPNET, we propose clockwise and counter-clockwise communication to reduce the laser power loss due to requests and responses traveling different path lengths [4]. The CLAP-NET design leverages shared waveguides to enable dynamic bandwidth allocation for improved network throughput, and a decomposed crossbar with reduced optical insertion losses and power consumption. In Laser Pooling, we propose sharing available laser power between all links of the network, such that laser power may be released from idle links and claimed by another link both statically and dynamically [5]. We refer to this as <em>pooling </em>laser power between the links of the network to maximize energy savings with marginal performance impact. To reduce the static power, in PEARL, we propose a dynamic laser scaling technique that predicts the power level for the next epoch using the buffer occupancy of previous epoch using machine learning techniques [6]. In terms of broader impact, this project has provided training to graduate and undergraduate students in modeling and simulation of NoC architectures and has resulted in 5 MS theses and 2 PhD dissertations. Further, the results of the project have been widely disseminated with journals and conference/workshop presentations.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>References:</p> <ol> <li>Randy Morris, Avinash Kodi, Ahmed Louri and Ralph Whaley, ?3D Stacked Nanophotonic Architecture with Minimal Reconfiguration,?
