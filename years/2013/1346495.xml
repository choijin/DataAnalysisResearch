<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable development of pulsed laser micro polishing equipment and the software needed to use and control the equipment. To obtain a desired level of polishing (a mirror finish for example), many decisions must be made such as the path of the polishing laser over a surface to be polished, the speed with which the laser beam moves, the diameter of the laser beam, and the laser power setting. These decisions are physically related in complex ways, and careful equipment design and software development is needed to produce a cost-effective laser micro polishing machine. In this project, models will be created and experimentally validated that predict surface roughness after pulsed laser micro polishing has been performed. The models also will recommend the laser path, beam diameter, etc. that will produce the desired results based on the original surface and the desired surface. The software models will be integrated with a cost-effective laser micro polishing equipment design that can be applied to a variety of customer-specific polishing applications and to stand-alone laser polishing systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable commercial automated polishing of manufactured metallic parts. This is a challenge because the surfaces of these parts can be relatively rough, which can negatively affect part shape, cause friction between contacting surfaces in devices, make appearance unacceptable, etc. Unlike traditional polishing methods (chemical etch, abrasive slurry, electro polishing, etc.), pulsed laser micro polishing is a method by which the rough surfaces on precisely selected areas on parts can be quickly polished using automated equipment. Laser polishing can be over 10 times faster than manual polishing, and surfaces can be polished without changing shape, creating hazardous waste, or leaving chemical residues. For example, titanium and stainless steel components are common in medical devices, and these components cannot be chemically contaminated. Polishing a mirror finish on molds for advanced lighting devices without changing their shape can lead to significant increases in efficiency of household lighting. Thousands of smaller mold makers in the United States seek lower costs and replacement of manual polishing with automated polishing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF STTR Phase I Project Outcomes: Pulsed Laser Polishing  LasX Industries, Inc., in close collaboration with the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advanced our new Pulsed Laser Polishing manufacturing process in 2014 through funding received in part from the National Science Foundation.  Pulsed Laser Polishing uses a laser programed with patent-applied methods to automatically polish metal surfaces in machined parts like plastic injection molds.  Polishing of molds is currently done by slow manual methods or by undesirable chemical etching.  Research completed in 2014 brought LasX closer to building the first commercial Pulsed Laser Polishing System designed and manufactured in the United States.     Pulsed Laser Polishing is an enabling technology for manufacturing precise parts like injection molds at higher production rates and lower cost.  Our process polishes 10 times faster than manual methods, precisely polishes selective areas, and polishes without touching the metal surface.  In addition, Pulsed Laser Polishing polishes without wasting any material or producing hazardous waste.  A computer model was developed to predict the surface roughness resulting from Pulsed Laser Polishing.  The predictions of the average surface roughness for tool steel materials used in molds were within 10% of experimental observations.  We also demonstrated that the model can be used to predict the surface roughness from multi-pass polishing: where the laser spot passes over an area multiple times but uses different laser settings for each pass. Multi-pass polishing achieves smoother surfaces when compared to a single laser pass.  In addition, we determined Pulsed Laser Polishing can produce very hard surfaces due to micro-melting of the tool steelÆs surface and the rapid cooling that follows each laser pulse (millions of degrees per second).  A hardened surface can extend the life of a plastic injection mold.     Commercial development of Pulsed Laser Polishing in 2014 included the initial design of a three-dimensional (3D) Pulsed Laser Polishing machine, construction of a testbed based on these design criteria, identification of the cost of Pulsed Laser Polishing, and continued development of 3D control software.  Our objective is to continue development in Phase II by constructing and demonstrating our first Pulsed Laser Polishing System by end of 2016.      Two primary markets for our Pulsed Laser Polishing System are micro-molds and 3D printing.  Micro-molds are used in molding small plastic parts (&lt; 0.25") for medical, electronic, and optical devices.  Our System can easily polish these very intricate molds where a manual process is almost impossible.  3D printing is rapidly gaining acceptance for producing unique or one of a kind parts needed for medical devices and prototyping.  Costs for 3D printing have dramatically dropped and the equipment is relatively easy to use.  However, the surfaces of parts produced by 3D printing are rough and require hand finishing.  Our System will automate this step by polishing parts immediately after 3D printing.          Last Modified: 02/25/2015       Submitted by: William R Dinauer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
