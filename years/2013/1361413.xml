<AbstractNarration>Professor Alexander Boldyrev of Utah State University is funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) Program for research to develop new theoretical tools to rationalize bonding, structure, stability, and reactivity of novel and unusual chemical species. The newly developed Adaptive Natural Density Partitioning (AdNDP) and Solid State Adaptive Natural Density Partitioning (SSAdNDP) methods for solids, biomolecules and reaction intermediates will advance the ability to decipher chemical bonding in clusters, nanoparticles, solids, biomolecules, catalysts, as well as to study mechanisms of chemical reactions. The results obtained in these studies can have significant potential for future advancement of nanotechnology, catalysis, material science and biotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is assessing the potential of the AdNDP  and SSAdNDP methods for interpreting a general electronic wavefunction of molecules, clusters, condensed phase materials and their surfaces, clusters on the surfaces of solids, molecules adsorbed on clusters on the surfaces, and interfaces of two solids. First, a software program capable of finding global minimum and other low-lying isomers of main group and transition metal clusters on the surface of solids is being developed. The way gas phase clusters are altered upon binding to surfaces also is being addressed. Second, these methods are being applied to investigate  the 2D-3D transition in negatively charged pure and doped boron clusters and the electronic spectra of boron clusters. Third, the SSAdNDP software is being used to elucidate the  chemical bonding in solid-state phosphide compounds. The broader impacts involve the incorporation of these methods into teaching computational and quantum chemistry to undergraduate and graduate students, as well as to high school students during the annual Utah State University High School Summer Internship. Teaching the methods is beneficial to students as it is the only tool capable of rendering a complete chemical bonding picture for molecules featuring both localized and delocalized bonding.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A chemical bond is a key concept in chemistry. It has a long history, but the major contribution was done by the American chemist Gilbert Lewis, who proposed that when two electrons coupled together, when lying between two atomic centers, and held jointly in the shells of the two atoms, should be the considered as a&nbsp;chemical bond. Based on this concept chemist developed so called Lewis structures, which are diagrams that show the bonding between atoms of a molecule and the lone pairs of electrons that may exist in the molecule. An example of a Lewis structure for water molecule is shown in Figure 1. A water molecule has 10 electrons (8 come from oxygen and two come from two hydrogen atoms).&nbsp;&nbsp;That allows forming 4 valence electron pairs and one core electron pair, which does not participate in chemical bonding. As one can see from Figure 1, we have two two-center two-electron (2c-2e) O-H bonds and two lone pairs of electron located at oxygen atom. That is how chemists view chemical bonding in a water molecule.&nbsp;</p> <p>Things, however, could be more complicated in molecules where a single Lewis structure failed to explain chemical bonding. For example, in the Al<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>molecule, chemical bonding cannot be described using only classical 2c-2e bonds. In this case we need to use tri-center two-electron (3c-2e) bonds for describing chemical bonding inside of the Al<sub>4</sub>cluster (Figure 2) in addition to four classical 2c-2e Al-H bonds and four aluminum lone pairs. In order do describe chemical bonding in molecules and clusters with multi-center bonds we developed a theoretical method and computer program named Adaptive Natural Density Partitioning (AdNDP) method/program and for solids and low-dimensional materials we developed a theoretical method and computer program named Solid State Adaptive Natural Partitioning (SSAdNDP) method/program.&nbsp;</p> <p>Why we need to understand chemical bonding in molecules, clusters, solids, surfaces, interfaces, and nanomaterials? We will discuss here only one example from the current proposal. Based on our understanding of chemical bonding in the Al<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>molecules, we proposed an existence of a new form of solid aluminum &ndash; supertetrahedral aluminum STAl (Figure 3). We started with the diamond crystal lattice and substituted every carbon atom by the tetrahedral Al<sub>4</sub>cluster, which we found is a global minimum structure for the Al<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4&nbsp;</sub>stoichiometry. We expected that chemical bonding in this building block of STAl would be the same as in the Al<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>molecule (four 3c-2e bonds). Then, we assumed that Al<sub>4</sub>clusters inside of the STAl would be connected to each other through 2c-2e Al-Al bonds. After that we run solid-state quantum chemical calculations and proved that our new aluminum allotrope is indeed a metastable form of aluminum (Figure 4). One of the most remarkable properties of this new form of aluminum is that it is an ultra-light. Its density is only 0.67 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. That is significantly smaller that the density of ordinary aluminum metal 3.82 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. Moreover, it is even smaller than the density of water 0.997 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. It means that if experimentally made such aluminum will float in water. We expect that this new material may have many applications in industry, from beer making to air force. That is why it is important to understand chemical bonding in molecules, cluster, nanoparticles, and solids. We can use chemical bonding as a tool for designing new materials with novel unexpected properties.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/26/2018<br>      Modified by: Alexander&nbsp;I&nbsp;Boldyrev</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1361413/1361413_10322080_1535270659237_Al4H4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1361413/1361413_10322080_1535270659237_Al4H4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Chemical bonding in Al4H4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1361413/1361413_10322080_1535270659237_Al4H4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Chemical bonding in Al4H4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2.
