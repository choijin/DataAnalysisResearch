<AbstractNarration>A new and fruitful line of research has developed over the last decade, which has shown that tropical rainfall is sensitive to influences even far away from the tropics. Even heating anomalies in high latitudes spread equatorward with ease via changes in extratropical eddy energy transports. In the tropics, an anomalous Hadley circulation develops in response to heating, fluxing heat out of the hemisphere that is warmed more in its upper branch, but moisture into the warmed hemisphere by the circulation in its lower branch. Recent results undertaken by the research group has used a new attribution procedure based on the idea of extratropical influence on tropical precipitation to uncover a surprising potential primary cause of the double intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) problem, to develop a new theory for why the ITCZ is in the Northern Hemisphere and to discover and attribute a late 20th century southward shift in precipitation in part due to aerosol forcing. In this project, this line of work will be extended to study several more important issues involving local and remote influences on the ITCZ. First, precipitation in the Indian Ocean is unique in that it peaks south of the equator. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climate models will be used to test whether this is due to local ocean heat transport, continental interactions over the seasonal cycle, or other factors. Second, the effect of absorbing aerosols on ITCZ shifts will be studied in a series of idealized model experiments. Finally,  the impact of tropical radiation anomalies on ITCZ shifts induced from the tropics and extratropics will be examined, via simulations that fix clouds and water vapor impacts on radiation in the tropics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Tropical rainfall is vital for the livelihood of hundreds of millions of people.  However it remains one of the most difficult aspects of the climate system to predict.  This is in part due to the fact that the precipitation in the tropics is affected not only by local climate processes, but also climate changes across the rest of the globe.  In this project, we studied factors that affect tropical rainfall, including mountain ranges, ocean heat transport, continental land masses of varying size, and surface vegetation type.    The work was performed in climate models of varying complexity, including simplified models with processes added one at a time, to comprehensive models which are used for decadal climate projections.  Our results often pointed to cloud feedbacks as an important determinant of shifts in tropical rainfall.  Several studies were performed using fully coupled atmosphere-ocean models, which allowed us to study the importance of ocean circulation in modulating tropical precipitation responses.   This project helped to support graduate and undergraduate research assistants, and resulted in Ph.D. and M.S. degrees conferred to student participants.  We shared our results through scientific publications and frequent presentations to scientific audiences and the general public.  We created educational videos for the public on atmospheric science topics that were posted to the UWAtmosOutreach YouTube channel.
