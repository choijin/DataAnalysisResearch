<AbstractNarration>The City of Chicago will embark on an innovative summer of learning (CSOL) in the summer of 2013, initiated by the Mayor?s office.  CSOL engages a variety of youth serving oroganizations across the city in both self-paced and face-to-face STEM learning activites enabling students to earn STEM badges.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID project creates an approach for tracking STEM program participation among young people by using youth's badging and online participation histories. While there is considerable interest and enthusiasm around the idea of STEM badges, there is actually a relatively thin set of evaluation/research findings around badges.  This project can begin to fill in a piece of that gap by providing information on youth?s participation in CSOL, the degree to which social media plays a role, and a small follow-up study around youth's continued interest and engagement in the beginning of the school year. The team will use the data to look at patterns for student engagement that can lead to profiles of participation by different types of students along with patterns of behavior. All data will be made publicly available and will enable researchers to engage in inquiry about the impact of STEM informal learning participation on longer-term STEM outcomes. The evaluation study can lead to a useful research and evaluation infrastructure that can build knowledge about the impact of summer learning on youth's interest and engagement in STEM.</AbstractNarration>

Accomplishments    Meetings and organization   The research team holds weekly project meetings that include logistics, updating progress, presenting recent analysis, and time for collaborative work. Established shared spaces for online collaboration (Dropbox and Evernote). We have made connections with project consultants, including Professor Brigid Barron (Stanford University School of Education, http://youthlab.stanford.edu) and research groups doing related groups in other settings (e.g. New York University Hive Research Lab, http://hiveresearchlab.org/)  Development of research methodology    To answer the research questions we developed new measures (quantitative (e.g. youth surveys of STEAM interest and in and out of school learning networks) and qualitative (e.g. mentor reflection interviews) and methodologies for implementation and analysis, including:  Participation analysis. CSOL participation patterns online, including social network analysis, evidence of progress and persistence, and profiles of online behaviors. Pre-post analysis: STEAM learning attitudes and access to learning opportunities before and after participation in CSOL. Comparison study: Differences of STEAM learning attitudes and access to learning opportunities between youth who did and did not participate in CSOL. Comparison study: Looking at similarities and differences of participation and learning networks among the different CSOL face-to-face programs and also for those youth who participated but were not involved in any program.   Data collection    Remix participation data from 260 youth. Remix use data from youth (N=260), adult mentors (N=36), and other adult participants (researchers, administrators, N=13) from June-August 2013. Pre-summer survey data (N=219 students X participated in CSOL); post summer data (N= 45 students, all CSOL participants); and fall 2013 data (N=82, 22 participated in a face-to-face program, 22 participated on their own online, and 39 did not participate at all).
