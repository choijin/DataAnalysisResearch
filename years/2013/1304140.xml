<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2013 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The subject matter of the project for this fellowship to Yaim Cooper lies in the area of algebraic geometry. The host institution for the fellowship is Harvard University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Shing-Tung Yau.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The central goal of this project was to better understand the enumerative geometry of surfaces.  We considered both classical enumerative questions, as well as more modern virtual counts of complex curves in complex surfaces.    We were able to extend previous work on curve counting for the surface P1 X P1 to a larger class of surfaces, Hirzebruch surfaces.  We showed a way to compute both enumerative counts and Gromov-Witten invariants of Hirzebruch surfaces using operators in a Heisenberg algebra.  In doing so, we were also able to unify several disparate earlier results in one framework.    The research conducted under this project provides a powerful new technique for computing Gromov-Witten invariants of Hirzebruch and other surfaces.  This will likely have three effects on the field.  First, this technique can be extended to other surfaces.  For example in "Fock spaces and refined Severi degrees", the authors use similar ideas to treat toric varieties.  Secondly, this provides a better conceptual understanding of earlier results such as "Counting plane curves of any genus", "Counting curves on rational surfaces", and "The formula 12 = 10 + 2 x 1 and its generalizations".  These previously disparate results can be viewed in a unified way within the framework of this research.  Thirdly, this research builds a bridge to representation theory, and going forward we hope to apply techniques from representation theory to the Gromov-Witten theory of surfaces.
