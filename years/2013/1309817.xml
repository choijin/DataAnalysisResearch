<AbstractNarration>Professor Tianquan (Tim) Lian of Emory University is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop a new technique for imaging charge transfer interactions in nanomaterials using integrated atomic force (AFM) and single molecule (particle) fluorescence spectroscopy. By attaching electron donors or acceptors on AFM tips, the spatial arrangement and interaction between the donor and acceptors can be controlled by AFM, while their charge transfer interaction and dynamics can be followed simultaneously using single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy. Therefore, this research is expected to offer a new and general approach for studying charge transfer interaction and dynamics in many donor-acceptor complexes, which is particularly important for nanomaterials because of the heterogeneous distributions of sizes, shapes and interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study will lead to a better understanding of charge transfer processes from nanostructures (quantum dots and quantum rod) and provide guidance for the improvement of these materials and their applications in solar energy conversion technology. In addition to the training of postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduate students, the proposed research also offers the opportunity to broaden the participation of under-represented minority students through research collaborations with faculty in the Atlanta University Center, undergraduate research programs co-sponsored by the Emory Center of Science Education, and the Georgia Intern-Fellowships for Teachers (GIFT) program.</AbstractNarration>
