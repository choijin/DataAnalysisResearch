<AbstractNarration>Places of worship are among the most prevalent and visible institutions in communities across the United States. This visibility, though, means that churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, and other religious congregations are often targets for street crime and ethnic- or even religiously-motivated hate crime. Indeed, it is easy to find hundreds of news reports each year about a religious congregation being victimized by vandalism, theft, arson, or some other crime. Yet, the victimization of religious congregations has received little attention by social scientists. Our research will contribute to the testing and extension of theories of crime and its relationship to community contexts, as well as theories of ethnic conflict and religious persecution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will gather nationally representative survey data on the prevalence, pattern, and predictors of victimization of religious congregations along with in-depth interview data with congregational leaders and their experiences with crime. We will compare and contrast the factors that predict street crime victimization with those that predict religiously-motivated hate crime victimization. These data will not only allow social scientists to test theories of crime, ethnic conflict, and religious persecution, but they will also provide the foundation for law enforcement, community, and congregational leaders to prevent and respond to the victimization of places of worship.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We achievd three integrated data collection goals for our project.  First, we collected semi-structured interviews with 52 congregation leaders in five neighborhoods within Minneapolis, MN.  Second, we conducted a survey of a stratified random sample of religious congregations, gathering 1,385 responses, to assess: a) the frequency and nature of victimization for different types of crime, b) congregational characteristics, and c) perceptions of contextual factors, victimization risk, and fear of crime.  Third, we geo-coded contextual data on the surrounding environments of the congregations, particularly census data and crime data.   Major findings from our study are as follows:  In our survey, roughly 62% of Christian, 56% of Jewish, and 60% of "Other" congregations reported experiencing no criminal incidents in the previous 12 months. However, notable percentages of the congregations reported certain types of property crimes, such as thefts and vandalism. Congregations reported an average of nearly one criminal incident over the prior year. Exterior vandalism was the most common crime experienced, with 19% of respondents reporting such an incident in the past year.    Roughly 3.5% of the Christian and Jewish congregations reported at least one serious violent crime occurring on their property, while 3.7% of "Other" congregations experienced such crimes. Jewish and Muslim congregations appear to be particularly likely to report violence or threats of violent acts (14.2% of Jewish congregations reported such incidents, and 38% of Muslim congregations).  Most congregations take at least some security measures against criminal activity. Nearly a quarter of Christian and "Other" congregations, and a substantial majority (about 64%) of Jewish congregations said they had obtained a professional security assessment of their properties from the police or a private company. Nearly three quarters of Jewish, and over a third of Christian and "Other" congregations reported taking four or more specific security measures the survey asked about.    From the interview data, we utilized the fifty-two interviews with places of worship representing a variety of religious traditions, to examine how congregations balance crime concerns with their organizational mission and identity. These interviews showed that congregations are aware that their goal of being an open and welcoming member of the community also brings with it vulnerabilities. Some congregations accept this while others mitigate it through security measures that also take into account the sacred social reality that is trying to be created and maintained. The dilemma faced by religious congregation regarding security has parallels with other social situations and organizations, such security in international humanitarian missions.  Multivariate analyses showed that religious tradition clearly was connected to congregations experiencing violent incidents, specifically, threats of violence.  These predominantly affect Jewish and especially Muslim congregations.  By contrast, overall and property crime was predominantly affected by criminal opportunity/routine activities factors; congregation affluence, access to items, and the types of activities hosted by congregations.  Congregations located in areas of high disadvantage (poverty, unemployment, low education) were at greater risk of overall and especially property crime.  The findings suggest that victimization of congregations differs substantially depending on the type of crime.  Bias related crime was strongly related to particular religious traditions--threats of violence were directed predominantly toward Muslim and Jewish congregations.  Religious tradition was largely irrelevant to property crime.   In addition, 37% of Jewish congregations that experienced a violent incident or threat reported it to be religiously biased, and 14% reported it to be ethnically biased, and 17% of Muslim congregations that experienced a violent incident or threat reported that incident to be religiously or racially/ethnically biased.  Thus, not only do Jewish and Muslim congregations report experiencing violent incidents more often, but these congregations perceive those violent incidents to be religiously or racially/ethnically biased a greater rates than the other religious traditions.      The survey we conducted will be useful in future research efforts by others who may replicate and extend our study.  Our survey and methodology may be a useful exemplar of surveying churches and congregational crime victimization experiences and congregations' responses to them. Our findings will contribute to theoretical and empirical knowledge about crime victimization (including bias crimes) occuring at religious congregations, and their security, and will hopefully be useful in preventing such crimes.  Our dataset will be shared with other researchers and scholars on the Association of Religious Data Archives, an international data archive of religion data.
