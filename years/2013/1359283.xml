<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to University of Missouri (MU) located Columbia, MO, will support the training of 12 students for 9 weeks during the summers of 2014- 2016. MU is the largest institution of higher learning in Missouri and the flagship campus of the University of Missouri System. The program offers a wide range of very exciting interdisciplinary projects in neuroscience, with both wet-lab and computational components. The projects are drawn from all levels in neuroscience (i.e., intracellular/cellular, systems and behavioral levels), with participating faculty coming from the colleges of arts &amp; science, engineering, and veterinary medicine. Students will attend a weekly class on computational neuroscience, conduct lab research, and participate in various seminars and professional development workshops on topics such as responsible conduct in research, communication skills, career opportunities in industry and academia, and the graduate school application process. Each student will have the opportunity to write reports, give presentations and design and present a scientific poster. They will also be part of a group of 100+ undergraduate researchers from all over U.S. who participate each summer in a vibrant summer research program (http://undergradresearch.missouri.edu/). All participants will be recruited from outside MU, and selection will be based on academic record, research performance, and potential for research in neuroscience. Participant support during the REU experience will include a stipend, lodging, food, travel to and from the university, and funding for the research project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diversity strengthens the experience for all students. Therefore, the program will emphasize recruitment from institutions without advanced research programs, and from historically black and traditional women's colleges. The team will follow-up with students to determine their continued interest in the chosen academic area and their career paths. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of a BIO/REU common assessment tool. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://engineering.missouri.edu/neuroreu/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Satish S. Nair at nairs@missouri.edu) or co-PI (Dr. David J. Schulz at schulzd@missouri.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our REU program included a strong interdisciplinary team of faculty mentors with expertise at all levels in the growing field of neuroscience (intracellular/ cellular, systems and behavioral levels).  The specific objectives of our NSF REU Site on Neuroscience were to:  Introduce undergraduate students to the basics of the research process; Demonstrate the importance of interaction (teamwork) and the value of different disciplines in collaborative research in neurosciences; Introduce students to the intensity of specialized independent research without losing sight of how their work fits into the larger goals that brought such a diverse group of faculty together; Foster students? creativity and provide satisfaction from seeing successful results; Develop outstanding candidates with research experience for graduate programs; and Provide valuable experience in technical writing and oral presentations.   The key outcomes of the 3-year project were as follows:  (i)      all 12 students/year enrolled over the three years were from outside MU, based on an average of 173 applicants each year to the area which is perceived as being difficult due to the need for a background of math and biology;  (ii)    over the three years, the 36 students were from 24 different states in US, and from seven different departments, spanning multiple colleges: Biology (11), Physiology (1), Neuroscience (5), Biochemistry (3), Chemistry (1), Psychology (5), Bioengineering (5), Computer Science (1), Electrical Engineering (1), Chemical Engineering (1), Mathematics (1) and Physics (1).  (iii)   the representation over the three years was as follows: Women = 61% (22 total; 7 African Amer; 9 Hispanic; 6 White Caucasian);  Men = 39% (14 total; 3 African American, 3 Hispanic, 6 White Caucasian + 2 Not Indicated); So, under-represented minorities were 22/36 or 61% of the total.  (iv)  Considering all 36 students over 3 years, their average GPA was a high 3.68/4. A total of 21/36 of the students, or 58%, were from non-PhD granting institutions.  (v)    To date, the REU site program has resulted in 6 refereed journal publications (+ the REU students had 10 others on other work), and 9 national/international conference papers/posters.  (vi)  Of the 36 REU participants over 3 years, to date, a total of 15 (42%) have transitioned to PhD Programs including in prestigious universities such as CalTech, Princeton University, University of Cambridge, UC-San Diego, University of Pennsylvania, University of Florida, Northwestern University, and Georgia Tech. Of these, 3 were awarded the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, and 1 each had US Army Fellowship, NIH IRTA award, Fullbright research Fellow and Cambridge international scholarship. Those who went on to PhD included 5 African American and 4 Hispanic students, i.e., 25%, to universities including University of Cambridge (on Fellowship), Princeton University, U Penn, U Florida, Northwestern University, Georgia Tech, and Syracuse University.  (vii)    The program was unique in the fact that neuroscience covers several levels of inquiry from genetic to molecular, cellular, systems, behavioral and clinical levels. So, the students and mentors came from multiple departments (over 10) spread over several colleges. For the students, this provides a unique interdisciplinary training ground to learn about the advances in the problem- and data- rich and growing area of neuroscience. We kept emphasizing this in the 1-credit course, as well as joint research presentations. Such an interdisciplinary-training is very beneficial for them at this early stage of their careers.  (viii)  This project has also positively impacted other efforts in the area on our own campus: (a) Our faculty from over 10 departments are encouraging their undergraduates to take advantage of the new Interdisciplinary undergraduate minor in computational neuroscience between the Colleges of Arts &amp; Science and Engineering, founded by PI Nair and Co-PI Schulz in 2012. (b) the investigators also received additional funding from NSF (2015-17; DUE-1432645) to disseminate the computational modules to teach neuroscience to undergraduate faculty from 2- and 4-year institutions, and from the NIH R25 program (2015-18; MH109122) to provide research training in computational neuroscience to PhDs, post-docs and faculty from research universities.
