<AbstractNarration>1337808&lt;br/&gt;Morton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central aim of this proposal is the acquisition of analytical equipment that will allow for the rapid establishment of a Sustainable Engineering Research Laboratory located in the Department of Engineering at James Madison University (JMU). The specific instrument requested, an advanced high performance liquid chromatography system, has been selected based on the potential for greatest and most immediate impact on existing as well as pending research. JMU is a primarily undergraduate institution with an institutional goal of fostering outstanding undergraduate research. This proposal will significantly advance this set of goals while providing the initial investment in the longer goal of developing a research laboratory to develop undergraduate researchers focused on solving the pair challenges of energy availability and water quality, which is at the root of the challenge to the global societal sustainability. While initially, faculty and undergraduate students based out of the Department of Engineering will most benefit and utilize the instrument requested in this proposal, faculty and students from other disciplines, such as Chemistry, Biochemistry, Integrated Science and Technology, and Geology and Environmental Science, will also utilize this instrument.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The proposal "MRI: Acquisition of a High Performance Liquid Chromatograph for the Establishment of a Sustainable Engineering Research Laboratory" requested funding to support the purchase and installation of a high performance liquid chromatography system in the Department of Engineering at James Madison University (JMU).  The instrument was requested to support the expansions of sustainable engineering related research of a number of faculty in this program.  The primary function was to provide a robust, accurate, and flexible analytical system for studying environmental, chemical, and biochemical problems involving.  The major focus of these efforts has been in support of the PIs research into a set of alternative extraction solvents known as room temperature ionic liquids.  The flexibility of the instrument has led to its inclusion in a number of newly developing research and educational effort at JMU the two most significant of these are in the area of brewery system analysis and the chemical characterization of regionally produced industrial hemp.  The instrumental package has been installed and is fully operational and available for local research activities.   To date, a number of students, four engineering undergraduate research assistants, one chemistry undergraduate research assistant, and one high school research scholar, have been involved in research employing the instrument.  It is expected that utilization of this instrument will accelerate rapidly in the immediate time following the completion of the engineering buildings multi-year renovations in the spring of 2018.  This new instrument significantly improves the research and educational capabilities related to the study of sustainability and environmental challenges as well as providing a foundational analytical instrument for the developing Brewery Systems &amp; Engineering program here at JMU.
