<AbstractNarration>Researchers have developed a prototype CO2 insufflator that when used during a colonoscopy reduces the discomfort caused by the procedure. The technology developed through this project could provide a disposable CO2 insufflator that uses an effervescent reaction to generate CO2 and is compatible with standard flexible endoscopes. Effervescent chemical reactions are one of the few physical phenomena capable of safely generating biocompatible gases in a rapid manner. This ability enables the development of this technology for providing surgical insufflation through small, light-weight and disposable devices that can be used safely in standard clinical settings, remote locations and frontline triage units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently used CO2 insufflators are large, complex and not widely used due to the high costs associated with the equipment. Development of a small, disposable CO2 insufflator could increase regular use of CO2 insufflators during colonoscopy procedures, which in turn would reduce the discomfort experienced by the patient during the procedure. This technology could enable a new class of insufflators which can be used in a wide range of minimally invasive procedures.</AbstractNarration>
