<AbstractNarration>The main goal of this collaborative research project is to develop behaviorally enhanced mathematical models grounded in queuing theory that allow predicting human behavior in customer service environments. These models will be evaluated and tested through laboratory and field experiments. Managing congestion (waiting lines) is of primary concern for most organizations providing some sort of service to customers. Customers are typically annoyed by long waiting times and therefore tend not to join long queues. Recent empirical and experimental studies provide new evidence that, in service environments in which the service value is uncertain, long queues may impact the value perception in a positive way. As a consequence, long queues may actually attract more customers and these customers may spend more when they see that the queue behind them is longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research, if successful, will develop a set of principles that guides service organizations to better understand and utilize this phenomenon. Applications can be found in service settings (e.g. waiting in a restaurant), as well as in health care settings (e.g. waiting for elective surgery) in which the quality of the outcome is somewhat uncertain. We expect to improve the quality of service (benefiting customers) and profit of service systems (benefiting organizations or businesses). Furthermore, the results of the research are expected to strengthen the field of behavioral queueing models: (i) by developing a set of advanced mathematical models of queues with parameters corresponding to human biases and behavior, (ii) by creating a series of lab and field experiments that captures the essence of human behavior in service environment with uncertainty in service quality, and (iii) by establishing an online queueing simulator and data base for designing behavioral queueing experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ When making choices, customers are influenced by other customers? choices.  We studied two environments in which this is relevant.   In a first environment, some customers are informed about the quality of different options, while other customers are not.  The uninformed customers then learn about the quality of the different options from the choices made by the informed customers.  For example, when selecting a restaurant, tourists will be attracted to the restaurant with the longer queue because the longer queue might indicate that informed customers have selected this restaurant because of its high quality.  With a limited choice set (join the queue or not), we confirm that the perceived quality by uninformed rational customers increases in the observed queue length.  In the laboratory, we also confirm that human subjects infer correctly that longer queues are more likely occur for high-quality services. However, we found that they might over-infer bad quality from short queues, yielding the `empty-restaurant-syndrome?: as the empty restaurant is associated with bad quality, no-one joins and hence, the restaurant remains empty, even though its quality can be high.  With a large choice set, which typically arises in large online market places for products (or services), the situation is different:  We studied how historical sales information about many options influences customer choice in such environments.  We found that when there are few informed customers in the market, uninformed rational customers should select an option with some sales, but, not a lot (`minority options?), as the few sales might be made by the few informed customers who bucked the sales trend caused by the majority of uninformed customers.  However, in the laboratory we find that human subjects are not good in recognizing value in the minority options.  Instead, they attributed minority sales to erroneous decisions of uninformed customers, rather than correct decisions of informed customers. This greatly diminishes the value of the minority options.  Our observations of real human choice behavior with limited or broad choice sets allow us understanding better observational learning in the real world.   In a second environment, customers have to wait to get access to a resource because other customers arrived earlier and/or are more urgent.  For example, excessive wait-times are common reasons for low patient satisfaction in Emergency Departments (ED) in hospitals nation-wide.  We conducted a field experiment in the ED of a large urban hospital for which we measured the improvement of patient satisfaction when patients are given an estimate of their wait time.  For that purpose, using predictive analytics and two years hospital data, an institution speci?c application was developed.  We observed that providing patients with their estimated wait-times improves their self-reported satisfaction signi?cantly.  We also observed that the increase in satisfaction of patients who wait less than predicted is lower than the decrease in satisfaction of patients who wait more than predicted.  We developed a method to optimize the wait time prediction, taking into account such observed behavior.                  Last Modified: 06/14/2018       Submitted by: Margaret Meloy]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
