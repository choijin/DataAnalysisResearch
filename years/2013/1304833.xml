<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project by Mesa Community College and Northern Arizona University is developing career and educational pathways in geospatial technology (GST) from secondary schools through two-year colleges and universities. Components include a) course and curriculum development that integrates GST and project-based learning as components of a broad range of courses within colleges and secondary schools, b) sustained professional development and support for college faculty and secondary teachers to implement the curriculum, and c) increasing awareness of and training for GST-related careers through internships, outreach and industry involvement. The curriculum is aligned with the Geospatial Technology Competency Model and informed by industry representation on the project's advisory board. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its comprehensive approach to infusing geospatial technology and data-processing and analytical skills within a pathway model aligned with workforce needs. Broader impacts include building technological and instructor capacity in GST within both urban and rural schools across the state, engagement of students from groups traditionally underrepresented in GST careers, and contributing to the development of the future GST workforce in Arizona.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Rapid adoption of geospatial technologies (GST) by government and industry makes GSTs among the top high growth industries identified by the U.S. Department of Labor. Employers in Arizona who use GST identify a deficit in key critical thinking, STEM and GST skill sets among potential and current employees. GEOCACHE has worked to resolve these deficits by providing high school and college educators opportunities to learn about GST, careers that use these enabling technologies, and how to enhance physical and natural sciences courses with project based instruction and GST. The overall program goal was to create a diverse workforce effective in careers that employ spatial tools and skills to visualize, analyze, and communicate with/about spatial data.</p> <p>The project offered basic and advanced faculty development workshops to high school, two-year, and four-year college faculty. Webinars, YouTube videos, monthly email correspondence, and on-site support supplemented the workshops. Thirty-six educators participated in 35-hour Beginning Institutes and 28 educators participated in an additional 35-hours of Advanced Institutes with a focus on teaching with GIS.</p> <p>Intellectual Merit: Program demonstrated that workshops were successful for educator and student learning. Most educators increased their GST skills. Twenty-one advanced participants (75%) implemented lessons across Arizona, many in rural, low income and diverse learning environments. Many of the lessons were aligned with state standards in the relevant content area or field, and provided opportunity for high level applied skill development, using real world spatial datasets to make claims about a topic or question. Examples of lessons included identifying the environmental footprint of the college campus, and mapping the biodiversity of local environments. One class documented health problems associated with food deserts, and mapped possible locations for campus gardens, fresh food pantries, and community gardens in low-income food deserts.</p> <p>Over 1000 high school, community college and university students had opportunities to experience GST in lessons and increased opportunities to practice 21st century skills (creativity, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking). After participating in lessons, college students significantly increased their awareness of GST careers, their capability of using maps and spatial datasets to analyze data, and their ability to make a claim based on spatial data, demonstrating the potential for GST-integrated, project-based lessons to improve student outcomes. Similar outcomes for high-school students were less successful, likely due to shorter time available for project participation times for project participation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To achieve broader impacts, GEOCACHE created additional sustaining mechanisms to support current and future educators&rsquo; abilities to integrate GST into the classroom as an instructional toolset. This involved building leadership capacity through support for presenting at and attending GIS education conferences and teaching workshops. GEOCACHE partnered with the Arizona Geographic Alliance to offer three-day residential summer geospatial education workshops across the state. Three former GEOCACHE participants led these workshops. Thirty teachers attended these workshops, with 21 creating lessons to teach in the upcoming school year. Participants reported their knowledge of using technology to analyze data increased by 42% by participating in the workshop and their knowledge of using technology to think spatially also increased by 42%.</p> <p>Additionally, the project initiated 1) a state-wide GIS Education User Conference (AZ GIS EdUC) and 2) a state-wide Educators&rsquo; GIS user group (AZ EdG). The intention is to encourage past GEOCACHE participants and stakeholders across the state to assume leadership of these educational efforts. Two AZ GIS EdUC statewide conferences have been held. Sixty-nine educators attended at least one of the conferences, which included hands-on sessions, presentations, discussions and career panels. Eight GEOCACHE participants presented how they have used GIS in the classroom at the conferences. GEOCACHE partnered with the AZ Geographic Information Council to continue AZ GIS EdUC as part of their annual conference, and to facilitate the pairing of GST professionals as mentors to educators. The AZEdG structure has been created to facilitate the use of GST in the classroom and to promote collaboration and exchange of pedagogical and technical knowledge and skills among its network of stakeholders. GEOCACHE participants serve as steering committee members for this group, consisting of 117 members.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/19/2018<br>      Modified by: Karen&nbsp;Blevins</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1304833/1304833_10267972_1539972502916_ISTEPoster--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1304833/1304833_10267972_1539972502916_ISTEPoster--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ISTE-Informed PBL"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1304833/1304833_10267972_1539972502916_ISTEPoster--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ISTE-Informed PBL"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">ISTE standards informed the development of Professional Development workshops offered to GEOCACHE participants.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lori Rubino-Hare</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Karen&nbsp;Blevins</div> <div class="imageTitle">ISTE-Informed PBL</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1304833/1304833_10267972_1539971969029_PolioProject--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1304833/1304833_10267972_1539971969029_PolioProject--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The Polio Project"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1304833/1304833_10267972_1539971969029_PolioProject--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The Polio Project"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students at Chandler-Gilbert Community College explore the spatial distribution of polio research.</div> <div class="imageCredit">GEOCACHE</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Karen&nbsp;Blevins</div> <div class="imageTitle">The Polio Project</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1304833/1304833_10267972_1539972147271_AdvancedProfessionalDevelopment--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1304833/1304833_10267972_1539972147271_AdvancedProfessionalDevelopment--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Advanced Professional Development"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1304833/1304833_10267972_1539972147271_AdvancedProfessionalDevelopment--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Advanced Professional Development"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Advanced professional development opportunities were offered to GEOCACHE participants.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lori Rubino-Hare</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Karen&nbsp;Blevins</div> <div class="imageTitle">Advanced Professional Development</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1304833/1304833_10267972_1539972727543_FoodAccessProject--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1304833/1304833_10267972_1539972727543_FoodAccessProject--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Food Deserts in an Urban Environment"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1304833/1304833_10267972_1539972727543_FoodAccessProject--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Food Deserts in an Urban Environment"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Biology students at Phoenix College explore food deserts in an urban setting.</div> <div class="imageCredit">GEOCACHE</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Karen&nbsp;Blevins</div> <div class="imageTitle">Food Deserts in an Urban Environment</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
