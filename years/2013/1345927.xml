<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to develop and deliver to health care enterprises a next generation imaging, analytics, and search solution that meets not only the current needs of multi-enterprise medical image viewing, but satisfies emerging demands related to clinical decision support and mobile health. The project addresses one of the ?Big Data? problems of medical imaging, i.e. providing access anywhere within the healthcare enterprise to large studies, advanced imaging tools, and image-based analytics across a spectrum of devices from powerful personal computers to mobile devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to translate novel research using quantitative imaging biomarkers into actual clinical practice. Medical imaging is commonly used for cancer screening, treatment planning, and monitoring but the results that come from purely qualitative interpretations of these images are not always definitive. Recent progress has shown that high-throughput extraction and analysis of advanced quantitative imaging features from medical images (?radiomics?) can be used to increase the accuracy and confidence of cancer screening in certain cases. The goals of this project are to incorporate these analytics into a commercially available system for medical image display and distribution which is necessary for widespread clinical adoption. These advances will enable health care providers to lower costs associated with unnecessary follow up exams as well as to improve patient outcomes through identification of tumors that are more likely to be resistant to treatment and to more efficiently and accurately monitor the response to treatment using medical imaging.</AbstractNarration>

The novel Search Imaging and Analytics (SAI) platform was proposed to address the growing need for clinicians to have timely access anywhere within the healthcare enterprise to complete patient data, including electronic medical record and imaging, for clinical decision support (CDS), quality improvement, and outcomes analysis using diagnostic medical imaging. The new architecture and design of the platform would give the clinicians access to all the relevant data anywhere within the healthcare enterprise across all platforms including mobile devices.     During the course of the project, HealthMyne successfully developed the software prototype and deployed it at two leading comprehensive cancer centers in Wisconsin and Florida. The platform is operational at both sites and being tested for scalability and clinical utilization. At one of the sites, the platform is enabling the IT administrators to perform analysis of the data to monitor and improve the radiology departmentÃ†s operational efficiency. At the other site the platform will be used, after regulatory clearance, for storing and analyzing clinical and imaging data for lung cancer screening using low-dose CT screening with a goal to reduce false positives.     The goals of the project, to develop the prototype that provides tight integration of a contextual search capability with integrated visualization and analytics and deploy it in a clinical setting, have been accomplished.  HealthMyne envisions that when put in broader clinical use the SAI platform will be very effective  as a powerful Clinical Decision Support  tool, a quality assurance tool to reduce diagnostic errors and its use will foster greater collaboration among specialists and clinicians thereby improving patient outcomes.
