<AbstractNarration>The so-called Abelian sandpile represents a striking example of surprising mathematics arising from a simple setting.  The rules of the sandpile are simple: given a configuration of "chips" on an infinite chessboard (i.e., the integer lattice), one can "topple" any square with at least 4 chips, by sending one chip from this square to each of its four neighboring squares.  When begun from a single large stack of chips and continued until no square has more than 3 chips, the result is a striking fractal configuration.  Studying this process has lead to the discovery of surprising connections between seemingly disparate areas of mathematics, and this project aims to leverage these new connections both for the sake of a deeper understanding of the sandpile process, and to enrich our understandings of these other areas as well.  This area of mathematics has connections with phase transitions and conformal field theory in physics as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, this project concerns the so-called Abelian sandpile model of Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld.  By identifying new connections between integer superharmonic functions, Apollonian circle packings, and certain regular tilings of the Euclidean plane, we are now able to characterize the scaling limit of the sandpile and analyze its local fractal structure. This project has two primary goals.  The first is to extend our knowledge of the sandpile: for example, we would like to strengthen the kind of convergence we can prove the sandpile process admits, characterize solutions to long-studied instances of the Dirichlet problem for the sandpile, and extend our knowledge of the scaling limit of the sandpile process beyond the universe of the square lattice.  On the other hand, we would like to bring new perspectives developed for our analysis of the sandpile to bear on other areas, with the possibility of confirming number-theoretic conjectures regarding Apollonian circle packings, or characterizing tilings of the plane with certain symmetry properties.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed new and deeper understanding of the appearance of fractal patterns in simple cellular automata  known as the Abelian Sandpile.  First introduced in the 1980s as a model of the statistical properties of frequencies of natural events such as earthquakes and avalanches, the Abelian sandpile was found to also produce strikingly complex and beautiful patterns from it's exceedingly simple rules.     The funded project has provided a new mathematical foundation for understanding this and related processes.  In particular, we now know that the complex patterns emerge as a consequence of a certain class of Partial Differential Equation which imposes an interesting discrete constraint on second derivatives.  The simple rules of the Abelian sandpile process efficiently find a discrete approximate solution to this PDE, exhibiting the same fractal structure as continuous solutions to the PDE would.     The funded project also elucidated a beautiful connection between this PDE and Apollonian circle packings, which are circle packings with the property that any circle is tangent to three ("parent") mutually tangent circles, and any three mutually parent circles have a ("child") circle to which they are each tangent.  Due to this connection, circles in Apollonian circle packings are intimately related to both the large-scale and small-scale structures in the sandpile.
