<AbstractNarration>DMR- 1337371 &lt;br/&gt;Armstrong&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program supports the acquisition of a multi-functional Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM) system for nanoscale surface characterization, to be housed in the W.M. Keck Center for Nano-Scale Imaging at the University of Arizona (UA).  This multi-user system will enhance our understanding of the relationship between surface and interface topography, mechanical composition, and electrical properties, at nanometer length scales, and will enable the study for the first time of dynamic interfacial processes. Understanding these surface and interfacial processes is critical since they often underpin the development of new energy conversion and energy storage technologies, new biosensors and biomaterials, and materials for a sustainable future.   Examples of new research activities and collaborations enabled through the acquisition of this instrument are: i) exploration of the interfacial chemistries and physics that control charge harvesting and charge injection, and electrical conductivities in thin film materials envisioned for use in energy conversion and energy storage technologies, ii) studies of organized thin film assemblies of unique glycolipid surfactants, iii) nanometer-scale understanding of the compositional variations in graphene-like materials which control work function and related electrical properties, iv) studies of the heterogeneous structure and nanomechanical properties of unique lipid bilayer constructs created from cross-linkable lipids, and functionalized with trans-membrane proteins, v) creation of nano-patterned oxide materials for nanoelectronic devices, and vi) mapping variations in electric force with and without photoexcitation for nanoparticle modified transparent electrode materials.  This new SPM system will directly impact a cohort of 45 principal investigators and 200 graduate students, postdocs and undergraduates from the UA community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program supports the acquisition of a multi-functional Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM).  This SPM will enhance interdisciplinary research and training activities at the University of Arizona (UA) focused on the development of new energy conversion and energy storage technologies, new biosensors and biomaterials, and materials for a sustainable future.  This new instrument will expand the research, training and outreach capabilities of the W.M. Keck Center for Surface and Interface Imaging which currently serves the needs of a diverse University of Arizona community interested in imaging, characterization and manipulation of matter at nanometer length scales.  The new SPM system will provide the capabilities to characterize matter on small length scales, including mechanical and electrical properties, and will in some cases provide for understanding of dynamic chemical processes at interfaces in real time. It will play a critical role in the UA educational mission through its use in our undergraduate and graduate-level instrumental analysis laboratory courses, a popular SPM annual summer workshop, and various outreach activities. The SPM will be featured in demonstrations for local K-12 students and UA hosted community activities such as Science City and UA Parent's Weekend. The new multi-functional SPM system will enable new research collaborations and innovations, and will serve to expose and inspire UA students and the greater southern Arizona community with state-of-the-art nanoscale scientific imaging.</AbstractNarration>
