<AbstractNarration>This project is designed to build capacity for conducting research on learning progressions in geography. Learning progressions offer a means for educators to determine how students learn geographic facts, concepts, and skills, and whether they are on track toward attainment of a particular curriculum standard or set of standards. The available research base in geography education is primarily focused on students' understanding (or learning) of individual ideas or skills, but not on the relationships between different areas of content or types of skills learned progressively across grade levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this project, geographers and education researchers will receive training to develop and validate learning progressions and assessments based on Standard 1 of Geography for Life: National Geography Standards (2nd Edition): How to use maps and other geographic representations, geospatial technologies, and spatial thinking to understand and communicate information. The capacity building will involve four activities: 1) a planning meeting with geographers and learning progressions experts, 2) an inventory and prospect study for the research, 3) a research training workshop with graduate students, early career scholars and faculty mentors, and 4) preparations for the coordination and implementation of the research plans produced by the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is the first to develop a methodology for designing learning progressions referenced to national geography standards. The goal is to stimulate interest, and provide training and mentoring support for graduate students and early career scholars interested in carrying out this type of research. The long-term vision is to educate a cadre of future researchers with strong research and analysis skills who can participate in the creation and testing of learning progressions for all 18 national geography standards. The outcomes of this project will include co-authored research manuscripts and an online American Association of Geographers (AAG ) clearinghouse of research results.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Learning progressions offer a means for educators to determine how students learn geographic facts, concepts, and skills, and whether they are on track toward attainment of a particular curriculum standard or set of standards. As noted in a report recently issued by National Geographic?s Road Map for 21st Century Geography Education Project, research on learning progressions is an area of critical need for improving the quality of geography teaching and learning. The available research base in geography education is primarily focused on students? understanding (or learning) of individual ideas or skills, but not on the relationships between different areas of content or types of skills learned progressively across grade levels.  Through this project, geographers and education researchers received training on how to conduct, develop, and validate learning progressions and assessments for maps, geospatial technology, and spatial thinking.  The capacity building began with a symposium (February 6-9, 2014) that brought together geographers and learning progressions experts to formulate an initial research agenda on geography learning progressions. Participants in the symposium discussed current debates about the potential of learning progressions for improving the quality of geography education.  In the months following the symposium, the group developed a research handbook for training graduate students and scholars interested in this area of research.  The GeoProgressions handbook was used to train 28 graduate students and faculty who attended a workshop, held from October 9-12, 2014 at the National Geographic Society. The participants met for panels and smaller breakout sessions for discussion and training activities on the following topics:  Definitions of learning progressions with examples from geography, math and science education. Discussion of relevant research on spatial cognition, map learning and GIS education. Materials and procedures that can be used to develop a hypothesized learning progression, for example:   Approaches to constructing samples and assessment items for quantitative studies. Demonstration of how to perform validity tests of research instruments. Demonstration and practice of qualitative methods, including clinical interviews. How to interpret quantitative and qualitative data.   Common errors, issues and obstacles in learning progressions research. Strategies for working with teachers and students in K-12 classrooms.                Last Modified: 01/20/2017       Submitted by: Michael N Solem]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
