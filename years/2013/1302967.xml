<AbstractNarration>Urban, suburban and exurban environments are important ecosystems and their extent is increasing in the U.S.  The conversion of wild or managed ecosystems to urban ecosystems is resulting in ecosystem homogenization across cities, where neighborhoods in very different parts of the country have similar patterns of roads, residential lots, commercial areas and aquatic features.  Funds are provided to test the hypothesis that this homogenization alters ecological structure and functions relevant to ecosystem carbon and nitrogen dynamics, with continental scale implications.  The research will provide a framework for understanding the impacts of urban land use change from local to continental scales.  The research encompasses datasets ranging from household surveys to regional-scale remote sensing across six metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) that cover the major climatic regions of the US (Phoenix, AZ, Miami, FL, Baltimore, MD, Boston, MA, St. Paul, MN and Los Angeles, CA) to determine how household characteristics correlate with landscaping decisions, land management practices and ecological structure and functions at local, regional and continental scales.  This research will transform scientific understanding of an important and increasingly common ecosystem type (?suburbia?) and the consequences to carbon storage and nitrogen pollution at multiple scales. In addition, it will advance understanding of how humans perceive, value and manage their surroundings. The award will leverage an extensive, multi-scale program of education and outreach associated with ongoing LTER and/or ULTRA-EX projects. Activities include K-12 education and outreach to community groups, city/regional planners, natural history museums, state and local agencies and non-governmental organizations. Graduate students will participate in a Distributed Graduate Seminar in Sustainability Science (DGSS) initiated by NCEAS and the University of Minnesota Institute on Environment.</AbstractNarration>

In addition, we processed plant and soil samples collected in all cities for carbon, nitrogen, and stable isotope analysis.  This is the first comprehensive analysis of lawn nitrogen content and isotopic composition at the continental scale, with identical sampling protocols in 7 cities across the U.S.  We found evidence for ecological homogenization of lawn nitrogen in that lawns tend to have both higher and also more homogenized nitrogen content than natural ecosystems, as well as more isotopically enriched nitrogen.  Our analysis of the relationship between parcel age and nitrogen isotopes suggests that a major mechanism driving isotopic enrichment is ecosystem N losses in older parcels.  This has significant environmental implications, as N losses from lawns contribute to air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and water pollution.  However, we did not find evidence for ecological homogenization of carbon isotopes, as the primary mechanism that explained the carbon isotopic composition of lawns was the proportion of C3 vs. C4 species (different photosynthetic pathways that affect plant physiology), which was primarily driven by temperature.  Hence, lawn management practices across the country do not appear to overcome the strong climatic constraint on the distribution of C4 grasses imposed by the relationship between temperature and photorespiration.  These are entirely novel findings that expand our understanding of distribution of plants to include the controls on lawn species, as this is the first study of lawn biogeochemistry and isotopic composition at this spatial scale.
