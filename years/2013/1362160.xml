<AbstractNarration>The proposed research involves computer explorations and the transfer of information connecting several areas of mathematics, most particularly Representation Theory, the Theory Special Functions and Combinatorics.  These connections provide a powerful vehicle of discovery, since results and mechanisms which may be quite obvious in one area often translate into highly nontrivial and unexpected facts in one of the other areas. This type of activity is also highly suitable for training young researchers and providing them with the opportunity to discover the manner in which some research can be carried in our Computer Age. Combinatorial interpretations translate mathematical information, be it algebraic, analytical, logical or otherwise, into visual information. Under this setting, even students with limited background can be brought to experience the joy of discovery.  For these reasons the PI, plans to continue the practice of bringing all current research efforts right into the classroom through graduate courses and seminars.  In fact most of the work of the students and collaborators of the PI carried out under prior NSF support resulted from such classroom activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subfield of Algebraic Combinatorics, that is the focus of the research carried out under this award was created by the PI's representation theoretical approach to the (1988) conjectures by Macdonald concerning his now-famous symmetric polynomial basis.  The 1990's joint work of the PI and Mark Haiman led to a conjectured formula for the Frobenius characteristic  of the space ``Diagonal Harmonics'' in terms of the Macdonald polynomials.  Early computer explorations by the PI and Haiman  yielded data which revealed a surprisingly intimate connection of Diagonal Harmonics with  ``Parking Functions'' (a colorful combinatorial structure created by computer scientists.) These discoveries led to the formulation by Haglund et al. of the Shuffle Conjecture which gives the Frobenius Characteristic of Diagonal Harmonics a beautiful explicit formula in terms of Parking Functions. Around the year 2000, Mark Haiman proved the original conjectures formulated jointly with the PI by Algebraic Geometrical tools.  This brought the attention of the Algebraic Geometers to this field of investigation.  This attention resulted in a truly surprising enrichment of the field with a variety of new tools and open problems.  Very recently the PI and his collaborators, using these new findings succeeded  in formulating an infinite family of ``Shuffle Conjectures''  connecting a whole Lie Algebra of Symmetric Function Operators to new ``Parking Function'' like objects.  Under the support of this award the PI  plans to use the vast collection of tools developed in two decades of efforts in this area to work on these problems in collaboration with his present PhD students Emily Leven, Yeonkyung Kim and Marino Romero. Preliminary results obtained by the PI and his present students have been very promising. In fact, recently Leven has succeeded in solving an infinite subfamily of these new conjectures. Historically, difficult problems have been the source of fundamental mathematical discoveries. Our particular area of investigation should be no exception in this respect.</AbstractNarration>

The principal motivation was a publication by Ian Macdonald that &nbsp;formulated a combinatorial problem. &nbsp;The PI's initial idea was to divide the problem into an algebraic part and a combinatorial part. We give a glimpse of Algebraic Combinatorics to better understand this idea. &nbsp;We are given a 6-letter word W=365131 &nbsp;in the Alphabet 1,2,3,4,5,6. If we rearrange &nbsp;its letters in a weakly increasing order we obtain the word W'=113356. Notice that W' has the property &nbsp;that every one of its letters is less or equal to its position in W'. &nbsp;If we look up "Parking Function" in Google we will probably get "a Parking Function is an n-letter word W &nbsp;in the&nbsp;Alphabet 1,2,&hellip;n whose weakly increasing rearrangement W' has every one of itsletters smaller or equal to its position". &nbsp;<em>This is a mathematical construct</em>. It is not even easy to see how to construct all these magic words for any given n. Let us see how this can be done for n=6.&nbsp;In the attached image we have depicted the 6 by 6 lattice square R<sub>6&nbsp;</sub>and drawn a path D that travels from the SW corner of R<sub>6</sub> to its NE corner by unit North and East steps, never going below the lattice diagonal.&nbsp;(The colored cells of R<sub>6</sub>).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, in the cells next to the North steps of D we placed the labels &nbsp;1,&hellip;,6 so that the resulting columns are increasing from bottom to top.&nbsp;We also placed our alphabet 1,&hellip;,6 at &nbsp;the bottom of the display. <em>This is a combinatorial object</em>. To see that it is simply a &nbsp;<em>visual representation</em>&nbsp;of our word &nbsp;Parking Function, we need only construct a 6-letter word W by &nbsp;reading the alphabet letters below each of the successive labels. &nbsp; For instance the letter below the label 1 is 3, letter below the label 2 is 6, the letter below the label 3 is 5, etc&hellip; We can see that this process will quickly deliver us the word W=365131. Now the fact that the word W'=113356 has the required property that makes W a Parking Functionis simply a consequence of the fact that D remains weakly above the lattice diagonal. &nbsp;We can now associate to &nbsp;each Parking Function two statistics. The <em>area</em> and the <em>dinv</em>. The former &nbsp;simply counts the cells between the &nbsp;path and the lattice diagonal. &nbsp;The latter is more elaborate. We only need to look at labels in the same diagonal, as 1 and 3 in the display. If the first label is less that the second we have a <em>primary dinv</em>. When the first label is in a diagonal immediately above the diagonal of the second label as 6 and 1 in the display, then we have a <em>secondary dinv</em>&nbsp;if the first label is larger that the second. The monomial w(PF)=t<sup>area(PF)</sup>q<sup>dinv(PF)&nbsp;</sup>is called the weight of the Parking Function. The final product is the mathematical construct obtained by summing the weights of all the Parking Functions in the n by n lattice square R<sub>n</sub>. This yields the polynomial &nbsp;P<sub>n</sub>(t,q)=&Sigma;<sub>PF in Rn</sub>w(PF). Since there are (n+1)<sup>n-1</sup>&nbsp;Parking functions in R<sub>n,&nbsp;</sub>even P<sub>6</sub>(t,q) is too big to be given here. But for instance &nbsp; P<sub>3</sub>(t,q)=q<sup>3</sup>+q<sup>2</sup>t+qt<sup>2</sup>+t<sup>3</sup>+2q<sup>2</sup>+ 3qt+2t<sup>2</sup>+2q +2t+1.&nbsp;We can now get across a glimpse of our branch Algebraic Combinatorics. After a few years of research in trying to solve the Macdonald &nbsp;problem we produced a variety of mathematical constructs one of which was the family of polynomials P<sub>n</sub>(t,q). It took a decade before we were able to give a purely combinatorial construction of P<sub>n</sub>(t,q). &nbsp;This is a simpler example of the &nbsp;type of research carried out under the present grant. The problems we investigate start with a mathematical construct and the goal is to explain the products that emit from it.

The results obtained during this period are contributions to the theory of symmetric function. A field that permits to produce computer data. This field not only can &nbsp;be used by mathematicians, but also physicists &nbsp;and engineers or any researcher in the applied sciences. This field, with its computer component is a superb tool for training research mathematicians. The PI's students Yeon Kim and Emily Sergel got their PhD during the period of this grant.
