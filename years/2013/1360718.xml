<AbstractNarration>This project will address fundamental science questions on how the midlatitude ionosphere behaves as a system. The midlatitude ionosphere is as prone to instability as the equatorial and auroral ionospheres despite the lack of obvious sources of free energy, and there is no comprehensive theory to explain this. There is a clear relationship between neutral winds, wind shear, and turbulence and Es layer formation and structuring, but the causal links have yet to be clearly articulated. Equally clear is that E region irregularities and F region medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) and irregularities are electrically coupled, but the roles of the regions (sources, loads, coupled resonators) remain unspecified. &lt;br/&gt; This project will investigate midlatitude sporadic E layers, MSTIDs, the associated plasma density irregularities, their mutual coupling, their geomagnetic conjugacy, and coupling to the thermospheric neutral motion. The investigation will have experimental, theoretical, and modeling aspects. The experimental component of the research will be conducted in the Caribbean and will center on the Arecibo incoherent scatter radar. This radar will be supported by a coherent scatter radar imager fielded so as to have common E- and F-region scattering volumes with Arecibo. The project will also utilize the Arecibo lidars and all-sky imagers as well as sounders and GPS Total Electron Content (TEC) data. The theoretical investigation will focus on the turbulence properties of the neutral motions in the mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT) region, which will be studied using a multi-scale analysis, and on the consequences for ionospheric structuring. Modeling work will incorporate a newly developed, fully three-dimensional plasma dynamics model. &lt;br/&gt; Undergraduate and graduate students will participate in this work, and public outreach activities will be carried out in the Caribbean.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the past ten years, Cornell University and Clemson University have carried out extensive observations of E- and F-region plasma instabilities at Arecibo using a coherent scatter imaging radar and the Arecibo incoherent scatter radar in a common observing volume configuration.  The combination of the two radars has provided unique, highly detailed, multi-parameter measurements that have provided new insights into the dynamics of the phenomena, both in terms of the plasma instabilities and the neutral drivers.  Results specifically related to the E-region instabilities, and to a lesser extent the F-region structures, have been described in a series of eight papers published in the peer-reviewed literature.  The study produced several discoveries. One was an F-region  plasma instability initiated by thermospheric wind-induced flows along  the magnetic field lines.  A numerical simulation of this instability was  able to reproduce observations of a single, large F-region plume  resembling plumes in equatorial spread F. Another F-region instability was discovered subsequently. This one produced tilted  corrugations in the F-region bottomside that resemble bottomside  layers in equatorial spread F. Numerical simulations of a  different kind of plasma instability reproduced this phenomena as  well. Together, the two instabilities are responsible for many of the  phenomena referred to collectively as mid-latitude spread F. While neutral dynamics play a role in the aforementioned processes, plasma physics is critical too, and some of the mechanisms at work turn out to be rather subtle.   A third discovery involved incoherent scatter gyro-lines, features of  the incoherent scatter radar spectrum that have seen relatively little investigation.  We  produced the first range-resolved gyro-line spectra and determined why  the lines appear in the altitudes they do.  Several signal processing techniques were developed in the course of the project including a means of inferring F-region vector drifts and E-region vector neutral wind profiles from Arecibo World-Day data. The World-Day data have not been well utilized, historically, because of their complexity. They combine data from three different modes (coded long pulse, multi-frequency pulses, and Barker-coded pulses) acquired with dual swinging beams. The complexity exploits Arecibo's capabilities, and the techniques developed under this award provide perhaps some of the most incisive measurements in aeronomy of plasma-neutral coupling in the lower thermosphere at middle latitudes.
