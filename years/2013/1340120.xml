<AbstractNarration>This is a request to support participation by graduate students and post-docs in two important international events organized around the concept of sustainability: 1) the international conference entitled Soil Carbon Sequestration for Climate, Food Security and Ecosystem Services (http://scs2013.land.is/) in Reykjavik, Iceland from May 26-29, 2013; and, 2) a Critical Zone science training workshop of the Soil Transformations in European Catchments (SoilTrEC) project: Land-use practices and sustainable use of soil, May 30-June 2, 2013, also in Iceland.&lt;br/&gt;The events are excellent opportunities for networking. In addition, these ten early-career scientists will form a core group of young U.S. Critical Zone scientists who will begin to consider sustainability issues throughout their evolving careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Study of the Critical Zone, the thin veneer of Earth's land surface that  spans from the top of the vegetation canopy down through soil and into  the subsurface depths where fresh groundwater circulates, requires a  systematic approach that draws and bonds scientists together to  investigate interdisciplinary problems within a global framework.This  project helped to build cooperation and to unite interdisciplinary and  international scientists.  Specifically, this project provided travel funds to support the participation of students from U.S. universities in two important international events, both generally organized around the concept of sustainability: 1) the international conference entitled Soil Carbon Sequestration for Climate, Food Security and Ecosystem Services in Reykjav&iacute;k, Iceland from May 26-29, 2013; and, 2) a Critical Zone science training workshop of the Soil Transformations in European Catchments (SoilTrEC) project: Land-use practices and sustainable use of soil, May 30-June 2, 2013, also in Iceland.  Attendance by young researchers and early career scientists at the meeting and workshop in Iceland was one step in initiating the education and increased awareness of U.S. Critical Zone scientists toward the oft-neglected but increasingly fundamental role of Critical Zone research in addressing some of the most pressing challenges facing humanity &ndash; the sustainability of Critical Zone services.
