<AbstractNarration>The overall research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to investigate the relationship between late-sound-field acoustics and perceived overall acoustic quality (OAQ) in performing arts venues. Late-sound-field acoustics are particularly important to the perception of listener envelopment (LEV), the sense of being immersed in the sound field. However, no universally accepted measure of LEV currently exists. The specific objectives of this project are to: A) Develop a quantifiable measure of LEV, B) Explore how this new LEV measure varies for auditoriums of different sizes, and C) Determine the relative significance of LEV and other established room acoustics characteristics to OAQ. The research will employ a combination of two methods: simulated sound-fields and binaural recordings evaluated by human subjects, and experimental measurements obtained in a total of nine American and European concert halls with varying size and OAQ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this work will provide the acoustical design and research community with an accurate methodology to measure LEV and will determine the relative importance of LEV to OAQ, as compared to well-accepted room acoustics measures. These results will allow for more efficient design of music performance venues and reduce the need for costly renovations. This project will increase the number of US students participating in room acoustics research and will provide research opportunities at a primarily undergraduate institution. These opportunities will improve the quality of the educational experience of undergraduate students, particularly females, and will also promote their professional development. Grade-school students will be exposed to the topic of sound, as well as a female role-model, in conjunction with the Connecticut Science Center's outreach program. In addition, self-contained acoustics experimental and learning kits will be created in collaboration with the Acoustical Society of America for middle-school student science education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support for the award is being provided by the Office of International Science and Engineering's Europe and the America programs and the Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation Division's Dynamical Systems within the Directorate for Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The ultimate design goal for a new concert hall is to create a hall with "excellent acoustics", but what does that mean? Many different terms are used to describe hall acoustics, like <em>warm</em>, <em>muddy</em>, <em>spacious</em>, and many others! The primary challenges in this field are</p> <p>(1) identifying and defining the most appropriate perceptual characteristics that create "excellent acoustics";</p> <p>(2) predicting these perceptions by quantifying (putting a number to) the measured sound fields, where the sound field is made up of acoustic waves reflecting off of the many surfaces in a hall, and its characteristics depend on the fine details of the hall's geometry and materials.</p> <p>The most common <strong>attribute</strong> associated with room acoustics is <em>reverberance</em>, which is the sense of the sound lingering in a space. The <strong>metric</strong> of Reverberation Time (RT), the time it takes sound to decay by 60 decibels (dB), is used to predict how <em>reverberant</em> a space will sound. A similar quantity is needed to predict the important perception of <em>envelopment</em>, which is the sense of being immersed in the sound, since more research was needed.</p> <p>Several studies were conducted to link the perception of envelopment to specific characteristics of a sound field: the time and direction of arrival of reflections at the listener. These studies were conducted by playing back measured sound fields to many participants and asking them to rate how enveloped they felt by each sound field. In other words, the different rooms (see Fig. 1) with their own unique acoustics properties were presented to individuals, who were then asked to rate their impression of envelopment for each room.</p> <p>A specialized laboratory facility was constructed to allow for listeners to be "teleported" or transported between the different rooms while the same orchestra continues to play. This lab (see Fig. 2) consists of 30 loudspeakers arranged in four rings around a central listener position and two subwoofers. The loudspeakers are located within a room that is fully absorptive, known as an anechoic ("no echoes") chamber, in order to avoid any reflections from the room interfering with the reproduced sound fields.</p> <p>The sound-field measurement equipment is shown in Fig. 3.

For this objective, 15 North American and 6 European concert halls were measured to create a database of concert hall measurements - see Fig. 4. In addition to the omnidirectional loudspeakers, a specialized loudspeaker array that has 20 separate driver elements was also used to mimic the directional patterns of musical instruments, for example a trumpet (Fig. 5). Measurements were taken at each of the 21 halls with this special loudspeaker in 20 different locations on stage to be representative of an orchestra for realistic playback for listening tests.</p> <p>Preference study outcome 1: An improved model was obtained to predict envelopment based on the direction that reflections arrive at a listener's head. In general, halls will be perceived as having high amounts of envelopment when most of the early energy arrives from approximately the left and right sides of the head: from about 45 to 100 degrees - the red regions in Fig. 6.
