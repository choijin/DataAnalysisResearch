<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an optical wireless system.  The proliferation of wireless devices and new applications are pushing Radio-Frequency (RF) wireless technologies to their limits.  Optics can fundamentally alter high-speed wireless communications because, relative to RF, optical systems provide more spectral bandwidth, higher-performance, and freedom from regulatory burdens.  However current optical wireless approaches are fixed in nature, limited in data rate, and susceptible to interference.  An optical wireless system is proposed that can adjust to optimize performance in many configurations by combining Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques with novel, adaptive optical component technology.  The anticipated technical results include creating the system architecture, developing the design, and demonstrating key technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes transformative technology, knowledge generation, and industry-university interaction.  The emergence of high-speed broadband Internet access enhanced numerous aspects of American society.  The increased bandwidth of optical relative to RF wireless solutions makes dramatically higher data rates possible, transforming wireless applications and societal usage.  Commercially the adaptive solution is a major differentiator for optical wireless, enabling optimization by application with a single design to address numerous large consumer and enterprise markets.  The emergence of optical wireless technology and the multi-disciplinary nature of the system offer many opportunities for knowledge generation and provide enhanced industry-university interaction.</AbstractNarration>

Optics can fundamentally alter high-speed communications because, relative to RF, optical systems provide more spectral bandwidth, higher-performance, and freedom from regulatory burdens.  During this Phase I SBIR, we developed an optical wireless system which can adapt to optimize performance in many configurations using Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and novel optical component technology.  During the period of performance, we defined the system architecture and identified how the system adapts to various scenarios.  We developed the optical component design, fabricated devices to validate our design, and demonstrated best-in-class performance.  We developed Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) DSP algorithms in a scalable and parameterized implementation which allows the system to adjust to a variety of conditions.  Finally we demonstrated the high-speed optical system by transmitting data across a link using realistic components.  Ultimately, optical wireless provides a path to long-term performance scaling, which is difficult to match with any other technology and generates numerous intellectual and societal benefits.  Commercially, our adaptive solution is a major differentiator for optical wireless, enabling optimization by application with a single design to eventually address numerous large consumer and enterprise markets.  With the Phase I proof-of-concept demonstration complete, our next step is to target a specific application by creating a prototype to address many practical issues like real-time algorithmic implementation, optical device packaging, and the system form-factor.
