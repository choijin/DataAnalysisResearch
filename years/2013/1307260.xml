<AbstractNarration>Working within a specific technical setting known as cavity quantum electrodynamics, this project pursues a program of experimental and theoretical research aimed at elucidating the essential physics of the 'mesoscopic' transition regime that lies between the deeply quantum-mechanical behavior of individual atoms and the classical behavior of large ensembles of atoms.  Our findings are of basic interest both for fundamental physics and for future engineering applications in nanotechnology, which often seeks to exploit unique aspects of mesoscopic physics.  Our approach is to conduct new experiments using several tens of atoms in a setting in which we have previously characterized the behavior of individual atoms and of ensembles of thousands of atoms.  We will pursue rigorous quantitative comparisons between experimental data and computer simulations based on fundamental theoretical models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines in science, engineering and mathematics.  The graduate student working on the project receives unique interdisciplinary training  and our research provides excellent source material for classroom teaching.  The publications and research presentations based on this research can reach new audiences in engineering and applied mathematics who may commonly study some of the kinds of nonlinear dynamical behaviors that we are investigating, introducing them for the first time to novel quantum mechanical aspects that emerge in the mesoscopic, nanoscale regime.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The primary focus of this project was an experimental investigation of cavity nonlinear optics in the few-atom regime, which represents a crossover regime between classical and quantum dynamics.  Such mesoscopic systems are of interest for modern physics as we are geenrally aware of tremendous qualitative differences between classical/macroscopic and quantum/microscopic dynamics, but do not understand well how the aggregation of individual atoms into bulk materials engenders changes in their fundamental behavior.  We designed our experiment around the well-known phenomenon of optical bistability, which has previously been studied both in the completely classical regime (with many intracavity atoms) and the fully quantum regime (with just one intracavity atom), by our group and others.  We utilized a cold atom source to deliver several strongly-coupled atoms into our optical cavity at a time, which provided the bulk of the nonlinear optical (bistable) response, but the nature of our source led to the presence of many weakly-coupled "background" atoms in the wings of the cavity as well.  While analyzing the data from our experiment we came to understand that these background atoms play a small but noticeable role in determining the quantitative behavior of the nonlinear cavity system, and we decided that it would be a significant contribution to mesoscopic physics to develop a way of modeling this background contribution rigorously.  Since the end of the project period for this award we have been refining our theoretical approach to modeling the joint effect of having both strongly-coupled and background atoms in the cavity, and we anticipate being able to publish a paper describing all of our results by the end of summer 2018.  This paper will also describe the effects of coherent feedback studies that we performed with the mesoscopic atom-cavity apparatus.  We found that coherent feedback can be used to modulate the effective decay rate of the cavity without changing any of the atom coupling parameters.  This is useful because it allowed us to acquire data under varying conditions, which we can compare with quantitative predictions of our theory.  It also demonstrates that coherent feedback provides a practical approach to changing cavity parameters in real time in cavity nonlinear optics, which may be of interest for applications in photonics (optical information processing) and quantum computing.  Broader Impacts  One graduate student received a Ph.D. degree based primarily on the work performed for this NSF project.  Several additional students who participated in aspects of the work (including work to complete a paper, after the end of the project performance period) have been receiving highly interdisciplinary training in quantum optics, computational physics and nonlinear dynamics.  The results of this project provide material for the PI's classroom teaching and for research seminars given at a wide range of venues including international conferences and overseas universities.
