<AbstractNarration>This award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program supports the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) with the acquisition of a Nova NanoSEM 450 high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) with low-vacuum option. The instrument has nanometer resolution and it is equipped with multiple detectors for secondary and backscattered electron imaging, energy dispersive X-ray detector for elemental analysis and mapping, backscattered electron diffraction for crystallographic and texture analysis, and a detector for scanning transmission electron imaging.  The ability of the instrument to achieve nanometer resolution in low vacuum makes it a unique addition to the pool of SEMs available in the Baltimore-Washington area and will substantially enhance the research infrastructure of UMBC and the region.  It will accelerate progress in many existing research programs, allow them to extend much farther than possible with the current SEM, and enables researchers to move into areas that are beyond the existing capabilities. The instrument will serve professors and their students from UMBC's science and engineering departments, as well as users from other universities, government laboratories and private firms. It will enable the study of the microstructure of alloys and composites, a variety of thin films and multilayers, optical fibers, functionalized gold nanoparticles, the texture of weld joints, aerosol particles, and others. The low-vacuum option is suitable for the study of partially insulating nanocomposite powders, dental tissue and restoration materials, archaeological artifacts, etc. The Nova NanoSEM 450 supports teaching through both undergraduate and graduate coursework and research projects. Many potential users of the new SEM involve undergraduate students in their research; those students will have the opportunity to use the instrument. Also, as UMBC has very diverse student population, the prospect to use the new SEM will certainly attract female and minority students to the STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern materials science is unimaginable without the scanning electron microscope (SEM) that can image samples on multiple length scales and provides information on morphology, chemical composition, and even crystallographic orientation. Although commercial scanning electron microscopes have been around for more than 50 years, there has been tremendous progress in SEM technology during the last decade. The Nova NanoSEM 450 supported by this Major Research Instrumentation award is a cutting edge instrument that has a unique combination of capabilities, such as nanometer resolution in both high and low vacuum and a variety of detectors that make it an extremely versatile instrument. It will be used to investigate nanocomposite powders, thin films, dental tissue and materials, gold nanoparticles, the texture of weld joints, aerosol particles, archaeological artifacts and others. The instrument is a major addition to UMBC's research infrastructure. It will serve researchers and their graduate and undergraduate students from several science and engineering departments, as well as users from other universities, government laboratories and private firms. It will accelerate existing research programs and enable investigations that are beyond the capabilities of the existing SEM. It will also be utilized in undergraduate and graduate courses. As UMBC has a very diverse student population, the opportunity to use this cutting edge instrument will certainly attract female and minority students to the STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This grant supported the acquisition of a modern field emission scanning electron microscope, specifically a Nova NanoSEM 450 instrument from FEI, to support the research and teaching missions of the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC.) It is the key instrument of UMBC&rsquo;s NanoImaging Center, a multi-user facility that is also available to researchers from other University of Maryland institutions, to non-profit organizations, and to users from the local industry. UMBC did not have a comparable state-of-the-art scanning electron microscope before.</p> <p>The microscope was installed in the summer of 2014. Since then, over 20 research groups have utilized it in a broad variety of projects. Some routine tasks, such as imaging the microstructure of metallic test samples, tooth enamel, and glass fibers contributed valuable information to the projects of the respective users efficiently and to a high standard of quality. Many problems required the advanced features of the microscope or pushed its capabilities to the limit. For example, imaging gold nanorods required transmission mode and the ultimate resolution of the microscope. Insulating ceramics and flint samples were studied without coating, using either frame averaging or imaging in low vacuum. Obtaining elemental maps from layers as thin as a few nanometers by X-ray analysis required careful optimization of the imaging conditions, particularly the accelerating voltage.</p> <p>Most users of the microscope are graduate students working on their thesis projects. Seven Ph.D. dissertations used images obtained with the microscope already and several are in progress. Some graduate students used it during their research rotation.&nbsp; The microscope also supported an undergraduate summer project on comparing archaeological flint samples from a variety of locations. The Mellon Foundation is supporting an undergraduate summer research program in art conservation with the participation of UMBC, the Johns Hopkins University, and the Walters Art Museum. Six students from that program used the microscope several times last summer to test cleaning methods for gilded silver articles and the structure of delicate fibers. The microscope was occasionally used by non-profit organizations and local industry. All counted, more than fifty persons used the microscope during its first two years of operation. Many of them had no prior experience with electron microscopy.&nbsp;</p> <p>The microscope was also used in courses, such as Solid Mechanics and Materials Laboratory ENME 332L offered by the Mechanical Engineering Department and Modern Physics Laboratory PHYS 431 and Nuclear Physics PHYS 402 offered by the Physics Department. The total number of students in those courses was about 100.</p> <p>Broader Impact: The Nova NanoSEM 450 has become an important element of UMBC&rsquo;s infrastructure. It makes many investigations possible on-site that could either not be done or required the use of off-campus facilities before. About two dozen proposals listed the microscope among the available facilities. It is fair to say that the availability of the instrument had a substantial, broad impact on research at UMBC. The availability of a cutting edge instrument also impacted the quality of coursework. As UMBC has a very diverse student population, it is no surprise that about one third of the users of the microscope were female or underrepresented minority.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/28/2016<br>      Modified by: Laszlo&nbsp;Takacs</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1337727/1337727_10273825_1479848004241_C_93_004--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1337727/1337727_10273825_1479848004241_C_93_004--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Well-formed quartz crystallites in a deep cavity in a flint sample"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1337727/1337727_10273825_1479848004241_C_93_004--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Well-formed quartz crystallites in a deep cavity in a flint sample"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Cavity in a natural flint sample.
