<AbstractNarration>The FCC seeks to connect 19 million unserved Americans to broadband by 2020.  These rural areas have yet to be fully connected to the Internet due to wireline infrastructure costs which exceed potential revenue opportunities. Even in heavily-populated environments with sufficient wireline infrastructure, capacity issues remain in congested stadiums, disaster recovery zones, and public transportation. Each aforementioned access challenge seemingly is well-suited for wireless mesh networks, but have yet to be fully solved. However, recently, there has been a sizable growth in radios operating in diverse frequency bands (e.g., TV white spaces) with emerging multi-antenna schemes. In this project, multi-user beamforming and diverse frequency bands are leveraged to significantly build upon the flexibility originally sought by mesh networks. In doing so, frequency-agile beamforming mesh (FabMesh) networks seek to truly scale in complexity and cost according to the user population and traffic demand. The work includes three key innovations: (i) client-side, beamforming-aware, and frequency-agile protocols to improve performance and reliability of clients, using contextual information and advanced physical layer techniques, (ii) analysis of spatial reuse and capacity for media access control in mesh networks which leverage multi-user beamforming, and (iii) scalable network deployments which leverage multi-user beamforming along the backhaul and adaptation across multiple frequency bands according to network demand. The project includes a number of hands-on courses for university students at all levels, "just in time" pedagogical approaches to thousands of online students, outreach to under-represented students and communities, and key industrial collaborations to accelerate the commercial adoption of FabMesh networks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching vision of the project is to leverage the diversity of multiple available frequency bands and multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) to allow greater flexibility and scalability of wireless mesh networks.   There are two major goals in achieving this vision of Frequency-Agile Beamforming Mesh Networks (FabMesh).  First, since user devices are increasingly being equipped with multiple antennas, we seek to exploit client-side beamforming and user context for the purposes of increased throughput and reliability of client connections. Second, we consider the spatial dimensions of both frequency agility and multi-user MIMO for increased spatial reuse and efficiency with novel media access designs and end-to-end multi-hop routes.  The specific research formulations studied include the following:  1. SAMU: The amount of bandwidth in IEEE 802.11 networks has scaled considerably in recent years from 20 to 160 MHz with multiple GHz networks potentially emerging very soon.  Also, IEEE 802.11ac has allowed different user groups to be chosen to receive simultaneous transmissions via multi-user beamforming.  We sought to develop a fully IEEE 802.11ac compliant addition to the standard which allows the channel bandwidth to be broken up into smaller chunks to choose user groups.  These subchannels would be chosen according to the users that have the highest degree of orthogonality between them.  Even with minimal mobility and only 20 MHz channel bandwidth, SAMU achieves as much as 80 percent throughput improvement compared to existing multi-user MIMO schemes over emulated and real indoor channels. This improvement is only expected to rise as the bandwidth reaches 80 and 160 GHz, creating more opportunities for diverse orthogonalities amoung multi-user beamforming groups across distinct sets of sub-carriers at a given point in time.  2. Crowdsensing: As sharing agreements are being ratified by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for various spectrum bands for commercial broadband use, it also opens up an equally challenging problem of enforcing these policies. The efficacy of an enforcement system greatly depends on the accuracy of evidential information and the speed of adjudication. We introduce the term "eye-witness" in the domain of spectrum enforcement by leveraging the power of the "crowd", defined as devices that are also operating in the same part of the spectrum. The objective of such a method is to observe a frequency band for policy-violations and, if an anomaly is detected, report it to the appropriate law enforcement agency for adjudication. We present an efficient method to aggregate this variety of observations to increase the credibility of the evidence and also locate the source of infraction with high accuracy. We also model and analyze the cost of enforcement using game theoretic methods to measure the relative payoffs of the participants and the enforcement agencies.
