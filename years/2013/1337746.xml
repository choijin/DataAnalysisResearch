<AbstractNarration>1337746&lt;br/&gt;Sun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs plan to acquire a 3-D multicolor N-STORM Superresolution Microscopy System and establish a&lt;br/&gt;Nanoscopy Laboratory of the City College of New York (CCNY). The STORM system will immediately&lt;br/&gt;enable 28 research topics or areas proposed by 21 faculty members, most of whom are leaders of their&lt;br/&gt;own groups/labs, in 8 departments including Electrical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Physics,&lt;br/&gt;Biology, Chemistry, Mechanical Engineering, Physiology/Pharmacology/Neuroscience, and Microbiology/&lt;br/&gt;Immunology. The research activities enabled by N-STORM and performed in this project will&lt;br/&gt;enhance the spatiotemporal resolution of STORM, clarify a number of biomedical hypotheses and&lt;br/&gt;phenomena established by other means, and result in insightful novel biomedical knowledge. They will&lt;br/&gt;promote teaching, training, and learning and improve basic science research, disease diagnostic&lt;br/&gt;assessment, and therapeutics development. The results will be broadly disseminated and applied in the&lt;br/&gt;fields of nanoscopy, cell biology, neurobiology, and medicine to enhance scientific, technological and&lt;br/&gt;clinical understanding.</AbstractNarration>
