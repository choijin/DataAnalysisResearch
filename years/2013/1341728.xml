<AbstractNarration>Stone/1341728&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to determine if the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) has thinned and collapsed in the past and if so, when did this occur.  This topic is of interest to geologists who have long been studying the history and behavior of ice sheets (including the WAIS) in order to determine what climatic conditions allow an ice sheet to survive and what conditions have caused them to collapse in the past.  The bulk of this research has focused on the last ice age, when climate conditions were far colder than the present; this project will focus on the response of ice sheets to warmer climates in the past.  A new and potentially transformative approach that uses the analysis of atoms transformed by cosmic-rays in bedrock beneath the WAIS will allow a definitive test for ice free conditions in the past.  This is because the cosmic rays capable of producing the necessary reactions can penetrate only a few meters through glacier ice.  Therefore, if they are detected in samples from hundreds of meters below the current ice sheet surface this would provide definitive proof of mostly ice-free conditions in the past.  The concentrations of different cosmic ray products in cores from different depths will help answer the question of how frequently bedrock has been exposed, how much the ice sheet has thinned, and which time periods in the past produced climatic conditions capable of making the ice sheet unstable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Short bedrock cores beneath the ice sheet near the Pirrit Hills in West Antarctica will be collected using a new agile sub-ice geological drill (capable of drilling up to 200 meters beneath the ice surface) that is being developed by the Ice Drilling Program Office (IDPO) to support this and other projects. Favorable drilling sites have already been identified based on prior reconnaissance mapping, sample analysis and radar surveys of the ice-sheet bed.  The cores collected in this study will be analyzed for cosmic-ray-produced isotopes of different elements with a range of half-lives from 5700 yr (C-14) to 1.4 Myr (Be-10), as well as stable Ne-21.  The presence or absence of these isotopes will provide a definitive test of whether bedrock surfaces were ice-free in the past and due to their different half-lives, ratios of the isotopes will place constraints on the age, frequency and duration of past exposure episodes.  Results from bedrock surfaces at different depths will indicate the degree of past ice-sheet thinning.  The aim is to tie evidence of deglaciation in the past to specific periods of warmer climate and thus to gauge the ice sheet's response to known climate conditions. This project addresses the broad question of ice-sheet sensitivity to climate warming, which previously has been largely determined indirectly from sea-level records.  In contrast, this project will provide direct measurements that provide evidence of ice-sheet thinning in West Antarctica. Results from this work will help to identify the climatic factors and thresholds capable of endangering the WAIS in future.  The project will make a significant contribution to the ongoing study of climate change, ice-sheet melting and associated sea-level rise. This project has field work in Antarctica.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A test for past West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse  When cosmic radiation penetrates into rock it produces rare, long-lived radioactive isotopes.  Some of these, such as beryllium-10 cannot be produced by any other natural process, and are used by geoscientists as a unique test of whether rock or sediment has been exposed at the Earth's surface.  Because the cosmic rays responsible for most beryllium-10 production are absorbed by only a few meters of ice cover, finding a distinctive profile of this isotope in bedrock beneath an ice sheet provides direct and unambiguous evidence of whether this rock has been deglaciated (ice-free) during past climatic periods warmer than the present.  Several recent studies have used this method to show that much of the Greenland Ice Sheet disappeared at least once, and possibly repeatedly, during the past million years.  During the 2016-17 Antarctic field season we drilled a core from bedrock 150 m below the surface of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) in the Pirrit Hills, in the Weddell Sea sector of the ice sheet.  We obtained 8 meters of bedrock core, and recovered 1 meter of the overlying ice intact.  We were able to collect the core without exposing the top to sunlight, allowing us to use a second dating method ? optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating ? to determine whether the bedrock had ever been exposed to sunlight.  Concentrations of the cosmic-ray-produced isotopes beryllium-10 and aluminum-26 are extremely low and constant down most of the core.  The topmost meter contains a small increase in beryllium-10 up to ~1000 atom/gram over the background level of ~4000 atom/gram.  The beryllium-10 background is produced by the tiny fraction of very high-energy cosmic-rays that penetrate hundreds of meters into ice, and the constant background level of ~ 4000 atom/gram tells us that the site has had an average ice cover of ~200 meters for at least the last few million years.  The increase in beryllium-10 at the top of the core requires that the site was ice-free at least once prior to that ? for roughly 200-800 years if this occurred during the Pliocene warm period 2.6?5.3 million years ago, or longer if it occurred in the earlier Miocene period.  Our OSL dating results give an age greater than 400,000 years for last exposure of the surface; this is the upper limit of the dating technique, and consistent with the result from the cosmic ray produced isotopes.  We also measured the argon isotopic composition of air trapped within bubbles in the glacier ice directly above the bedrock. This indicates that the ice is older than 2?2.5 million years (making it some of the oldest ice yet recovered from Antarctica). Together these results conclusively rule out exposure of the bedrock surface we sampled within the last few million years, and limit thinning of ice in the Pirrit Hills region by more than 150 m during this time.  Although this appears to contradict recent computer models which show the ice sheet prone to collapse during past climatic warm periods, it is important to realise that it is a single geographic datum from a vast ice sheet. To explore the implications for the broader ice sheet and West Antarctic contributions to past sea-level rise, we ran a series of WAIS simulations over three Pleistocene interglacial periods, MIS-31, -11 and -5e.  Our model results suggest there should be a strong correlation between WAIS volume and ice thickness at our test site in the Pirrit Hills; however, all predict exposure of the site during these three climatic warm periods, contrary to the drillcore evidence.  Our ensemble of models suggests that Pirrit Hills ice thickness is strongly governed by persistence of a large ice shelf in the Weddell Sea, making results for regions like the Pirrit Hills sensitive to the model's ocean-temperature forcing.  Others using the same ice-sheet model, but forced instead by a coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model, found ice-sheet behavior consistent with our result. At this point we can say that, although our conclusions rest on modeling to connect results from the Pirrit Hills to the broader WAIS, we expect future subglacial drilling at other key sites to eventually provide robust and model-independent constraints on the climate sensitivity of the ice sheet.
