<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program that is co-funded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, Professor Kung Wang from West Virginia University and colleagues Jeffrey Petersen, Xiaodong Shi, Jessica Hoover and Brian Popp will acquire a single crystal X-ray diffractometer that will replace an obsolete diffractometer with a single-point detector. The project is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) studies of transition metal complexes for promoting catalytic C-C bond forming and dehydrogenative cross coupling reactions, for modeling enzymatic systems capable of the reductive coupling of CO, or for developing new achiral and chiral reagents; (b) preparation of ambiphilic, BINOLate-type, and 1,2,3-triazole ligand systems (BINOL = the chiral 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-diol); and (c) synthesis of highly strained polycyclic aromatics that serve as end-cap templates for carbon nanotubes and heteroaromatics that display biological activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training. It will be the only modern diffractometer in the state which will positively benefit society through research, education, workforce training and outreach and increase the already historic collaborations with outer-of-state schools and used for summer enrichment programs involving middle, high-school and undergraduate as well as graduate students in the area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[NSF-MRI Award 1336071:  Acquisition of an Automated Single-Crystal X-Ray Diffractometer for Research and Teaching              This research award from the National Science Foundation was used to acquire a state-of-the-art automated X-ray diffractometer at West Virginia University.  This instrument supports the research and teaching missions of the Bennett Department of Chemistry at WVU; it replaced an outdated X-ray diffractometer previously acquired with funds provided by NSF in 1992.              X-ray crystallography is the primary method used in academic and industrial laboratories throughout the world to determine the three-dimensional structure of chemical compounds from the analysis of the diffraction patterns generated by the exposure of a single crystal to monochromatic X-ray radiation.  Our new Bruker AXS D8 Venture system is equipped with a low-temperature system to collect X-ray diffraction data routinely at 100 K (or ca. -280&deg;F) and a large CMOS detector with 1000 x 1000 pixel resolution.  These features substantially reduce the data collection time and improve the accuracy and precision of the structural results.              Our new X-ray diffractometer has contributed significantly to the research programs of three recently hired faculty members, Professors Popp, Hoover, and Milsmann. It also supports the research efforts of our senior faculty, who rely on X-ray crystallography to confirm the chemical composition and molecular structures of new compounds prepared by their undergraduate and graduate students.  Specific examples are briefly highlighted below:            Professor Kung Wang is developing synthetic methodologies for the preparation of functionalized [n]cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs), which serve as templates for synthesizing carbon nanotubes for future applications in nanotechnology.  CPPs display a novel nanohoop structure, formed by linking six-membered planar carbon rings in a macrocyclic array, with ring sizes ranging from n = 5 - 18.  His co-workers have developed a multi-step synthetic strategy leading to the isolation of [6]CPPs, [9]CPPs, and cyclic dimers containing a pair of fused [6]CPP units.           Professor Brian Popp is developing catalytic processes that feature earth abundant metals such as copper, cobalt, and nickel.  His group has recently developed a regioselective copper-catalyzed process for the boracarboxylation of vinyl arenes and has demonstrated its application for the preparation of non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).             Professor Jessica Hoover is developing copper based catalysts for the oxidative decarboxylative coupling reaction for the selective functionalization of arenes from carboxylic acids.  X-ray crystallographic analyses enable her to determine the molecular structures and identities of copper species that serve as catalyst precursors or structurally resemble reactive intermediates that may be involved in the catalytic process.   Her group is also interested in the reductive coupling of isonitriles and carbon monoxide by mononuclear tripodal iron complexes. A large number of these complexes, bearing both isonitrile and carbon monoxide ligands, have been characterized using X-ray crystallography.             Professor Carsten Milsmann is investigating alternative transition metal compounds to promote nitrogen activation and to develop chemical systems for use in photoredox catalysis.   His efforts have focused on the synthesis, characterization, and chemical reactivity displayed by metal complexes that feature a 2,6-bis(pyrrolyl)pyridine ligand.  For example, titanium and zirconium complexes that contain a pair of bis(5-methyl-3-phenyl-1-pyrrol-2-yl)pyridine dianions undergo multiple reversible electron transfer processes.  The luminescent Zr complex functions as a molecular photosensitizer for visible light redox catalysis to facilitate dehalogenation reactions, the reduction of electron-poor olefins, and the reductive coupling of benzyl bromide.  These results are significant because they demonstrate that this Zr complex, which contains the earth-abundant element zirconium, acts as an effective substitute for a well-known, less-abundant ruthenium complex.
