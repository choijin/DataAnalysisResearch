<AbstractNarration>The objective of the program is to explore the integration of nano metallic structures with photonic crystal for developing high efficient photonic antennas to significantly improve the fill factor of nanocarbon material based infrared detectors. It has been demonstrated that the nanocarbon material based infrared detectors have many superb performance comparing to currently available infrared detectors such as no need for cryogenic cooling, spectrum detection, and high signal to noise ratio. However the major bottle neck for applying such detectors is their low fill factors due to the dimensions of nanocarbon material. The potential results of this program will be a key step forward for the applications of nanocarbon material based infrared detectors. They will be also transformative by discovering new knowledge on the design of nanophotonic antenna and nanoinfrared detectors, and developing new nanomanufacturing processes for nanophotonic devices. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is to advance the state-of-art of nanocarbon material based photovoltaics by using a photonic antenna to increase quantum efficiency and fill factors. The transformative contributions will be made in theoretical understanding of electromagnetic field topology and surface plasmonics, optimal design of nanophotonic devices, and efficient nanomanufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are not only on nanophotonics and nanomanufacturing, but also on broader areas including: creating new multidisciplinary research and development directions in nanotechnology and electromagnetics; providing new understanding and devices for research and development in engineering, biology and other science fields; and leading to the development of new infrared cameras for applications in national security, medical diagnostics, and industrial inspections.</AbstractNarration>

However, high performance IR sensors require cryogenic cooling to suppress the thermally-generated noise. In addition, most existing IR detectors suffer from low quantum efficiency and can only detect specific ranges of wavelengths, which make them impractical for many applications. To overcome the above limitations, semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are very promising materials because they exhibit a bandgap in the IR range, low thermal noise, high quantum efficiency, and low temperature dependency, making it capable to sense a wide range of IR radiation at either room or moderately low temperature where cryogenic cooling is not required. However, there are several fundamental problems which still plague the development of these CNT-based nanodevices for practical applications including the limited fill factor, repeatable and reliable fabrication processes, and difficulties in characterization due to the variations in electronic properties of nanotubes.</p> <p>Over the past year, we have explored the integration of optical antennas made from helical nanobelts (HNBs) onto CNT-based IR sensors to enhance their sensitivity by improving the fill factor. Optical antennas, analogous to their microwave and radiowave counterparts, are used to convert free-propagating wave into localized energy. Optical antennas are an enabling technology for a lot of applications including efficiency enhancement for photodetection, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and single molecule microscopy.</p> <p>A real-time dielectrophoretic (DEP) process is developed for the assembly of CNTs between electrodes, where the quantity of CNTs between a localized gap can be monitored by measuring the impedance change through the current change rate when nanotubes are bridged. The experimental results have shown that the system response speed is fast to both single wall and multi-wall CNTs, although the impedance differs much. This system will also be applicable to thin layer graphene deposition control and other 2D nanomaterials deposition and localization.</p> <p>To integrate HNB optical antennas onto CNT-based IR sensors, a robotic assembly process is achieved using nanomanipulation under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The application of nanorobotic manipulator and focus ion beam (FIB) has demonstrated the advancement of the 3D nanorobotic assembly in a repeatable and controllable way. The enhancement after integration is confirmed by the electromagnetic simulation. Based on the simulation result, the integration of HNB antenna can increase the local electric field by 58 folds, which makes the CNT-based IR sensors an ideal candidate for non-cryogenic highly sensitive IR detection. The in-situ characterization of a HNB-based optical antenna is investigated from the near field of the assembled devices and far field using a scanning probe. Nanomanipulation technique is employed to improve the controllability and reliability of the nanomanufacturing-based sampling process and realize the <em>in-situ</em> characterization of the antenna performance without inducing the unnecessary errors. A robust test bench consisting of a digital microscope, a nanorobotic manipulator, and a precise five axis stage is used to measure detector photoresponse. The relative position between the IR sensor and IR beam is localized by mapping the photocurrent on laser spot. The distance between photodetector and infrared laser lens is leveraged by digital microscope. By scanning a probe with a helical antenna, the effectiveness of the HNB to serve as a far-field optical antenna has been demonstrated by the experiments and measured field enhancement ranges from 1.5 to 2.3. The experimental results have also shown that the photovoltaic quantum effect dominates CNT-metal Schottky based IR detectors and the photoresponse is dependent on contact size and metal materials. The photoresponsivity can reach up to 16.8 uA/mW at 808 nm wavelength. The proposed method will be applicable for 1D/2D nanoscale material based photodiode characterization.</p> <p>The research is significant because it impacts not only on nanophotonics and nanomanufacturing, but also broader areas of engineering, science and the society in general, which includes: (i) creating new multidisciplinary research and development directions in nanotechnology and electromagnetics research; (ii) providing new sensors and instruments for research and development in engineering, biology and other science fields; (iii) providing a new manufacturing and sensing technology for compact high performance IR detection and imaging systems that are suitable for many applications; (iv) providing a new architecture for building nanoantennas for not only infrared radiation, but also visible light, which possesses the impact for the improvement of the energy adsorption efficiency of solar cells and for photonics research and applications.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/14/2016<br>      Modified by: Lixin&nbsp;Dong</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1301691/1301691_10244506_1478786990536_Fig1_CNTIRSensorswOptAntenna--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1301691/1301691_10244506_1478786990536_Fig1_CNTIRSensorswOptAntenna--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CNT-based IR Sensors with Optical Antennas"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1301691/1301691_10244506_1478786990536_Fig1_CNTIRSensorswOptAntenna--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CNT-based IR Sensors with Optical Antennas"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The design consists of an array of detectors which are formed by a single CNT aligned with a pair of asymmetric metal electrodes.
