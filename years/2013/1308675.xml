<AbstractNarration>Through this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is funding Professor Kathryn Splan from Macalester College to study the interaction of copper(I) with zinc finger protein domains. Cu(I) exhibits high affinity for thiolate ligands, which suggests that thiol-rich metalloprotein binding sites such as the ones present in zinc finger domains, may be disrupted at elevated copper concentrations. Professor Splan uses spectroscopic methods to measure the thermodynamic stability- and speciation of- copper-zinc finger peptide complexes. The research tests the ability of Cu(I) to affect the interactions between zinc fingers and DNA, and thus to modulate the function of zinc fingers. The results of this research may be relevant for understanding the mechanism of copper toxicity and homeostasis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The function of metalloproteins is linked to the metal ion(s) endogenous to the protein.  Substitution of the endogenous metals with exogenous ones is likely to alter the structure and function of the protein. The research conducted by Professor Splan and undergraduate students at Macalaster College addresses such a substitution of zinc by copper in a zinc finger protein, which may underline the toxic effect of copper.  In conducting this research, the students are trained in methods pertaining to both inorganic chemistry and biology.  The research experiences provide the students with skills useful in many areas of chemical and biological research and prepare them for careers in STEM.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Metal ions are essential for many biological processes, and nature has optimized cellular function to ensure that the proper metal ion binds to its intended target. However, similar chemical properties among various biologically relevant metals can also allow for alternate metal ions to interact with binding sites. While metal ion substitution has clear ramifications in the context of metal ion toxicity, changes in protein function upon metal ion substitution may constitute a functional strategy. Therefore, it is important to have a broad understanding of the interaction of cellular metals with their "native" targets as well as proteins and other biomolecules that exhibit similar metal ion preferences.  In this context, this project focused on the interaction of copper with a class of proteins termed "zinc fingers" (ZFs) that require zinc to maintain their proper shape, and therefore, function. Our work showed that copper can readily displace zinc from a variety of ZF proteins, and in some cases, displacement of zinc by copper resulted in a change in structural and/or functional properties. One of the ZF proteins studied herein, the Sp1 transcription factor, controls the expression of genes associated with maintenance of proper cellular copper concentrations via interaction with DNA. Substitution of Sp1 with copper results in a loss of Sp1-DNA binding, establishing copper-Sp1 binding as a putative regulatory mechanism. More broadly, our results with multiple ZF proteins provide a chemical basis for the disruption of zinc protein function under elevated copper levels, which may be particularly relevant in disease states that are characterized by altered copper homeostasis.
