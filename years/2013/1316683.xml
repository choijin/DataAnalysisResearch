<AbstractNarration>The University of Missouri-Columbia is examining an innovative model of situated Professional Development (PD) and the contribution of controlled teaching experiences to teacher learning and, as a result, to student learning.  The project is carrying out intensive research about an existing special PD summer institute (QuEST) that has been in existence for more than five years through a state Improving Teacher Quality Grants program.  The project will do the following: (1) undertake more in-depth and targeted research to better understand the efficacy of the PD model and impacts on student learning; (2) develop and field test resources from the project that can produce broader impacts; and (3) explore potential scale-up of the model for diverse audiences.  The overarching goals of the project are: (a) Implement a high-quality situated PD model for K-6 teachers in science; (b) Conduct a comprehensive and rigorous program of research to study the impacts of this model on teacher and student learning; and (c) Disseminate project outcomes to a variety of stakeholders to produce broader impacts.  A comparison of two groups of teachers will be done.  Both groups will experience a content (physics) and pedagogy learning experience during one week in the summer.  During a second week, one group will experience "controlled teaching" of elementary students, while the other group will not.  Teacher and student gains will be measured using a quantitative and qualitative, mixed-methods design.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A widespread axiom among teachers is that <em>to teach something is to really learn it</em>. This is not dissimilar to theoretical perspectives, in which teachers' specialized knowledge for teaching, or pedagogical content knowledge (PCK; Shulman, 1986), is viewed as arising from classroom teaching experience. Field experiences and practice teaching have long been recognized as essential to the learning of prospective teachers, yet rarely have professional development (PD) experiences for teachers been based around actual teaching experiences. Thus, a common complaint about traditional PD workshops is that they are too far removed from the day-to-day work of the classroom to have meaningful impact (Putnam &amp; Borko, 2000). The <em>Quality Elementary Science Teaching </em>(QuEST) professional development program used an innovative model that allows teachers to gain experience teaching new content and strategies through an embedded practicum experience with children. With funding from the National Science Foundation, our team set out to (1) undertake more in-depth and targeted research to better understand the efficacy of this practicum-based professional development model and impacts on student learning; (2) develop and field test resources from the project that can produce broader impacts; and (3) explore potential scale-up of the model for diverse audiences. Over a three year period, 104 teachers of grades 3-5 from 18 schools in 7 different districts participated in our professional development program.</p> <p>Our main research focus was understanding the impact of the professional development on teachers and their students. The results show teachers increased their content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). Teachers expressed greater confidence in their abilities to teach science, and demonstrated facility in designing instruction using the 5E learning cycle, formative assessment, and principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL). However, we found no significant difference on quantitative assessments between teachers who participated in our practicum-based experience and those who completed a comparison experience. In terms of student achievement, schools in districts that participated in QuEST improved their students' performance on the 5th grade science exam over the three-year project. Again, however, there were no differential effects based on participation in practicum vs. non-practicum programs.</p> <p>The outcomes from our work have yielded useful insights for researchers and professional developers in science. First, it demonstrates that practicum-based professional development models are able to achieve similar outcomes to other program models that are known to be effective. Second, it illustrates how teachers professional development can support teachers in applying principles of UDL to create more inclusive science classrooms. Finally, it alerted us to an overlooked problem in elementary science education. Over the course of the project we were able to document the widespread practice of grade level reassignment of teachers among participating districts and provide evidence of the impact not only on our ability to study the impacts of our professional development programs, but also on teachers' professional development needs. Our research documented how newly reassigned teachers were, in many ways, more akin to their novice colleagues than similarly experienced peers; however, they followed different learning trajectories in the PD. With over 60% of participants being reassigned to new grade levels in the three years following the PD program, the challenge for professional development to help teachers learn new content and curriculum resumes. The insights gained in this project have prompted a new line of research that examines the impacts of teacher reassignment on elementary science teachers and their students.</p> <p>Enhancing teachers' knowledge of content and pedagogical strategies for meeting the needs of all students is important to enhancing the capacity of schools to offer high-quality, inclusive learning opportunities in science. At the elementary school level, these experiences lay a foundation for future learning, and are critical to the formation of students' attitudes and interest in science and science careers. The outcomes of our study demonstrate how practicum-based professional development can play an important role in this. The materials and resources developed as part of the program continue to be used by teachers in participating districts to support not only their own teaching, but that of their colleagues.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/30/2019<br>      Modified by: Deborah&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hanuscin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1316683/1316683_10266984_1572462489560_workshop--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1316683/1316683_10266984_1572462489560_workshop--rgov-800width.jpg" title="QuEST Professional Development Program"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1316683/1316683_10266984_1572462489560_workshop--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="QuEST Professional Development Program"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Teachers work together to apply principles of Universal Design for Learning in order to create more inclusive science learning opportunities.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Steve Addams</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Deborah&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hanuscin</div> <div class="imageTitle">QuEST Professional Development Program</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1316683/1316683_10266984_1572462370868_preservice--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1316683/1316683_10266984_1572462370868_preservice--rgov-800width.jpg" title="QuEST Professional Development Program"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1316683/1316683_10266984_1572462370868_preservice--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="QuEST Professional Development Program"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Practicum-Based Professional Development provides opportunities for teachers to practice teaching new content and strategies with students.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Steve Addams</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Deborah&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hanuscin</div> <div class="imageTitle">QuEST Professional Development Program</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1316683/1316683_10266984_1572462303028_physics--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1316683/1316683_10266984_1572462303028_physics--rgov-800width.jpg" title="QuEST Professional Development Program"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1316683/1316683_10266984_1572462303028_physics--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="QuEST Professional Development Program"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Teachers developed knowledge of physics concepts in the elementary curriculum.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Steve Addams</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Deborah&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hanuscin</div> <div class="imageTitle">QuEST Professional Development Program</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
