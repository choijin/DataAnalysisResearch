<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Aberration-corrected Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) will be used to study magnetic domain wall behavior in a number of multi-ferroic materials which exhibit multiple phase transitions, each giving rise to a fine-scale domain microstructure. The interactions between these domains (for instance, between crystallographic twin boundaries and magnetic domain walls, or between anti-phase boundaries and magnetic domain walls) is the main focus of the proposed research.  Magnetic materials form an important class of materials for a wide variety of engineering applications and it is important to understand how they behave under a changing magnetic field.  When an applied field is reversed, the magnetization in the material will attempt to follow the direction of the field, but this reversal process is strongly influenced by the presence of other crystallographic entities, such as interfaces and line defects.  Phase reconstructed LTEM is the technique of choice to determine the local magnetization state and the potential interactions between domain walls and lattice defects.  The alloys of choice are the ferromagnetic shape memory alloys with compositions near the stoichiometric Ni2MnGa compound and Fe-Pd alloys with around 30 at% Pd. The proposed research will consist of experimental observations of domain walls in static and dynamic conditions, supported by image simulations based on micro-magnetic models. In addition, Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) and Electron Channeling Contrast Imaging (ECCI, in a scanning electron microscope) will be employed to image micro-structural features as well as surface-penetrating defects at a number of different length scales.  The improved spatial resolution offered by aberration-corrected LTEM will enable this quantitative study of static and dynamic domain wall processes, and will make it possible to obtain 3-D information about the magnetization state of the material by carrying out observations with different viewing directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research program will study how the magnetization state of a material changes when a slowly changing magnetic field is applied.  A specialized experimental technique, making use of a transmission electron microscope, will be used to visualize the magnetization pattern, either as a static pattern, or as a dynamic changing pattern when a field is applied.  Magnetic materials form an important class of materials for advanced engineering applications; for instance, in a modern car, there are several hundred magnets for a variety of components (electric motors, door locks, and various sensors).  Understanding the behavior of these materials while they are used in a changing magnetic field is crucial in the context of energy efficiency.  The proposed research may also have an impact in the area of novel magnetic recording media.  The experimental protocols used during this research as well as direct observations will be made available to the broader scientific community.  The educational component of the proposed program has the potential to impact middle and high school science education in several schools in the greater Pittsburgh area.  The program will make several scanning electron microscopes available to students in local middle and high schools, and will educate a number of science teachers so that they can use these microscopes in their class rooms. In addition, the proposed program will provide an opportunity to a number of undergraduate material students to carry out research in the area of mineral identification through collaboration with the Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History located right next to Carnegie Mellon University.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research program is entitled "Domain Walls in Ferromagnetic Shape Memory Alloys". The primary research goal of this project is the quantitative study of the internal structure of magnetic materials.  One of the important features of a magnetic material is the fact that it consists of three-dimensional (3D) arrangements of atomic size magnets, each with a north and a south pole.  Those atomic magnets arrange themselves in domains inside which all the magnet poles are aligned; different domains, however, can have different alignment directions.  When an external magnetic field is applied to these domains, the boundaries between them, the so-called magnetic domain walls, can move around in the material.  In our study, we used a form of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) known as Lorentz TEM to visualize those magnetic domain walls.  In addition to the experimental work, looking at a number of material systems including, Fe-Pt and Fe-Pd alloys as well as Ni2MnGa alloys, we have also developed theoretical models to predict the images observed by Lorentz TEM.  Such predictions are necessary to ensure that our images are properly interpreted.  Our work leads to a better understanding of how the magnetic properties of a material interact with other properties and microstructural features, such as crystal lattice defects and grain boundaries.     In addition to the work performed by graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University, we have also collaborated with the group of Prof. Kavanagh (Simon Fraser University, Canada). We have generated a theoretical model for the images of magnetic nano-wires, and we were successful to extract from experimental images both the magnitude and the direction of the nanoscale magnets inside several cylindrical magnetic wires.  This work is important because it provides other research groups with a quantitative tool to determine the magnetic properties of nano-wires.     Finally, we have succeeded in creating a numerical technique to reconstruct the magnetization state of a nano-scale particle in 3D, i.e., we now have a technique that can determine the orientation of the magnetic moments (the north pole- south pole atomic magnets) in three dimensions.  We anticipate that this work will have a significant impact of the magnetic nano materials community; we are making all of our algorithms available to the scientific community as open source code.  The results of our work have been published in peer-reviewed journal, primarily in the journal Ultramicroscopy.
