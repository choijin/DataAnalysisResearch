<AbstractNarration>This award will provide three years of support for the Midwest Dynamical Systems Seminar (MWDS); the first occurrence of this conference to be funded by this grant will be  October 25-27, 2013 at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. The MWDS is one of the country's longest running and most influential analysis conference series: it has been in existence for over forty years, the last twenty-two with NSF support. The MWDS has  positively affected the careers of several generations of mathematicians. It is not possible to tabulate the number of mathematical papers that have resulted from the interactions that the event has fostered. The MDWS meets annually at venues all around the country, but primarily at locations in the Midwest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the many long-standing, recurring mathematical conferences in the US, the MWDS stands out as a model of successful efforts to ensure diversity and broaden participation. From its inception the MWDS has displayed as one of its hallmarks the inclusion of women, young mathematicians, and members of underrepresented groups. This will not change with the current award: the bulk of the forty individuals who will receive support for any meeting of the MWDS will be women and young mathematicians (graduate students, postdocs, untenured assistant professors).</AbstractNarration>

Dynamical Systems is one of the most active areas of mathematical research and has interactions with almost every other area of mathematics, as well as with physics, biology, chemistry, astronomy, meteorology, medicine, and other sciences.

The conferences continued its tradition of bringing together researchers from all branches of dynamics, promoting interactions with other areas of mathematics, of providing opportunities for recent PhD's to present their work, and of attracting students to the field. The talks not only presented recent important developments but pointed towards new areas of promising research. As in the past, the participation of women and minorities was encouraged.
