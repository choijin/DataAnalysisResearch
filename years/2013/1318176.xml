<AbstractNarration>In many primate societies, including humans, individuals form strong, long-lasting social bonds which can be adaptive, for example, by increasing longevity, offspring survival, and, ultimately, reproductive success.  What is still poorly understood are the mechanisms by which social bonds achieve their effects. One possibility is that, because of their known function in helping individuals cope with stressors, social bonds mitigate negative effects of chronic stress on health and reproduction. But whether, and how, daily-life social stress influences female reproduction in primate societies also is poorly understood. This project will address both of the above gaps in our knowledge by examining the pathways connecting variation in social bonds with measures of health and reproduction. It will assess whether stress hormones mediate the susceptibility to intestinal parasite infections; examine the relationship between social stress and reproductive physiology; and evaluate whether social bonds mediate success in feeding competition, and hence, energy available for reproduction. Data for this project will be collected from three troops of chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) in the Cape Peninsula of South Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's multifaceted data will include behavioral observations to document sources of stress and social bonds; measurement of stress and reproductive hormones, as well as intestinal parasite loads, via non-invasively collected fecal samples; and collection of urinary C-peptide (a byproduct of insulin production) to measure energy balance.  Additionally, a novel field experiment will be conducted in which intestinal parasites are eliminated from a random selection of females to assess, for the first time in a wild primate, the factors associated with the timing and intensity of re-infection. Utilizing this comprehensive approach, the research will generate new insights into the mechanisms linking social behavior, stress physiology, health, and reproduction, and help elucidate the function of social bonds in primate societies.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because non-human primates such as baboons share many traits with humans and are useful in studying aspects of human biology, this project will improve understanding of the benefits of sociality during human evolution and carry clinical implications by elucidating the role of social stress as a risk factor for parasite infections.  The project will strengthen institutional ties between the U.S. and South Africa, train students underrepresented in science, and provide valuable data and educational resources to aid in management and conservation of primates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Baboons experience stress in the same way that humans do, and they are also equally as social as humans.  Thus to better understand the links between sociality, stress, and health in humans, we use wild baboons as a model.   Our main questions center on the mechanisms by which sociality tempers the effects of stress on reproduction and health.  Specifically, we propose that individuals that experience more stress suffer from heavier loads of intestinal parasites, which negatively impact health and reproduction, and that stronger social bonds alleviate this stress and therefore lead to better health and reproductive benefits.  To investigate this possibility, we conducted a study of the behavioral ecology, endocrinology, and parasitology of two troops of wild baboons in the Tokai Forest in the Cape Peninsula of South Africa.  We collected over 1700 hours of detailed behavioral observations, 4600 fecal samples for analysis of stress and reproductive hormones, 5060 fecal samples for analysis of intestinal parasites, and 1100 urine samples for measurement of energy balance.  We are still in the process of analyzing data and at the time of this report have not yet produced any scientific results based on the entire project data set.  Small subsets of our larger data set, however, have been analyzed and have led to three undergraduate honors theses, by Ilana Zucker Scharff, Chandra Swanson, and Anna Willoughby, as well as data analysis, write-up, and conference presentation experience instrumental to graduate school admission for Tessa Steiniche.  From a broader perspective, this project has had additional numerous positive impacts.  We have provided training opportunities for over 30 post-bachelors volunteers and undergraduate students, who have obtained valuable skills in primatology field methods, data organization, and project management.  In addition, two laboratory assistants, Morgan Jackson at the Conservation Biology Institute at the Smithsonian Institution and Val Kelly in the Appleton lab at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa, have been trained to contribute to the processing and analyses of biological samples.  From a public outreach perspective, the PI has submitted research reports and given lectures to members of the South African National Parks service, the South African CapeNature regional wildlife authority, the City of Cape Town, and the Cape Peninsula Baboon Technical Team, who manage the baboon population.  Overall, the project has provided valuable data to aid in management and conservation of baboons and has led to strengthened institutional ties between the City University of New York and the University of Cape Town in South Africa.  Ultimately, we expect this project to generate new insights into the mechanisms linking social behavior, stress physiology, health, and reproduction and help elucidate the function of social bonds in primate societies.  Because baboons share many traits with humans and are useful in studying aspects of human biology, this project will both help us understand the benefits of sociality during human evolution and carry clinical implications by elucidating the role of social stress as a risk factor for parasite infections.
