<AbstractNarration>This project is addressing a persistent problem in engineering education:  the mismatch between the writing skills of program graduates and the demands of writing in the workplace.  This project is identifying problems in undergraduate student writing by analyzing student writing and high quality practitioner writing.  A team of linguists and engineers is then addressing the problems by developing teaching materials that integrate instruction about effective organization, grammar, and vocabulary into civil engineering classes.  After the use of the new materials, student writing improvement is being assessed from multiple perspectives that cover language features, organization, and overall effectiveness. The project has many innovative features that contribute to its intellectual merit:  the integration of engineering practitioners' perspectives into classroom teaching materials, the synthesis of writing skills and engineering content, the use of empirical analysis to identify student writing weaknesses, and the application of multiple methods to assess the instructional materials' effectiveness. The project's broader impacts include the participation of universities with a high percentage of students from groups that are underrepresented in civil engineering; stronger writing skills can facilitate their participation in this field.  Furthermore, effective communication has been found to be the single largest variable in infrastructure project success; poor communication in documents can lead to a waste of time and taxpayer dollars and even to injuries and death.  Thus, the benefits of teaching civil engineers to write more effectively extend far beyond the profession of civil engineering itself.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project addressed a persistent problem in civil engineering education: the mismatch between the writing skills of program graduates and the demands of writing in the workplace. Overall, the project found that students' writing improved significantly when the students received explicit instruction that tied writing skills to civil engineering content and practice. The writing was more effective for meeting concerns expressed by engineers in the workplace. Specifically, the students' word choices, grammar, and organization better met concerns that practitioners had for accuracy, precision, liability, credibility and client expectations. The project relied on collaboration among engineering practitioners, engineering faculty, and applied linguists (who study how people adapt their language for different contexts and purposes).</p> <p>The project had four major components. First, we identified the most serious student writing weaknesses by analyzing differences between student writing and effective workplace writing. We compiled a text corpus of practitioner documents from 40 civil engineering workplaces and student papers from four different universities, including a Historically Black University, a Hispanic-serving Institution, and a university with a high percentage of immigrant and nontraditional students. We used techniques from applied linguistics to analyze the differences between the student and practitioner writing quantitatively and qualitatively. We also interviewed practitioners to identify the problems that would be most serious in the workplace.&nbsp; The problems included specific language features - such as inappropriately absolute words and extremely complicated sentence structures - and global issues, such as missing information or disjointed organization. We used interviews with students to identify reasons behind the writing problems.
