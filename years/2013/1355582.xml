<AbstractNarration>The Department of Computer Science at Kean University is implementing "Project ASK: Applying Student Knowledge (ASK) for Success in Computer Science (CS) and Information Technology (IT)," which is aimed at increasing the number of academically talented, financially needy students graduating with undergraduate degrees in CS and IT.   Project ASK supports a total of 40 transfer students and rising juniors who each receive two-year scholarships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ASK Scholars participate in weekly workshops, cohort experiences, and interact closely with faculty members who provide academic and professional support through advising and mentoring.  They gain leadership experience from participating in professional student organizations and local and regional programming contests. The individual and cohort experiences offered to ASK Scholars provide a basis for intellectual growth and promote increased student confidence, retention, and timely degree completion.   Upon graduation, ASK Scholars are prepared to enter the scientific workforce or graduate school as competent, highly trained individuals who are skilled in teamwork and research, serve as role models to members of their communities and contribute to increased diversity in the fields of CS and IT.</AbstractNarration>

Over half of the students were transfer students and almost three-quarters of the students were from underrepresented groups in computing and information technology. All recipients now have professional jobs in New Jersey or elsewhere in the US and several have completed graduate degrees.   Weekly workshops were held during this project, building a cohort community of students, with students helping each other with problem solving, teamwork, and leadership.

A local hackathon was developed as part of this project, and Hack Kean has been held annually each spring for the past five years. Many project participants worked on Hack Kean in leadership roles.  In addition to the established ACM student chapter at Kean, two new student groups have been established during this project. The ACM-Women (ACM-W) and Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS) chapters provided additional leadership roles for project participants and other students and continue to be strong.  The recruiting and retention model developed as part of this project has been adopted by the School of Computer Science and Technology at Kean and shared with other schools and with the Computing Alliance for Hispanic Serving Institutions (CAHSI) a NSF INCLUDES Alliance.  Study plans were designed for project participants, with coursework for each semester identified, and these study plans were updated throughout the student's academic career.  The success of this planning process has resulted in study plans being used with all students in the School of Computer Science and Technology. A peer-led mentoring program was developed and has grown to support all students in the School of Computer Science and Technology.  Members of this project were the initial student leaders during the first years of the peer-mentoring effort.   Overall, this project immediately benefited the 40 scholarship recipients, with additional lasting benefit through faculty advising methodologies, the development of a cohort community, and peer mentoring.
