<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovations Research Phase (SBIR) II project is to support the continued development of using proprietary perfusion decellularization technology to create a fully revascularized cardiac patch for the treatment of ischemic heart disease and congenital heart repair. Current surgical approaches for cardiac reconstruction utilize synthetic materials that do not have the ability to grow and remodel with the patient.  Feasibility will be demonstrated by in-vitro and in-vivo characterization to create a perfusable cardiac-derived revascularized cardiac patch to promote faster reconstruction of functional tissue by providing a fully perfusable scaffold with a composition and architecture similar to native cardiac tissue.  This product will have significant advantages over existing technologies, including: 1) full thickness, biological, cardiac-derived matrix material; 2) vascular supply to support migrating cells and remodeling; 3) superior mechanical properties; and, 4) no need for immunosuppressive therapies. Moreover, this will be the first cardiac-derived, revascularized patch available for treating ischemic areas of the heart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, is the development of a revascularized cardiac patch to treat ischemic heart failure and congenital repair in a way that is superior to existing technologies.  While medical advancements have decreased the overall mortality rate for acute myocardial infarction patients, therapeutic options are lacking to address the underlying loss of myocardial tissue, resulting in a mortality rate greater than 33% at five years. Inhibiting the onset or delaying the severity of heart failure will have a significant effect on lowering this mortality rate and reducing the treatment cost of heart failure, which currently is estimated at over $37 billion annually. The use of this product will further enhance the medical and scientific understanding of the mechanisms by which damaged cardiac tissue may be restored/repaired and patient life may be extended following myocardial infarction.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Miromatrix? Small Business Innovations Research Phase II grant demonstrated the ability of using Miromatrix' perfusion decellularization technology to create a fully revascularized cardiac patch capable of maintaining physiological blood pressures for the treatment of ischemic heart disease and congenital heart repair along with an acellular cardiac patch. While medical advancements, including percutaneous coronary interventions ("PCI"), have decreased the overall mortality rate for acute MI patients, the lack of therapeutic options available to address the underlying loss of myocardial tissue results in patients? progression towards Congestive Heart Failure ("CHF"), resulting in a mortality rate greater than 33% only five years following the initial event.  For congenital repair, current surgical approaches for cardiac reconstruction utilize synthetic materials that do not have the ability to grow with the patient and do not provide any contractile function.  Miromatrix? cardiac-derived revascularized cardiac patch may promote faster reconstruction of functional tissue by providing a fully perfusable scaffold with a composition and architecture similar to the tissue that it is intended to replace.     Broader Impacts  The broader commercial impact of this research is the development of a revascularized cardiac patch and acellular cardiac patch to treat ischemic heart failure and congenital repair.  The ability of the material to be remodeled and functionally grow with the patient will be of great value to repair congenital cardiac defects and to inhibit the progression towards heart failure following a myocardial infarction.  Inhibiting the onset or delaying the severity of heart failure will have a significant effect on reducing the treatment cost of heart failure, which currently is estimated at over $37 billion in 2010 for indirect and direct costs.  This product with have significant advantages over existing technologies including: 1) full thickness, biological, cardiac-derived matrix material; 2) vascular supply to support migrating cells and remodeling; 3) superior mechanical properties; and, 4) no need for immunosuppressive therapies.  Moreover, this will be the first cardiac-derived, re-vascularized patch available for treating ischemic areas of the heart.
