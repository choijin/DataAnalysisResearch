<AbstractNarration>To enable resilient, eight to fourteen story, timber buildings in regions of high seismicity in the United States, this planning grant combines innovative concepts in seismic load resisting systems with a new form of a mass timber structural component, called cross laminated timber (CLT), to research three potential structural systems for resilient, tall CLT building construction: (a) single-story, pre-stressed re-centering walls, (b) multi-story, segmental rocking walls, and (c) deformable floor diaphragms with supplemental damping devices. These systems will be distributed vertically along the height of the building, combining deformable panels or layers with relatively rigid and stiff ones, to leverage CLT behavior, enable rapid construction, and limit the impact of higher modes. Based on their performance in component-level testing and system-level simulation conducted as part of this research, promising systems that are economically competitive will be selected for full-scale experimental investigation in follow-on research.  This planning phase research will generate fundamental knowledge on resilient, multi-story panelized systems that have the potential to transform the seismic design of taller buildings in general. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As urban densification occurs in U.S. regions of high seismicity, there is a natural demand for tall buildings that can survive large earthquakes with minimal damage and interruption. CLT is a naturally sustainable material that has been used in Europe and Australia to rapidly construct multi-story buildings. However, existing multi-story CLT constructions were limited to regions of low seismicity because there is no seismic design methodology for tall CLT buildings worldwide.  In the U.S. Pacific Northwest, there is significant interest in utilizing CLT in eight to fourteen story residential and commercial buildings due to its appeal as a potential locally sourced, sustainable, and economically competitive building material. With combined expertise from the research and design community, this project will address this societal need by prototyping three potential structural systems that are suitable for tall CLT buildings in high seismicity regions, comparing their performance through experimentation and simulation, and developing performance-based seismic design methods for their implementation. Once the optimal systems are selected in this study and verified at full-scale in subsequent research, it is envisioned that a resilient, tall CLT building will become an option for west coast cities in about six to eight years. In addition to providing research training for students working on the project, the project will deliver educational resources to introduce this new sustainable building type to students, stakeholders, and the general public.  Data from this project will be archived and made available to the public through the NEES data repository.  This award is part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project quantified the cyclic response characteristics for the two-layer floor system were quantified and are available for use by modelers.  While similar to a standard friction damper system, the project illustrated that the friction coefficient is not linearly proportional to dead load applied, nor is it independent of displacement rate.  These characteristic values have been implemented in a computer model of a 10-story building with one, two, and three planes.  The model illustrates that the introduction of the first slip plane provides the most significant reduction in story forces, both above and below the slip plane.  Introducing more than three planes of slip in the building becomes ineffective in providing further reductions in story forces that need to be resisted by the building lateral force resisting system. Initial results indicate that the forces imposed on the bottom story of a 10-story building are reduced as much as 60%, while the response of the upper stories remains elastic, indicating that the resilience of the building is significantly improved to where the building should experience no significant damage in a design-level earthquake.  What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?  One Master of Science graduate student was supported in this project.  The thesis will be completed in the Spring of 2016 due to the studentÆs request to take a leave of absence for the Fall, 2015 term to care for her terminally ill mother, which was granted.  A second Master of Science student, that was unfunded, also finished a thesis that was related to this project.  Mr. Vincent Bordry conducted the initial computer investigation of the distributed base-isolation system for multi-story buildings.  He is now working for the French Space Agency, CNES.  How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?  Findings from this research have been disseminated to interested parties and the public through three major venues:   1.     Conferences and workshops:   Conference Presentation: "High-rise Cross Laminated Timber Building: Design and Performance" Structures Congress 2014, Boston MA.
