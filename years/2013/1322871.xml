<AbstractNarration>This Pathways project, led by Hubbard Brook Research Foundation (HBRF), develops and pilots a model to foster engagement and learning among diverse stakeholders related to timely ecosystem, social, economic, and policy issues in rural regions of New England's Northern Forest. As such, this project seeks to serve as a model for how other rural areas across the US that have pressing concerns that relate to science, technology, mathematics, and engineering (STEM) may partner with scientists, community members, and local organizations to better understand and become involved in regional issues. Research carried out for more than 50 years at the 7,800-acre Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest?among the longest-running ecosystem studies in the world?has significant implications for decision making at local as well as national levels on topics including climate change, environmental stresses on tree physiology, biomass energy, and invasive pests and pathogens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By employing a Pubic Engagement with Science approach, the project goals focus on learning and equitable participation by both public audiences (local communities and organizations) and professional audiences (scientists who want to engage in informal science learning). In this case, "equitable" means valuing the  experiences and knowledge that diverse people have. "Learning" is designed to occur for all participants, such that everyone has a deeper, broader, and more nuanced understanding of STEM, the regional issues, and opportunities for the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HBRF has designed a three-part model that includes multi-stakeholder dialogue events, workshops and dialogues with scientists working in the region, and regional capacity building for supporting outcomes of the dialogues and workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project evaluation aligns closely with the Public Engagement with Science approach and project goals. As such, over the course of project activities, the evaluation  measures both the public's learning and capacity to engage with other stakeholder around regional issues as well as those of the scientists. In addition, the evaluation will document the strategies and capacities of the  HBRF model to broaden and sustain productive interactions among diverse regional stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination of this pilot project's findings include a case study reflecting on the process, lessons learned, and potential best practices related to the PES model as well as presentations by project leadership at community, scientific, and educational meetings. The pilot would then provide a foundation for an on-going, expanded effort for HBRF in the Northern Forest and/or an expanded effort in the region around a set off issues. In either case, the full-scale project would build from the refined model as well as the capacity built through the pilot.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Intellectual Merit:  This Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) pilot study focused on developing a roundtable dialogue method of public engagement with science in order to investigate mutual learning among stakeholder audiences in the rural Northern Forest region of the northeastern US and scientists from the long-term Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study. Over the project period, the PIs convened 7 roundtable dialogue events involving 137 participants. As a result of these activities and an external evaluation by researchers from RMC Research Corp., the project resulted in a set of best practices for convening roundtable dialogues with scientists and stakeholders, published as a resource on www.informalscience.org.   Using the roundtable method, as well as a survey of scientists and a systematic review of social science data (Berg et al., 2015), the PIs identified a list of priority concerns and values related to forest ecosystems for multiple stakeholder groups and community members, and a list of priority topics Hubbard Brook scientists have for public engagement. Defining the overlap of these areas of interest as the "engagement space," these results represent a co-created agenda for future public engagement with science efforts.  This pilot study resulted in new insights into the views, motivations, and barriers toward participation in public engagement with science by both stakeholders and scientists. The study also allowed the PIs to develop a strategic understanding of the feedbacks between dialogue-based public engagement and other modes of science communication.  Broader Impacts: The PIs made presentations to &gt;350 scientists over the course of the project about public engagement with science and the benefits of public engagement with science for the broader impacts of ecosystem research. This project provided two training opportunities in public engagement with science and science communication for 30+ Hubbard Brook scientists. As a result of this project, several ongoing ecosystem research projects at Hubbard Brook now incorporate dialogue-based engagement with stakeholders and community members as part of their methods.
