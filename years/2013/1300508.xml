<AbstractNarration>Support from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation will allow Professor Christopher Bradley of Mount St. Mary's University to investigate the ability of cyclopentadienyl (Cp) cobalt(I) sources to mediate stoichiometric and catalytic carbon-hydrogen bond activation. A combination of computational and synthetic studies will permit structure/reactivity trends to be established for C-H activation in both monomeric and aggregate [Cp-Co] fragments. Specifically, catalytic alkane dehydrogenation will be targeted. The proposed research involves continued mentoring of both high school and undergraduate students in a research environment. In particular, economically disadvantaged high school students in the Maryland and Washington D.C. metro area will have the opportunity to conduct summer research in synthetic chemistry. The students will be encouraged to continue their college education at Mount St. Mary's, through the Third Century Scholar Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conversion of aliphatic hydrocarbons to unsaturated products has great value to a range of fields, including commodity chemical and polymer synthesis. Performing this transformation using more abundant metals as catalysts under milder conditions would therefore be ideal. The abilities developed by both high school and undergraduate students supported by this award will prepare them well for pursuit of advanced degrees in the chemical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on the development of earth abudant catalysts to mediate chemical reactions of importance to chemical industry. Currently, most chemical feedstocks derived from petroleum are converted to more useful materials under extreme conditions. A transition metal catalyst can lower the harsh conditions needed for these processes. Current catalysts employ expensive and scarce metals, like iridium and rhodium, to mediate this chemistry.  Our approach was to translate this reactivity to metals that are easily accessible and abundant in the earth's crust, specifically cobalt. By attaching very labile stabilizing groups to the metal center, we were able to access incredibly reactive cobalt species, which activated carbon-hydrogen bonds in a variety of molecules. In one instance, for the first time, we isolated the reactive cobalt species, allowing us to watch the fundamental reactivity at the metal center with a variety of organic molecules. The information gained from these studies on a well defined cobalt complex pave the way for development of new cobalt catalysts with greater activity, hopefully rivaling the reactions mediated by precious metals.  The project also allowed the PI to encourage both undergraduates and high school students to pursue research in synthetic chemistry. As a result of their experiences, a number of undergraduates who worked on the project attended graduate school in chemistry. In addition, the research infrastructure improved tremendously at Mount St. Mary's, paving the way for ACS accreditation of our chemistry program and establishment of a permanent endowment to support summer research students.
