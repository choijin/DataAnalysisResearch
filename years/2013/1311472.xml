<AbstractNarration>Selfish genetic elements can promote their own transmission into the next generation, even if there is a cost to the inclusive fitness of the host. They are found in all eukaryotes, including, for example, mammals, plants, insects, birds, and fish. A classic example of a selfish genetic element is X-chromosome meiotic drive. 'X-drive' causes males to pass on the driving X chromosome to all of their offspring, which are all daughters. As a result of this biased transmission, theory predicts that X-drive could spread rapidly in a population and potentially drive it to extinction, due to a lack of males. Contrary to this prediction, X-drive is often observed at low to moderate frequencies in nature. The goal of this research is to understand how variation in female mating behavior may counteract the spread of X-drive. The investigators will perform experimental evolution with the fruit fly Drosophila neotestacea to provide new insights into how host behaviors can affect whether X-drive invades into a population, and the frequency at which it is maintained in a population. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study will deepen our understanding of how X-drive is maintained as a polymorphism in nature, and may be broadly applied to other species. Selfish genetic elements have been proposed for use in pest control regimes for insects that are vectors for devastating diseases. Thus, understanding the dynamics of driving chromosomes in nature may inform pest management practices. Additionally, this project will provide ample opportunities for undergraduate research training.</AbstractNarration>
