<AbstractNarration>Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STS Scholars Award is to support research on a project in the conceptual foundations of physics. The standard view concerning the fundamental postulates of a physical theory is that they are independent assertions about the nature of space, time, matter, and their mutual interactions. The proposed alternative hypothesis to be examined by the principal investigator (PI) holds that physical theories are better understood as a network of mutually inter-dependent principles and assumptions. The proposed study will focus on the central principles of classical field theories, particularly theories of gravitation. Those principles include conservation principles, energy conditions, and field equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While it well known that some principles of classical field theories may be derived from others, the idea that this inter-derivability is ubiquitous (or nearly so) and that this is essential to understanding the foundations of physical theories are novel claims. Also novel is the proposal to systematically explore these interconnections. If the alternative hypothesis of the PI is correct, then the basic postulates of our best physical theories are mutually supporting and constraining in ways that have not previously been systematically recognized; in that case, understanding these interconnections is essential to a full account of the philosophical and mathematical foundations of these theories. Testing the hypothesis will involve new technical work in the mathematical foundations of classical field theories as well as conceptual and philosophical analysis of both new and previously known results. Results will be communicated in physics and mathematics journals as well as philosophy journals, and will form the basis of a monograph on the foundations of classical field theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will also explore the implications for topics in general philosophy of science, including explanation and theory change, provided that the hypothesis turns out to be correct. In addition, it would be expected that the hypothesis applies more broadly to include quantum theories and perhaps scientific theories more generally. In addition, the proposed project will integrate research with graduate education. The project includes many small, well-defined problems that will provide opportunities for collaborative work with graduate students. These collaborations will form the basis for the development and implementation of a hybrid model of graduate education, drawing from education traditions in philosophy and in theoretical physics, to facilitate broader participation in research by early graduate students from under-served groups. To that end, the PI will partner with existing organizations that are working to increase diversity in philosophy and the sciences such as Hypatia, which aims to improve retention and recruitment of women in philosophy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our best physical theories are based on a handful of central principles: mass and energy are conserved over time; bodies move along straight lines in space-time unless acted upon by an outside force; nothing can move faster than the speed of light; and so on.  It is tempting to think of these principles as axioms: fundamental laws, each of which is true or false independent of the others.  But this picture is flawed.  In fact, the central principle of our physical theories depend on and constrain one another.  In some cases, given some principles, one can uniquely derive the others; in other cases, in order to make some of some fundamental claims about physics, many background assumptions must already be in place&mdash;background assumptions that themselves have a status much like the principles that depend on them.  The goal of this project was to chart these mathematical, conceptual, and explanatory links between the fundamental principles of a particular class of physical theories, known as classical field theories.  This class of theories includes general relativity, the theory of gravitation introduced by Einstein in 1915, and classical Yang-Mills theory, which is the pre-quantum theory on which the so-called Standard Model of particle physics is based.  The project made substantial progress towards this goal.  The principal accomplishments were (a) to formulate and prove a much stronger theorem than was previously available concerning the relationship, in general relativity, between force-free (inertial) motion, conservation of energy, and the requirements that mass must be positive and cannot propagate faster than light; (b) to establish the relationship between the conservation of mass-energy and the laws of nature governing how matter evolves, and to show how these laws are related to the motion of small bodies and the geometry of spacetime; (c) to show, counterintuitively, that the prohibition on "faster-than-light" motion, often taken to be a central principle of relativity theory, is actually much less dependent on other parts of the theory than other core principles; (d) and to develop a new criterion for when two theories should be taken to be "theoretically equivalent" that helps to identify which features of a theory are essential, and which depend on a choice of formulation.  A second goal of the project was pedagogical: it was to develop and implement a hybrid model of graduate education that drew on elements from both physics and philosophy.  The idea was to create a more collaborative and mutually supportive research environment, in which graduate students who feel less alienated than in some humanities PhD programs, while also developing research skills and independence.  Four PhD students and one undergraduate were supported on this grant, leading to both single-authored and co-authored articles.  Two students who were trained on this model received PhDs during the grant period, and two more expect to finish in Spring 2018.
