<AbstractNarration>SES-1303573 &lt;br/&gt;Mary Nell Trautner&lt;br/&gt;Sarah Smith&lt;br/&gt;SUNY at Buffalo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What roles do organizations and institutions play in the socialization of youths? By exploring students' accounts of their experiences with school staff, the researcher will conduct an organizational analysis to better understand the role that schools have in the socialization of youth. In particular, the researcher will complete an analysis of school-based health education, which represents a formalized, institutional attempt to foster a particular set of dispositions to health.  The research will examine school based sex education (SBSE) where the training is based on assumptions about its preventative potential for sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy.  Prior research, however, does not address how young people make sense of SBSE so that it may have these intended effects. Similarly, analyses of SBSE policy, rhetoric, and curricula tend to focus on the ways in which adults perceive SBSE, with scant focus on students' perceptions. In contrast, studies of social learning focus on young people?s exposure to messages about sex and sexuality from other sources such as media, religion, family, and school contexts beyond the SBSE classroom. This research bridges literature on SBSE with research on how youth interpret messages about sex and sexuality. In interviews with 60 boys and girls from one low-achieving and one-high achieving school in Western New York, the analyses will address how young people describe SBSE, in what ways young people describe SBSE as having influences on their attitudes about sex, and differences in the stories youth tell across race, class, and gender, and other characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will introduce new scholars from underrepresented groups to the field of social science through the use of a diverse group of undergraduate assistants. Undergraduate assistants will gain valuable knowledge and experience in social science research methods. Through their participation as research assistants, undergraduate students will have access to data for their student theses. Further, the researcher will solicit feedback from the academic community (i.e., via conference presentations and correspondence with experts in the field), as well as local practitioners in the field (i.e., sex education teachers, school nurses, etc.) and in-turn, provide post-analysis presentations to both academic and public audiences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Scholars have long argued schools play important roles in organizing and reproducing dominant meanings and values across social fields to legitimize structural inequalities. Sex education in particular is an important institutional arbiter in the teaching and learning of both official language and unwritten social rules surrounding sex and sexualities, reproducing stigma regarding sexually transmitted infections (STI), pregnancy, and sexual identity. This dissertation extends that literature in two ways. First, by sampling at two different schools in the same public school district, I explore ways in which teens&rsquo; perspectives may be shaped by organizational-level differences in context, such as school rank, demographic composition, and aggregate levels of poverty at each site. Second, where much United States based literature on sex education focuses on adults, is limited to girls, and/or narrowly examines outcomes such as pregnancy, my research explores patterns of thematic similarity and difference in meanings internalized by girls and boys. Drawing on 63 interviews, I find that students perceive sex education&rsquo;s lessons through amplification of fear-based, stigmatizing messages about pregnant teens and those suffering STI. By simultaneously muting talk about same-sex relationships and amplifying fear of infection and pregnancy, sex education reinforced dominance of heteronormativity and homophobia for most students. Further, I find that students make sex education meaningful first through adults&rsquo; perceptions of risk that overshadow students&rsquo; own perceptions of risk, and second through anticipations of their own adulthoods. Lastly, while the majority of students at both schools lacked knowledge about consent, boys at the low-ranked school were particularly vulnerable to this lapse, as well as to stereotypes of the hypersexual teen. These findings contribute to sociological theories of risk perception and risk communication, as well as feminist and intersectional scholarship on gender and sexualities. Further, the findings of this project have broader implications for the design and delivery of school-based sex education.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/08/2015<br>      Modified by: Sarah&nbsp;H&nbsp;Smith</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
