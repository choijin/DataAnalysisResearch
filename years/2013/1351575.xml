<AbstractNarration>Over the course of  this five-year, young investigator award, the PI will investigate the prospects and problems of creating a global nuclear emergency response through an integrated research, education, and outreach program. The PI will generate a comprehensive map of existing nuclear disaster response experts and will bring these experts into conversation with each other through an  international workshop and a cycle of interrelated graduate seminars. The PI will also investigate the historical dimensions of nuclear emergency expertise, to formulate and disseminate conclusions about what policies work (or don't), and to discover what types of expertise were used, needed, and valued in actual emergencies. This goal synthesizes lessons from past nuclear incidents and disasters, Cold War civil defense, and homeland security preparations for "dirty bombs."  Under her supervision, students will engage in an oral history project with nuclear emergency responders to preserve a record of their experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to upper division undergraduate and graduate curriculum for nuclear engineering and graduate work in Science and Technology Studies  whereby students will engage in policy-relevant research and active, reflexive learning, including developing publicly accessible web resources.</AbstractNarration>

The dread of future nuclear accidents had prompted some governments to begin phasing out nuclear power entirely, while other nations continued to expand their nuclear industries. This project set out to examine the post-Fukushima efforts to improve nuclear emergency preparedness and response (EPR) through an integrated research, education, and outreach program, relying on the interdisciplinary tool-kit of Science and Technology Studies (STS).  Efforts to strengthen nuclear emergency response have been conducted in multiple countries but for most of the award period, these programs remained relatively isolated from each other. This project looked specifically at the US, Russia, Germany, and France, to identify characteristics of these individual national approaches. While there are some common features, e.g. a reliance on hierarchical incident command system structures, the PI and his two postdoctoral associates also found significant differences in terms of emphasis, e.g. on hardware versus personnel training.  We also studied the historical dimensions of nuclear emergency expertise, and the project team conducted interviews with responders to past nuclear emergencies, such as Chernobyl and Three Mile Island.

The project has been able to connect international nuclear EPR experts via a series of lectures and discussions (the Seminar on Interdisciplinary Research and Education in Nuclear Emergency Response, SIREN), and, at a point where national programs are largely completed and multinational cooperation becomes the next logical step, laid the groundwork for future collaboration across disciplines and nations. In terms of broader impacts, the archive of SIREN events will allow disaster response professionals to gain insights into an area that has previously been neglected, perhaps due to the rare occurrence of nuclear/radiological emergencies.  The new, interdisciplinary graduate certificate in "Nuclear Science, Technology, and Policy," offered jointly by STS, the Nuclear Engineering program, and the School of Public and International Affairs at VT, offers students from all backgrounds an opportunity to gain fundamental training in nuclear policy issues, and to collaborate on interdisciplinary, real-world problems in the nuclear area, including, but not limited to, nuclear emergency response.
