<AbstractNarration>This action funds Amit Shavit of the University of Pennsylvania to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Academia Sinica in Taipei.  The project title is "Molecular Simulations of Confined Polymer Films." The host scientist is Dr. Yeng-Long Chen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although ultra-confined deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) appears throughout the human body and within many biotechnological applications, it is unclear exactly how ultra confinement itself affects the characteristics and properties of DNA.  It is typically difficult to physically manipulate DNA molecules under such confinement, which makes molecular simulations extremely advantageous in this area.  This project investigates polymers, such as DNA, using molecular simulations, with a focus on observing how such materials change under ultra-confined dimensions. Results from this project might aid in the development of improved nanodevices for disease detection, as well as advanced gene therapies that rely on the manipulation of DNA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the Principal Investigator (PI) plans to hold a workshop upon his return to the United States, where he will teach others the techniques he learned overseas.  He also to present results to interdisciplinary groups within his institution and to participate in a local series of "Geek Night" public outreach talks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Although confined deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) frequently appears in the human body and within various biotechnical applications, the lack of technological advancements and methods to manipulate DNA have prevented investigations of precisely how DNA behaves at this nanoscopic length scale.  Recent technological advancements now allow scientists to track and detect single DNA molecules using both experimental and computational techniques.  Jointly utilizing these techniques has significantly increased the field's understanding of DNA and its behavior in nanochannels and nanoslits, as well as provided a microscopic picture of the entropic interactions governing behaviors of confined DNA.  However, much of DNA's behavior under confinement and at various polymer densities remains unknown.              In this project, we used Brownian Dynamics simulations of DNA-like polymers to understand their behavior in confined dimensions.  Previous simulations looked at the behavior of a single polymer chain, but we extend these ideas to study many chain systems.  Even more interesting is to understand how the properties of confined polymers change as we cross the so-called dilute-semidilute regime.  In the dilute regime, the chain can be approximated as interacting only with itself.  However, in the semidilute regime, any single chain is surrounded by other chains, which not only interact with, but also affect its behavior in various ways.  This project focused on the behaviors of DNA-like polymers in both regimes, and our results indicate interesting phenomena that have not previously been seen or published.  We continue to collaborate on this project and we plan to publish the results in the upcoming calendar year.          Last Modified: 12/02/2013       Submitted by: Amit Shavit]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
