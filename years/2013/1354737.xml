<AbstractNarration>Why are some organisms specialized, while others can survive under many conditions? This research tests the idea that patterns of gene expression in individuals are molded to specific environments through processes analogous to learning. This kind of mechanism should come with costs such as delayed breeding or fewer offspring, leading to tradeoffs associated with being a generalist. The proposed research will test these ideas using caterpillars of a crop pest species, the cabbage white butterfly. This species feeds on a wide range of plants in the mustard family, such as broccoli and canola. However, after an individual has experienced one food source, they do poorly if switched to a new food source, suggestive of a type of physiological memory. This research will test whether genetic differences in specialization between agricultural and nonagricultural populations are associated with differences in gene expression variability and associated reproductive tradeoffs. The expected results will have implications for understanding how crop pests adapt to monoculture crops, which, in many cases, may be selecting for more problematic pests. The results of this work will be communicated to the public across a number of events, including outreach fairs at the national level, annual meeting of the behavior society and in association with the butterfly house at the Minnesota State Fair. Outreach modules will be developed that communicate the implications of this work for controlling agricultural pests, in addition to the importance of understanding developmental variation in the emergence of cancer.</AbstractNarration>

Understanding such questions is relevant to predicting how species will respond to new and changing environments, such as the spread of invasive species into new regions or the ability of pests to colonize agricultural or urban environments. This research considers the role of plasticity &ndash; the ability of an organism to adjust their development in different conditions and thus thrive in a range of environments. We are interested in how costs associated with plasticity result in some species, populations, or individuals being more specialized, while other are more generalized. We use butterflies as a study system because they are diverse, easy to manipulate in the lab, and exhibit extensive flexibility in development and behavior. In this research, we focus on cabbage white butterflies, a pest on canola, cabbage, and other cruciferous crops, in part by contrasting agricultural and non-agricultural populations. In the present work, we focused on the idea that variability in gene expression may allow individuals to use a broad range of resources, but come with costs and trade-offs. We found support for this idea, in particular with respect to trade-offs with offspring number. In doing so, we also discovered a range of differences associated with the agricultural population, which is specialized in its use of canola. This population shows genetic differences in metabolic pathways, in addition to changes in behavior related to increases in resource nutrition (likely due to fertilizer application), highlighting how intensive agriculture can drive changes in pest populations. During the course of this project, we also explored several other ideas about how costs of plasticity may result in some individuals or populations being more specialized or generalized. For instance, attention to detail when choosing resources trades-off with offspring number &ndash; in other words, butterflies that are more careful in their search for plants on which they lay eggs, end up laying fewer eggs. In addition, we found evidence that variation across species in access to nutritious resources can ameliorate some of the trade-offs between plasticity and reproduction &ndash; in other words, when resources are abundant, organisms can be flexible and have lots of offspring. Taken together, the results of this work have several implications and potential applications. For example, planting crops in more complex ways in agricultural systems should favor pests that are actually less pest-like &ndash; in other words, plasticity is favored in complex and unpredictable settings, but the costs of this plasticity result in lower reproductive rates. Overall, this research supports the idea that some forms of plasticity (like behavior and variable gene expression) are particularly costly, potentially explaining why so many species are specialized and thus less able to colonize new environments.</p> <p>In addition to the research described above, this project also resulted in the training of several graduate students, one postdoctoral fellow, and over ten undergraduate students.
