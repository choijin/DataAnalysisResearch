<AbstractNarration>This collaborative research will define a new approach for retrieving useful analogies for innovation based on the relevant performance characteristics of critical functions. Analogy matching is made possible by the novel incorporation of Non Uniform Rational B-spline (NURBs) based metamodels that enable efficient representation of critical function performance. These metamodels are obtained from simulations, engineering models (such as bond graphs) and/or experimental data collections. This approach will enable multiple analogies to be presented to the designer with a quantified match quality metric related to the desired performance benefit to the design. The impact of this approach for inspiring novel designs will be measured through controlled experiments measuring the impact of the MetaAnalogy via Performance Specification (MAPS) technique at both the conceptual design phase and throughout the design process. Working prototypes from the experiments will allow for direct quantification of performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engineering innovation is critical to meet a vast array of challenges including the grand engineering challenges of the 21st century in the form of energy and environmental solutions. If successful, results of the research will provide a critical foundation for new approaches to analogy retrieval based on quantitative performance measures along with function for use in education and industry. Class modules applying MAPS to analogy-based innovation will be created. Workshops integrated with webinars on MAPS and design by analogy will be used to disseminate research results beyond the educational sector and to provide necessary educational tools to bring design by analogy and quantification via Metamodeling into the classroom.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Engineering innovation drives continued economic growth, overcoming current societal problems, and reduced environmental impact.  Grasping for ideas, people can struggle to find solutions to a problem. They might be limited by their particular domain knowledge and lack access to ideas that could actually help them to find an innovative solution.  One method that has been very successful in helping engineering traverse from one domain to another to find innovative solutions is design-by-analogy. Design-by-analogy from nature and existing products is a well-documented approach to enhancing engineering innovation, but effectively identifying analogies from outside to problem domains is very challenging.  Design-by-analogy occurs when designers identify solutions in nature or existing products.  For example, Velcro?s design was based on the close examination of burrs.   To better support engineering innovation, the project developed a novel approach to analogy retrieval.  Due to the critical role of product performance metrics in product design, the analogy retrieval approach focused on this unmet need.   The project created frameworks for organizing the myriad of technical performance metrics used in engineering design (e.g. efficiency, cost, weight, etc.).

The project embedded this organization in a software tool called Design Repository &amp; Analogy Computation via Unit-Language Analysis (DRACULA) tool. The program performs dimensional analysis matching using function, flow, and performance descriptions with an evolving database repository of design analogies.  Functions are an abstraction of what a device must do not its physical form.  For example, the function of a battery is to store energy.  Flows are the energy, materials, and signals which pass through a product.  A functional model abstracts the functions and flows of a product.
