<AbstractNarration>Analysis of the recently-acquired multi-channel seismic (MCS) data will address a series of topics that relate to the structure of the lithosphere and the margin evolution along the central WA portion of Cascadia subduction zone, and how these relate to current seismicity patterns. Advanced processing of the MCS data is expected to identify the depth and character of the plate boundary and the amount of sediment currently being subducted will be assessed. Deformation of strata within the accretionary wedge will be mapped to track longer-term evolution of the plate interactions. Estimates of crustal hydration will be obtained from assumed seismic velocity-porosity relationships and, along interfaces, reflectivity. Maps showing the distribution of methane hydrates in the region will be produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results will provide a framework within which other Cascadia geoscientific studies are conducted, both for seismic processes and tectonic evolution, and are likely to have implications for hazard assessment. While this subduction zone currently has less earthquake activity than other zones around the world, onshore evidence of repeated megathrust events is clear, so it is important to understand the history of of stress buildup (strata deformation) and the extent to which fluids along faults might enable periods of 'lubricated', slow release.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our objectives in this project were to understand the physical properties of the Cascadia plate boundary, which is considered capable of producing magnitude 9 or larger earthquakes. Specifically, we were interested in the physical properties that could be contributing to the lack of interseismic strain release on the Cascadia megathrust as compared to other boundaries such as Alaska. In our research, we processed two seismic lines from the COAST seismic survey to the level of a prestack time migrated image in order to determine the structure of the sediments and oceanic crust near the plate boundary, and to provide constraints on lithology, fluids, and fractures. In our processing, we created both velocity models of the two lines and seismic images of these lines. The velocity model indicates a high-wavespeed basal sediment layer (up to 5.5 km/sec), overlying a low-wavespeed upper oceanic crust (3-4 km/sec). From rock property estimates, this would indicate low porosity in the basal sedimentary layer, and high fracture density along with fluid in oceanic crust. We determined that porosity of the deepest sedimentary layer is below 5 percent, allowing only a low flow rate for fluid escaping from the deeper oceanic crust, and that the velocity of the oceanic crust could not be caused solely by alteration of basaltic crust but also requires fracture porosity and fluids. Fracture zones and alteration both mechanically weaken rocks, therefore we interpret that the upper oceanic crust is a weak layer below a strong, low-porosity sedimentary layer that has undergone early diagenesis and fluid escape. The structural image indicates that the main plate boundary occurs along this interface between sediment and oceanic crust out to the trench, and that it does not rise up into the accretionary prism. Together, these results indicate that the plate boundary lies below a strong, low-porosity layer and above a weak oceanic crust, taking advantage of the strong contrast in mechanical properties. Additionally, the structural imaging indicates that the decollement extends to the deformation front. The high-wavespeed deep layer and the continuation of the decollement is similar to results observed in Sumatra, where a large earthquake created a destructive tsunami in 2004.
