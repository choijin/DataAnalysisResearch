<AbstractNarration>The American Mathematical Society will administer a program for selecting and supporting approximately 90 U.S. early-career and more senior mathematicians to attend the International Congress of Mathematicians in Seoul Korea in August 2014 (ICM-2014). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) is held once every four years, and is one of the most significant gatherings of the world's leading mathematicians, where major developments in mathematical research, across sub-disciplines, is discussed. Attendance by U.S. mathematicians at this meeting is important for the scientific health of the nation because U.S. mathematicians discuss, learn and share in mathematical research that is going on all over the world. The Society has administered similar travel grant programs for previous ICM gatherings, beginning with ICM-90 in Kyoto, Japan and most recently for ICM-2010 in Hyderabad, India. The program ensures that there is strong attendance by U.S. mathematicians, promoting contact with mathematical scientists from other parts of the world, which is important not only for the education of future mathematicians, but also for the long-term vitality of mathematical research in the United States. In addition, efforts will be made to ensure that early career mathematicians, women and minorities receive full consideration to support their attendance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The International Congress of Mathematicians is held once every four years, and is one of the most significant gatherings of leading mathematicians, where major developments in mathematical research, across subdisciplines, are discussed. Attending an International Congress is highly important for individual mathematicians, as they are able to learn about new developments in their fields, share their own work and collaborate with colleagues from around the world.  U.S. mathematicians have always had a significant presence at the International Congress of Mathematicians, and it is vital to maintain that presence. This travel grants program ensured that there was a strong attendance by U.S. mathematicians at the ICM 2014, promoting contact with mathematical scientists from other parts of the world. This is important not only for the education of future mathematicians, but also for the long-term vitality of mathematical research in the United States. In addition, efforts were made to ensure that early career mathematicians, women and underrepresented minorities received full consideration to support their attendance.  Applications for travel awards to attend the ICM 2014 were collected on www.mathprograms.org.  The deadline for applications was November 15, 2013.  Two hundred and ten applications were received (142 male, 54 female, 14 unknown); seven were disqualified and hence 203 were reviewed by the committee.  Thirty-nine awards were given to invited speakers, as expected.  An additional 51 awards were chosen by the Selection Committee.  This committee chose 39 early career mathematicians and 12 other mathematicians for a total of 90 awards.  Twenty-nine percent of the 51 awards chosen by the Selection Committee were women; 43% of the original 90 awards went to early career mathematicians.   Later, six additional awards were given to individuals on a ranked wait list prepared by the Selection Committee. Applicants were notified via email of their awards in February 2014.  The ICM 2014 was held in Seoul, Korea, on August 13 - 21, 2014.  Ninety individuals submitted travel vouchers for reimbursement of their expenses for the trip to the ICM 2014, for a total of $294,439.81.   This NSF grant provided an important opportunity for 90 U.S. mathematicians to travel to the ICM 2014, an exceptional gathering of research mathematicians from around the world.  Those who participated had the opportunity to learn about the latest developments in their fields, to meet and collaborate with other mathematicians and to become informed about the newest and most important breakthroughs in all of mathematics.
