<AbstractNarration>This research will examine emerging patterns of economic migration that leave populations trapped in liminal settlement between their sending communities and desired destinations for undefined periods of time. The project will center on ethnographic engagement with the rapidly expanding population of migrants in North Africa. Through a focus on migrants' lived experiences, migrant-citizen interactions in the public sphere of labor and the placement of "illegal" subjects within national discourse, the researcher will examine interconnections between new forms of transnational migration, identity construction and social stratification. The research will be conducted in a heavily migrant-populated suburb of a capital city. The researcher will employ a range of qualitative methodologies, including: biographical questionnaires, semi-structured interviewing, "go-along" interviewing, oral history collection and ongoing participant observation as a volunteer caseworker at a migrant aid organization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will advance anthropological understandings of citizenship and "illegality" by exploring the racial, social and economic constructions of political identity. Findings from this research will be important to scholars and policymakers, who examine North Africa as a final stopping point for African migrants. In addition to training a graduate student, funding this project will contribute valuable information to those working towards policy reform to ensure that international human rights conventions are upheld throughout the E.U. and its periphery.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the summer of 2013 &ndash; only months after beginning my extended period of fieldwork in Morocco &ndash; the murder of a young Senegalese migrant on a public bus sparked two schools of violent protest in the nationÃ†s capital city &ndash; those for and against the assimilation of foreign nationals. As the population of sub-Saharan African migrants "trapped" throughout the Maghreb continues to expand, Moroccan media commonly addresses the perils and problems of rapidly growing migrant settlements in Rabat and other urban centers. Caught between their sending countries and their desired European destinations, these migrants have been linked to the "mounting racism of Moroccan nationals" (L'Economiste), the "spread of disease, drugs, and prostitution" (Telquel), and a "growing humanitarian crisis concurrently produced and ignored by the E.U." (Al Massae). Placed at the critical border between European labor markets and African laborers, Morocco serves as an ideal site for examining how emergent migratory trajectories impact the experiences of a nationÃ†s migrant population, as well as the lives of citizens whose places of work or habitation leave them in dangerous spheres of "illegality."  My research draws on my recent ethnographic engagement with MoroccoÃ†s new migrant class, centering on (1) migrantsÃ† lived experiences, (2) migrant-citizen interactions in the sphere of labor and (3) the placement of "illegal" subjects within larger Moroccan and E.U. discourses. Contributing to debates on identity construction in light of expanding neoliberal policies, I analyze political categories of "citizen" and "migrant" alongside traditional racial categories and question how one individual can be labeled "Arab" and "black," "Moroccan" and "African," "citizen" and "migrant" in the course of one day, depending on the social spaces that are occupied or denied. My research finds that the identification of particular neighborhoods or vocations as "migrant" spaces is leading to the syncretization of class, race, and "illegality" throughout Morocco.  Saturated labor markets and heightened border controls in traditional immigrant-receiving countries across the E.U. result in the deportation and settlement of increasing numbers of economic migrants in Morocco, shifting local sociopolitical structures and making categorizations of political inclusion and exclusion increasingly important markers of identity. My findings set the stage for future comparative research on the new geographies of legality, liminality, and belonging that are emerging as more traditional emigrant-sending countries, like Morocco, transition into migrant "destinations." The importance of this research extends beyond the academic realm, also informing policy makers and local NGOs about the E.U.Ã†s role in shaping Moroccan immigration policy, the failure of Spanish and Moroccan governments to provide migrants with basic social services, and the treatment of second-generation youth born in Morocco.
