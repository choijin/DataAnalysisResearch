<AbstractNarration>Freshwater streams are a critical natural resource and are ecologically linked to the surrounding landscape. Due to their nature, streamside forests are highly vulnerable to invasion by plant species which aggressively displace other species.  This project will test the hypothesis that the ecology of aquatic microbial and macroinvertebrate stream communities are regulated by bottom-up processes altered through terrestrial plant invasion along headwater streams. The investigators will use the invasion of headwater stream forests by the exotic shrub Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) to assess alteration of materials that enter the stream, and how those alterations change the in-stream habitat. The project will further assess how invasion influences stream microbial biofilm (bacteria and fungi) and macroinvertebrate communities. Field assessments along a gradient of L. maackii density will be complemented by field manipulation experiments to test mechanisms. Overall, the project tests the broad hypothesis that the loss of biodiversity in streamside forests due to invasion is mirrored by a loss of biodiversity in the aquatic community. The foundation for the proposed work includes an extensive suite of published studies and preliminary data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will directly benefit traditionally underrepresented groups in science by creating paid internship opportunities for urban students from a charter school that serves poverty-stricken parts of urban Dayton. This project will directly inform management of aquatic habitats and riparian zones throughout the region by involving managers from a variety of park systems. The findings could influence management on thousands of miles of headwater streams in North America. This funding will facilitate scientific training of undergraduate students through paid internships, support a PhD student, and provide an excellent training platform for a postdoctoral researcher.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project assessed the influence of the exotic shrub Amur honeysuckle on headwater streams.  This shrub invades aggressively into forests and has strong impacts on the biology of those forests; however, small streams meander through many of these forests and our project tested a series of hypotheses about how these streams may be influenced by the terrestrial invasion.  Headwater streams are important for conservation and because they are connected to larger river systems in a biological continuum.   In terms of intellectual merit, we discovered that the biology of headwater streams is strongly influenced by the invasion of this shrub and that this influence is related to the materials that are transferred into the stream.  In fact, we found that some materials from Amur honeysuckle are toxic to the small aquatic organisms that make up the base of the stream food web.  This is the first documentation of what what could be a widespread biological phenomenon.    We developed a model that links the invasion of this terrestrial shrub and the biology of aquatic systems and have continued to test various elements of this model.  The project has generated a series of peer-reviewed scientific articles including those with direct relevance to management.  One important discovery is that removal of the shrub from the riparian area, even over a relatively short distance, creates significant positive effects on the aquatic organisms in the stream.  This discovery has been communicated to land managers and could influence activities on natural areas throughout the American Midwest.  In terms of broader impacts, we have leveraged this research project to engage 21 undergraduates over the four years of the project.  This project, then, has impacted a whole generation of students who have gained in scientific acumen and joined the workforce with new leadership skills and capacity.  We also provided training to a MS level student, a PhD student and a postdoc.  All of these individuals gained from their engagement in the project and have become leaders.  For instance, Rachel McNeish completed a PhD funded by this grant and has now become a faculty member at California State University, Bakersfield and will launch her own laboratory there this fall, magnifying the effects of the funding through engagement with a whole new generation of students.   We have also intermingled all of our activity with land management agencies.  Much of our work was done in direct collaboration with these agencies and we have presented our research directly to managers through multiple venues.  Our work is currently informing management activities on many thousands of acres in the region and we expect to continue to engage managers in the future.  Overall, the funding transformed our biological understanding of a widespread and important invasive plant, transformed the University of Dayton as a generation of students received training that would not have been possible otherwise, and transformed the field as all of these students launch into careers, mentor others ,and pass on knowledge gained to management organizations and students with whom they work.
