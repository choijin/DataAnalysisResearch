<AbstractNarration>This project is developing a new methodology to control adaptively the evolution of materials microstructure during thermal processing, through integration of simulation, real-time measurement, control algorithms, and simulated and experimental data sets.   The specific implementation focuses on the spatial control of grain microstructure during thermal processing of polycrystalline metals.  Monte Carlo and phase field simulations are used to predict the trajectory of microstructure evolution, and real-time measurements of local microstructure, crystallography and temperature using scanning electron microscopy methods are used to track these trajectories experimentally.   When measurement shows significant deviation from the planned trajectory, a new trajectory is simulated and implemented through control algorithms.  The experimental implementation comprises a multi-zone resistive heating array that enables controlled temperature distributions to be programmed across a macroscopic polycrystalline metal sample in-situ to a scanning electron microscope.  Secondary electron imaging and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) are employed to monitor the evolution of grain structure and crystallography, while a new method, based upon quantification of diffuse scattering in the EBSD patterns, is employed to measure local temperature distributions using the same electron beam. The resulting real time data streams are compared to the predictions from simulation, and as deviations emerge, the temperature distribution across the sample is adjusted to steer micro-structural evolution back towards the desired state. The control algorithms employed to achieve this are developed based on the linearized phase field models. When the deviations between measurement and simulation become excessive, re-optimization using full Monte-Carlo simulation between intermediate and final states is required.  As these methods develop, implementation of feedback control without excessive use of such re-optimization is expected as the libraries of correlated experimental and simulated data sets develop.  While these methods inherently measure two-dimensional distributions of grain parameters at the surface, integrated focused ion beam tomography is used to correlate the surface grain microstructure to three dimensional distributions within the bulk, and also to compare to two dimensional ? three dimensional correlations from the simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on developing a major new capability for control of materials processing: the ability to monitor, evaluate and control the local materials structure of a system as it evolves during thermal processing in order to obtain optimal properties.  This is enabled through new methodologies for integrating experiment, simulation, and data management. The specific project implementation comprises control of grain growth during annealing of polycrystalline metals.  However, the methodologies developed should be extendible to acceleration of a wide range of process development cycles where specific internal materials structures are known to correlate to optimal materials properties and performance.  The research project is integrated with a broad set of educational and outreach activities. High school, undergraduate and graduate students are involved throughout the project.  In particular, multiple graduate students who are trained through this research are becoming expert in the integrated application of experimental, simulation and data sciences to the acceleration of materials processing technologies.  This is preparing them for future leadership in the development of new materials manufacturing technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The internal microstructure of metals (for example grain sizes, grain boundaries, crystalline defects, and distributions of different phases) control the properties and performance of those materials. While materials engineers have long studied how such microstructure correlates to the materials? properties, the processing of materials during manufacturing to achieve desired microstructures remains largely experience-based, and typically follows prescribed schedules.   The central Intellectual Merit of this project is that it sought to advance real time control and optimization of processing of polycrystalline metals by establishing the foundations of an integrated experimental-simulation-control cycle. The project focused on thermally-driven grain growth in polycrystalline copper films.  A key activity of the project was fabricating novel micro-heater arrays, with multiple controllable channels, for use within a scanning electron and ion microscope (SEIM).  This allowed user-configurable one-dimensional temperature profiles to be created across a one square millimeter area of polycrystalline films, and thermally-driven grain growth to be observed in real time at ultra-high magnification using the SEIM imaging capabilities (which allow features as small as a few nanometers to be resolved).  On heating with a controlled temperature profile, the evolution of the grain distribution within the film can be continuously monitored and compared to computer simulations (Monte Carlo and Phase Field methods were used) of grain growth.   An over-arching project goal was to develop methodologies whereby monitoring of deviations between model prediction and experimental observation can be integrated with control design to tune the temperature profile in real time, and guide the grain growth back onto a pathway that results in the optimized microstructure. Extensive integration of experimental imaging, simulation and adaptive control was realized. The project demonstrated full virtual control of grain growth in computer simulations (using atomistic Monte Carlo and continuum Finite Element Method methods), with evolving grain distributions and temperature as feedback to define the control loops, and models of predicted grain growth as the commands to guide control of the subsequent temperature distribution.  While there has been extensive prior literature on many aspects of metal microstructure characterization, modeling and processing, it is believed that this development represents a significant advance in establishing a comprehensive model-based microstructure process control methodology.  In terms of Broader Impacts of the project, four graduate students were funded over multiple years and seven undergraduate research experiences were provided. The graduate students had extensive exposure to the full range of project activities and most spent a semester or more working in the groups of other project faculty, in addition to their central contributions working with their primary advisor.  A core curriculum of common knowledge was established as part of the graduate students? classwork, comprising classes on microscopy, modeling and mechatronics/control, plus an in-house seminar on fundamentals of grain growth provided by the project faculty.  Results from this project have been disseminated through numerous conference presentations and seminars, and through multiple publications.  Multiple computer codes developed during the project are being released to the community.   In addition, the project faculty co-organized a symposium at a regional manufacturing conference highlighting this work to a broad set of representatives from regional industries.  This led to a set of collaborations with industrial companies that are under-pinning future work.  We have leveraged extensively our research into outreach activities, for example Summer High School Engineering Camps at Rensselaer, that have in total reached hundreds of participating students.
