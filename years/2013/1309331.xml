<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent experimental and theoretical progress on mechanical instabilities of polymer surfaces has provided a good understanding of two fundamental modes of instability: wrinkling, driven by buckling of a stiff film on a soft substrate, and creasing, driven by buckling of the soft substrate itself. However, real material systems found in biological and technological contexts often show a diversity of behaviors that defy explanation based on these simple paradigms alone, due to the greater complexity in terms of both geometry and material properties when compared to the simple model systems that have been carefully studied to date. This project seeks to advance understanding of polymer surface instabilities by developing a comprehensive picture of the landscape of surface buckling modes that occur in elastic bilayers, as parameterized by the mismatch in thickness and stiffness between the two layers, as well as the level of compression felt by each. Experiments will be carried out to quantitatively characterize the onset and development of different instability modes, the mechanisms of transitions between these different states, and the presence of hysteresis and bistability upon cycles of loading and unloading. Comparisons with finite element models will provide further insights into the driving forces for each of these behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buckling mechanics are central to a wide range of phenomena, ranging from the development of functional structures in biology, to the operation of micro-electromechanical devices in consumer electronics. This project seeks to provide an integrated understanding of the interplay between two fundamental surface buckling modes that are of key importance for polymeric materials. It will provide model experimental systems that offer the potential to improve our understanding of morphogenetic processes in biology and diseases such as asthma, and will also open new routes to technologically applicable materials with switchable properties such as adhesion and optical transparency. The project will also provide mentoring and research opportunities for a diverse group of participants including high school students and teachers, graduate students, and undergraduates. Lasting partnerships with teachers and students from nearby school districts that serve large populations of under-represented minority students will be developed to aid in efforts to diversify the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has led to major advances in our fundamental understanding of buckling instabilities of polymer surfaces under compression, and new opportunities for the practical application of these deformation modes in the development of polymer materials with surface properties that can be altered on demand. While two ?archetypes? of surface buckling modes&mdash;wrinkling of a stiff film on a soft foundation, and creasing of a single soft homogeneous material&mdash;were well understood at the outset of the project, how these two modes compete with each other in layered systems that have modest contrasts in stiffness, thickness, and/or pre-stress, between the constituent layers was not. This is despite the importance of such scenarios in both industrial contexts, where graded or multi-layered polymer films subjected to differential levels of stress are common, as well as morphogenesis of functional biological structures, where differential growth or contraction in layered structures drives diverse phenomena including the development of folds in the brain and the functioning of arteries and airways.         Through systematic experiments on model elastomeric bilayers, in comparison to finite element simulations, we obtained an excellent understanding of the interplay between these phenomena throughout this three-dimensional parameter space defined by stiffness contrast, thickness contrast, and differential pre-stress. In particular, we developed a detailed understanding of what parameters give rise to creases vs. wrinkles as the primary mode of instability, as well as how wrinkles can transition to creases as a function of applied compression. We also determined how pre-compression of the substrate, relative to the film, can control (and greatly enhance) the degree of hysteresis in the formation of creases, or give rise to a new mode of ?chaotic? surface wrinkling, depending on the stiffness contrast.        Alongside these fundamental advances, we developed new approaches to harness buckling instabilities to generate surfaces with potential applications as ?smart? materials with reconfigurable properties such as adhesion, optical transparency, wettability, and bioactivity. These included new methods to form both creases and delamination blisters with a high degree of structural regularity and controlled hysteresis between the conditions required to switch the features ?on? and ?off?, as well as highly strain-responsive flexible electronic devices based on reversibly making and breaking electrical contacts in micro-patterned circuits through the formation of creases.     Our work resulted in 7 peer-reviewed publications, including in high impact journals, and numerous presentations by the students and PI, including 8 at major national meetings of scientific organizations (American Chemical Society, American Physical Society, National Organization of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers, Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science).
