<AbstractNarration>The site to be planned at Drexel University will highlight in its efforts two fundamental challenges are 1) advancing the understanding of how plasmas interact with their surroundings, either through chemical and physical processes on plasma facing surfaces or through their interaction with electromagnetic fields, and 2) advancing the understanding of and modeling the fundamental interactions of plasmas with the external mechanisms (electrical or mechanical) that drive them, thereby providing a means to engineer these systems based on the optimal conditions predicted from a complete understanding of plasma processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned site intends to provide scientific insight to a class of plasma engineering processes that are vital to established and growing markets, and support advancement of plasma engineering technologies in multiple fields. By providing an environment that focuses on fundamental understanding of these systems, combined with industry engagement through collaborative research, industry residencies, and co-operative opportunities, the planned site intends to contribute to filling a manpower void and accelerating the growth of low cost, repeatable solutions for the domestic high-tech industry. The interdisciplinary training environment for plasma research spanning 6 colleges at Drexel will support this end.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this award ID 1361719, Planning Grant: I/UCRC for Laser &amp; Plasma for Advanced Manufacturing (LPAM), was to advertise NSF I/UCRC system and the existing LPAM center to our existing and potential corporate partners.  In the framework of this Award, Drexel UniversityÆs A.J. Drexel Plasma Institute held numerous teleconferences and discussions with various industries, culminating in the Planning Grant Workshop which took place on DrexelÆs campus on December 4th and 5th, 2014.  Eleven companies have participated in the Workshop of which eight have supplied us with Letters of Commitment to become full members once/if NSF funds DrexelÆs Phase 1 Center Site in the existing LPAM.  As a result of the Planning Grant workshop, Drexel Plasma InstituteÆs faculty and staff have selected five projects of interest to the exiting Industrial Advisory Board as well as to the new Member Companies and submitted full proposal to the NSF I/UCRC program.  Regardless of the outcome of the proposal, the Workshop allowed DrexelÆs faculty, staff, and students to form better connections with our Corporate Partners.  Drexel University's graduate and undergraduate students presented their projects to he existing Industrial Advisory Board members as well as the potential member companies.  Our corporate partners have expressed great interest not only in the science to be generated in the framework of the I/UCRC LPAM but also in the potential hires resulting from these projects.
