<AbstractNarration>This award will support a Synthesis Workshop to identify community-based perspectives, research imperatives, and policy needs linked to the interactions of ice, water and global climate. This workshop will precede and assist in the science community in preparation for the emerging U.N. International Year for Snow and Ice and the Celebrating Glaciers campaigns.  It is the intention of the organizer to bring together key representatives of the cryospheric-hydrologic-social science research, policy, education, and outreach communities to elaborate plans for creating a transdisciplinary ice-snow-water nexus communication community, as well as set the groundwork for creating strategies and toolkits for effectively communicating science to the public and to policy makers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop has as its themes, interdisciplinarity, innovation, integration and engagement. In order to have the full engagement in the workshop sessions, the PI suggests limiting it to 10-15 people with expertise in producing, using, and communicating science.  The goal of the workshop being to bring together a key group of earth system and interdisciplinary social scientists, users of natural and social science knowledge - people who can articulate their needs and interests in science products e.g., policy makers, environmental managers, and public stakeholders, and education and outreach experts, including public relations practitioners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop is structured as a three day meeting: the first two days will be conference-style, consisting of plenary talks, discussion, and breakout sessions focused; the final day will be an intensive writing workshop to synthesize key knowledge production from the prior two days. The final results of the meeting will be a short community-reviewed report summarizing key issues, common challenges, general lessons and ideas for steps forward that emerged during the workshop.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ice and snow today occupy up to 33% of the EarthÃ¦s total land surface and play a critical role in the mechanics of the Earth system. They are also central to the climate system as well as the hydrologic cycle and thus are essential to life on the planet. One of the major challenges for the scientific and policy communities is communicating these changes occurring in the cryosphere, or the ice-dominated regions of the earth. The goal of this project was to convene a workshop to address the challenge of identifying and describing change in science communication today.     One of the major challenges of science communication is not just capturing the rapid changes in the physics, chemistry, and biology of the environment, but also effectively describing these changes due to the new ways in which humans consume information in the digital age. This is further complicated by the political rancor as well as public perception surrounding cryospheric change, and how these social factors themselves evolve. The capacity of scientists to work with stakeholders to reconcile both facts and human values may well determine the long-term viability of the science-media relationship.     In November 2014, an international expert group was convened on "Communicating the Science and Impacts of Fundamental Earth System Change with a Focus on Ice-Snow-Water." The workshop and an affiliated "Public-Private Sector Policy Forum" with public and private sector decision makers included more than participants. The World Bank hosted the workshop and the Icelandic Ambassador in Washington, DC, hosted the policy forum. The presentations, talks, and ensuing discussions identified how scientific consensus is transformed by the forces that shape human belief systems. Among the recommendations that came about from these workshops are the needs to develop new research opportunities to understand how the public and policymaking community perceives the scientific method; how to assist non-scientific audiences to better understand credentialing systems that certify research competency; and how to design of experimental and survey tools to test how different science communication strategies affect public perception and knowledge.

Given the shift of the cryosphere to a more ice-free state, issues of research needs and communicating changes serve as both challenges and opportunities for society. Climate issues remain polarizing, and the fact that climate deni...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
