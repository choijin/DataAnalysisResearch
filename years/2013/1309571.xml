<AbstractNarration>In this scientific project, energy transfer processes in collisions between atoms and molecules are investigated. These processes play an important role and are essential to the understanding of combustion dynamics, astrophysical plasmas and plasma formation. The results can serve as bench marks with which to verify theoretical models of the processes. Theoretical models are themselves useful because they may be then conveniently applied to physical systems that are more difficult or more expensive to study experimentally.  The amount of energy transfer arising from collisions between atoms and molecules will be studied by using two lasers. First, the internal properties of the quantum states of molecules will be manipulated by a laser beam. These molecules then oscillate like vibrating violin strings and collisions can alter their quantum properties. A second probe laser will arrive at the system after some time delay and sense this alteration. By varying the delay time between the two lasers as short as 10 picoseconds, time evolution of the molecular properties can be mapped out, similar to the way a stroboscope maps out the motion of macroscopic objects.  These studies can provide exceptional spectroscopic precision and understanding of the various transfer processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides understanding of energy transfer processes that are important in combustion and plasma formation.  It has an essential and socially important educational aspect as well. This project integrates research components into course work at Miami University while providing students with hands-on laboratory experience with state-of-the-art technology. The extensive research training and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students contribute to the future professionals entering science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields.</AbstractNarration>
