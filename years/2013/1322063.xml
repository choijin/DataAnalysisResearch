<AbstractNarration>The University of Miami requests funding for additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Walton Smith, a 96,? general purpose regional vessel operated by the University of Miami?s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (RSMAS) as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The R/V WALTON SMITH conducts a substantial portion of her operations in the near shore waters of South Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, providing scientific information relevant to major environmental initiatives. The operations include oil spill monitoring, water management changes, municipal waste disposal, and storm water discharge among others which are deemed critical to the sustainable development of the South Florida and Gulf economy.  In 2012, R/V Walton Smith completed 143 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 25% of the total sailing schedule. In 2013, R/V Walton Smith is scheduled for 108 days with NSF days accounting for 17% of the total sailing schedule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1) 1m MOCNESS Overhaul and Spares $15,890 &lt;br/&gt;2) POSMV Upgrade $97,089 &lt;br/&gt;3) Nisken Water Sampler $10,000 &lt;br/&gt;4) Altimeter of use with CTD Systems $3,910 &lt;br/&gt;5) Integrated Optical Bow Sensor Suite $21,751 &lt;br/&gt;TOTAL $148,640 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two of the Proposal Guidelines. They provide infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Miami's proposal to the National Science Foundation for 2013 Oceanographic Instrumentation requested funding for multiple items including an upgrade to the Position &amp; Orientation System for Motor Vessels (POS/MV), an Optical bow sensor suite, a replacement Niskin water sampler, 1m MOCNESS overhaul components and spares, and a spare Benthos altimeter. Based on the the review process, the Niskin water sampler was ranked highest priority by the NSF Review Panel. Following the panel's recommendations, and prior to the award, several MOCNESS components failed, rendering the system inoperable. A request was submitted to change the award from the highest ranking item to the second highest ranking item. The cognizant Program Manger reviewed our request and revised the award to allow replacement of the MONCESS components.  The MOCNESS system was quite antiquated. It was acquired over 30 years ago. Multiple imminent science missions were depending on its availability and proper working condition. The acronym stands for 'Multiple Opening-Closing Net Environmental Sampling System'. It is the primary instrument deployed for collecting plankton in the open ocean. A serious of up to nine nets may be opened and closed  at various depths to collect samples which determine bio-availability, in population studies, in understanding eddies and other complex ocean currents, and to determine effects of pollution or oil spills on microorganisms at the bottom of the food web.  In 2014, the Niskin sampler was again proposed and received high ranking by the review panel. The funds for this replacement system were awarded. For the remaining items which were also deemed critical to the success of oceanographic research conducted aboard the RV WALTON SMITH, funds were pooled from multiple sources to upgrade the POS/MV. The Optical sensor suite has been requested again in 2015. The spare altimeter has not been acquired nor requested again at this time.
