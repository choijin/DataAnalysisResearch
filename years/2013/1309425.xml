<AbstractNarration>Gut microbes and the evolution of mutualism and diet in lycaenid butterflies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most lycaenid butterflies engage in specialized associations with ants, and while the majority of these ant-lycaenid interactions are considered mutualistic, many are parasitic in which caterpillars feed on ant regurgitations, ant-tended insects, or directly on ant brood. Despite the incredible diversity of diets, life histories, and interspecific associations among lycaenid butterflies, the evolution of diet and resulting transitions from mutualism to parasitism within this group are not well understood. This research investigates the taxonomic, functional and evolutionary dimensions of the gut bacterial associations of lycaenid butterflies in order to explore the possibility that gut microbes are implicated in the evolution of parasitic lifestyles and carnivorous diets in this group. This is the first study of the role of symbiotic gut microbes in determining their hosts' associations with free-living organisms, including evolutionary shifts from mutualism to parasitism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the guidance of Dr. Naomi Pierce at Harvard University and Dr. Martin Kaltenpoth at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, this project addresses several training goals. Specific aims include the Fellow receiving training in functional genomics methods, developing strong teaching skills, and gaining experience applying genomics techniques to ecological and evolutionary questions. Additionally, the Fellow will remain active in outreach activities aimed at increasing opportunities and advancement of underrepresented students in the greater Boston area and beyond. This research will provide novel insights into the biology of insect-microbe associations, with potential applications to human health, conservation, and pest management.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Many animals rely on symbiotic gut bacteria to provide important nutritional functions, such as producing vitamins, degrading food-borne toxins, and converting complex molecules into more nutritional forms.

This study surveyed and compared the gut bacterial communities of more than 30 species of lycaenid butterfly larvae from across the world. Lycaenid butterflies have diverse and unusual diets as caterpillars: in addition to plant-feeding species, some species feed on lichen, while others are strict carnivores. In comparing the microbiomes of these diverse butterflies, I found that the gut communities of herbivorous and carnivorous species do not differ in predictable ways, and that butterfly larvae do not seem to host specialized or resident bacteria in their guts.
