<AbstractNarration>This award from the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) Program of the Chemistry Division supports work by Professor Trevor W. Hayton at the University of California Santa Barbara to carry out fundamental studies on the synthesis and reactivity of molecules in unusual oxidations states. Often, these molecules have the ability to effect challenging bond forming and bond activation reactions; reactions that are relevant to a wide variety of catalytic processes. In addition, these complexes further our understanding of metal-ligand bonding and help to validate new computational methodologies. These molecules are stabilized by the ketimide ligand, which possesses a combination of orbital interactions that permits it to stabilize both high and low oxidation states.  The basic research funded by this award advances our understanding of the chemistry of the earth abundant elements and assists in the transition to a carbon-neutral, sustainable economy.  The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits, such as the use of these materials in catalysis or magnetic information storage, as well as the training of undergraduate and graduate students in the synthesis and characterization of inorganic and organometallic complexes.  Professor Hayton helps organize the Southern California Organometallics meeting (SoCal Organometallics).  This meeting allows organometallic students from Southern California to present their current research and interact with students and faculty from neighboring institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project pays particular focus on ketimide-containing complexes of the earth abundant elements, manganese, iron, and copper.  Their properties are being studied using a variety of techniques, including NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and SQUID magnetometry. Their reactivity with small molecules, such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and ethylene, is also being explored.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The central goal of this project was to design and validate new ligands to stabilize high oxidation states, use these ligands to synthesize high oxidation state complexes, and then study their spectroscopic properties, bonding, and reactivity.  High valent metal complexes are critical intermediates in many important organic transformations and industrial processes, and by exploring the fundamental properties of these ions we will provide new insights and understanding into these important reactions.  A secondary goal was to develop new methodologies for the generation of metal-ligand multiple bonds.  Complexes with metal-ligand multiple bonds have broad utility in catalysis and are also widely found in bioinorganic chemistry.  By exploring their synthesis and reactivity we hope to discover new modes of small molecule activation and to help answer remaining questions about important biological processes, such as denitrification.  One significant research accomplishment from this project was the development of a bonding model that rationalizes the spectroscopic properties of a family of homoleptic group 5 ketimide complexes (V, Nb, Ta).  This model quantifies the amounts of &sigma;-donation, &pi;-donation, and &pi;-backdonation extant in the metal-ketimide interaction.  Most significantly, we have found that the ketimide ligand is both a strong &pi;-donor and &pi;-acceptor, which is a rare combination. Excitingly, the combined donor/acceptor properties of the ketimide ligand could engender unique structure and reactivity.  Another significant research accomplishment was the synthesis and structural characterization of unique "masked" terminal nickel(II) sulfide.  Access to this complex was achieved by "Reductive Deprotection" of a Ni(II) tritylthiolate precursor, a method of metal-ligand multiple bond formation that was pioneered by our laboratory.  Our "masked" nickel sulfide reacts with a variety of small molecules, including CO, NO, and N2O. The latter example is notable because N2O is a famously inert small molecule.  In addition, it is an important greenhouse gas and discovering new methods for N2O activation and reduction could make it easier to reduce its impact on global temperatures.   Finally, two graduate students participated in this project.   They were trained in the synthesis and characterization of organometallic complexes.  Additionally, they participated in the writing and editing of manuscripts and in the presentation of research results at a variety of venues.  This training will allow them to make important contributions to chemistry research and teaching in the years to come.
