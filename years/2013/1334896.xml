<AbstractNarration>PI: Palumbo, Robert&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1334896&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Valparaiso University&lt;br/&gt;Title: RUI-The solar thermal decoupled electrolysis process for H2 Production&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate a process for producing H2 from water for the purpose of storing solar energy as chemical energy.  In the process, concentrated solar-thermal energy reduces Fe2O3 or CoO2 or Mn2O3 to a metal oxide with a lower oxidation state, which, in turn acts as a solute or anode in an electrolysis cell, enabling the production of H2 from water at ideal voltages as low as 0.21V. The low voltage is due to the anodic re-oxidation of the metal oxide.  This produced oxide is then recycled in the solar step. The work required for the electrolysis is a fraction of the work that is available in a H2-air fuel cell. Thus the only energy entering the cycle is sunlight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Valparaiso University?s partners in the project are Sandia National Laboratories, Diver Solar LLC, an industrial partner, and Professor Peter Kissinger, an electrochemist from Purdue University?s Chemistry Department. With support from the partners, undergraduate engineering and natural science students guided by faculty will conduct fundamental studies involving thermodynamics and electrochemistry. The project?s scientific objective is to obtain the requisite knowledge to assess the industrial viability of the process based on realistic estimates of the sunlight to H2 efficiency and how they compare to those from other processes reported in the solar chemistry literature.  Achieving this goal requires a quantitative mechanistic understanding of the electrochemical reactions from voltammetry studies and a quantitative kinetic understanding of the solar decomposition and re-oxidation reactions from thermogravimetric analysis studies. The PIs will use our new 10kW  solar furnace to conduct experiments that lead to the development of a solar thermal reactor that minimizes the irreversibilities associated with matching the incoming concentrated solar radiation to the kinetics of the decomposition reaction and the kinetics of re-oxidation to the product cool-down step.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The process resolves four major problems that have kept solar thermal chemistry from being industrially viable. (1) The process allows for the production of a solar fuel with a windowless reactor. Thus, it addresses the problem that windows must remain clean of reaction products or side products, a goal the solar chemistry research community has not yet reached with at least some of the reactions being investigated, and it improves process economics by avoiding the need to separate solar gaseous products from inert or unreacted gas. (2) It allows for a quasi-continuous process, addressing the industrial culture?s desire for nearly continuous operation. (3) The process operates at a temperature similar to those in industry. Many solar chemistry processes under investigation operate at temperatures approaching 2000 K, making the design for reliability challenging due to materials degradation, volatilization, and thermal energy management at extreme temperatures. (4) Although industry would do the solar step in the desert, the electrolysis involving water can be done wherever water is available, avoiding the need to bring water to the desert. The research will lead to a quantitative understanding of reaction kinetics for high temperature reduction and oxidation reactions of select metal oxides. The research will lead to a quantitative understanding of electrochemical reactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of the research program advances goal to have undergraduates aspire to be scientific leaders. The students will have the opportunity to experience the pleasure of discovery. They will synthesize concepts learned in thermal science and measurement courses in order to build up experiments and to analyze data. They will experience the process of teasing out of data new knowledge that allows us to see better the industrial potential of solar thermal electrochemistry. The students will learn rhetorical skills for communicating complex scientific ideas to the general public without compromising the science. Through the project?s outreach program, we will inspire young people in Northwest Indiana coming from underrepresented groups to consider a life in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Solar Thermal Decoupled Electrolysis Process for H2 Production  This process involves a metal oxide that is reduced to a lower oxidation state in air with concentrated solar energy.  The reduced oxide is then used as an anode or solute for the electrolytic production of H2 in either an aqueous acid or base.  The presence of the reduced metal oxide as part of the electrolytic cell decreases the voltage required for water electrolysis below the ideal 1.23 V required when H2 and O2 evolve at 1 bar and 298 K.  In our process, H2 evolves at the cathode at 1 bar while the reduced metal oxide produced under concentrated sunlight is re-oxidized at the anode, thus completing the H2 production cycle.    Intellectual Merit:    The Electrochemistry  We established the fundamental reaction kinetics for the anode process where the anodic electro-active species is CoO and the product is Co3O4. Fourteen parameters characterize the electrochemical reaction on a clean electrode, with the Butler-Volmer equation describing the electron transfer step to solution and to adsorption bound electroactive species.   We have developed a 3-dimensional finite difference model of the cell that incorporates our reaction parameters.  The model is enabling us to develop more efficient cells for the process: we alter cell geometry to predict current density at a given cell voltage.  The higher the current density for a voltage below 1.23 V, the more industrially viable the process.  The Solar Reactor Development  We have developed a promising reactor concept to effect the solid-state reduction of metal oxides, and realized this concept through a multi-year iterative design process, a process in which undergraduate students played a leading role.  We call the reactor concept the windowless, solar rotary drum reactor.  It uses a rotating cylinder with integrated mixing paddles to simultaneously mix the solid reactant particles and generate a particle suspension within the reaction chamber.  The particle suspension is directly irradiated through a windowless aperture to heat and effect the reduction of the metal oxide.  While prior solar reactors have utilized either a rotating drum or a particle suspension, ours is the first to do both.  The result is a reactor that volumetrically absorbs concentrated solar radiation and actively mixes the solid reactant to improve heat and mass transfer.  The rotary drum reactor was operated for over 40 hours at high temperature.  We demonstrated the ability to convert 86% of Co3O4 into CoO while feeding the Co3O4 at a rate of 26 g/min.  This is the highest conversion achieved to date using concentrated solar energy to drive the endothermic reduction.  Furthermore, we demonstrated that it is possible to prevent re-oxidation of the reduced cobalt oxide by cooling the solid with air.  Broad Impacts  Fifteen students that participated in the project went on to graduate school in a scientific discipline: The schools were Ohio State, CalTech, U. of Florida, Iowa State, Georgia Tech, University of Minnesota, Harvard, Oregon State, Indiana University, Washington St. Louis.  Of these, 2 won the NSF Graduate Fellowship and one was an honorable mention.   One student received an International Engineering Experience: an Internship for six months at the CNRS-Odeillo Laboratory in France to do reactor modeling and reactor testing work. He was an Engineering-French double major student.  His work on the reactor development portion of this project enabled him to develop the requisite skills for the internship.  The students and faculty on more than 25 occasions under a variety of venues communicated the importance of the engineering science associated with this project to the general public.  It was clear from all of us that those who attended our outreach lectures and tours left with a deeper understanding of the potential of solar energy as an industrial energy resource.  They also left with a better sense of the global warming problem.                 Last Modified: 11/29/2017       Submitted by: Robert Palumbo]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
