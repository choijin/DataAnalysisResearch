<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to determine the couplings of rotational and translational body oscillations underlying dynamic legged locomotion, and develop strategies to exploit them for faster, more efficient and more stable running and climbing.  The planar point-mass dynamic models which have informed the design of existing single-mode running robots will be extended to better capture the three-dimensional dynamics evidenced by animals that allow for rapid negotiation of a variety of terrains via multiple modes of locomotion.  The benefits of coupled roll, pitch and yaw with traditional translational motions, as well as inclines, attachment, and body inertia will be examined for multi-modal legged runners.  These findings will be used in turn to inform control strategies for robots capable of high-speed running and climbing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will enable legged robotic systems to run more quickly, across more treacherous terrains, and maneuver with more agility.   The currently "missing" reduced-order dynamic models for climbing will be developed, affording better understanding of the mechanisms and methods employed by biological climbers.  These insights will also enable robot designs and controllers to effectively utilize the inherent rotational dynamics over a range of surface inclines and geometries.  Running reliably down hills, through rough terrain, up trees, and over obstacles will be easier for these biologically anchored multi-modal devices.  These advances will lead to unprecedented mobility for robots involved in search and rescue, hazardous material clean up, and inspection tasks in natural and urban disaster areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated the role of rotational dynamics on legged locomotion in a variety of terrains, including terrestrial and scansorial domains.  To better understand how animals quickly and adroitly run and climb through natural environments we created a series of reduced-order dynamic models.  These models capture the whole-body motion of legged systems as they run, climb, and even swim.   We found that proper use of compliant legs, body sway, and foot attachment can result in fast, stable, and efficient motions.  In particular, we found: that body-yaw improves the stability of high-speed vertical climbing, that there are at least three viable vertical climbing gaits (akin to walking, running, and a high-speed compliant run), and that optimal lateral force generation varies with substrate inclination.  We also showed that existing lateral-plane running and climbing models can be integrated to account for changes in animal gaits as the slope of the terrain changes from level ground to vertical walls.   Additional modeling work showed that fore-aft leg specialization (which is common in animals, but not with robots), improves stability for both vertical climbing and while running over difficult terrain.     These modeling results have led to the development of novel robotic platforms that have demonstrated: rapid running and climbing at animal-like speeds, distinct dynamic high-speed vertical climbing gaits, rapid ascension of tree-like geometries, and multi-modal legged locomotion across terrestrial, scansorial, and aquatic domains.    The integration of these robots with high-speed, model-based robot planners has also enabled autonomous dynamic maneuverability on both horizontal and vertical surfaces.  By exploiting the natural dynamics of legged systems (including significant role, pitch, and yaw motions) these robots demonstrate robust dynamic self-stabilization as they rapidly move through difficult terrains.   In addition to peer-reviewed publications, dissemination of these findings took place via the development of a low-cost (&lt; $100) educational wall climbing robot that became part of robotic showcases, youth robotic summer camps, and a temporary display at the National Museum of American History in Washington D.C. where thousands of people were exposed to principles of dynamic legged locomotion developed as part of this project.
