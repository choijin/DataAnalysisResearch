<AbstractNarration>This study will provide a deeper understanding into how natural selection leads to the divergence of populations, the first step toward speciation, focusing on traits that differ between males and females. The results of this study will address fundamental aspects of how selection varies on males and females and how this affects the structure of genes and chromosomes. Understanding these processes will broaden our knowledge about a central question of biology: Why are there so many different kinds of organisms? The work will train several undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a postdoctoral scholar, in both scientific research and public outreach, and provide them with opportunities to establish international collaborations. The researchers will work with scientists at Bloomington, IN, WonderLab Museum of Science, Health and Technology and with teachers at the Templeton Elementary School to create public displays about pollination biology and plant reproduction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will investigate the genetic architecture of local adaptation using the short-lived, herbaceous, dioecious, perennial plant white campion (Silene latifolia). The researchers hypothesize that local adaptation occurs primarily via selection on males, leading not only to phenotypic differences between males and females, but also the genetic basis of local adaptation being associated with pseudoautosomal loci. To test this hypothesis, they will conduct a multi-year reciprocal-transplant experiment using two populations from Spain and Croatia that are highly divergent for sexually dimorphic traits. They will also conduct manipulative experiments in the greenhouse and the field to determine: (1) which traits are involved in local adaptation (via phenotypic-selection analyses), and how variation in water availability and air temperature influences this adaptation (via water and temperature manipulation), (2) whether males are under greater selection to diverge, and (3) whether sexual antagonism exists for any of these traits. In addition to pure-population individuals, F2 progeny planted in both Spain and Croatia will allow further determination of which traits and quantitative trait loci (QTL) are targets of differential selection between the two habitats. They will measure the extent to which QTL for divergent traits are essentially sex specific in their effect or shared between the sexes, and lastly, whether QTL responsible for adaptive trait divergence occur in the pseudoautosomal region of the sex chromosomes. The result will determine which traits of males and females are under selection, the extent to which antagonistic selection between males and females is implicated in adaptive population differentiation, and the extent to which these loci are located on the X and Y chromosomes.</AbstractNarration>

Research was performed using the plant species&nbsp;<em>Silene latifolia</em>. This species has male and female individuals (wherein sex is determined by a set of sex chromosomes) and exhibits many differences between the sexes. The research went beyond documenting local adaptation, to identifying traits underlying this adaptation, how selection operates on males vs. females, and the genetic architecture of population differentiation and differences between the sexes. A genetic basis to population divergence in early-seedling growth rate, pre-flowering leaf physiology, leaf thickness, and responses to water limitation for traits involved in fitness was revealed by common-garden experiments using populations that spanned a range of precipitation. This work revealed that water availability is likely an important abiotic factor responsible for population divergence, and that males and females respond differently to water limitation. A three-year, reciprocal-transplant experiment in Europe using two populations with different amounts of rainfall during the growing season (one from Spain and one from Croatia), revealed strong local adaptation for all components of fitness: longevity, mating, and fertility.&nbsp;Days to flowering and leaf thickness were both under fecundity selection in Croatia: plants that flowered earlier and that had thinner leaves had the highest fitness. In Spain, leaf thickness was under viability selection, with plants that had thick leaves surviving better than those with thin leaves. Two females from Croatia were each crossed to males from Spain; a female from one of these sets of grandparents was then crossed to a male from the other set to give rise to a set of fully outcrossed set of F<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>progeny. Hundreds of these progeny were grown in a common-garden setting, many traits were measured, each plant's DNA was extracted and evaluated for thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms. By having both the phenotype and genotype of each plant, it was possible to produce a recombination linkage map, to determine where in the genome the genetic control of the various traits mapped, and to determine whether some of this genetic control was specific to males vs. females. Traits important for local adaptation were found to have genetic loci on the sex chromosomes, and some of the loci were sex specific in their effect. Taken together, these results show that the evolution of local adaptation, differences between the sexes, and sex chromosomes are interrelated. Multiple undergraduates were involved in the research, as well as two graduate students and two postdoctoral researchers. Outreach activities to engage the general public in science were undertaken, and a workshop on how to write a scientific article was presented.</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/12/2019<br>      Modified by: Lynda&nbsp;F&nbsp;Delph</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1353970/1353970_10303635_1565640196827_femaleandmaleflowers--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1353970/1353970_10303635_1565640196827_femaleandmaleflowers--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Female and male flower"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1353970/1353970_10303635_1565640196827_femaleandmaleflowers--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Female and male flower"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A female (left) and male (right) flower of the dioecious plant species Silene latifolia</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lynda Delph</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Lynda&nbsp;F&nbsp;Delph</div> <div class="imageTitle">Female and male flower</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
