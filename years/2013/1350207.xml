<AbstractNarration>Insect species with wing polyphenism grow to two distinctly different adult wing sizes, with distinctly different anatomical patterns. Therefore, while humans have a single developmental pathway to the size and pattern of the adult body and organs, the developmental process must diverge for different individuals of polyphenic insects. The importance of growth regulation to human health makes studies of polyphenic organ size potentially transformative. How is one form specified and realized in each individual? How does this ability evolve in the species where it occurs? How can alternate wing sizes affect the spread of insects into new habitats? This project seeks to understand the cues and alternative developmental processes that result in differently sized and patterned wings of a native Florida insect, the red-shouldered soapberry bug (Jadera haematoloma). This project will use high-throughput sequencing to compare the expression of genes in bugs of each wing pattern. For selected genes, functional tests will examine their interactions and roles in regulating organ size and wing pattern. The evolution of polyphenism will be explored by laboratory selection on wing size variation in soapberry bugs and in a related insect, the large milkweed bug (Oncopeltus fasciatus), which normally grows to a consistent adult wing size and pattern. This work will be conducted largely by undergraduate students, as part of an integrative curriculum that combines hands-on work in molecular genetics, evolutionary biology and ecology with related social science and humanities courses related to urban life and adaptation to new environments. Public K-12 students and teachers will assist in field surveys of the bugs to determine how wing sizes correlate with their northward expansion from Florida up the East Coast. Project personnel and undergraduates will exchange knowledge and experiences online to illustrate the process of scientific research to younger students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The occurrence of short and long wing morphs in some insect species represents, polyphenism, that is, two alternative adult endpoints to development that are determined by the environment. In contrast, human development is characterized by relatively little variation in organ size, and extremes typically only occur in disease states. Polyphenism has been a classic topic of study in organismal and evolutionary biology. The genetic mechanisms underlying polyphenism can now be studied using modern methods of molecular biology. This project provides an understanding of polyphenic wing growth and patterning in the red-shouldered soapberry bug at the environmental, endocrine, genetic, developmental, and evolutionary levels. We have found that for individual bugs, wing length is not determined genetically. Each bug has the potential to respond to its environment and develop as either long or short winged. The determining factor is juvenile nutrition, which is integrated into adult development via the insulin signaling pathway. The threshold level of nutrition to switch between these two developmental endpoints has evolved as the bugs have adapted to different host plants, some of which provide more or less food for them. This change is associated with changes in the level of expression of insulin signaling components. Insulin and epidermal growth factor signaling also help pattern and shape the wings themselves. The decision to make wings or not allows bugs to maximize offspring production in environments with lots of food, or fly away and risk looking for better locations if food is limited. While this is advantageous for females, it comes at a cost to some males, who as short-winged bugs cannot fly and actually produce fewer offspring. This sexual conflict has been resolved in populations of bugs adapted to food-rich environments. Understanding this wing polyphenism helps provides insight into the regulation of organ growth in a system much more variable than in humans. Continued examination of these findings may reveal previously obscure aspects of related developmental systems in established model organisms or humans. The importance of hormonal control and growth regulation to human health make studies of polyphenic organ size potentially transformative. This research was also conducted is such a way that it incorporated elementary, secondary and undergraduate students directly.
