<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop novel "caged" macrocyclic chelating groups that display faster and more stable binding as compared to acyclic and mono-macrocyclic chelators currently used. Metallic radioisotopes offer versatile imaging and therapeutic properties, but loss of metallic radioisotopes from their site-directing molecules can lead to deleterious side-effects or reduced contrast and efficacy. There is a recognized, compelling need for improved chelating groups for use in radiopharmaceuticals. Such chelating groups must rapidly bind radioisotopes, so that they are compatible with the practicalities of clinical laboratory preparation. They must also stably bind the cation so that none is released in vivo, at least prior to its decay. The optimized chelating groups to be developed under this project will stably coordinate metal cations currently used for radioisotope-based diagnosis and therapy, display facile complexation kinetics, and provide a convenient synthetic handle for attachment to targeting moieties. By means of this approach, the novel chelators will both improve the utility of existing radiopharmaceuticals and permit the use of radionuclides that are at present underdeveloped in the clinic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be that aromatic macrocyclic bifunctional chelators (AMBFCs) will be developed that will potentially change the landscape in the way cancer is detected and treated.  Because the AMBFCs can be used in cancer imaging, the physician benefits from an effective feedback loop on therapeutic progress, remission, and prognosis that could further shorten the time of treatment. AMBFCs in companion radiodiagnostics also could reduce the cost of ineffectual medication, which is a strategic goal of the FDA. Plus, by employing novel radionuclides in the AMBFCs to kill tumors and their metastases, the benefit could materially cut down the time and cost of therapy. All of these features could promote better clinical outcomes and reduce the overall cost of healthcare by saving lives with earlier intervention. Through improved clinical outcomes from this unique science, AMBFCs will advance the national health, prosperity and welfare of others.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview: We have developed several new classes of bifunctional chelators for possible use in radiopharmaceutical agents.  We have identified the most promising candidates and continue to investigate their development.     Results: Novel bifunctional chelators containing isophthalamide, teraphthalamide, or hydroxypyridine coordinating units were prepared and conjugated to antibodies.  The corresponding zirconium-89 metal complexes were formed.  In vitro stability and in vivo biodistribution of the complexes were evaluated.  Bifunctional chelators based on teraphthalamide coordinating groups outperformed benchmark bifunctional chelator desferoximine (DFO) in terms of stability.  However, zirconium coordination by the corresponding antibody conjugates led to unacceptable levels of protein aggregation.  Bifunctional chelators based on isophthalamide coordinating groups were either insufficiently stable in terms of zirconium coordination, or else required more forcing conditions than DFO to coordinate zirconium.  Bifunctional chelators based on hydroxypyridine coordinating groups bound zirconium rapidly at ambient temperature and displayed acceptable stability in vitro and in vivo.  Further studies will determine whether these bifunctional chelators represent an improvment over the benchmark chelator DFO. Another new bifunctional chelator with hydroxypyridine coordinating units was prepared and the stability of the europium complex was evaluated in vitro.  We also prepared a peptide- isophthalamide chelator conjugate and formed the lutetium complex at ambient temperature.     Impact: In this project, we investigated new methods to attach metallic radioisotopes to site directing molecules for possible development as radiopharmaceutical agents.  Our focus was on the use of zirconium-89 as a PET imaging agent, although it is likely that the chelators we developed for zirconium will bind other radiometals that can be used for imaging or therapy.  All of the chelators that we developed have been disclosed in patent filings, and, in some instances, in academic publications.  In general, this work extends our knowledge base concerning the performance of chelating systems comprised of various topologies and coordinating units.  We expect that particular combinations of chelating unit, site directing molecule, radioisotope, and disease will form the basis of future development work by ourselves or partners to provide viable drug candidates. Some of the chelating systems developed during this project might display properties suitable for use in luminescent applications such as drug discovery and diagnostics.
