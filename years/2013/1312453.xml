<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project combines observational and theoretical efforts with a goal of improving knowledge of magnetic fields on low mass stars.  They will use high precision lightcurves of M-dwarfs from the Kepler satellite to probe starspots on late type stars to determine how stellar mass and rotation affect local magnetic fields.  They will use data already acquired from Kepler, and new photometry with moderate sized (1-m aperture) robotic telescopes and new spectra with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope.  Starspots are short-lived areas on the surfaces of stars that are caused by magnetic activity.  The researchers will also investigate the effect of magnetic fields on fundamental stellar properties, such as temperature, luminosity and radius as a function of M-dwarf mass.  They will also determine the relative importance of magnetic fields on observatory activity, such as flares and hydrogen-alpha emission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include providing research opportunities to undergraduate students in STEM majors, with an effort to broaden participation by students from traditionally underrepresented minority groups.  They will also engage a group of amateur astronomers to obtain time series photometry of bright eclipsing binary stars.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Sun has a magnetic field which produces sunspots on its surface when loops of magnetic field float up from the interior and pierce the surface.   The magnetic field also creates flares and coronal mass ejections which can be harmful to life on any orbiting planet.  The pattern of sunspots changes slowly over time in a predicatable way.  This tells us about the mechanism that generates and amplifies the magnetic field in the interior.   Our goal with this project was to study  This project involved trying to understand and characterize magnetic fields on stars other than the Sun.  We used a technique in which a planet orbiting another star transits the star causing a dip in brightness of the star when the planet passes in front of the star and blocks light from the star.  If the star's surface contains starspots, the transit is not smooth and symmetric.  Bumps in the bottom of the transit indicate the planet is passing in front of starspots on the surface.   In the image "Transit of HAT-P-11", a single transit of the planet hosting star, HAT-P-11, is shown crossing over 4 different starspots on the surface of the star.   We used this technique to map the starspots on the entire surface of HAT-P-11.  The image, "Map of starspots on HAT-P-11" shows the position of all the spots that were detected on the surface of the star.  These spots preferrentially occur in two distinct latitudes approximately 15 degrees above and below the equator of the star.   This is very similar to the star spot pattern that is seen on the Sun when the Sun is at the maximum activity level in its predictable cycle suggesting that HAT-P-11 has a similar mechanism for generating its own magnetic field.      Our analysis of HAT-P-11 is the first ever detailed mapping of a distant star which shows distinct small features like individual starspots on its surface.  We found that HAT-P-11 has a similar starspot distribution as the Sun and that the size of individual spots was similar to the Sun, but it had many more starspots on it than the Sun typically does.   HAT-P-11 is a cooler star with a deeper convection layer in its interior.  This convection may be the cause of the enhanced number of spots on the surface.  This project also analyzed the starspots on a cool star that is about 20-30 percent as massive as the Sun.   This star, GJ 1243, is spinning very rapidly.  It spins once every 12 hours, unlike the Sun which spins approximately once every month.   The rapid rotation of this star results in a large, long-lived starspot on the north pole of the star and a second large spot near the equator.    We use these features to measure the difference in rotation of the equator compared to the pole and find that the equator is moving faster than the pole of the star.    Lastly, we analyzed the magnetic flares  GJ 1243 and many other very low mass stars that are only 20-60% of the mass of the Sun.    We found strong correlations between the energy, maximum brightness, and duration of the flares.  However, there is no correlation between the flare occurence times and the phase of light curve modulation caused by large starspots at the poles.   Flares are not necessarily more common in the largest spots.    These observations support a scenario in which many individual starspots or magnetically active regions on the star contribute to the observed flare rate.
