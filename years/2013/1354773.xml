<AbstractNarration>Photosynthetic life (plants and algae) has a complex evolutionary history due to symbiotic interactions that have resulted in the transfer of chloroplasts (the photosynthetic organelle) among unrelated groups of organisms. While there is abundant evidence for the role of symbiosis in these evolutionary events, little is known regarding how organisms adapt to become "green". This project will investigate early events in the acquisition of a chloroplast and how an organism has restructured its entire metabolism in order to use photosynthesis, despite lacking the genes necessary to run it. The investigators will focus on a common marine ciliate that is known to feed on one particular group of algae, and steal its cellular machinery (i.e. the organelles: chloroplasts, mitochondria, and nucleus). The ciliate is able to incorporate these organelles into its own cell, and even replicate them as the cell divides, by utilizing genes expressed from the temporary stolen nucleus. The investigators will use next generation (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) and traditional (microscopy, cell physiology) techniques to discover how organisms can adapt to a photosynthetic metabolism and incorporate foreign organelles into their own cell. The investigators will focus on how the ciliate is able to steal a nucleus and facilitate its gene expression, and the subsequent targeting of proteins back to the stolen organelles that are reorganized within its cell. This foreign nucleus cannot divide in the ciliate, and therefore must be routinely replaced by feeding after the cell divides. These results will have broad applications to studies of symbiosis (including parasitism), and will reshape how we think about the role of symbiosis in eukaryotic evolution. The investigators will work with students (grades 8-12) in collaboration with the Zephyr Education Foundation, to expand marine science literacy and to teach about symbiosis. They will also train under-represented undergraduates through laboratory research projects.</AbstractNarration>

Instead, the ciliate also steals and utilizes the nucleus from its prey, thereby acquiring its entire metabolism and biochemical potential. The ciliate is unique in its ability to fully exploit foreign organelles, and this project sought to better understand how it is capable of doing so. Using next generation molecular approaches to measure its total gene (transcriptome) and protein (proteome) expression, novel insights were made into how gene regulation changes in the stolen nucleus and which pathways are active in the ciliate. The ciliate is able to maximize expression of key gene pathways involved in metabolism and energy acquisition, while down regulating nonessential foreign pathways for cytoskeleton, motility, and signal transduction. Analysis of the ciliate proteome also demonstrated that it synthesizes large quantities of cryptophyte proteins involved in photosynthesis and energy metabolism. Remarkably, the majority of the transcriptome and proteome in <em>M. rubrum</em> originates from the stolen cryptophyte nucleus, rather than the ciliate&rsquo;s own genome. This project also investigated the specificity by which <em>M. rubrum</em> selects and exploits cryptophyte prey for their organelles. The ciliate fed and grew equally well upon two closely related cryptophytes, <em>Teleaulax acuta</em> and <em>T. amphioxeia</em>, over short time periods, but over longer time periods performed better on the latter. Additional experiments were also performed on a related species, <em>M. chamaeleon</em>, that is less successful at exploiting stolen plastids and has less regulatory control over them. This study demonstrated that <em>M. chamaeleon</em> can commandeer chloroplasts from several lineages of cryptophyte algae, but that in most cases relied heavily upon heterotrophic digestion of prey. Despite displaying less regulatory control over stolen organelles, transcriptome data revealed that the majority of genes expressed by this ciliate still derived from its prey and that photosynthetic pathways were up or down-regulated depending on its nutritional state.&nbsp; The information gained from this project helped to further our understanding of the ecology and biology of this important marine ciliate, and to establish <em>M. rubrum</em> as a model species for understanding organelle sequestration and acquisitions.
