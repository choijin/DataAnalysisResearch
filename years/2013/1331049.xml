<AbstractNarration>This is a multi-sited ethnographic study of a small startup pharmaceutical company with an elite international scientific board, which focuses on drug discovery for neglected infectious diseases. The focus is on the global networks engaged in the training of African scientists, specifically in the US and UK.  The ethnography will include extended oral histories, observation at lab meetings and at scientific advisory board meetings.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Results of this study should offer suggestions on how to best train, support, and enable an emerging cadre of well-trained scientists working in this area. Results will be disseminated via a book and a web-based interactive narrative for high school and undergraduate students in the US and Africa.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Anne Pollock has completed ethnographic research at a small startup drug discovery company in South Africa, which was founded with the mission of drug discovery for TB, HIV, and malaria. She has also done ethnographic research at related sites in the U.S. and U.K., to understand the company's global networks.  She has found that although the synthetic chemistry that these Johannesburg-based scientists do is indistinguishable from what might be done in a well-equipped lab anywhere in the world, and is informed by global experts, place matters -- both for the scientists themselves, and for scholars and broader publics interested in global health and in postcolonial science.  The pharmaceutical company on which this project focused is called "iThemba Pharmaceuticals," and iThemba means "hope" in Zulu. Analysis hopes and aspirations has become a prominent mode in the field of science and technology studies (STS), and iThemba Pharmaceuticals provides a rich site for this.  For scholars in the fields of global health and STS, exploring the prospect of doing this fundamental research in Africa provides an opportunity to question entrenched bifurcations between global north and south, in which Africa is generally positioned as the site of problems to be solved rather than the site of problem solvers.  For the bench scientists involved, the hope has been multifaceted.  Their motivation has come from personal experience with disease, desires to contribute to democratic South Africa and to the continent more broadly, and the opportunity to have a job that is both in their field and at home.  This project's analysis of this particular site should also be of interest to policy makers and others interested in building capacity for African participation in global science, exploring in depth a case that showcases its contraints and its promise.  During the 2-year award period, the PI did took three ethnographic research trips to South Africa, and one to the UK, where she interviewed scientists and did participant observation.  She also did research in Atlanta. She worked with an artist and graduate student to prepare a web-based interactive narrative on the project, available at mappingithemba.com, and published an article from the project in Social Studies of Science, entitled "Places of Pharmaceutical Knowledge Making."  She gave several refereed conference presentations and two invited lectures on the project.  She is currently completing the book manuscript on the project, provisionally entitled Synthesizing Hope: Global Health, Postcolonial Science, and South Africa Drug Discovery.
