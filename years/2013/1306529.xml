<AbstractNarration>Dr. Mark Ellison from Ursinus College and Dr. Michael Strano from MIT are supported by an award from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry to investigate the motion of ions and biologically relevant molecules through single-walled carbon nanotubes.  Using nanotube nanopore devices fabricated at MIT, they are conducting experiments to study fundamental properties of these systems and to assess their usefulness for the nanoscale detection and control of the flow of ions and molecules.  This research extends the knowledge of motion through nanopores to several important areas, including amino acids and small neutral molecules.  The research also enhances our understanding of the role of nanopore properties, such as the effects of functional groups at the pore mouth and nanopore surface charge on the motion of ions and molecules through nanopores.  The results of this research provide foundational knowledge of nanotube nanopores and take an important step toward utilizing them in practical devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The undergraduate researchers at Ursinus College involved in these projects attain a variety of scientific skills.  First, they obtain significant experience conducting experiments in nanoscience.  They also develop their abilities to formulate, test, and revise scientific hypotheses.  Additionally, the Ursinus students significantly benefit from the collaboration with MIT, which includes visits to MIT to conduct experiments with the high-grade research instrumentation there.  Students involved in this research will emerge as well-trained young scientists with the tools to approach a wide range of scientific questions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this collaborative work with the Department of Chemistry at Ursinus College, we explored the electrokinetic transport through single walled carbon nanotubes.  An electric field applied between two reservoirs, connected by a carbon nanotube, allows us to measure the electric current passing through the small amount of aqueous solution (water) inside the carbon nanotube.  It is possible for salt ions to disrupt the flow of current (from protons) when they enter the nanotube, which is observed as a dip in the measured current for a short period of time, referred to as a blocking event.  In this work, in addition to observing blocking events from ions, we have found and analyzed blocking events from amino acids and methanol.  The neutral molecule methanol, in particular, exhibits different behavior when blocking compared to blocking from ionic species.  The length of time for the blocking events, referred to as the dwell time, for ionic species is proportional to the inverse of the applied voltage; understood as the blocking ion traveling faster through the nanotube when driven by the higher voltage.  For the neutral methanol, this dwell time in unrelated to the voltage, since the methanol is no longer directly pushed by the electric field.  Over the course of the project, undergraduate students at Ursinus were able to perform graduate level research.  They performed the experiments to measure the current through the nanotubes and analyzed the results.  Some of the students also participated in an annual visit to MIT where they were introduced to other techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy.  The students also gained experience with the chemical vapor deposition process used to grow the carbon nanotubes that were studied in this work.
