<AbstractNarration>An award is made to the University of Alaska Museum (UAM) to generate and publish electronic records from over 9,000 collections of marine invertebrates currently archived at the museum. These collections represent the results of oceanographic research on the faunal diversity of Arctic and sub-Arctic oceans over a period spanning five decades. The expertly curated, digitized records will be available to the global community of researchers interested in marine ecology for study. Understanding the diversity and patterns of distribution of Arctic and sub-Arctic marine faunas is of special urgency given growing interest in the development of mineral resources and transportation routes in those waters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, in the process of ensuring the preservation and dissemination of the information associated with the marine invertebrate collections at UAM, the project will promote training and improve expertise in taxonomy and biodiversity research. A graduate student will receive training on natural history collections research and on invertebrate taxonomy. Undergraduate students will work in the digitization effort and gain first hand experience with scientific research.  All aspects of the project will also involve training, mentorship and the development of an appreciation of the importance of collections-based research. Data records from the UAM will be readily accessible through the Arctos database web portal located at http://arctos.database.museum/.</AbstractNarration>
