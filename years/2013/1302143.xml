<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2013 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Igor Rapinchuk is "Abstract Homomorphisms and Other Problems in the Theory of Algebraic Groups." The host institution for the fellowship is Harvard University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Barry Mazur.</AbstractNarration>
