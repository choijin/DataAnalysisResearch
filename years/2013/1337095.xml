<AbstractNarration>1337095 (Kendall). Energy-related greenhouse gas emissions are expected to double by 2050, leading to warming of the global climate by 6 degrees or more. Rapid and extensive deployment of renewable and energy-efficient technologies is required to change the course of these emissions. This deployment will increase demands for materials important for clean energy technologies, leading to some becoming critical energy materials. National and international agencies have increasingly emphasized the role of critical energy materials in meeting climate change mitigation goals and for developing a vibrant economy for clean energy in the U.S. The complex interactions of supply, demand, and mineral extraction delays, barriers, or incentives will lead to varying resource restrictions and environmental impacts for critical materials over time. Thus, a dynamic and prospective approach to modeling material availability and environmental impacts is required for environmentally preferable material selection by technology developers, and to support strategic clean energy policies. This research will develop an integrated life cycle assessment (LCA) and material flow analysis (MFA) framework to create a dynamic approach for material sustainability assessment. LCA holistically analyzes the environmental performance of technologies, yet current LCA methods rely on static life cycle inventory data even in assessments of future technologies. This research will develop a prospective and dynamic approach by coupling two methods from industrial ecology: LCA and MFA. This coupling results in a new framework for dynamic LCA, one that acknowledges spatial variability in mining and refining impacts, and anticipates changes in a material's availability and environmental impacts over time. The framework will be applied to four metals considered critical, near critical, or watch list: two rare earths, neodymium and dysprosium; lithium; and magnesium. All four are essential for producing electric vehicles, an important clean energy technology. A dynamic LCA of future electric vehicles will serve as an illustrative case for this new method. The models and datasets generated will contribute to improved life cycle design, planning, and material selection for this particular technology, and provide a framework for developing similar tools and data for other technologies and materials. This research will contribute to other methodological advancements in industrial ecology by addressing unresolved issues in LCA, including recycling allocation practices for materials in long-lived products, and the treatment of co-production in prospective LCAs. The delay in secondary material availability when recyclable materials are bound in long-lived products represents an interesting case for recycling allocation. In addition, co-product allocation issues will be addressed because many critical energy materials are produced as co-products because they co-occur in geologic deposits. Application of enhanced LCA methods can help avert unintended consequences and improve the effectiveness of climate change mitigation strategies. This research will allow clean energy technology developers to anticipate long-term negative environmental consequences of selecting a particular material in a design, facilitating life cycle decision-making at the earliest stages of product development. This research will also help policymakers and industry anticipate the timing required for identifying alternative materials and resources, and for developing robust recycling infrastructure. The research methods and outcomes will be incorporated into educational curricula research and should also help policymakers and industry anticipate the timing required for identifying alternative materials and resources, and for developing robust recycling infrastructure. The research methods and outcomes will be incorporated into educational curricula for graduate and undergraduate courses, exposing students to quantitative sustainability methods and current issues. In addition, project-based seminars will be developed to target first year undergraduates from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds and community college transfer students considering or enrolled in engineering fields. Seminars will use engineering design problems with environmental sustainability themes to help students connect careers in engineering with socially relevant themes. In addition, students in grades 6-12 will be targeted through teacher training materials. The project will support one doctoral student in all years and provide two undergraduate summer research experiences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  This project developed new knowledge and methods for industrial ecology that incorporated temporal and spatial dimensions in material flow analysis (MFA), created dynamic life cycle inventories (LCIs) for use in life cycle assessments (LCAs) of critical or near-critical materials used in electric vehicles (EVs), and developed a new indicator for determining supply risk of critical EV materials.

This increases understanding of the long-term environmental impacts and supply risks of materials that enable EV technologies as well as other clean energy technologies such as stationary electricity storage for renewables integration and wind turbines.  Significant research results from this project include the following:  (1) Dynamic Life Cycle Assessment and Resource Modelling of Lithium for Batteries: Key outcomes from this research include a novel forecast of lithium demand coupled with a lithium resource deployment model, and a dynamic LCA model that estimates a global average environmental impact intensity for battery grade lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) over time.  LCE demand is expected to reach 82 to 98 kilotons per year (kt/year) by 2030, and could exceed 280 kt/year by 2050. Despite shifting to lower-grade resources around 2050, results show only modest increases in the impact of global average LCE, increasing from 2.8 kg CO2 equivalent per kilogram (CO2e/kg) LCE in 2020 to 3.2 kg CO2e/kg LCE by 2100.  (2) New LCI of Heavy Rare Earth Elements: Very few LCAs have examined heavy rare earth elements (REEs), and even fewer have considered production from ion-adsorption clays, which are increasingly dominant sources.  This research estimated environmental impacts of extracting and processing heavy REEs by collecting primary data from sites producing heavy rare earth oxides (HREOs &ndash; the precursor to refined heavy REEs) from ion-adsorption clays in China.  These data were used to develop open-source life cycle inventory (LCI) datasets of HREO production, and included the changing Chinese electricity grid over time. Results show one kg of mixed HREOs emits 258-408 kg CO2e.

Results show that supply risk of REEs is highly correlated with the concentration of the production market. China has become the dominant producer of REEs with over 90% of world production. Thus the fluctuation of supply risk is almost solely depend on China?s policies.  In addition, when compared to similar indicators developed by other researchers, this study arrived at similar but consistently higher estimates of supply risk.

Broader impacts  Beyond tackling a research topic of importance for climate change mitigation and environmental sustainability more broadly, this project provided substantial financial support and research opportunities for three graduate student researchers and research opportunities for three undergraduate student researchers.  One of the graduate students has completed her doctoral degree and is working on transportation sustainability themes for the World Bank in China.  Two other doctoral students are completing their dissertations with expected completion in 2019.  In addition to providing undergraduate research opportunities, this project also supported the development of an undergraduate seminar offered to UC Davis College of Engineering STEPS students in their sophomore year &ndash; these students are mostly first generation college students.  The seminar used project-based learning to help students connect the concepts they were learning in introductory engineering classes to problems of societal importance or popular interest with the goal of improving retention of students in the critical sophomore year.  Dissemination of this research was also undertaken through conferences, workshops, peer-reviewed journal articles, and communications in popular media.
