<AbstractNarration>The Main Conjectures of Iwasawa theory which have been studied up to now relate the first Chern classes of Iwasawa modules and Selmer complexes to p-adic L-series. The object of this FRG project is to generalize this theory to higher Chern classes. One component of this generalization concerns how to define higher Chern classes in a way that facilitates studying them by L-series. This will be done by extending to the context of Iwasawa theory the adelic methods of Parshin and Beilinson. Another component of the generalization has to do with connecting higher Chern class invariants to L-series.  To do this, one needs enough structure in the arithmetic problem to see into its higher codimension features using L-series. Three particular cases will be considered are (i) Greenberg's conjecture over totally real fields, (ii) Iwasawa theory for imaginary quadratic fields at split primes, and (iii) the function field case.  Concerning (i), Greenberg has conjectured that the natural Iwasawa modules have trivial support in codimension one;  the PIs will study their codimension two support using L-series. Concerning (ii), work of Rubin, and of Kings and Johnson-Leung, suggests that one should study second Chern classes via symbols in K_2 groups associated to pairs of p-adic L-series.  Concerning (iii), the PIs will study the images under Chern class maps of classes defined by Witte in the function field case inside the higher relative K-groups of Iwasawa algebras.  One further component of this project has to do with generalizing to higher Chern classes the reduction techniques used in proving first Chern class Main Conjectures. This involves generalizing to Iwasawa algebras the theory of tilting complexes and derived equivalences which is used in group representation theory and in studying Fourier-Mukai functors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal deals with fundamental questions about the groups of symmetries of algebraic equations.  In the 1950's, Iwasawa began a new approach to the study of such equations by considering their behavior in infinite families. Iwasawa showed that many such families have well defined asymptotic behavior. This led to fundamental conjectures concerning the numerical growth rate of the symmetry groups arising from such families.  The proof of such "Main Conjectures" has been one of the  central goals of abstract algebra over the last 50 years.  This proposal has to do with the refinements of these conjectures which deal with more precise measures of rates of growth.  Concerning broad impacts, work on algebraic questions of this kind  has led to the development of technology essential to society, such as the improved compression and secure transmission of data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The award funded research in the field of algebraic number theory, which concerns solutions to polynomial equations in a single variable with rational coefficients.  These solutions give rise to large sets of numbers on which one can perform standard arithmetic operations and which generalize and extend the usual rational numbers and their integers.  These sets are known as number fields and their integer rings.  Unlike the usual integers, these integer rings need not have the property of unique factorization that their elements factor in essentially just one way into products of prime elements.  The class group, one of the central objects in the field, is a device that measures this failure of unique factorization.  Iwasawa theory, a now-central area of algebraic number theory that was initiated by Kenkichi Iwasawa in the 1950s, studies the growth of a part of these class groups in an increasingly large tower of number fields. Iwasawa's main conjecture described the growth in a certain case in terms of values of complex-valued functions known as L-functions and their "p-adic" analogues.  This conjecture was proven by Barry Mazur and Andrew Wiles in 1984.  Numerous generalizations of it to other settings have since been formulated and in many cases proven.  In all of them, the parts of the class groups under consideration grow sufficiently rapidly in the tower that the analytic objects that are the L-functions can be brought to bear.   This project aimed to study cases where the growth is slower: essentially, the limiting object is too small to be described by the same invariants as before.  In this NSF Focused Research Group award, the five principal investigators and two collaborators in the United Kingdom defined "higher Chern classes" that can be used to measure the size of these smaller objects.  Moreover, they showed that in certain cases these objects too can be described in terms of not one L-function, but a pair of them.  This has opened up a remarkable new avenue of study in an an active and central subarea of number theory.  The research group for this collaborative award organized a 5-day workshop at the Banff International Research Station in 2016 on Iwasawa theory, where these new developments were discussed.  The NSF award at U. Arizona supported the research and professional development of four Ph.D. students.       Last Modified: 10/10/2017       Submitted by: Romyar T Sharifi]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
