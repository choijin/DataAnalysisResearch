<AbstractNarration>Winthrop University hosts a nine week research program, Winthrop University REU: Bridging Applied and Theoretical Mathematics. Research themes include differential equations modeling of cancer biology and the study of phylogenetics using algebraic geometry and combinatorics. A professional development seminar and a colloquium series supplement the faculty mentored research activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program supports students from groups traditionally underrepresented in mathematics graduate programs, but welcomes all students from institutions whose highest mathematics degree is Bachelor's degree. This project builds a diverse and talented group of mathematics students and supports their transition into graduate programs in STEM fields.  In this project, faculty mentors provide sustained mentorship beyond the completion of the nine week research experience and participants are supported to present their findings at national meetings.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
