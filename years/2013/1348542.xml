<AbstractNarration>This project will enable the development of personally-tailored motivators for the use of social technologies, e.g., various incentives to encourage users to contribute knowledge, provide emotional support or curate information on an online system. The project includes (1) study of motivator-to-motivation matching using a series of controlled studies, (2) development of models to infer users' motivation profiles through analyzing how underlying motivations predict usages of social technologies, and (3) application and evaluation of tailored motivators to encourage user-participation in naturalistic settings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will advance scientific understanding of how a person's motivations influence his or her usage of social technologies. It will also deepen our understanding of human motivations more generally by elucidating the intricate relationship between the types of rewards and how they are moderated by different underlying motivations to affect behaviors. In addition, the research will also result in models for identifying users' motivation profiles, and a general design framework for researchers and designers to tailor motivators, bridging multiple disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developed motivation profiles and design framework may be useful to tackle a variety of everyday challenges of motivation in social technologies to improve knowledge sharing, social support and information representation. Through collaborative projects, this research will also aid health behavior change efforts to encourage blood donation and combat infant obesity. Finally, through an integrated educational plan, this research program will also contribute to improving general classroom learning, the creation of a graduate course and high school summer camp, and the training of scholars in interdisciplinary research methods.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award supported a research and education program that resulted in 10+ peer-reviewed research publications (including one best paper award), a personal values model that is integrated into an IBM product (Watson's Personality Insights), numerous professional presentations and invited lectures, and funded the training and education of 4 PhD students, 15+ underrepresented minority high school students, and the development of a master's level class on Designing for Behavior Change.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Getting people to participate in social systems is hard. While many have acknowledged the effectiveness of using a tailored approach over a one-size-fits-all approach, there exists a number of challenges with using tailored designs. With this award, we were able to make key contributions in three aspects:</p> <p><strong>1. Understanding how to tailor.</strong></p> <p>One critical challenge with tailoring is that we have only a limited understanding of how various motivators can differentially impact each individual. Our research has made significant contributions in this area. Through experiments, field studies, and analyses of social media data, we studied how to more effectively match motivators to individuals' personal values and psychosocial characteristics. We empirically demonstrated that people's values influence the types of incentives and content people are drawn to [2,5], how temporal distance (how far away an event is) influence the factors that people consider and the messages they are more influenced by [4], and how reciprocity influence people's donation patterns through Wikimedia's banner campaigns [9]. These insights offer designers levers in designing technology-enabled motivators to encourage prosocial behaviors.</p> <p><strong>2. Tools to help reduce the cost of tailoring.</strong></p> <p>Another challenge with tailoring is the cost of implementing such designs. To offer individually-appropriate motivators, the system needs to be able to differentiate across users along key dimensions of interest. Our work also contributed tools to help reduce this cost. We collected usage behaviors on social media and developed machine learning and statistical models to predict users' personal values [1]. We further explore the efficacy of our model in a field study in the context of social media ad targeting [3]. This fruitful collaboration with IBM Research facilitated the development of IBM Watson's Personality Insights, which can help predict social media users' personality characteristics, needs and values through the text they have written.</p> <p><strong>3. Applications of and design guidelines for tailoring.</strong></p> <p>We also designed and deployed services that tested different tailoring strategies, and contributed to design guidelines. Aside from the aforementioned use of tailoring in ad targeting on Twitter, we also developed a crowd-based behavior change planning tool to enable crowds of other people to help generate personalized behavior change plans [6], tailored visualization to increase game performance [7], and SMS-based reminders [8] and chatbot systems [10] that uses tailored messages to encourage physical activities. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of using tailored approaches to encourage positive behavior change, as well as highlight the use of human centered approaches in developing and evaluating tailored motivators.</p> <p>1.
