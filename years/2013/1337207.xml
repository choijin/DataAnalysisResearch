<AbstractNarration>1337207 &lt;br/&gt;He&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award supports the University of Northern Iowa (UNI)with the acquisition of a closed cycle optical microscopy cryostat to be interfaced with a Horiba Labram HR Raman Microscope. The combined system will enable variable temperature optical microscopy studies of materials such as 2-dimensional dichalcogenide systems and low dimensional topological insulators (TIs). The instrument will enable studies of a range of current condensed matter topics such as the interplay between charge-density-waves and superconductivity, the physics of quantum confinement effects of charges and phonons in nanostructures, studies of surface properties of low dimensional TIs, and the search for optical signature of Dirac cones on the surface of TI nanostructures. The instrument will also be integrated in undergraduate students research and it will be incorporated in three undergraduate courses at UNI. The state-of-the-art optical microscopy cryostat will significantly broaden the scope of research and teaching at UNI.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award supports the acquisition of an efficient refrigeration system for variable temperature optical microscopy studies of diverse materials. The system will be combined with a commercial Raman microscope at the Physics Department of the University of Northern Iowa (UNI). The combined system (Raman microscope and refrigeration system) will enable variable temperature optical microscopy studies of a variety of materials and will enhance and broaden the scope of the research at UNI. The acquisition of an optical microscopy refrigeration system will have a powerful impact on the undergraduate students at UNI. This equipment will be used in three undergraduate courses and will extend the reach of the instrument to approximately forty more students per year at UNI. It will also stimulate participation of greater numbers of students in research activities and provide undergraduate students with hands-on experience in low temperature optical experiments using world-class research instrumentation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A new closed cycle optical microscopy cryostat (made by Cryo Industries of America, Inc.) was purchased in fall 2013 and installed in the PIÆs research lab at the University of Northern Iowa in June 2014. The requested instrumentation is interfaced with the Horiba Labram high resolution Raman Microscope system.  Intellectual merit: The acquisition of the closed cycle cryostat has enabled variable temperature (10-320 K) optical microscopy studies of diverse materials in the PIÆs group: (i) Few-layer graphene: The vacuum environment in the cryostat has enabled the studies of adsorption processes of air molecules on graphene surface; (ii) Topological insulators (TIs) and doped TIs: Phonons display strong temperature dependence. Temperature coefficients for well-defined Raman lines are determined. From power dependent Raman measurements at T &lt; 30 K, we can determine the thermal conductivity of Bi2Te3 at low temperature; (iii) Transition metal dichalcogenide nanostructures: Raman signals from charge density waves in few-layer 1T-TaS2 emerge at low temperatures and are different from those in bulk 1T-TaS2; (iv) Complex oxide systems: Spin-gap and magnon features which occur at low temperatures in thin layers of Ca3Ru2O7 are explored.  Broader impact: The acquisition of the closed cycle cryostat has stimulated vigorous collaborations between the PIÆs group at UNI and research groups at large research institutions. The equipment has opened up new opportunities for more students to improve their preparation for graduate school and the STEM workforce.  The greater number of research projects and experimental techniques enabled by this equipment has increased the number of students who participate in physics research. The PI has involved ten undergraduate research students and two high school students in the process of installation and training of the operation of the equipment. Among the ten undergraduate research students, five are female students. The PI also incorporated this equipment in the Optical Science course that she taught in fall 2014.
