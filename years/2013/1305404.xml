<AbstractNarration>Abstract:  RouteViews is a system for systematically collecting data on the routes (the paths by which data gets from point A to point B) used by Internet traffic.  It has played a critical role in the study of significant events, such as large scale outages, that have taken place in the Internet.  The RouteViews data archives are the most widely used source of Internet routing data for the computer networking, network operations and network security communities.    They are also increasingly being used in studies of network topological growth and network economics.  However, access to the RouteViews data has been challenging to new users since the data is current structured as flat binary files with no simple interfaces for searching or accessing the data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will design and implement database access to the RouteViews data, and will develop simple interfaces and tools for accessing the data.  The resources used to acquire and store the data will also be expanded.  The project will open up the use of routing data to a broader community including undergraduate education.   It will work with the community to raise awareness about the potential uses of routing data in research and education, and will promote the use of the new access methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will expand routing data collection, will make it easier to access the collected data and will benefit  networking research, network operations and network security.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ BGP is the de-facto routing protocol in the Internet. Studying the BGP behavior can reveal important information about the Internet, such as where there are outages, if a prefix was hijacked, who censors what, routing stability, connectivity differences between countries and much more.  In the past, BGP information was delivered in raw form, with a time delay, and in a format that was hard to use, requiring a certain level of expertise from the users. In this project, we addressed these issues by making BGP data easier to use, faster to obtain, and available in a variety of formats to serve different user needs. We also made substantial changes to the collection and storage infrastructure, moving away from custom, hard to maintain code, to community software. The result is a far more scalable and robust system based on a distributed database.  We used the new version of BGPmon to instantiate a prefix hijack alert system. The database interface of the new system enabled the creation of the alert system in very little time. We demonstrated this system at various venues, including the DHS Showcase meeting in February 2016.  Other outcomes include "WIT: A Watchdog System for Internet Routing", a DHS-funded project. Leveraging both the software (BGPmon/Cyclops) developed under the current NSF funding and the on-going data collection at RouteViews, we developed WIT, a BGP monitoring system for the Australian critical infrastructure. We identified critical services and monitor these critical services from locations around the world to provide real-time alerts for new events. We also provide long term historical records for tracking behavior under past events.  The system is flexible since it can be deployed as a private instance or as part of the public system we operate; it is scalable and robust through the use of a high-performance distributed database; it is lightweight through the use of efficient, community-supported BGP monitoring software; it is extensible by accommodating a broad set of monitored data; and finally, it enables several types of alerts such as prefix hijacks and routing path anomalies.
