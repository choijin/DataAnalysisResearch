<AbstractNarration>The project is focused on designing a holistic communication stack that leverages TV whitespaces for enabling "connected vehicles" and their many advantages in ushering smarter and safer transportation services. The combination of low cost of the unlicensed TV whitespace spectrum and its longer communication ranges matches the needs of vehicular connectivity quite well.  Yet realizing TV whitespace communications faces unique constraints and challenges including, e.g., protecting primary incumbents, scanning through many channel configurations subject to spatial-temporal variations, dealing with asymmetric uplink/downlink transmit power constraints due to FCC regulations concerning mobile and static nodes.  The proposed research addresses these challenges through a range of techniques. It augments spectrum sensing techniques from sensors distributed across moving vehicles to enhance the accuracy of spectrum databases. It employs innovative PHY and MAC layer techniques including variable spreading codes, MIMO and directional antennas, complemented with network/transport layer protocols that adapt to uplink/downlink asymmetry.  These research tasks integrate machine learning techniques to explore the predictable mobility and other unique advantages of the vehicular whitespace network. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a new communication technology for improved and robust wide-area connectivity for vehicles.  All developed techniques are expected to be deployed in a practical setting on a realistic vehicular testbed in Madison, WI. The research work engages collaboration with many industry partners and is expected to influence regulatory and standardization bodies.  The researchers are also making educational impact through public lectures, developing new curriculum, and motivating women and minorities in future STEM careers through appropriate PI engagement at high school and undergraduate levels.</AbstractNarration>
