<AbstractNarration>In this Institutional Implementation project, learning and retention is being enhanced for students in STEM disciplines at Oregon State University resulting from the broad implementation of evidence-based instructional practices (EBIPs) in calculus based freshmen and sophomore level courses in biology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, and physics. The introduction and expansion of EBIP courses are based on two instructional approaches with a broad evidence of effectiveness, interactive engagement in lecture and formal cooperative learning in studio workshop laboratory/recitation sections. Growth of EBIP implementation is being catalyzed through a theoretically grounded action research approach to organizational change, namely the establishment of inter- and intra-disciplinary communities of practice (CoP) focused on instructional design and learning.  These CoPs include innovators, instructional faculty, and graduate and undergraduate assistants.  The CoPs themselves are the subject of action research that is examining the participants' interpretations, meanings, and connections related to curricular and pedagogical reform and how these influence their decision making processes related to implementing EBIPs.  The research is evaluating the effectiveness of EBIPs using a mixed methods approach to measuring student learning, beliefs related to learning, and social variables that facilitate learning.  The research results are being shared more broadly across the university to facilitate further awareness and change.  The goal of this effort by its conclusion is broad implementation of EBIPs courses in STEM disciplines, evidence of their effectiveness on student success, and an institutionalized infrastructure to continue the reform process through faculty development and monitoring of effectiveness after the conclusion of this project.  Project success is facilitated by a detailed and theoretically grounded plan of action and research and a highly qualified team. The project team includes provosts, deans, department chairs, educational innovators and educational researchers. The project builds on successful past innovations from NSF funding. The advisory panel includes prominent expertise in educational practices of curriculum and instruction, organizational change, psychometrics, and educational research. The organizational research plan is founded on theories of emergent organizational change, communities of practice, and intentional conceptual change.&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 10,000 OSU STEM students will be exposed to EBIPs annually, with highly likely impacts on their learning and retention. Approximately 50 OSU faculty and 300 student instructors will have enhanced knowledge of and changed beliefs about interactive engagement and formal cooperative learning environments. A sustainable infrastructure for continued improvement and implementation of EBIPS will be in place.  At the conclusion of this project we will understand (i) how common EBIPs are manifested in different academic environments and disciplines, (ii) how singular and multiple experiences with EBIPs courses impact student learning, motivation, self-efficacy, personal epistemology, sense of community, and social networks, and (iii) how elements of communities of practice enable faculty to learn about and implement EBIPs in their own courses. Collectively, these intellectual contributions will have long lasting impact on others attempting to encourage the increased implementation of EBIPs.</AbstractNarration>
