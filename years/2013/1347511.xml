<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the Sixth Annual Graduate Student Mini-conference on Computational Mathematics, held at Virginia Tech on March 7-8, 2014.  The conference series engages researchers and graduate students from a number of research universities in the southeastern Atlantic region of the United States. The primary objective of this meeting is to provide a venue for graduate students to present their research in either poster (interactive) or short presentation formats. The conference also includes a plenary speaker from one of the participating universities.  This conference series exposes students to modern research directions in a wide range of areas in computational mathematics including, but not limited to: turbulent flow, large eddy simulation, optimal control, groundwater flows, magnetohydrodynamics, numerical approximation for stochastic partial differential equations, model reduction methods, fluid-structure interaction, and climate modeling.  The meetings lay the groundwork for future collaborations in these important research areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For most of the student participants, this mini-conference provides their first presentation experience within a supportive atmosphere and provides valuable exposure to a large network of researchers with the same or related research interests.  The mini-conference has always attracted participants of different backgrounds and nationalities. Underrepresented groups, including women and minorities, are strongly encouraged to participate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:  www.icam.vt.edu/Conferences/johnfest_2014/</AbstractNarration>
