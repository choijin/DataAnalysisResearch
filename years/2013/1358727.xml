<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Howard University provides six undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in research on topics in atmospheric physics, computational and experimental nanophysics and condensed matter, mathematical physics and supersymmetry, and experimental laser spectroscopy. In addition to participating in research with an experienced mentor, the REU students will engage in weekly activities to ensure not only that their research stays on track but that they have an engaging collegial and scholarly experience. By the end of the program, every student will have prepared a poster, made an oral presentation of the research, and written a final report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will have a number of broader impacts with its focus on providing research opportunities to undergraduates to help prepare them for future science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers. The site has a strong plan to recruit undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in physics and from community colleges. The project plans to be informed by an on-going evaluation, which examines clear goals.</AbstractNarration>
