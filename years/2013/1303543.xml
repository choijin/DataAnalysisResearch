<AbstractNarration>Dr. Jie Qing proposes to study various problems in the field of partial differential equations in conformal geometry. At its core is the study of the interplays between geometric structures of manifolds (submanifolds) and analysis of conformally invariant partial differential equations, with a general principle that is originated from the so-called AdS/CFT correspondence in string theory in mathematical physics.  Currently there are two approaches that reflect such principle. One is the Yamabe problems of different orders generalizing the Yamabe problem via scattering operators, and the other is the fully nonlinear Yamabe problems arising from the study of hypersurfaces via support functions in hyperbolic space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is to study the holography principles that relate quantum gravitation theory and some conformal field theory. It has become a part the field where mathematicians and physicists can interact. One broader impact of this proposal is that advancements in this field of research will help establish mathematical framework for the proposed theory in theoretic physics. The second broader impact of this proposal is to the education. The proposed research will enable Dr. Jie Qing to actively participate and contribute to the undergraduate and graduate program at UC Santa Cruz.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of my research in the period are in the following three categories: 1) scalar curvature rigidity and static spaces; 2) local scalar conformal invariants for hypersurfaces; 3) asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein manifolds.  On scalar curvature rigidity and static spaces, based the previous work of Corvino, we concluded that, at least locally, there is no deformation of metrics to increase scalar curvature when and only when the metric is static. This gives an interesting interpertation of the celebrated positive mass theorem in mathematical relativity.  On the study of local scalar conformal invariants for hyersurfaces, we considered the model case of surfaces in conformal round 3-sphere. We took the ambient space approach of Feffermen and Graham and created the associated hypersurfaces in Minkowski 5-spacetime from a surface in 3-sphere. This approach allows us to relate the classic work of Blaschke to the work of Robert Bryant.  On the study of asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein (AHE) manifolds, our main achievement is to have established the volume growth rates inside an AHE manifold is bounded from below by the Yamabe constant of the conformal infinitiy. This is the most direct impact of the conformal geometry of the boundary at infinity to the Riemannian geometry of the AHE manifolds. In partiacular, this proves the complete rigidity of hyperbolic spaces.             Last Modified: 08/31/2017       Submitted by: Jie Qing]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
