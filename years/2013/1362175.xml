<AbstractNarration>Complex analysis in one and several variables occupies a central place in mathematics and mathematical physics. The use of complex numbers is essential in the development of mathematics. The concept of phase in complex analysis, for example, is commonly used in control theory, image analysis and dynamical systems. Certain important structures in physics arise from an integration of complex analysis with partial differential equations. Partial differential equations and several complex variables are also used in String and Twister mathematical physical theories that try to unify different physical force fields. For all these applications, foundational questions concerning the solution of such partial differential equations under certain geometric constraints are still not fully understood and they form some of the most challenging problems in mathematics. The current study is not only important for the development in mathematics, but it may lead to new understanding of physical phenomena with potential applications in other sciences and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will focus on some of the most important equations in several complex variables, including the Cauchy-Riemann equations and the induced tangential Cauchy- Riemann equations. The problems discussed in this proposal include function theory on complex manifolds, Hausdorff property of Dolbeault cohomology groups, Levi-flat hypersur- faces and complex foliation, the Cauchy-Riemann operators on complex pro jective spaces and negatively curved manifolds. Understanding the geometric aspects of these equations under the curvature conditions and their relations with function theory in complex manifolds is one of the most challenging and important problems in complex analysis and geometry. New approaches have been introduced to study these problems which connect the topology of domains in complex manifolds with the topology of Dolbeault cohomology groups. Regularity of the solutions to the Cauchy-Riemann equations are related to the foliation theory on the boundary. The study of several complex variables in a geometric setting has provided interesting new questions with fresh insight to problems in topology, foliation theory, complex dynamics, algebraic and complex geometry. The solution of these questions will advance our knowledge in all the aforementioned areas. Complex geometric theory has only just begun to develop and more efforts will be directed in this direction. Geometric measure theory and harmonic analysis will also be applied to study several com- plex variables on non-smooth domains. These problems are at the intersection of analysis, geometry and topology with applications in applied mathematics and physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The  PI  has obtained several significant results  in  several  complex variables     and complex geometry.   They span both fields because the results in several complex variables are related to the Cauchy-Riemann equations under geometric curvature conditions.   As such, the problems represent some of the  most challenging and exciting new directions in both complex analysis and geometry.   They have applications in complex foliation theory, as well as algebraic and complex geometry.   The PI and her collaborators have characterized the closed range property of the Cauchy-Riemann equations in different function spaces.  Their result is particular important in the Hilbert space setting since it is related to the spectral  theory of the complex Laplacian. In other words, one can ask the question if one can hear pseudoconvexity in complex manifolds. Its real analogue is the famous question asked by Mark Kac more than fifty years ago "Can we hear the shape of a drum?"  These new results have attracted a lot of attention from people not just in complex analysis, but people in real spectral theory,  complex geometry, mathematical physics and other fields. She has been invited to give  lectures on the subject in both conferences and short courses in several countries, including   a lecture series at a workshop in Brazil.  The interaction between  complex analysts and differential geometers at these events and elsewhere has produced deep and important results over the past few decades. The PI has brought  the necessary tools and knowledge in both disciplines to catalyze such interaction and make significant contributions.  She also  continues her  work   on the Laplace equations   on domains with  minimal  smooth boundary, which is not only an active area of research in mathematics, but   has applications in engineering and physics.       The PI is co-authoring  a graduate textbook  to be published   by the American Mathematical Society. This book will be a modern approach to study basic one complex variables.   The first draft,   based on her own lecture notes and research in the past decade, is almost ready. She has already made many chapters of the book available to graduate students and researchers.          Besides writing  research papers and graduate textbook,  The P.I.    wrote   an article entitled "A woman mathematician's journey" published in the book " I, Mathematician" by MAA in 2015 based on her own experiences.    Excerpts  of the article has been re-published on the website of the  Association for  Women in Mathematics. It was also published  by the  International Congress of Chinese Mathematicians and its translation has been published  in a Chinese  magazine in Taiwan.    She   received considerable positive feedback about the article  from young mathematicians, especially women, who appreciate her honest  depiction of her own struggle with   self-doubt,   obstacles,  and the joy during her journey to become a mathematician.   Her article has reached a wide audience all over the world, including high school students.               Last Modified: 07/21/2018       Submitted by: Mei-Chi Shaw]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
