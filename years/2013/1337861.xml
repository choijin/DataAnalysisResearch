<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The ice dynamics and tectonic history of Ice-covered regions are poorly understood. Scientific investigations of these regions are hindered by extreme weather and complex logistical support. The PIs propose development of a new, rapid deployment, dense footprint, seismic observatory for ice-covered regions, the Geophysical Earth Observatory for Ice-Covered Environments (GEOICE). This seismic array will provide increased observational capabilities and logistical efficiencies needed to seismically image the structures and dynamic behavior of both the solid Earth and overlying ice in remote ice-covered regions. Instruments developed for GEOICE will be designed to withstand icy and/or wet environments and require minimal logistics. Research enabled by GEOICE includes: ice mass and sea level changes, solid earth structure, tectonics and ice sheet stability, and deep Earth structure and processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;GEOICE will provide a community tool for achieving a better understanding of the Earth's rapidly changing polar and ice-covered regions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2007 report concluded that poor understanding of glacial dynamics prohibits robust estimates of future sea-level. GEOICE will enable research that helps address this societally relevant issue. Simplified logistics enabled by GEOICE could lower the technical and logistical barriers that hinder young investigators in the polar regions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ GEOICE Project Outcomes Report  NSF Award #: 1337861  Award Title: Collaborative MRI: Development of Geophysical Earth Observatory for Ice Covered Environments (GEOICE)  Award Term: October 1, 2013 to March 31, 2019  Introduction   The Geophysical Earth Observatory for Ice Covered Environments (GEOICE) was a project supported by the National Science Foundation to develop a pool of seismic instruments that were specially designed for use in Earth?s ice-covered regions.  The project, which began in 2013, lasted approximately five years and resulted in a state-of-the-art pool of seismometers and ancillary equipment that will allow scientists to make detailed recordings of earthquakes beneath the ice, as well as icequakes, glacial calving events, and other ice-related phenomena.  GEOICE was made possible by a unique collaboration between glacial seismologists at Central Washington University, seismic engineers at the IRIS PASSCAL Instrument Center at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (NMT), and management staff from the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS).  Together, these three groups brought the necessary expertise in seismology, instrumentation, and execution to see the project through to a successful conclusion.  The resulting GEOICE pool of seismic equipment could not come at a more opportune time?both seismologists and society have developed an increasing interest in the rapid changes now occurring in Earth?s polar regions.  Intellectual Merit   While scientists today are fortunate to have seismic sensors installed all over the Earth, the polar regions remain more sparsely instrumented than elsewhere.  This has direct impacts on the ability of seismologists to detect events happening in these regions, and also limits the quantity and types of observations that can be made for large earthquakes anywhere on Earth.  For instance, when a large earthquake happens anywhere on the planet (e.g., California) the seismic waves travel through the Earth and are recorded by seismometers worldwide.  The more observations we can make of those waves the more we can learn about the paths the waves have traveled through the Earth, which informs our understanding of Earth structure.  Beyond recording distant earthquakes, seismometers in polar regions have proven vital to recording the significant changes these regions are seeing in a warming climate.  In recent years, seismometers have produced spectacular recordings of calving glaciers in Greenland, tsunami-tossed icebergs in Antarctica, and the effects of melting of ice sheets and glaciers worldwide.  Even for ice-covered regions that are not currently experiencing dramatic changes, the GEOICE equipment pool allows scientists to create an important record that can be compared against any changes in the future.  The instrumentation array developed and built as part of the GEOICE project incorporates decades of lessons learned from earlier attempts to record earthquakes and related phenomena in ice-covered regions. For example, the GEOICE array is designed to be easily transported to some of the most remote locations on Earth, a significant improvement over earlier generations of seismic sensors.  Once on-site, the sensors themselves are built to withstand extreme cold (&lt;40?C) and can operate while submerged within the water of a melting glacier (Figure 1).  The sensors require significantly less power than typical seismometers, allowing scientists to deploy them with fewer batteries, or for longer periods of time, while still gathering high-quality data.  Figure 1 - A GEOICE seismometer at the bottom of a borehole in an Alaskan glacier.  Broader Impacts   The highly-specialized pool of seismic equipment produced by the GEOICE project provides the entire scientific community with a specialized tool for studying the Earth?s rapidly changing polar and ice-covered regions.  The GEOICE pool contains 3 different types of seismic sensors: 10 larger ?broadband? sensors for recording distant sources, 55 smaller ?intermediate period? sensors for more recording of regional sources, and 200 small ?nodal? sensors for dense deployments studying nearby sources.  The sensors themselves are housed at and maintained by the IRIS PASSCAL Instrument Center at NMT, funded by NSF under the SAGE award (Seismological Facilities for the Advancement of Geoscience) (Figure 2).  There, expert staff maintain the equipment and make it available for free use by any scientist funded by the National Science Foundation.  In this way, the GEOICE equipment is a true community resource, able to be used by a variety of scientists (e.g. seismologists, glaciologists, meteorologists, etc.) who wish to conduct scientific studies in Earth?s ice-covered regions.  The lessons learned during the GEOICE project have been and continue to be shared with the broader scientific community through scientific conferences, meetings, and publications.  Through the partnership with the IRIS PASSCAL Instrument Center at NMT, several geophysics graduate students have been involved with the project?gaining valuable experience with seismic instrumentation, and enhancing the knowledge of the next generation of scientists.
