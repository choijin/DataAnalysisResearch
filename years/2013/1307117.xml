<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Eric Fossum of Wright State University will utilize meta-activated nucleophilic aromatic substitution as a facile route to prepare poly(arylene ether)s with a multitude of functional groups located in pendent positions. Three different approaches will be employed including: 1) the introduction of azide moieties, via the corresponding iodo derivative, allowing for "clickable" systems, 2) utilization of functional sulfonamide groups as the activating group for nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions, and 3) reactivity ratio controlled polycondensation reactions of BB'B"-type monomers, which provide the possibility of functionalization either before or after the polymerization process.  The thermal and mechanical properties of the polymers will be evaluated as well as their potential for application as engineering thermoplastics. The broader impacts involve training master's, undergraduate, and high school students in research methods, disseminating results in publications and seminars, as well as the development of a new class of chemically robust polymeric materials suitable for a wide variety of applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polymers are long chain organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life that utilize plastics, including food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and lightweight electronic devices.  This work will enhance our ability to synthesize new engineering plastics with excellent environmental stability and properties that can be readily tailored to meet a specific need. The results of these studies may have many positive, long-term impacts on applications in which engineering plastics are currently employed, including the energy, medical, automotive, electronics, and aerospace industries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scientific Merit                       The overall goal of this project was to utilize meta activated nucleophilic aromatic substitution, NAS, polycondensation reactions as practical and efficient routes to functionalized poly(arylene ether)s, PAEs.  One of the key advantages to this methodology is that the functionality resides in a truly pendent position, relative to the backbone of the polymer.  As such, a wide variety of functional materials can be prepared from a relatively small number of monomeric species.  In addition, since the various functional groups are located in identical positions, these new materials provide an exceptional opportunity for the development of thorough structure-property relationships.  The introduction of new functionality into the systems allows the researcher to readily tailor the properties of the material to meet a specific need.               The primary scientific outcome of this project was the introduction of functionality to PAEs, via the use of sulfonamide, sulfone, and benzophenone type monomers, each of which was designed to undergo meta activated NAS reactions (Figure 1). In the sulfonamide category, two different classes of materials were prepared, N,N-dialkyl and N-alkyl-N-aryl based systems.  The dialkyl materials provided the opportunity to tailor the glass transition temperature of the polymer, from a low of 19 &deg;C to a high of 155 &deg;C, without any change to the polymer backbone.  Similar results were achieved with the N-alkyl-N-aryl based systems with the additional capability to introduced functional groups such as allyl, iodo-aryl, and benzoate.  The sulfone systems led to an isolated chromophore material in which a "push-pull" type chromophore, that emitted in the blue spectral region, was covalently fixed within the polymer.  Finally, a methodology, which is named Reactivity Ratio Controlled Polycondensation, RRCP, was developed, in this case with a benzophenone monomer, that afforded the possibility of incorporating a wide range of functional groups to poly(ether ether ketone), PEEK, polymers, but in a "one-pot" approach.  This approach only required the synthesis of one monomer, that could be reacted at low temperatures with functionalized phenols, followed by reaction with a bisphenol, at higher temperatures, to prepare the desired functional PEEK analogue. This new methodology provides the scientific community a viable option to rapidly prepare a multitude of engineering thermoplastics with tailored chemical and physical properties.  Broader Impacts              The broader impacts resulting from this project included the scientific training of sixteen students, ten M.S. level and 6 undergraduates, which provided them with the necessary "skill set" to succeed in their chosen endeavors.  The "skill-set" consisted of a variety of synthetic and analytical techniques, report writing, manuscript preparation, and presentation methods.  Six of the sixteen students involved with the project were female, which served to broaden the participation of this underrepresented group in scientific endeavors.  Beyond the above mentioned academic impacts, this project provides the scientific community with a new and robust platform for the introduction of functional groups to engineering thermoplastics, a synthetic tool called Reactivity Ratio Controlled Polycondensation for the facile incorporation of functionality, and a wide variety of new materials with enhanced and readily tuned properties for use in numerous applications that require traditional engineering materials.
