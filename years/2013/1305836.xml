<AbstractNarration>As rates of parasitism increase and species invasions skyrocket, there are increasing numbers of outbreaks of disease that result from novel host-parasite pairings.  How do hosts and parasites evolve in response to these new interactions, and what are the consequences for ecological dynamics of native and invasive hosts?  This project uses interactions among a native bacterial parasite, a native zooplankton host, and an invasive zooplankton host that is now infected by the native bacterial parasite to ask how parasites adapt when they first enter a novel host.  Existing genetic archives for both host and parasite provide a rare opportunity to study the important process of how pathogens that originate in one host species move to another; this host switch is very difficult to observe in nature. In addition, observational studies of lake populations, laboratory experiments and mathematical models will be used to understand how parasitism influences population dynamics of native and invasive hosts.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important component of this project involves educating, training and diversifying the next generation of scientists.  The principal investigator will work with science educators to develop hands-on, experiential learning activities for inner city children in Atlanta, focusing on plankton and microbes.  Informal science education activities aimed at the general public will also be developed, and will be used to engage visitors to an inner city park. Pre-teacher undergraduates from Georgia Tech will be trained in scientific research, educational research, and pedagogy.  In addition, students from Georgia Tech and nearby Spelman College will be involved in the proposed research, gaining valuable research experience. Finally, because many new human pathogens likely arose in different hosts, understanding the process by which pathogens jump from one host to another will have broad societal significance.</AbstractNarration>

Transmission between host species is more likely if those host species are more closely related. Finally, we found that, while transmission can occur between species, the pathogen has lower fitness when it?s in the "wrong" host species.  When a novel host invades a community and becomes infected by a native pathogen, can we predict what impacts it will have on patterns of disease? We expected that we should be able to use host competence to predict how an invasive species would influence community disease dynamics; specifically, we predicted that the addition of a highly competent invasive host species should increase disease.
