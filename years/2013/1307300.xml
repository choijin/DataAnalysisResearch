<AbstractNarration>Multipacting is a resonance phenomenon that involves electron emission and dynamics in high electric fields at the vacuum chamber or cavity walls in acceleration systems. In this award, the physics giving rise to the electron emission and dynamics will be studied. Experiments will be conducted with superconducting undulators (SCU) at the Argonne National Laboratory Advanced Photon Source (the APS) and the data analyzed. A combination of analytical and numerical computation will be used to analyze the physics, and the results will be compared with the experimental data where available.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the work are significant as the development of SCU has considerable benefits in enhancing the capabilities of synchrotron light sources, particularly for hard-x-ray sources.  Multipacting is also an important challenge for other machines, for example electron-positron and proton proton colliders. Carrying out the research on site at the APS will provide direct training of a student in accelerator science and operation, an opportunity that is not readily accessible outside of an operating synchrotron facility.</AbstractNarration>

An SCU employs a set of superconducting coils to generate a periodic magnetic field that interacts with the high-energy electron beam in a synchrotron light source to produce higher-brightness high-energy x-rays for scientific research. SCUs may be subject to multipacting phemonena, which can negatively impact the device itself and potentially degrade the accelerator performance. Multipacting is a resonance phenomenon that involves electron emission and dynamics in high electric fields at the vacuum chamber walls.  In this project, the physics giving rise to the electron emission and dynamics were studied. In particular, the research focused on understanding in detail the first step in the emission process; namely, surface physics of photon absorption and beam-induced synchrotron radiation heat load in the SCU. A combination of analytical and numerical computation were used to analyze the physics, and the results were compared with experimental data obtained with the first SCU installed at APS. Various photon scattering models were compared, a method was developed to convert power incident on the vacuum chamber walls to temperature, which can be measured, and an effective quantum efficiency was constructed for use in future photoemission studies.  The analytical calculations agree well with numerical modeling of typical, rough vacuum chamber surfaces, where diffuse 3D photon scattering were taken into account. The predicted SCU chamber temperatures from incident beam-induced radiation power and resistive-wall heating, including the anomalous skin effect (applicable at cryogenic temperatures), agree to within 20% for beam orbit excursions possible during APS user operations. This is an excellent result, given that previous work elsewhere on heat load calculations on cryogenic beam liners in a synchrotron have typically underestimated the liner beam-induced power by factors of 2-10.  This project has greatly advanced the sophistication and accuracy with which beam-induced heat loads are estimated in a cryogenic vacuum chamber in an electron synchrotron. Accurate heat load predictions are critical for optimal cryogenic design.  The conclusions were generalized to in order to be applicable to other SCUs or superconducting wigglers. The work is expected to contribute to SCU development for APS Upgrade, and to future studies of beam-induced heating and multipacting at other accelerator facilities. The grant supported a physics graduate student in completing a doctoral thesis.       Last Modified: 11/20/2015       Submitted by: Katherine Harkay]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
