<AbstractNarration>Rock glaciers are the most important form of high mountain permafrost, making the investigation of rock glacier dynamics a key factor in understanding the evolution and movement of permafrost-related formations under changing climate conditions.  Monitoring terrain change is necessary to understand rock glacier mass-transport processes, to detect their response to environmental variability, and to assess associated natural hazards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support a new international research collaboration between Southwest Research Institute® (SwRI®) and West University of Timisoara (WUT), Romania, to quantify rock glacier dynamics using a state-of-art method based on complementary analysis of high resolution optical and radar satellite imagery.  The project will set up a "benchmark" study where we will test the applicability of these methods in measuring movements of several rock glaciers located in Retezat National Park, Southern Carpathian Mountains, Romania.  It promotes interdisciplinary research, bringing together principles and specific methods of geomorphology, climatology, mountain ecology, remote sensing, and geoinformatics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this proposed work will create a baseline for future studies on rock glacier movements in Central and Eastern European alpine regions where information on glacier rock dynamics is scarce or completely missing.  In parallel with this work, we will initiate similar research activities in the United States (e.g., Front Range, Colorado or La Sal Mountains, Utah). Future research will advance our broader understanding of climate trends and permafrost evolution in mountainous areas and the potential for remote sensing techniques to detect and monitor a variety of rock glacier movements.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported an international collaboration to investigate the dynamics of high mountain rock glaciers and the effects of climate change on these land forms.  In addition to providing indications of the impacts of climate change, rock glaciers are important regulators of the hydrologic cycle in mountain terrains and can pose a threat to humans and infrastructure if they are destabilized by climate change and accelerated thawing.  Southwest Research Institute&reg; (SwRI&reg;) and West University of Timisoara (WUT), Romania, conducted field investigations and analyses of remote sensing data to quantify rock glacier dynamics using a state-of-art method based on complementary analysis of high resolution optical and radar satellite imagery.  The project tested the applicability of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and optical data analysis techniques for measuring movements of several rock glaciers located in Retezat National Park, Southern Carpathian Mountains, Romania.  The results of this project established that these rock glaciers are moving very slowly in response to changes in temperature and climate.  In addition to the technical accomplishments, this project brought together an international, interdisciplinary team that combined the principles and methods of geomorphology, climatology, mountain ecology, remote sensing, and geoinformatics to investigate an important environmental concern about the stability of rock glaciers.  It also supported educational opportunities for four students, an entry-level graduate scientist and two post-doctoral researchers.  By supporting international travel for the U.S. Principal Investigator, the project facilitated important contacts with government agencies and other stakeholders to educate them on the impacts of climate change on high mountain environments.  Future research will advance our broader understanding of climate trends and permafrost evolution in mountainous areas and the potential for remote sensing techniques to detect and monitor rock glaciers as well as other types of mass movements (e.g., ice glaciers, talus cones and scree slopes, and rock rivers in the alpine domain, river bed evolution, gullies and ravines, alluvial cones, and landslides).  Results from this work will create a baseline for future studies on rock glacier movements in Central and Eastern European alpine regions where information on glacier rock dynamics is scarce or completely absent.  In parallel with this work, similar research activities will be initiated in the United States (e.g., Front Range, Colorado or La Sal Mountains, Utah).
