<AbstractNarration>Defining the mechanism that regulates the insertion of the voltage-dependent potassium channel 1.1 into the surface membrane of neuronal dendrites&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The number of voltage-dependent potassium channel subunit 1.1 on the cell membrane tightly regulates a neuron's resting state and determines how a neuron responds to its environment accordingly.  In the dendrites of neurons, voltage-dependent potassium channels that contain the 1.1 subunit influence changes in synapses that are considered to reflect the different types of learning or formation of memories.  This research aims to identify the molecular mechanism governing the insertion of the voltage-dependent potassium channel subunit 1.1 into the surface membrane of dendrites.  The proposed study will examine how the voltage-dependent potassium channel subunit 1.2 promotes the surface expression of subunit 1.1.  Furthermore, this research will investigate the mechanism by which the suppression of the mammalian target of rapamycin, a protein that positively regulates translation, leads to the protein synthesis of the voltage-dependent potassium channel subunit 1.2.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The discoveries from this study will expand the current understanding on the mechanisms that influence learning and memory at the molecular level.  Furthermore, findings from this investigation will provide a holistic characterization on how the protein-the mammalian target of rapamycin-regulates the production of other proteins.  Data generated from this project will be used to gain a faculty position and establish a laboratory at a university that will further elucidate the molecular events that regulate learning and memory, and support the education and research training of underrepresented populations in science.</AbstractNarration>

Inhibiting activity of or turning off the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) increases the level of Kv1.1 in the dendrites. I have found that reducing mTORC1 activity also increased the expression of Kv1.2, another voltage-gated potassium channel subunit which associates with Kv1.1. Interestingly, turning off mTORC1 increased the protein levels of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 in the postsynaptic density region, a subcellular area that is thought to receive chemical messages and that is important for learning. Attenuating mTORC1&rsquo;s activity also increased the association of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 proteins. Since other studies show that association of Kv1.1 with other Kv subunits is sufficient to traffic Kv1.1-containing channels to the membrane, Kv1.1&rsquo;s association with Kv1.2 and the increased expression of Kv1.2 when mTOR activity is lowered may serve as a mechanism that promotes the surface expression of Kv1.1 channels in the postsynaptic region.&nbsp; Kv1.1 channel affects the ability of a neuron to send signals that are thought to encode the perception of our surroundings. Thus, these findings provide significant insights into the molecular events that govern learning and memory.&nbsp; This work is published as &ldquo;mTORC1 is a local, postsynaptic voltage sensor regulated by positive and negative feedback pathways,&rdquo; in the journal, <em>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience</em>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project also investigated how mTORC1 regulates the syntheses of proteins. It is well-established that activating mTORC1 promotes protein synthesis. However recently, turning on mTORC1 has been shown to repress protein synthesis.&nbsp; Because mTORC1 is critical in learning, determining which proteins are synthesized or repressed when mTORC1 is active or inactive is fundamental to advance our knowledge of the processes that underlie learning. &nbsp;The project interestingly discovered that equal number of proteins are elevated and reduced at the synapse, the site of communication between neurons, when mTORC1 activity is perturbed. This discovery suggests that prolonged activation or inactivation could lead to synapse dysfunction and disrupt learning.&nbsp; I have also found that mTORC1 activity may control protein levels at the synapse by altering the abundance of RNA binding proteins (RBP). RBPs influence which proteins are translated or repressed.&nbsp; This project found that Parkinson protein 7 (Park7/DJ-1) and alpha-synuclein (Snca), newly-identified RBPs, may dictate which proteins are expressed when mTORC1 is turned on or off.
