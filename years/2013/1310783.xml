<AbstractNarration>This action funds Joseph Hollmann of Northeastern University to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at National Taiwan University in Taipei. The project title is "Analysis and Modeling of Ultrasound-Modulated Light in Tissue to Reduce the Effects of Scattering." The host scientist is Professor Snow Tseng.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optical interrogation of tissue uses non-ionizing radiation and has high biological specificity. However, its application in biomedical imaging is limited because, in most tissues, scattering masks physiologically important information such as optical absorption. Recent work has shown phase conjugation of a scattered probe beam can be utilized to reduce scattering and allow for focusing deep within tissue. We can dynamically determine this focal point by modulating an optical wave with an ultrasound beam to create a reference point, or "guidestar," and achieve ultrasound resolution imaging to depths of multiple millimeters. This project analyzes the coherent properties of an optical signal propagating in a scattering medium to determine its effects on the formation of the ultrasound-modulated guidestar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the Fellow will extend the benefits of this experience to others in several ways. First, the results will be presented to Prof. Tseng's research group at the conclusion of the program. Second, after traveling back to the United States, the research as well as the experience in Taiwan as a Fellow will be presented to the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University. During the fall, the Fellow will travel to Brownsville, Texas, a community with a large minority population, and offer a series of discussions to local high school students about engineering, research and the experience in Taiwan. The Fellow will mentor students in programs designed to enhance representation of under-served populations, such as the Young Scholars and Research Experience for Undergrads programs. Finally, the Fellow will continue to collaborate with Prof. Tseng's group to ensure the results of the summer?s work are disseminated by publishing papers and giving presentations at conferences.</AbstractNarration>
