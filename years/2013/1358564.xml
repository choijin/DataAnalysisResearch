<AbstractNarration>Objective: This research project aims to achieve a greater understanding of erbium optical centers in the wide bandgap semiconductor GaN. The approach utilizes the magneto-optical techniques to study the microscopic structure of these centers.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The proposed work involves theoretical and experimental investigations of the microscopic structure of optically active Er centers in GaN will be investigated using magneto-optical measurements. The study will focus on the Zeeman effect on photoluminescence lines associated with erbium centers in GaN as a function of magnetic field strength. Several approaches combining analytical and simulation techniques for the magnetic field-induced splitting of the photoluminescence lines will be utilized. The individual g-tensors of ground and excited states of the erbium optical centers will be determined. The study will focus on the temperature dependence of the intensity ratio of the high and the low energy components at high magnetic fields. The information will provide a detailed description of the microscopic structure of the optical centers.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research will lead to a greater understanding of erbium optical centers in GaN semiconductor films. This information is crucial for future photonic/optoelectronic applications, including optical amplifiers, optical communication systems, solid state lighting devices, and quantum information processing systems. The proposed research also impacts training graduate and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary areas of photonics, material science and devices.&lt;br/&gt;The research results will be incorporated into courses offered by the PIs in both Optics and Nanoscience programs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The research provides comprehensive information on the excitation mechanisms and the microscopic structure of erbium (Er) optical centers in the large-bandgap semiconductor gallium nitride (GaN). Er-doped GaN has attracted much attention due to its potential impacts on display technology, solid state lasers, optical amplifiers, and optical communication systems. However, the GaN:Er system remains poorly understood and even controversial in regard to the microscopic structure of the Er optical centers as well as the relevant energy transfer mechanisms, which constitutes a barrier to further increases of device emission efficiency and thermal stability. Using optical techniques, we have reported direct evidence of two mechanisms responsible for the excitation of optically active Er<sup>3+</sup> ions in GaN epilayers grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. These mechanisms, resonant excitation via the higher-lying inner 4<em>f</em> shell transitions and band-to-band excitation of the semiconductor host, lead to narrow emission lines from isolated and the defect-related Er optical centers. These centers have different photoluminescence spectra, local defect environments, decay dynamics, and excitation cross-sections. The high excitation cross-section combined with the temperature independence of decay dynamics and high percentage of optically active center of the isolated Er optical centers makes the GaN:Er materials synthesized by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition interesting for GaN photonics. By applying the Zeeman spectroscopy in magnetic field strength up to 17.5 T combined with a high resolution monochromator, our results shed light on the current understanding of the microscopic structure of Er optical centers in GaN epilayers. These information are crucial for future photonic/optoelectronic applications, including optical amplifiers, optical communication systems, solid-state lighting devices, and quantum information processing systems.
