<AbstractNarration>The proposed new site of the I/UCRC for Advanced Forestry Systems (CAFS) at Auburn University intends to expand CAFS efforts by providing additional and specialized expertise and research in areas specifically within the forest entomology and forest pathology research and the management of forest pests in the southern US forest ecosystems. The Auburn University associated CAFS projects will augment and complement current CAFS projects in the broad areas of insect and disease management, through silviculture, disease and insect resistance and invasive species research in forest plantations throughout the southern US.   Auburn University specifically proposes a number of collaborative projects on developing disease and insect management and genotype screening programs for enhancing southern US conifer planting stock survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Auburn University CAFS site has the potential to increase the breadth and reach of broader center impacts. These key impacts include:  increased competitiveness of forest products industries and forest landowners, improved knowledge of members with respect to insect and disease pests that affect stand productivity and enhanced technology transfer between Center scientists and industrial members, expanded scientific knowledge through peer reviewed publications and presentations, expanded training of graduate students with unique interdisciplinary skill sets, recruitment of graduate students from underrepresented groups, and undergraduate involvement that may promote more graduate enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Root architecture and root growth in container-grown Pinus species: </strong>Toppling of young conifer stands is defined as an instability in young stands that occurs when the trees are not completely wind-thrown, but lean at various angles and continue to grow (Figure 1). Of the documented cases of wind-thrown trees dating back to the late 1980s, nearly every case has been associated with container seedlings. When toppled seedlings have been examined, many do not have a normal tap root extending into the soil profile. The choice of container set composition is limited to either polystyrene or hard plastic. The trend over the past 15 years has been toward hard plastic due to the longevity, ease of extraction, and reduced price differential between polystyrene and hard plastic. In 2016, over 85% of all seedlings were produced in hard plastic container sets. &nbsp;&nbsp;This study has shown that polystyrene containers have a relatively uniform distribution of roots throughout the horizontal profile of the plug (Figure 2), whereas, hard plastic containers have the greatest proportion of root numbers and weight toward the bottom of the plug (Figure 3). &nbsp;Container sets without the side air pruning holes had regions of the seedling plug with little to no lateral root growth.&nbsp; When root morphology for loblolly and longleaf pines are examined from the various container types, the copper treated polystyrene container produces a uniform root system. &nbsp;As a result of these studies, some container set manufacturers are modifying new container sets to include more side root pruning holes that will increase the number of fibrous roots around the area of their placement. &nbsp;Although some growers do not like the side air pruning holes, since it requires more attention to irrigation, the best hard plastic containers with respect to root architecture and root growth were those with side air pruning holes.</p> <p><strong>An novel method for inoculum production and inoculation of fungi into trees to mimic insect feeding habits:&nbsp;</strong> We evaluated the potential of toothpicks cultured with Leptographium terebrantis inoculated into &nbsp;loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stems with different densities to mimic feeding by bark beetles (Figure 4). &nbsp;Experiments showed that toothpicks can serve as a substrate for inoculation causing blue stain and sapwood occlusions in trees (Figure 5). The best distance between two inoculation points was 1.2 cm with the sapwood occlusion increasing as the radial density of fungal inoculation increased. &nbsp;&nbsp;Those interested in insect/fungal inoculation interactions could consider using toothpicks for inoculations to successfully mimic the natural way of ophiostomatoid fungal inoculation by bark-beetles into trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Tree host response to four different levels of stem inoculation with the fungus Leptographium terebrantis</strong>: Leptographium terebrantis is an opportunistic root pathogen commonly associated with loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stands that are undergoing excessive and unexpected mortality in the southeastern US. &nbsp;Using the toothpick inoculation method described above, an inoculation study was conducted in a five-year-old loblolly pine stand over a 24 week period.&nbsp; We found that L. terebrantis caused sapwood occlusions that increased in severity as inoculum (toothpick) density increased. The occlusions within the sapwood significantly reduced water transport through the stem but did not interfere with stomatal conductance or induce moisture stress in the saplings.&nbsp; &nbsp;We attribute the resilience of stomatal conductance to the growth and function of new the sapwood that developed after artificial inoculation with toothpicks. These inoculation trials indicated that faster-growing families of loblolly pine may be capable of tolerating the root disease when the formation of new sapwood is supported by sustained crown health.</p> <p><strong>Within tree species response of insect-vectored fungi, Grosmannia huntii and Leptographium terebrantis inoculated into loblolly pine:</strong> We examined within species variation in the tolerance of loblolly pine &nbsp;(Pinus taeda L.) to two ophiostomatoid fungi, Leptographium terebrantis and Grosmannia huntii associated with pine decline in the southern US. &nbsp;Containerized seedlings of P. taeda from 27, 32, 17, and 23 different genetic families were artificially inoculated with L. terebrantis and G. huntii in 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2017, respectively. After inoculation, lesion and occlusion were measured on each seedling to determine their relative susceptibility or tolerance of the various loblolly pine families to these fungi (Figure 6). &nbsp;The 4-yr inoculation trials revealed that loblolly pine families differed widely in their host response to the fungi.&nbsp;&nbsp; These results showed that within species variation to L. terebrantis and G. huntii exists among loblolly pine families and it could be possible to breed tolerant families to minimize the negative impact due to these fungi.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/20/2019<br>      Modified by: Scott&nbsp;A&nbsp;Enebak</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1360860/1360860_10293042_1556216615675_IMG_3424--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1360860/1360860_10293042_1556216615675_IMG_3424--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1360860/1360860_10293042_1556216615675_IMG_3424--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Longleaf pine seedlings toppled due to wind event and poor lateral root stablity.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr. Ryan Nadel</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Scott&nbsp;A&nbsp;Enebak</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1360860/1360860_10293042_1556285731401_PolystryeneCopper--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1360860/1360860_10293042_1556285731401_PolystryeneCopper--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1360860/1360860_10293042_1556285731401_PolystryeneCopper--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Root architecture of seedling grown in polystyrene container coated with copper.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr. Ryan Nadel</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use -
