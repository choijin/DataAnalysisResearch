<AbstractNarration>Paine College proposes to implement a project entitled "Undertanding Barriers to STEM Education for African American Women". The project will investigate the underlying factors linked to the disproportionate participation of African American women in STEM fields. Specifically, the PI will identify the psychological and contextual barriers that limit their preparation in STEM disciplines using a consolidated longitudinal mixed methods research design. The study will investigate the link between career decisions and self-efficacy and the impact of the learning context on African American women's persistence in STEM. The study will also identify patterns of secondary education preparation in math and science that differentiate STEM and non-STEM African American females. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will enhance the body of knowledge on ethnic minorities by presenting a rigorous research study beyond anecdotal data that gives a better understanding of the socialization experiences of ethnic minority students, especially African American females. The study can be replicated at other HBCUs and other institutions seeking to circumvent contextual barriers through holistic interventions designed for African American female students. It also could provide new insights into the intersectionality of gender and race.</AbstractNarration>

Lastly, a comparative analysis of African American college women's academic help-seeking behaviors and domains of self-efficacy was examined to identify behaviors that pose challenges to and facilitate academic success in STEM undergraduate education.  Quantitative Analysis  An independent-samples t-test was calculated comparing the mean scores of participants within STEM and Non-STEM degree programs for math self-efficacy and science self-efficacy yielding a significant difference between the two groups in year 1 (Math: t(36) =2.12, p&lt; .05 and Science: t(36) =2.17, p&lt; .05). In the third year, a significant difference was only evidenced in math self-efficacy (Math: t(90) =-3.01, p&lt; .01 and Science: t(90) =-.72, p= .47) The scores for general academic self-efficacy scores were not significantly different across groups indicating a similar self-perceived capacity to perform well academically despite degree field for all three years.  The goal of STEM career inclusion is further facilitated by a significant difference in students reported Career Decision Self-Efficacy in which STEM student reported greater confidence in the self-appraisal, occupational information, goal selection, planning, and problem-solving; t(90) =-2.03, p&lt; .05)  A t-test analysis of contextual support utilization for STEM vs. Non-STEM participants revealed a trend in year 1 data indicating that STEM students use contextual supports more than their Non-STEM counterparts (t(36) =1.72, p&lt; .10) In years 2 and 3 a significant association emerged year 2 (t(72) =-2.13., p&lt; .05) and in year 3 (t(88)=-1.96, p &lt; .05).  The role and function of parent and teacher socialization messages were also assessed yielding a statistical trend where STEM students reported more parental socialization that focuses on student active engagement in academic exploration, t(90) =-1.62 p= .05).    Qualitative Analysis  Individual interviews (n=58) and focus groups (=18) were conducted during the three-year grant period. Interview data was further reviewed and refined to identify four major themes related to the objective of the research. Participants described math and science courses in a pejorative manner.  General curriculum courses such as College Algebra and Biology were viewed as barriers to academic success. Participants that switch majors reported course difficulty as one of the major factors impacting their decision.  Another significant impact of changing major is the length program completion.  Participants felt that program that required more than four years to complete was a major area of concern. Participants were more likely to identify peers as main sources of both academic and emotional support When faced with academic problems, participants often sought help from their peers rather than their professors. Many of the participants were first general college students. Parents were cited as playing an important role in participants? motivation to succeed in college.  Most often parents? experiences and behaviors shaped how participants felt about their ability to succeed in college.
