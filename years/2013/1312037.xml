<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the U.S. annual dues to four, separate International Geoscience Unions that are part of the International Council for Science (ICSU): International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG), International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS), and International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA).  This award also provides support for the U.S. National committees (USNC) to each of these Unions.  The role of the USNC's is to facilitate participation of American scientists in the activities of the international unions, engage the U.S. community in advancing geosciences in the U.S. and abroad; establish strong links to and foster communications with the respective international unions; exercise U.S. leadership in these unions; develop a globally aware U.S. geoscience community that collaborates internationally; and support the development of early-career U.S. geoscientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Meeting a Critical Need at a Critical Time: The U.S. National Committees for the Earth Sciences  NSF Grant 1312037  The goals of this project were to 1) appropriately represent the U.S. geosciences community in four major international geoscience unions of the International Council for Science (ICSU): the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG), International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS), and the International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA), and (2) advance geosciences in the U.S. through the continued work of the respective U.S. National Committees (USNCs).  The National Academy of Sciences is the official U.S. adhering body to each of these four Earth science unions, and effects this representation through the USNCs for Geodesy and Geophysics, Geological Sciences, Soil Science, and Quaternary Research, which performed this work. Unions provide scientific services for the global community, such as convening scientific meetings (from large international congresses to focused events), capacity building and professional development, the organization and sponsoring of disciplinary and interdisciplinary international research projects, and specification and definition of standards.     INTELLECTUAL MERIT  By its nature, geoscience research is collaborative and has a large international component.  The USNCs perform a bridge function between the U.S. scientific community and the international scientific community as represented by the unions. The USNCs effect the representation of the U.S. through contributions in union governance, policy, and programs through nominating top U.S. scientists for leadership positions and awards,organizing delegations to the General Assemblies, and proposing resolutions; and by organizing and participating in union projects and programs. Stronger scientific unions, in turn, strengthen U.S. science.  The USNC for Geodesy and Geophysics, with the support of the other three geoscience USNCs, organized a session on the impact of Arctic warming on the mid-latitudes at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) 2014 Annual meeting that resulted in wide media coverage in the U.S. and abroad, contributing state-of-the-art research to the discussion.  Other activities organized and carried out by the USNCs alone or in collaboration with professional society meetings, such as the Soil Science Society of America (SSSA) and the American Quaternary Association (AMQUA), benefited U.S. early career scientists.     BROADER IMPACT  As neutral conveners, the USNCs for the Earth sciences bring a variety of stakeholders together to discuss important issues in the geosciences and organize activities to benefit U.S. scientists.    The USNCs provide U.S. scientists with information about Union programs and activities and encourage participation in them. They also work to advance geosciences in the United States. Cases in point are the organization of a session on the past, present, and future of interdisciplinary Quaternary research at the 2015 INQUA International Congress in Nagoya, Japan, and the participation of the USNC/Soils on activities related to the International Year of Soils (originally proposed by the IUSS), which have helped make this effort a success with scientists and non-scientists alike; and the great success of the 2014 AAAS session organized by the USNCs, which was very well attended, positively evaluated, and resulted in over 70 press articles.  Career development of U.S. scientists is of great importance to the USNCs: through the core support provided by this grant, the USNC/Soils participated with SSSA in a 2014 travel award program for the World Congress of Soil Science in Jeju, Korea, and organized a mentoring session at the 2013 SSSA meeting; and the USNC/INQUA organized a stand-alone mentoring session at the 2014 AMQUA meeting.
