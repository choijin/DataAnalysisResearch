<AbstractNarration>The PI will resolve specific questions about knots, links, and spatial graphs in 3-dimensional space using a combination of topological and algebraic techniques as well as techniques from Heegaard Floer homology and von Neumann algebras.  The aim of the first part of the project is to gain a better understanding of the smooth knot concordance group C, by studying a new filtration of the subgroup of topologically slice knots called the bipolar filtration, defining a primary decomposition for the n-solvable quotients, and viewing C as a metric space and studying operators acting on it.  Questions about the knot concordance group are closely related to questions about smooth 4-manifolds and thus will provide insight into the mysterious and exciting world of 4-manifolds.  In the second project, the PI proposes to establish a higher-order Heegaard Floer homology theory that categorifies the higher-order and twisted Alexander polynomials.   The PI will use this theory to define new concordance invariants generalizing the Heegaard Floer tau invariant. In the third project, the PI will investigate the study Legendrian spatial graphs and spatial graph concordance via the recent Graph Floer homology invariant of spatial graph defined by the PI and coauthor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knot theory is the study of knotted circles or strings in 3-dimensional space.  Knots have been studied for over a century, ever since Lord Kelvin (incorrectly) hypothesized that atoms were made of knotted tubes of ether.  However, we are still far from a complete classification of them or how they are related to one another.   This project will give a better understanding of knots and how they interact in 3- and 4-dimensions.   Since the world we live in is 3-dimensional (or 4-dimensional if one considers time), knots and links play a special role in many real life applications.  For example, the Jones polynomial of a knot is related to the Pott's model in statistical mechanics.  In addition, knot theory plays an role in the study of DNA and cancer research.  One can view circular DNA as a knot and certain enzymes, called topoisomerases, manipulate DNA; this manipulation can be viewed as certain simple moves on knots.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Topology is the study of the shapes of spaces, the so called rubber sheet geometry.  In low-dimensional topology, one studies 2-dimensions (surfaces), 3-dimensionals (the dimension we live in) and 4-dimensions (space and time).  An extremely important part of understand the spaces is to understand how subspaces can be knotted inside of them (knots and links).  A knot is a closed look in space.  The study of knots has importnat applications in chemistry and cancer research.   This project aimed to understand how knots in 3-dimensional space can change as they move into 4-dimensions.  This is done by trying to understand an algebraic object defined in the 50s, called the knot concordance group, C.    The knot concordance group is an extremely rich and complicated object that has been studied extensively since the 60s yet we know very little about its sturcture.  The PI and collaborators in previous work conjectured that the knot concorndance group had a fractal structure (that is, certain types of self-simillaries).  However, this question doesn't really make sense unless one can measure how small objects can get.  In this project the PI and collaborators studied different metrics on the knot concordance space and certain natural geometric operators on C, called satellite operators.  The first was a discrete metric.  Here, the PI studied the coarse or large scale geometry of the space.  The interesting part here was that the satellite operators had a nice algebraic property, that is they act like homomophisms (preserve the algebraic stucture) if you look from very far away.  Using this metric, the PI and collaborators showed that there were self-similarites but they were not getting smaller.    To find a true fractal stucture, they PI realized that one needed to have a real valued metric.  The PI and collaborators defined a two new real valued metrics using something called gropes and positive/negative towers.  These are both defined so that they are closely related to two important algebraic filtrations of C, called the n-solvable and n-bipolar filtrations.  The PI and collaborators showed that the grope metrics were not discrete.  Using some previous work, this gave evidence that the knot concordance group has a fractal structure.  The PI is continuing to study the tower filtration and has hope that this will give information about an importance subset of C, called topologically slice knots.    A spatial graph is a generalization of a knot where the knot can intersect itself.  The PI and collaborator defined for spatial graphs, a generalization of knot Floer homology called graph Floer homology.  This was used by the PIs graduate student to define a tau invariants of spatial graphs.  This should become an important tool when studying C as one can find a natural spatial graph associated to a knot by looking at a spine of something called a Seifert surface for the knot.
