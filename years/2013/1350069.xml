<AbstractNarration>Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs are one of the best recruiting tools for Geoscience-related graduate programs, and successful management of these programs is a high priority. This award supports a workshop that will bring most of the Directorate of Geoscience (GEO) REU PI's together to discuss best practices in a changing REU landscape and to discuss common community issues, such as combining resources, creating common evaluation or application tools, and assessing the combined impact of REU-type programs in the Geosciences. Participants will include the leaders of REU Site programs supported by the Divisions of Ocean Sciences, Earth Sciences, Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences and Polar Programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2nd workshop for leaders of research experiences for undergraduates (REUs) in the geosciences brought together science educators to UCAR in Boulder, CO, in March of 2014.  More than 90 people representing over 75 institutions in the fields of Earth, ocean, polar, and atmospheric and geospace sciences gathered to share strategies and tools for running effective internship programs.   The theme of the workshop was centered on creating more inclusive REUs to engage and welcome students from diverse ethnic, cultural, and socio-economic backgrounds. A guest speaker challenged participants to examine their own recruiting materials to discern whether they would appeal to students  with disabilities or from other underserved groups.  Several discussions focused on how to adapt these internships to community college students in terms of modifying science mentor expectations on the research, and providing additional support.    Feedback on the workshop provided in a post-workshop survey showed that the REU leaders got a great deal out of the experience in terms of practical advice, insight, and support.  One participant wrote:    "The workshop was the best organized event, with the best camaraderie, that I have experienced in 35 years of science and education. I think the value of networking with colleagues facing similar issues, learning from the success of other programs, and gathering information from special topic sessions was enormous."  The workshop has helped to develop a sense of community between REU leaders that is continued online via an email list and conference sessions and workshops at large annual meetings.  Materials contributed by participants in real time during the workshop to a central repository will be compiled and synthesized into an online manual for REU leaders.
