<AbstractNarration>The first planets around other stars were discovered only within the last few decades, and since then scientists have been surprised by how common such exoplanets are, and by the surprising nature of some of their characteristics.  The search for more exoplanets and the drive to gather better statistics to fully understand them (and so the planetary system in which we live) is a vigorous area of modern research.  A particularly urgent scientific direction is establishing that an exoplanet is earthlike, which requires measurement of both the radius and the mass of the planet.  Radius can be measured by satellite observations when the planet passes in front of the star; mass is measured by extremely precise monitoring of the radial velocity of the central star, since its motions are influenced by the gravitational tug of the planet in proportion to its mass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop frequency calibrators based on robust, field-compatible new laser technologies that should push radial velocity precision down to below 10 cm/s (for comparison, the recoil velocity of the Sun caused by the earth is about 9 cm/s).  These systems are moving toward long-term, continuous operation by standard observatory personnel, without specialized laser experts on-site or any need to make frequent adjustments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The laser-comb development project will train several graduate and undergraduate students in the physics of ultrafast optics and astronomical instrument building and observation. Many of the techniques developed here will find fruitful application in other scientific disciplines, such as molecular spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this project is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project we developed and tested new laser-based technologies to aid searches for small, rocky planets around other stars ("exoplanets").  In previous work, we developed an instrument known as an "astro-comb", which produces an array of spectral peaks that can be referenced to atomic clocks and used to correct for drift in the wavelengths measured by astronomical telescopes and spectrographs.  This wavelength drift can obscure the small signature of exoplanets, preventing their discovery.  However, our existing astro-comb employs delicate laser technology that cannot be kept operating continuously, limiting the usefulness of this device.  In the present program, we explored more robust fiber-laser technology to enable a higher-duty-cycle astro-comb.  We had two key achievements in this technology development effort.  First, we realized a fiber-laser with several of the key properties needed for a robust astro-comb: fast pulsing, which will allow appropriate spacing between the comb spectral peaks; "mode-locked" operation, which is key to referencing to atomic clocks; and sufficient output power to allow operation in the visible part of the spectrum.  Second, we realized a fiber-laser frequency comb with sufficient power and low enough noise to allow "self-referencing", i.e., stable spectral peak wavelengths.  In future work we hope to integrate these fiber-laser technologies as part of an upgraded astro-comb wavelength calibrator used with the HARPS-N spectrograph, which is located at the TNG telescope in the Canary Islands.   As a broader impact of this research, we showed that fiber-laser technology can be adapted to provide laser frequency combs with large wavelength separation between the output spectral peaks.  Students and postdoctoral researchers were active participants in all phases of this research: design, construction, and execution of experiments; detailed calculations; analysis of data; presentation of results at scientific meetings; and writing scientific papers.  In addition, the investigators on this NSF-supported project described the scientific process and results in a wide variety of presentations ranging from scientific conferences and seminars to public lectures.
