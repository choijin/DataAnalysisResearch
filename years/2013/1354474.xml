<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project funded and co-funded a strategic planning workshop and four conferences in the mathematics of cybersecurity:  Mathematics of Data Analysis in Cybersecurity held October 22-24, 2014, organized by Edo Airoldi (Harvard University), Paul Barford, (University of Wisconsin), Henry Cohn (Microsoft), John Harer, (Duke University), John Johnson (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory), Mauro Maggioni (Duke University), and Jill Pipher (ICERM);  Mathematics of Lattices and Cybersecurity held April 21-24, 2015, organized by Jeffrey Hoffstein (Brown University), Stephen Miller (Rutgers University), and Ramarathnam Venkatesan(Microsoft Research);  Algorithmic Coding Theory held June 13 - 17, 2016, organized by Mary Wootters (Carnegie Mellon University), Atri Rudra (University at Buffalo, SUNY), and Hamed Hassani (ETH Zurich);  and The SaTC Workshop on Privacy and Security held June 15-17, 2016, organized by Somesh Jha (University of Wisconsin) and Nigel Boston (University of Wisconsin).    Three of the conferences were held at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Reseach in Mathematics, a National Science Foundation mathematics institute at Brown University, with a fourth held at the University of Wisconsin.    The conferences brought together mathematical scientists, computer scientists, engineers and social scientists to explore traditionally successful as well as innovative approaches to the mathematics of cybersecurity. Early career researchers were especially encouraged to attend. Outcomes from these conferences included new collaborations and new proposals to the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace within the Computer and Network Systems division of NSF.  To contribute to the the intellectual merit, the lectures have been video recorded and archieved on the ICERM website.  Additionally, the slides for the lectures have been archieved on the website.  The broader impacts of the workshop include expanding the number of mathematically trained scientists devoting time and expertise to problems arising in cybersecurity and identifying the mathematical problems whose solution would have an impact on mitigating or resolving cybersecurity threats, both of which could have a positive impact on national security.
