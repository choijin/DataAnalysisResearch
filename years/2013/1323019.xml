<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project, designed to determine the outcomes of a long standing faculty development effort, includes four institutions, Yale University, the University of Colorado, Boulder, Cornell University, and the University of Connecticut. Over the last decade, the National Academies Summer Institutes (SIs) have trained almost 1,000 faculty and instructional staff in 'scientific teaching,' an approach to STEM instruction based on evidence about how people learn (1, 2). The SIs are designed to teach effective use of active learning and assessment with attention to fostering learning by diverse students. They feature an iterative approach to examining the learning associated with newly introduced teaching practices. At present few studies systematically examine the outcomes of faculty development efforts. This project is a Phase III assessment of the impact of the SI training on participants' teaching practices and their students' outcomes. It entails developing a general system for asking questions about the outcomes of faculty development efforts and using the SIs as a base for testing that system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project is an important large-scale assessment of scientific teaching practices and their impact on student outcomes. The project is unique because it employs a novel systems evaluation approach to design and applies measures for the adoption of teaching practices and student achievement. This work will create knowledge about educational practices, instructor behavior change, and student outcomes, while developing universal evaluation tools that will be widely disseminated to enable others to evaluate their education initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The results from the study of the institutes will help inform future faculty development efforts.  In addition, the resulting evaluation system will provide tools for designing and conducting evaluations of complex projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. J. Handelsman, S. Miller, C.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In recent decades, several national reports have highlighted the need for improved education in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in order for the country to solve emerging challenges and remain competitive in the global economy.  In response to this call, the Summer Institutes on Scientific Teaching (SI) was founded in 2004 to provide training to STEM faculty to help them improve their undergraduate STEM courses.  This week-long workshop promoted a specific pedagogical approach called Scientific Teaching, which aims to make the teaching of science more closely resemble how science is practiced by infusing courses with the nature and rigor of the scientific process and by incorporating teaching strategies supported by empirical evidence.  Since its inception, the SI has trained more than 2,000 faculty in Scientific Teaching.  The current project represents a collaborative effort to better understand the impact of this training on faculty teaching practices and student outcomes.  This outcomes report will focus on the project activities led by researchers at the University of Colorado-Boulder and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.      These researchers focused specifically on the development of tools to measure the degree to which faculty incorporate Scientific Teaching in their courses.  Specifically, they developed the Measurement Instrument for Scientific Teaching, an instrument that can be used by students, instructors, or observers to report the frequency of certain teaching practices in a course.  This multi-perspective format is innovative because it enabled them to determine the degree to which these different groups agree in their perceptions.  By collecting data across many courses and institutions, they found that these perspectives show high agreement in their reporting of active learning practices but show more divergence in their reporting of less concrete practices.  This research helps advance the undergraduate STEM education field because it provides researchers with empirical evidence on the extent to which different perspectives vary in their reporting of teaching practices.      Building on these findings, the project team also analyzed data from the SI Alumni Census, a retrospective survey where participants reflected on their teaching practices before and after attending the SI.  They found that SI participants reported adopting some practices more commonly than others, and the practices were implemented in the classroom to varying degrees.  The most commonly adopted practices were engaging students in their own learning, using learning goals in course designs, and using Bloom’s taxonomy in assessment questions. Furthermore, instructors reported implementation increases both in the first semester after SI attendance as well as after a longer time frame, suggesting that implementation levels persisted and continued to increase over time.
