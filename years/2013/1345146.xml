<AbstractNarration>This project is a teacher professional development program advancing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education by improving teacher content knowledge and instructional practices through Teacher Research Experiences (TRE) in the Arctic and Antarctic. Teachers spend three to six weeks participating in hands-on research in the polar regions and sharing their experiences with diverse audiences via PolarConnect real-time webinars, online multimedia journals, and interactive forums in the PolarTREC Virtual Base Camp.  Teachers report significant improvements in their knowledge of the polar regions and ability to teach science concepts. Researchers report that PolarTREC outreach is an essential bridge between their science and the public. This project leverages cutting-edge science and global changes taking place in the polar regions, and is broadly disseminating activities and products to students, educators, researchers, and the public; sustaining the widespread interest in the polar regions that was generated during the International Polar Year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of PolarTREC lies in its integration of research and education through a uniquely comprehensive approach to TREs. PolarTREC contributes to STEM education and pedagogy through an innovative TRE model conceived and organized according to best practices such as pre-research training, mentoring, support for classroom transfer, and long-term access to resources and professional networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;Although a limited number of teachers participate in a field experience, those selected represent ethnic, economic, and geographic diversity and are well connected within their schools, communities, and professions. Participants are exemplary teacher-leaders in their schools, districts, states, and in professional organizations. PolarTREC is providing a professional development experience for at least 14 teachers including 2 community college professionals. 20 PolarConnect live events facilitating dialogue between nearly 8,000 international participants and polar researchers are planned, and 28 new polar related lesson plans are being disseminated. Discussions on current education and science issues are being broadcast and archived with participants reached via media and online interactions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PolarTREC (Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating), a program started in 2004 that continues to be a model for the National Science Foundation (NSF) Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education programming. In 2010, the NSF designated PolarTREC as "potentially transformative" research, which is defined by the NSF as research that "involves ideas, discoveries, or tools that radically change our understanding of an important existing scientific or engineering concept or educational practice or leads to the creation of a new paradigm of field science, engineering, or education".  PolarTREC is administered by a non-profit, Arctic Research Consortium of the United States (http://www.arcus.org).  Through hands-on field research experiences in the Arctic and Antarctica, K-12 educators from around the United States participant in 3-6 week field experiences with researchers in the polar regions (Arctic and Antarctica).  With pre and post field support, participating teachers  improve teaching strategies, connect with the public and their classrooms, and develop resources for their careers.  From 2014-2015, ARCUS supported 18 expeditions to the polar regions, 11 in the Arctic and seven in Antarctica. Of the 18 teachers, one was an Einstein Fellow at PLR,  two were informal educators, one was a community college teacher, eight  were middle school teachers, and six were high school teachers. Teachers  were deployed to the field starting in the late spring of 2014 and  continued through mid-May 2015.
