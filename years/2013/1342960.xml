<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 13-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum and the G8 countries Heads of Research Councils. The Belmont Forum is a high level group of the world's major and emerging funders of global environmental change research and international science councils.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. The G8 Heads of Research Councils developed a funding framework to support multilateral research projects that address global challenges in ways that are beyond the capacity of national or bilateral activities. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders.  This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working together in an inaugural call of the International Opportunities Fund, the Belmont Forum and G8HORCs have provided support for research projects that seek to deliver knowledge needed for action to mitigate and adapt to detrimental environmental change and extreme hazardous events that relate to either Freshwater Security or Coastal Vulnerability.  This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports research activities that will develop a versatile modeling framework that can be applied to evaluate the unique functioning, critical stressors, and vulnerability of the world?s deltas. Deltas are economically and environmentally important systems, sustaining a large portion of the world?s populations, economic activity, and ecosystems. These systems are deteriorating rapidly due to climate changes, catchment changes, and local exploitation and ecosystem degradation. This project will develop an evidence-based framework for global delta sustainability by (1) advancing delta sustainability science as critical coupled human-natural systems; (2) co-design, -develop, and -deliver an evidence-based sustainability framework for risk assessment and decision support; (3) build an international repository of integrated delta datasets; and (4) develop and implement a modeling and decision support framework in partnership with local stakeholders. Applicable from local to national levels, this framework will be applied to three case-studies in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna, Mekong, and Amazon deltas. This project will contribute toward effective regional delta management and governance by providing a mechanism to integrate social, economic, bio-physical, and ecosystem services components to assess delta vulnerability and guide sustainable management strategies and decisions across scales, in collaboration with experts and stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>

The project would be the largest water diversion in human history, and construction is underway &ndash; the first canal opened in September 2015, linking the Godavari and Krishna rivers. If the Interlink project is completed, fourteen canals will divert water from tributaries of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers to drier areas in the south and west of India. Our analysis compiled the first complete database of proposed dams, reservoirs and canals, including operating schedules for Himalayan infrastructure. We evaluated potential changes to mean annual water discharge for 29 rivers and mean monthly water and sediment discharge for six rivers flowing to five major deltas. Sediment rating curves are used to quantify the impacts of changing water discharge within the rivers, and basin-wide trapping efficiency is established for new reservoirs.&nbsp; Given full implementation of the Indian River Interlinking project, we forecast reductions in annual suspended sediment transport to deltas of 40-85% (Mahanadi), 71-99% (Godavari) and 7-43% (Krishna) due to profound reservoir trapping and peak streamflow reductions. The Ganga before its confluence with the Brahmaputra is projected to experience a 39-75% reduction in annual suspended load. The Brahmaputra before its confluence with the Ganga is projected to experience a 9-25% reduction in suspended load, despite losing only 6% of its annual water flow. We calculate a projected corresponding aggradation decrease for the Ganga-Brahmaputra delta from 3.6 to 2.5 mm y<sup>-1</sup>, which is a large enough change to drive relative sea-level rise at the delta front. At the remaining four deltas, the NRLP will exacerbate current sediment starvation. We reconstruct the annual water transfer volume proposed for the NRLP to be 245 km<sup>3</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>, higher than previous estimates due to the inclusion of along-canal usage. If completed, the NRLP will transform watershed boundaries, with more than half of the land in India contributing a portion of its runoff to a new mouth.

Delta?s fertile soils, abundant fisheries, and strategic location have promoted human habitation from the earliest days of civilization.

For example, local groundwater extraction in cities and for fish farming along the coast causes subsidence [and upstream construction of dams and reservoirs decreases sediment fluxes to the coast and reduces aggradation of the deltaic platform.  Despite the recognition of the dire situation delta systems around the world, we are lacking integrated data and modeling capability to better understanding and make predictions in face of change in interwoven anthropogenic and natural processes.  In the context of the "Belmont-Forum DELTAS: Catalyzing action towards sustainability in delta systems with an integrated framework for modeling risk assessment" project, our team at the University of Colorado worked towards improved modeling capability of delta systems and their upstream connections.   Capability for modeling delta systems has been advanced by making newly available a reduced complexity model of delta systems, PyDeltaRCM, through the easy-to-use web modeling tool (this tool, WMT, is part of the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System modeling framework).

We developed a comprehensive tool chain that combines simple anthropogenic drivers, climatological data, and basin characteristics to predict water and sediment fluxes to delta systems.   We used the new modeling tool chain to make progress towards quantifying the impacts of the ?Indian Rivers Interlinking project? on sediment transport to threatened river deltas in India: the Krishna, Mahanadi, Godavari, and Kaveri deltas, and Bangladesh; the Ganga-Brahmaputra delta.
