<AbstractNarration>Significant resources have been expended to provide services to intimate partner violence (IPV) victims and to increase perpetrator accountability through criminal justice interventions, but less attention has been given to preventing IPV.  The 2-day Workshop to Develop Effective Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Interventions to Prevent Intimate Partner Violence will bring together researchers, practitioners, advocates, and students from various fields (social sciences, law, public health, medicine, victim services and advocacy) to critically examine IPV prevention at three levels: programs to stop IPV from occurring (primary prevention), methods to reduce the consequences of IPV when it occurs (secondary prevention), and programs to respond to victims and perpetrators to prevent IPV reoccurrence (tertiary prevention). Participants will: 1) identify knowledge gaps at all three levels of prevention; 2) examine findings from current evaluations of promising programs, especially those designed for underserved groups; 3) develop recommendations for future research; 4) foster interdisciplinary collaboration to develop new research projects; and 5) promote mentoring relationships among researchers, graduate students, practitioners, and advocates.  To achieve these goals, participants will either: a) prepare a paper evaluating current knowledge and practices for a type of IPV prevention; b) discuss knowledge or practices gaps in IVP prevention; c) prepare a paper on evaluation outcomes for a type of prevention; or d) facilitate discussion of the next generation of prevention research. Workshop activities will produce knowledge useful to researchers, practitioners, advocates and students throughout the United States and internationally to develop innovative prevention programs, especially for underserved communities. The materials produced (i.e., reports, an edited book, a website) will also be useful to policy makers and other stakeholders as they work to address the problem of IPV.</AbstractNarration>
