<AbstractNarration>The evolutionary success of a species is greatly influenced by its interactions with other species sharing its environment. One of the best examples of evolutionary patterns strongly influenced by interspecific interactions is the relationship between hosts and their parasites.  Studies examining host-parasite interactions have found that similar evolutionary histories are most often shared between highly host-specific parasites and their hosts, while generalist parasites evolve almost independently from their hosts. This raises an important question: What factors drive patterns of coevolution between hosts and their parasites?  Using the deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, and its ectoparasites on the California Channel Islands as a model system, this study will investigate how differences between parasites affect their evolution on and with their hosts. The study will also examine how the availability of alternative hosts on different islands affects the relationship between deer mice and their parasites. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides a novel system in which to study host-parasite interactions. Comparing the coevolution of parasites and their hosts on the Channel Islands will help tease apart the basic factors influencing evolution in host-parasite systems, which will be important for the study of both wildlife conservation and the ecology of diseases.  Additionally, this work will provide valuable population genetic information for Channel Islands deer mice, a species of special concern in California, and it will provide field research training opportunities for a local undergraduate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ SUMMARY AND INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  The evolutionary trajectory of a species is greatly influenced by its interactions with other species sharing its environment. One of the best examples of evolutionary patterns strongly influenced by interspecific interactions is produced by the relationship between hosts and their parasites. A large body of work has found that specialist parasites &ndash; those associated with a single host species &ndash;exhibit strong patterns of genetic co-structure with their hosts while generalist parasites &ndash; species able to utilize multiple host species &ndash;exhibit negligible genetic co-structure.  Islands are often isolated and support few hosts, suggesting that typical generalist and specialist genetic patterns may not hold. However, parasite genetic diversity on islands is largely unexplored. To better understand the factors influencing host-parasite co-structure, we focused on deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) across the California Channel Islands.  Specifically, we (i) tested for host-parasite co-structure between deer mice and fleas, mobile, generalist parasites that show little to no co-structure on the mainland and (ii) we examined the impact of multiple potential hosts on the congruence between the histories of deer mice and their fleas.  We found that by restricting the geographic range of a mobile host and parasite mobile, generalist parasites of rodents on islands exhibit shared patterns of genetic divergence with their hosts--patterns that, on the mainland, are only found with less mobile, host-specific parasites.  Interestingly, these patterns become weaker on islands with multiple potential host species, independent of the population sizes of the hosts, suggesting that the genetic diversity of parasites increases with the availability of additional host species.    BROADER IMPACTS:  This project has resulted in five sets of broader impacts.  First, the co-PI mentored a female undergraduate student, work that will culminate in an undergraduate honors thesis this coming spring.  Second it supported outreach to the general public.  Specifically, the co-PI presented findings from this work at a public lecture at the Museum of Life Sciences in Raleigh, NC, and the co-PI was interviewed about this work on several widely-distributed programs including the BBC World Service.  Third, the co-PI developed this research into multiple teaching modules that were implemented in biology courses at NC State University and UNC Pembroke, a minority-serving institution in rural North Carolina.  Fourth, the co-PI has discussed the results of this project with scientific audiences at several conferences and a number of external seminar series.  Finally, this work provided much needed genetic data on two subspecies of special concern in California, Peromyscus maniculatus anacapae, andPeromyscus maniculatus clementis.
