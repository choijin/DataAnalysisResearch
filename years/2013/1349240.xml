<AbstractNarration>There is a critical need for ecologists and land managers to understand the potential magnitude, persistence, and ecosystem services of beaver landscape transformation. This OPUS proposal will integrate the results of four previous NSF awards relating to beaver ecosystem alteration, bringing the findings together into works that will analyze the dynamics of a beaver-altered landscape at Voyageurs National Park. The 86-year record of beaver landscape occupation and alteration documented from aerial photography and field work provides a unique perspective of the ecosystem effects and sustainability of beaver activity. The objective is to synthesize the vegetative, water, soil, and biogeochemical alterations associated with beaver impoundments. The aims are to produce a book based on the 37 articles that the researchers have published from prior NSF-funded research, and a monograph about beaver pond/meadow transitions in the landscape that combines datasets documenting beaver pond creation and changes with recent updates about beaver ponds and populations commissioned by the National Park Service. This project will also transfer the previously collected datasets from their current in-house data management system to a public open-format repository.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will inform other scientists and managers about the sustainability and long-term ecosystem effects of beaver activity that is still expanding in much of North America. Undergraduate researchers will be recruited from the newly-formed South Dakota State University chapter of SEEDS - Strategies for Ecology Education, Diversity and Sustainability.  This project will contribute to the training of a graduate student who is researching beaver pond sustainability under separate funding. The project will strengthen pedagogy as the researchers will use elements from this OPUS synthesis in an Ecosystem Ecology class. The National Park Service will publicize and help disseminate the resulting publications, and will also ensure that scientific findings are incorporated into interpretive programs, web and print media, wayside exhibits, and visitor centers to reach a wide and diverse audience. Finally, the project will benefit society by contributing to land management, both directly at Voyageurs National Park and indirectly at locations throughout the continent where beaver populations are expanding.</AbstractNarration>

This OPUS project has synthesized research about the ways in which beaver dam building and herbivory has created new habitats and profoundly altered ecosystem properties of boreal forests. The geographic focus is the Kabetogama Peninsula on the Minnesota (USA) and Ontario (Canada) border, but the research is applicable to the mixed coniferous and deciduous forests that dominate the global boreal zone (taiga) from about 50&deg;N to 70&deg;N. Beaver populations were decimated by over-trapping during the 18th and 19th centuries, but began to recover during the 20th century. Historical aerial photos taken since 1927 document the increase in number of beaver ponds and "beaver meadows," grassy areas that develop and persist after ponds have drained. Relating data about those beaver-created landscape features to corresponding information about the number of active beaver colonies provides a tool for estimating beaver populations from the evidence of their works.   Beavers are a keystone species upon which many other animals rely for habitat.

This project has resulted in a forthcoming book entitled "Beavers: Boreal Ecosystem Engineers." The project also produced journal articles about beaver colony abundance, beaver dam persistence, and beaver pond water storage.
