<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Annaliese Franz in the Department of Chemistry at the University of California-Davis is developing new sustainable silicon-based catalysts for the synthesis of organic materials and polymers.  The development of silicon-based catalysts is important because metal-free catalysts tend to be non-toxic, stable, and minimize the use of reagents and organic solvents. Outreach activities developed by Professor Franz are allowing girls in elementary and middle school the opportunity to participate in hands-on activities and learn about catalysts, energy, and polymers. The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits from the discovery of new catalysts from less toxic, earth abundant materials and biodegradable polymers from natural feedstocks as well as student training and outreach activities to promote science for girls and young women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the synthesis of new silicon-based catalysts with silanol activating groups and the application of these catalysts to organic transformations, including polymerization reactions for biodegradable materials.  The structure, binding interactions and mechanism of various catalysts are being studied using computational methods, X-ray crystallography, and mass spectrometry.  This information will be used to enhance mechanistic studies for organic silanol activation, as well as other classes of metal-free catalysts. The research is improving the fundamental understanding of hydrogen-bonding and anion-binding and enhancing the application of these catalysts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of this project have led to the development of new sustainable silicon-based catalysts for the synthesis of organic materials, medicines and polymers. Silicon is the second most abundant element on earth and various forms of silicon oxides are ubiquitous, making the design of homogeneous silicon-based catalysts an attractive and sustainable direction for chiral catalysis.  Our synthetic and mechanistic studies have helped to identify and overcome many challenges in the first stages of development for silanol catalysts. We have made advances toward a long-term goal for sustainable "geo-based" small molecule catalysis, which is essential to understand and exploit the unique properties of homogeneous organic silanols.  In the course of our studies, the challenges and deviation from our initial hypotheses have also led us to new discoveries for catalytic activity and catalyst design.     We have designed and synthesized new silicon-based catalysts called disiloxanediols with two silanol activating groups, and also developed a metal-free environmentally-benign synthesis for these catalysts.  Our research demonstrates that these new silanol catalysts can catalyze organic transformations to create new chemical bonds and build more complex heterocycle molecules with applications for medicines and materials.  The data collected in this study includes structure, binding interactions and mechanism of the new silanol catalysts using various spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry, and computational methods.  This data is expected to enhance mechanistic studies for organic silanol activation, as well as other classes of metal-free catalysts, which will improve the fundamental understanding of hydrogen-bonding and anion-binding to enhance the application of these catalysts.     The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits from the discovery of new catalysts from less toxic, earth abundant materials and biodegradable polymers from natural sources as well as student training and outreach activities to promote science for girls and young women. The development and fundamental understanding of catalysis reduces waste products resulting from chemical processes. This project has also made contributions to training the next generation of scientists and broadening participation in STEM, with specific impact to develop workshops and presentations for young girls (elementary and junior high school) and blind-visually-Impaired (BVI) students. Outreach events feature graduate student mentors, and involve hands-on activities and demonstrations related to polymers, catalysts, chemical reactions, and energy.
