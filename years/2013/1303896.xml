<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The PI will collect samples to extend the magneto-stratigraphic record of late Cretaceous sediments of the James Ross Basin, Antarctica. RAPID support will allow him to take advantage of an invitation from the Instituto Antartico Argentino (IAA) to participate on an excursion to James Ross Island in the Antarctic Peninsula. The PI hopes to collect samples that will refine the position of several geomagnetic reversals between the end of the Cretaceous long normal Chron and the lower portion of Chron 31R. The Brandy Bay locality targeted by this expedition is the best place in the basin for calibrating the biostratigraphic position of the top of the Cretaceous Long Normal Chron, which is one of the most reliable correlation horizons in the entire Geological Time Scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The top of the Cretaceous long normal Chron is not properly correlated to southern hemisphere biostratigraphy. Locating this event will be a major addition to understanding geological time. This expedition will provide opportunities for an undergraduate student. This project is based on a productive collaboration with an Argentine scientist.</AbstractNarration>
