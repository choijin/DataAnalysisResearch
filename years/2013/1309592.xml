<AbstractNarration>This action funds Abby Schadock-Hewitt of Clemson University to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand.  The project title is "Modeling of a Unique Shaped-Fiber Stationary Phase for the Large-Scale Purification of Antibodies."  The host scientists are Dr. Simone Dimartino and Dr. Conan Fee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project involves characterization and modeling of a novel recombinant protein A- modified affinity chromatography stationary phase for the capture and recovery of immunoglobulin G (IgG).  IgG is necessary for antibody-based therapeutics, a rapidly growing field that requires high quantities of highly pure antibody to be separated from complex fermentation broths in an efficient, fast, cost effective way.  This work focuses on capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers modified with protein A (the affinity capture ligand for IgG), which show excellent potential, at the analytical scale, in overcoming the drawbacks of costly commercially available resins.  Modeling of protein A-modified C-CP fibers is essential to determine if their advantageous properties hold at a preparative, industry suitable, scale. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, this project encourages incorporation of engineering ideas and perspectives toward the analytical scale implementation of C-CP fiber columns.  The Fellow will be able to bring this engineering perspective to other chemist colleagues by giving a presentation of the knowledge gained.  Successful completion of the proposed work will open up many opportunities for future modification and modeling studies; taking the discovery steps into the practical realm.  This will promote development of other novel C-CP fiber modifications and allow for the continued collaboration with the host researchers, possibly opening up new collaborations, and resulting in conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications.  The fibers current educational applications applied at Clemson will grow from the information gained, allowing for added applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project set out to increase the scale of an already developed proof-of-concept experiment where protein A, a biomolecule with the ability to specifically capture an antibody, was adsorbed to the surface of a novel, unique, advantageous polypropylene fiber.  To capture antibody with these protein A-fibers in an efficient way would be of great advantage to the antibody separations field, where high quantities of highly pure antibodies are necessary for drugs and therapeutics.  The proposed project spanned only 10 weeks, requiring significant planning and relying on progress in order to continue.                With a known procedure, the fibers, packed into a column, were modified and the amount of protein A immobilized on the surface was quantified by comparing protein injections on a blank column and fiber column (Image 1).  The blank shows a larger curve because no adsorption is occurring and thus more protein is being detected.  After optimization of flow rate (1 mL/min), concentration (0.2 mg/mL), amount of protein loaded (1 mL, 20 &micro;g), an average maximum of ~24 &micro;g could be adsorbed.  This was around 70% less then expected from previous results.                  Concerned about this, we investigated the protein A solution.  Image 2 shows a protein gel in which the components of a solution can be separated based on their size and charge.  The known sample weights are identified in kDa, and show that our sample (high concentration in column 1-2, low concentration in 3-7) is forming a dimer (two protein molecules stuck together) and instead of showing only ~60kDa, it is also showing around ~120kDa.  A dimer means that the concentration we think we have is inaccurate and our calculations are full of error.  Another test performed to determine size distribution in our sample was dynamic light scattering.  This also showed a large molecule size of 150 &plusmn; 56 kDa.  The explanation of our low adsorption is likely batch-to-batch variation of protein A causing dimers to form.  Having unstable, dimerized protein causes irreproducibility and lower then expected surface immobilization.              Trying to reproduce the experiments performed previously with the antibody also proved difficult and could be explained by the antibody used, as the source was different from that used previously.  Ultimately, the solution used to remove (elute) bound antibody that was successful in previous experiments was not able to elute an appreciable amount of antibody (Image 3).  An excess of antibody was loaded and 291 &micro;g adsorbed.  Elution, beginning at 7 mL and lasting for 2 mL was only able to elute 31 &micro;g antibody.              The goal of this project was to characterize the fibers in terms of how well they captured and eluted antibody and provide a mathematical model towards larger scale separations.  However, as this characterization failed, the goals were not met.  The intellectual merit, however, was met in furthering the development and understanding of a unique fiber that shows high advantage in the separations field.  In incorporating new collaborators into the research involved, new ideas were developed and greater discussion occurred.  The broader impacts of involving chemical engineering ideas into an analytical chemistry-based project were observed.  Several undergraduate students were exposed to the fibers and used them in their research.  I was able to teach them the fiber properties and aid them in their use.  This project helped to further collaboration and continue the challenge of new ideas for their use and focus.  While the project was not successfully completed, the benefits reaped from the experience will, no doubt, impact the future work with the fibers.
