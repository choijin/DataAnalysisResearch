<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;With greater public access, scientific articles are expected to reach a broader audience, generating a broader scope of creativity and inspiration and likely leading to more and faster follow-on research. This project empirically investigates the effects of greater public accessibility to scientific publications resulting from federally funded research on knowledge flow and diffusion in both academic and industrial research. The project focuses on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Public Access Policy, effective in April 2008, that requires NIH awardees to make peer-reviewed publications resulting from NIH-funded research publically available free of charge in PubMed Central (PMC) within twelve months after the original publication. Employing expertise in economics, computer sciences and the biosciences, this research analyzes changes in  (1) paper citation networks to uncover the impacts of the NIH policy on knowledge diffusion in academic research, and (2) heterogeneous paper and patent citation networks to understand the effects of the policy on industrial research. The project proposes and verifies various measures of degree, breadth and speed of knowledge flow on citation networks, and develops novel citation network growth models that are useful for policy scenario analyses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) recently issued a memorandum to Federal agencies with more than $100 million in research and development expenditure, directing them to develop plans to increase public accessibility to results and data of federally-funded research. Some other governments have implemented or considered similar policies. This research sheds urgently-needed empirical lights on whether such policies are likely to achieve the overarching goals including accelerating the progress of science, spurring innovation and stimulating economic growth.  It provides empirical results and insights for "evidence-based" policy making on this important science and innovation policy. The analytical frameworks, methodologies and algorithms developed in this project are valuable for evaluation of similar or related policy initiatives in the future.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Public accessibility of scholarly publications is an important science policy. In the U.S. federal funding agencies have developed plans to increase public access to scientific publications resulting from research they fund, in compliance with the Office of Science and Technology Policy?s Feb. 22, 2013, memorandum, "Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Research.". European research funders released the Plan S on September 4, 2018, foreseeing that they will mandate that from 2020 the scientists they fund publish resulting papers in Open Access journals or on Open Access platform, to be free to read immediately on publication.      This multi-disciplinary project, involving economics and computer sciences, seeks to empirically investigate the impacts of increased public accessibility of scholarly publications. The research focuses on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Public Access Policy, effective in April 2008, that requires NIH awardees to make peer-reviewed publications resulting from NIH-funded research publicly available free of charge in PubMed Central (PMC) within twelve months after the original publication.      We construct a comprehensive analytical dataset by linking together five distinct datasets: Medline paper bibliographic data, PMC paper data, PMC journal participation data, Web of Science (WOS) paper citation data, and WOS journal data. We exploit significant variations in PMC participation levels by journals to carefully design empirical strategies, and construct a variety of measurements for the extent, speed and breadth of knowledge diffusion from a published paper.      We find that in general papers resulted from NIH funded research in general have higher, faster and broader knowledge diffusion than papers from non-NIH funded research. This holds true for papers in the same journal and same issue, and before the NIH public access policy, which could have led to spurious results on the impacts of the policy. Controlling for this "inherent" difference, we find that overall the NIH public access policy has no significant impact on knowledge diffusion of papers from NIH-funded research. Although we are investigating whether the policy has heterogeneous impacts across countries and regions where scientists? access to subscribed scientific journals vary, these findings shed interesting empirical light on the discourse on the public access policy.      Our research also involves citation network analyses incorporating speed of knowledge flow, modeling citation dynamics of "atypical" articles, representation learning via deep learning of heterogeneous citation networks, and matching paper and patent pairs with the same underlying inventions. These work provides novel and useful perspectives, methodologies and algorithms for analyzing knowledge diffusion in science and innovation, and makes useful contributions in the general field of data science, data mining and big data.      The project has supported three Ph.D. students at Penn State, one being female. Some research questions and findings have been incorporated into two undergraduate courses at Penn State, one on economics and policy of technological innovation and the other on network analyses.
