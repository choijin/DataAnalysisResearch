<AbstractNarration>Refugees are designated by the U.S. Federal government as immigrants who have been allowed to enter the U.S. to escape dangerous conditions in their countries of origin.  Recent years have witnessed the movement of refugees to locales different from "gateway" cities such as New York, Chicago, and San Francisco where they traditionally settled.  This project will investigate the resettlement experience of refugees in small cities in the US, beginning in New England and eventually expanding the study to other sites in the South, Midwest, and Northwest. This project will build on the work of other social scientists who have studied the effects of such settlement patterns -- what the economic impacts might be, how refugees are adjusting to new lives, how their children are doing in school, and how their new homes are adjusting to unfamiliar faces.  Many of these new destinations do not have long histories of integrating newcomers into their midst, making it important to ask what kinds of impacts are being felt in local schools, industries, and social services because of this influx.  These are important questions not only for researchers, but also for urban planners and civic leaders, for policymakers, and for residents in these communities.    Because the project is being conducted in concert with community organizations, including mutual aid associations, resettlement agencies, and local social service providers, researchers will generate useful information and insights regarding why refugees are being placed in small cities without large existing immigrant populations, what the refugees' experience of settlement has been, and if and how their new communities are being transformed by their arrival.  The project will result in a model with tools and data to assist scholars, policymakers, service providers, community leaders and refugees understand and improve the resettlement experience in new destinations throughout the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates resettlement processes in three stages.  First, researchers will conduct interviews with the decision makers who send refugees to their initial resettlement destinations and with the local leaders who are in charge of helping the newcomers adjust to their arrival.  Second, the project will survey a number of recent refugees regarding their experiences on two occasions -- shortly after they first arrive they will be asked about their expectations for their new life, and one year later the same group will be asked questions about their actual experiences.  These surveys will examine a range of important aspects of refugee and immigrant life including education, employment, healthcare, housing, social integration, and transportation.  Finally, researchers will conduct a series of workshops on perceptions of landscape change, some with recently arrived refugees and others with long-term residents of the neighborhoods into which they have been placed.  These workshops will draw on important tools in geographic research including mental and sketch mapping, photography, and qualitative GIS.  Together these various forms of inquiry will help to develop a model for incorporating data-driven local knowledge on resettlement -- from both refugees and the communities where they live -- into regional and national planning on refugee placement and reception.  Incorporating such local knowledge into policymaking has the potential for creating better outcomes in refugee resettlement across the country.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Refugees are designated by the U.S. Federal government as immigrants who have been allowed to enter the U.S. to escape dangerous conditions in their countries of origin. Recent years have witnessed the movement of refugees to places different from gateway cities such as New York, Chicago, and San Francisco where they traditionally settled. In this project over a five-year period (2014-2019), our team of researchers set out to study the resettlement experience of refugees in small cities in the US, beginning in New England and eventually expanding the study to other sites across the country.&nbsp;There were three main questions we set out to explore:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Why are refugees being placed in these smaller cities?</strong></li> <li><strong>What happens to them in these places?</strong></li> <li><strong>What happens to the communities that receive new arrivals?</strong></li> </ol> <p>We built on the work of other researchers and tried to answer questions that are at the heart of debates regarding immigration across the country. What are the economic impacts of new arrivals, how do refugees adjust to new lives, how do their children do in school, and how do the cities that receive them adjust to unfamiliar faces?&nbsp;&nbsp;These are important questions not only for researchers, but also for urban planners and civic leaders, for policymakers, and for residents in these communities.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our project involved multiple methods, locations and examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;We interviewed over 300 stakeholders including politicians, refugees, resettlement workers, community leaders, social service providers, civic officials and many others besides them.&nbsp;&nbsp;We conducted opinion polls and looked at socio-economic data for over 200 resettlement locations across the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;We visited small cities in the South, Midwest, Northeast, Southwest, and Northwest, to see how the influx of new arrivals looked in very different places. We visited neighborhoods to catalog the effect of change at the local level. We spoke with many people who were both in favor of and opposed to refugee resettlement to better understand their perspectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;We interviewed refugees shortly after their arrival to see what it was that they hoped would be the outcome of their resettlement ? and then asked them again each year what had actually happened.</p> <p>We learned many lessons as a result of our research and are working closely with a number of organizations and groups to make our findings as widely available as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that our work provides balanced and nuanced evidence for data-driven policymaking and information that helps to improve the lives of refugees, the communities that they are settled into, and the nation as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few particular outcomes we would like to highlight here:</p> <ul> <li>For smaller cities outside of the traditional gateway destinations (like New York, Chicago or San Francisco) that immigrants have always come to,

example), refugees are often seen as a lifeline to renewed growth.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The experience for refugees resettling into many of these communities can be a mixed one.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand we found high levels of local support for most resettlement programs within the towns they are located.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, some of these communities have little experience with immigrant integration and thus were not always able to deliver necessary services. &nbsp;</li> </ul> <ul> <li>In particular, the mismatch between refugee skills (including advanced skills in fields of healthcare and engineering) and initial job placements (especially in low-wage manufacturing, agriculture and domestic labor) is a potential waste of human capital. &nbsp;</li> </ul> <ul> <li>More resources dedicated to long-term integration rather than short-term adjustment has the potential for greater success.&nbsp;Successful immigration outcomes, in the estimation of this study, need to be viewed and planned for in the 5-10 year rather than 1-2 year range.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>For smaller communities this includes more investment by federal and state governments into education and housing opportunities.&nbsp;Employment services and healthcare access are already important aspects of resettlement programs but along with education and housing, access to adequate transportation is a key determinant of successful outcomes.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Finally, we found refugee newcomers to be amongst the most enthusiastic and patriotic of new immigrant arrivals within the small cities we studied.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were high levels of civic participation including volunteering for community events, participating in recreational activities, getting involved with their childrens education, studying English diligently, and showing an eagerness to vote once eligible &nbsp;n every community that we studied.&nbsp;&nbsp;Refugee resettlement would thus seem to be an ideal program
