<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to use a combination of numerical simulation and analytic calculations to explore the nonequilibrium mechanics of active cytoskeletal networks. The cytoskeleton of living cells is a chemically complex network of filamentous proteins, cross-linking molecules, and molecular motors, which drive the network into a complex and nonequilibrium steady state. Studies conducted under this award will investigate how the state of motor activity can tune the mechanical response of this filament network, and how the binding and unbinding of cross linkers contributes to the structural reorganization and viscoelasticity of the network. These network models will be validated against simplified experimental systems and then applied to the study of how cells interact mechanically with their environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, these studies would generate new insight into a frontier problem in the statistical mechanics of motor-driven filament networks concerning the evolution of their structure and elastic moduli due to motor activity within them. This new insight would have broad implications for understanding the mechanics of living cells. Specifically, one would learn more about how cells exert forces on and adhere to their surroundings. These properties are of prime physiological relevance for elucidating cell motility and adhesion. The numerical simulation packages produced over the course of these studies will also benefit other researchers seeking simulation tools to explore the response of the cytoskeleton to forces or changes in the evolution of the active network due to the introduction of different cross linking molecules. The educational plan focuses on course development in engineering and physics at the undergraduate and graduate level in order to bring biomechanics more into the mainstream at the awardees' institution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Biology is replete with networks of long thin filaments held together by smaller cross-linking molecules or by branching points.   For example, our cells are filled with a low-density network of protein filaments ? the cytoskeleton ? that gives them their mechanical rigidity and is the site on which molecular motors generate forces so that the cells can pull on their surrounding environment.  That environment, the extra cellular matrix, is itself a complex network of other protein filaments.  By pulling on that network, cells communicate with each other over long distances by force and that communication appears to be essential for maintaining the health of our tissues.      Over the period of this award, we have explored the mechanics of these cytoskeletal networks examining them through a combination of mathematical calculations and computer simulations. Our goal was to better understand how the mechanical response of the network emerges from the elasticity of the individual filaments making it up.  In the process, we discovered that due to the breaking and forming of cross links under applied force, these networks remodel their structure in complex ways in response to those forces. Due to that remodeling, networks have an inherent mechanical memory. Their mechanical response to future stimuli changes due to the ?training? provided by past episodes of force.  We also discovered that, because the filaments are undulating (this is the characteristic ?Brownian? or random motion of small objects in water due to their being randomly bombarded by water molecules) there is new sort of indirect interaction between cross linkers in the network.  This interaction arises because a cross linker at one point changes those thermal Brownian undulations of the filaments at all other points, which, in turn, affects the dynamics of other cross linkers bound there.  This effect is analogous to something well known in quantum field theory called the Casimir effect.  The thermal analog of this quantum Casimir effect appears to change the chemical equilibrium of mixtures of filaments and cross-linking molecules.  We do not yet understand the implications of these changes for living cells, but there is now strong evidence for these Casimir interactions in computer simulations and some evidence for them in experiments on filament networks that have been performed outside of living cells.      In order to explore these complex dynamics of filaments and their cross-liking molecules we have built a new type of computer simulation that is specifically designed to study the very slow reorganization of filament networks as their cross linking molecules move around either due the Casimir induced forces or due to external forces (as happens when cells are squeezed or pulled). These computer simulations appear to reproduce experimental data quite well and give us a chance to look inside these networks to better understand what precise changes are happening to the connectivity of the network as it deforms.      Among the outcomes of our work is the development of new techniques for the analysis deformations and fluctuations in filament networks that have implications for new experimental probes of cell generated forces (either in isolation or in small groups) and of force propagation in tissue networks.  It is our hope that these techniques will improve our understanding of how cells generate forces and how those force propagate through tissues, allowing cells to interact with each other by pushing and pulling.
