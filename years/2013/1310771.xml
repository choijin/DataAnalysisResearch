<AbstractNarration>This action funds Kelly Spendlove of Montana State University to conduct a research project in the Math and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Kyoto University in Kyoto, Japan.  The project is entitled "Computing the Signatures of Critical Transitions Arising in a Complex System." The host scientist is Hiroshi Kokubu. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complex dynamical systems, which range from physiological systems and financial markets to models of the Earth's climate, often exhibit critical thresholds - commonly entitled tipping points - at which the system may radically shift its behavior from one state to another.  For instance, in physiology, there are spontaneous systemic failures such as asthma attacks or epileptic seizures, as well as the sudden onset and progression of certain diseases; in ecology there is the collapse of wildlife populations or catastrophic desertification of environments; in the Earth climate system, abrupt shifts in ocean circulation or climate may occur.  It is notoriously difficult to predict such critical transitions before they happen: empirically, systems may show little change before reaching a tipping point; theoretically, it has been proven that changes in global dynamics can occur on all scales in both phase space and parameter space. Moreover, models of complex systems are typically imprecise, parameters are rarely known exactly and computations may contain errors of various magnitudes. In spite of this difficulty, recent work now suggests the existence of generic early-warning signals, not specific to any particular class of system. Utilizing such generic indicators, this project implements a novel form of analysis, based on ideas from dynamical systems theory and applied algebraic topology, aiming to uncover the fundamental characteristics - or signature - of critical transitions before they occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, all developed code is being incorporated within an existing open-source project with which the host scientist is currently involved.  The emphasis on an open-source framework in this project is particularly important, since as part of an on-going website and source-code repository the results of the work are publicly available, unhindered by academic institution, monetary cost and even scientific discipline.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The past few decades of dynamical systems theory have established that multiparameter nonlinear dynamical systems can exhibit extremely complex behavior with respect to both the system variables and parameters. Such complex behavior proven in theoretical work has to be contrasted with the capabilities of application; in the case of modeling multiscale processes, for instance, measurements may be of limited precision, parameters are rarely known exactly and nonlinearities are often not derived from first principles. This contrast suggests that extracting robust features which persist over a range of parameter values is of greater importance than a detailed understanding of the fine structure at some particular parameter. That is, the resolution at which one analyzes the problem is of fundamental importance.  The purpose of this research was to explore the interplay between the dynamics of complex systems and its dependence upon parameters. As discussed above, in such systems it is typical to observe bifurcations, or small changes in the parameters which lead to radical qualitative changes in the behavior of the system.  The goal of our research was to develop algorithms for detecting such qualitative changes, while focusing on the role of resolution in the problem. To do this, we utilized a recently developed approach which analyzes the dynamics at a resolution specified a priori, and characterizes the global dynamics in the form of a directed graph.    Using this characterization, we developed a family of algorithms for clustering directed graphs, which may be used to track the changes of robust structures within the graph as the parameters of the system are varied.  Our algorithm considers weights on the edges of the directed graph; roughly, these weights may be thought of as probabilities of an edge, or the strength of the connection. We are interested in analyzing the subgraphs having edges with weights only higher than some threshold. In particular, we are interested in the how the vertices of this subgraph cluster together, as well as how these clusters behave with respect to the thresholding parameter. Intuitively, clusters which exist for large ranges of the thresholding value may correspond to dynamics at a finer resolution. Our empirical evidence from a variety of dynamical models suggests this form of analysis is quite effective at discerning the dynamical behavior at finer scales, as well as detecting when clusters are bifurcating. Furthermore, we are also investigating the behavior of this type of analysis with respect to which clustering algorithm is utilized. Finally, we are in the process of developing mathematical theorems which relate this form of analysis back to traditional concepts from dynamical systems theory.
