<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this study was to examine the potential of exploiting recent advances in photonics, nanotechnology, and mobile technology in the development of new low-cost technologies for rapid detection of infectious diseases.  The study had two quite independent thrusts. The first thrust, the responsibility of subcontractor, Innospace Systems was focused on identifying the state-of-the-art related to detection of infectious diseases by examining current grants, patents, publications, products and identifying key active researchers. The second thrust, the responsibility of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, was a pilot study to develop single frequency broadly tunable middle-infrared laser as a source for detection of biomarkers associated with an infectious disease.   The ultimate interest of Thrust 1 was in identifying research opportunities that will enable smart phones and mobile devices as eventual tools for detecting several infectious pathogens simultaneously.  The study conducted focuses on examining relevant research in universities and technologies under development at companies that are related to infectious disease in hospital environment, surgical centers, semiconductor industry, agriculture, food safety, soil and animal infection control, cancers and STD detection, epidemiology data collection, nanotechnology, and biophotonics.  These methods relate to detection of pathogens directly on human body, airborne, in human samples, in soil, or in food.   Databases of NSF and NIH were searched using various key words and topic including infectious diseases, not limited to human body but also pathogens in general including in the environment, hospitals, medical instrument, agriculture, and food.  This was conducted comprehensively and with the ultimate goal of early detection and scanning of infectious disease to identify the pedigree and the genome of the bacteria/virus/fungus/ via mobile technology.  An outcome of this study is to possibly rely on library/database of cross references where the instrument can compare the genetic material of the disease detected by a smart phone instantly by sending the image to current and updated library or have the partial database of series of known or select pathogens already uploaded on the hand-held device (smart phone) to determine the most commonly known infections instantly.  A third option is a lab-on-a-chip which can identify and analyze in real-time or close to real-time the infection at hand.  The focus of this search is on development of the instrument over acquisition and with the possibility of finding collaborative partners who have the potential or the infrastructure to develop such instrument. A two-step handheld device scenario can be considered and recommended to solve the crucial need for remote regions until the merged solution of the one hand-held device is realized.  The study demonstrates a growing interest and functional possibilities in the use of smartphones to diagnose disease and how the use of smartphone is becoming acceptable and even encouraged by the medical community to provide data by the patients in diagnosing disease.  The main objective of the second thrust was to realize single frequency operation on chromium transitions with output laser parameters suitable for sensing of organic molecules.  Cr:ZnS laser capable to operate in gain-switched regime at pulse repetition rate matching resonant frequency of quartz tuning fork of 32 kHz and on its sub harmonics (16, 8 kHz) with good pulse-to-pulse stability was developed.  Cr:ZnS CW tunable single frequency solid state lasers was developed for spectroscopic applications. Wavelength modulation was achieved via amplitude modulation of the pump laser power as well as via piezo driven mirror shakers.  Developed Cr:ZnS single frequency laser was validated for sensing and characterization of NH3 molecules.
