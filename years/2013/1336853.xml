<AbstractNarration>Fritch/Isaac&lt;br/&gt;1336853/1336722&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selective activation of redox-polymer-modified electrodes in a small volume in magnetic fields will be investigated to control microfluidics spatially and temporally. This new form of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), as opposed to adding redox species to the solution or not adding them at all, defeats problems that hinder MHD from use in lab-on-a-chip (LOAC) devices. It allows higher currents with lower voltages, and thus, higher MHD forces and faster velocities without bubble formation or corrosion, faster response times, and compatibility with detectors and samples. MHD offers greater versatility over other micropumps, because flow can be programmed without redesigning channels of a device. An interdisciplinary, preexisting collaboration of investigators in Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry at the Univ. of Arkansas and in Mechanical &amp; Aerospace Engineering at Missouri Univ. of Science &amp; Technology will perform the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;Reduction/oxidation of chemical species confined to polymer films on electrodes creates an ionic current in solution. When at right angles to the magnetic field, the resulting MHD force causes fluid to flow there in the third dimension. Individually-addressable electrodes will be fabricated in desired patterns, polymer films will be polymerized and characterized by electrochemistry, electrodes will be activated with current and voltage in magnetic fields, and flow will be monitored by microbead movement in solution. The objectives are to (1) establish large coulombic capacity, fast response, and equivalent circuit models for redox-polymer films on electrodes, (2) control and maximize flow velocities, tune profiles, switch direction, and drive adjacent counter-flows using concentric disk-ring configurations of redox-polymer-modified electrodes perpendicular to a magnetic field, (3) sustain fluid flow by recharging redox-polymer films, and (4) use simulations to obtain spatial maps of ionic current density, MHD force density, and fluid velocities as a function of time, compare with experiment, and evaluate parameters that exceed experimental limits to better design redox-MHD microfluidic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to control microfluidics in a programmable way with far-reaching consequences toward products of interest to the public, such as hand-held, self-contained chemical analysis units for medical, environmental, and household uses. The interdisciplinary nature of the project enhances training of students involved in the research. Completed software modules will become available for testing and further evaluation to the scientific community free of charge.  An outreach collaboration between science, math, and language arts teachers at The New School and mentors at the U of A and Missouri S&amp;T will use MHD as a starting point to stimulate viral learning for middle school students on topics of forces and energy. Students will perform self-directed projects in collaboration with teachers and mentors, communicate results with videos using their own vocabulary and perspective, which they have scripted, edited, produced, and post them on the internet for public viewing and commentary. This approach is expected to bridge the gap between university research and middle school education, while simultaneously enhancing STEM education and educator development and increasing public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Just as computing power that historically filled a room can now fit in the palm of a hand, there is a need to transform a laboratory filled with instruments that perform a chemical analysis to diagnose an illness, personalize medical treatment, and measure environmental toxins to a handheld device at point-of-care (site).  As with computing technology, chemical analysis benefits by downsizing, which provides portability, less waste, improved speed, and diminished requirements for skilled personnel.  A question that arises and is unique to such "lab-on-a-chip" devices, however, is, "How does one handle liquid samples and reagents on a millionth to billionth of the laboratory scale?" This "microfluidics" ("micro" meaning microscopically small and "fluidics" meaning fluid transport) needs to have the versatility to perform many functions, such as pumping fluids between locations, stopping, varying speed and profile, switching direction, combining fluids of different compositions, mixing, tailoring localized fluid flow around objects, trapping and releasing, and splitting a fluid element into smaller volumes for differential processing.  The "microfluidics" also needs to perform these functions on many different kinds of liquids in an automated and programmable way, and preferably without redesign and fabrication of the device.  The NSF project has achieved advances in the development and understanding of a microfluidics approach that propels tiny volumes of liquids simply by using magnets and electricity, called magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). MHD essentially "grabs" a part of the liquid inside a cartridge just smaller than a credit card and moves it at a speed and in a path based on the amount, direction, and placement of the magnetic field and electricity.  Thus, the cartridge is truly self-contained, where different components of the fluid remain within the cartridge, minimizing contamination and mess, which is unlike traditional microfluidic pumps that force an external fluid through a device. One outcome of the project was the achievement of desired fluid transport in a deliberate and predictable fashion, and with control over the three dimensional path of that fluid element by the determination of experimental conditions, development of theory, and establishment of simulations (through collaboration). . Another outcome was the synthesis of electroactive or "redox" (R) polymer materials and assessment of their electrochemical behavior. Films of these polymers were coated onto device electrodes as sources of charge in converting the electricity from electronic current to ionic current in the liquid of the chamber. These polymer-modified electrodes will have a significant impact on the future of R-MHD microfluidics, because they allow the method to be compatible with almost any liquid sample and reagent, while preventing electrode corrosion and formation of impeding bubbles. Formation of the films onto the electrodes was also simplified and the preparation time was diminished to 1/6th of that reported previously. The quality and quantity of the films were also improved substantially so that the duration of a continuous R-MHD pumping event without recharging the polymer film-modified electrodes was increased to about 10 times the previous lifetime with twice the flow speed. In addition, two different approaches were initiated that alternate the magnetic field direction with the applied electricity direction to enable recharging of the polymer-film-modified electrodes while sustaining flow in a single direction, essentially indefinitely.  With collaborators, an application was demonstrated using the optimized film-modified electrodes for a continuous flow, high-resolution, fluorescence image cytometry (a specialized microscope method) to classify populations of biological cells based on their size, shape, and interior structures.  In brief, R-MHD?s highly uniform flow profile across distances of several millimeters was combined with epitaxial light sheet confocal microscopy to differentially image three kinds of white blood cells, which is of interest in monitoring chemotherapy effects in cancer patients.  This platform is well-suited to miniaturization and could lead to impactful point-of-care devices for clinical decision-making across a broad array of applications.   Another broader impacts outcome involved outreach activities between the science, mathematics, and language arts teachers at a middle school and the faculty and graduate student mentors at universities. MHD was used as a starting point to stimulate viral learning for middle school students on topics of forces, energy, electricity, and magnetism. Students performed self-directed projects in collaboration with teachers and university mentors, communicated results with videos using their own vocabulary and perspective, which they scripted, edited, produced, and posted them on the internet for public viewing and commentary. This approach attempted to bridge the gap between university research and middle school education, while simultaneously enhancing STEM education and educator development and increasing public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology.
