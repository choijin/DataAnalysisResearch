<AbstractNarration>A Clearinghouse for Natural Hazards Research and Applications&lt;br/&gt;Kathleen Tierney, Principal Investigator&lt;br/&gt;Natural Hazards Center, Institute of Behavioral Science&lt;br/&gt;University of Colorado Boulder&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every year, disasters cause numerous deaths and injuries and many economic losses in the U. S.  The costs of disasters continue to rise, owing largely to growing population density in hazardous areas such as floodplains, coastal areas that are at risk from hurricane winds and storm surges, and parts of the country that are at risk from wildland fires. Disasters present complex and difficult recovery challenges for communities, businesses, and households and their psychological effects can linger long after disaster impact. The University of Colorado?s Natural Hazards Center seeks to prevent and reduce these negative impacts and enhance the disaster resilience of the nation through transferring knowledge on the social, economic, political, and psychosocial dimensions of disasters to decision makers, the emergency management community, and the general public, as well as through leadership and advocacy. To advance these goals, the Center provides a range of information products, including: 1) library and information services; 2) electronic newsletters and listservs (Natural Hazards Observer, DR, Disaster Grads) aimed at providing information to public officials, private entities, researchers, students, and the general public; 3) a web site that is the most widely-recognized in the hazards and disasters field, containing research reports, bibliographies, guidance documents, and links to many other centers and information sources; 4) publications on topics of special interest (Natural Hazards Informer and monographs); 5) information distribution through social media (e.g., on Twitter as HazCenter); and 6) an annual workshop that is attended by hundreds of participants from universities, government, and the private sector and that increasingly includes participation by international researchers and practitioners. To provide rapid information on disasters and their social impacts, the Center also sponsors quick-response research in the aftermath of major U. S. disasters. Information products, including quick-response research reports, are available free of charge, primarily through the Center web site, http://www.colorado.edu/hazards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of Center activities is based on its contributions to hazards and disaster theory and to the analysis of the causes and consequences of disasters. Center faculty and staff are actively engaged in research and in reporting research results in books (including textbooks), journal articles, and conference presentations.  Principal investigator Tierney is widely recognized for her research on topics such as the social causes of risk and disaster losses, disaster vulnerability and resilience, and disaster recovery, as well as her work on improving multi-disciplinary collaboration for the in-depth study of hazards, disasters, and risk. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of Center activities and NSF funding can be measured along a variety of dimensions, including visits to the Center web site, information requests handled by the Hazards Center Library, newsletter and listserv subscriptions, attendance at annual workshops, and the training of the next generation of disaster researchers and practitioners. The PI incorporates state-of-the art research findings into her undergraduate and graduate courses at the University of Colorado Boulder and is frequently called upon to provide context and commentary on disaster-related issues for the media. Additionally, her publications and those of the Center are often included in graduate and undergraduate course syllabi around the country. Recently, she has served as a source or on-air participant for media outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, CNN, the Associated Press, National Public Radio and local NPR stations, and HuffPost Live. Tierney speaks regularly at meetings of professional societies and at conferences for emergency management and disaster loss-reduction practitioners. She has also served on several National Academy of Sciences committees and panels focusing both on disasters and on climate change. NAS committee reports and activities are designed to provide guidance to various governmental agencies and programs on ways of addressing issues of national significance.</AbstractNarration>

The Center engages in four interconnected activities, including (1) translating and transferring social science, engineering, and interdisciplinary knowledge on natural hazards and disasters; (2) facilitating connections across disciplinary and professional divides through convening events that bring together members of hazards research, practice, and policy communities; (3) supporting and conducting original research on topics of national importance; and (4) training and mentoring a diverse next generation of hazards and disaster scholars through providing opportunities for research and education.</p> <p>The Center designs and leads various initiatives to link the multi-disciplinary natural hazards social science and engineering research communities to decision makers from federal, state, and local government, non-profit organizations and professional associations, and the private sector. To that end, the Center serves as a convener for meetings focused on hazards mitigation and disaster risk reduction. Notably, for 43 years, the Center has hosted the Annual Natural Hazards Research and Applications Workshop in Colorado. For the reporting period of 2013 through 2018, the Center brought together 2,636 participants spanning the academic, government, non-profit, and private sectors. The annual Workshop is followed by a Researchers Meeting that was attended by 513 participants between 2013 and 2018. Many other events were held in conjunction with the Workshop including those hosted by partner organizations such as the Natural Hazards Mitigation Association, the Bill Anderson Fund, and the recently established North American Alliance for Hazards and Disaster Research Centers and Institutes. In 2017, the Center, in partnership with the International Association of Emergency Managers and the Association of State Floodplain Managers, began offering continuing education credits for emergency managers who attend the Workshop.</p> <p>During the reporting period, the Center produced the <em>Natural Hazards Observer</em> newsletter through 2016, which was distributed in electronic or print form bimonthly to over 4,000 direct subscribers; produced and distributed the electronic newsletter <em>DR&ndash;Disaster Research News You Can Use</em> to over 6,000 subscribers every two weeks with online content posted in between publication dates; co-edited the multi-disciplinary journal <em>Natural Hazards Review</em>, which is published by the American Society of Civil Engineers and was founded at the Natural Hazards Center, through 2016; maintained nearly 50,000 print and online acquisitions at the Natural Hazards Center Library, which is the second largest academic library in the nation dedicated specifically to hazards and disasters; hosted HazLib, a fully accessible online search engine for hazards and disaster specific information, with nearly 2,000 new digital items added per month; and maintained and updated the Natural Hazards Center website. In 2017, the Center launched the <em>Research Counts</em> series, which offers access to brief publications written by leading and emerging researchers in the field. The 38 article contributions produced to date have received over 11,000 unique page views via the Center website and tens of thousands more through social media. Also in 2017, the Center director began writing a <em>Director&rsquo;s Corner </em>column for the website. That same year, the Center initiated a map series to identify the location of academic hazards and disaster research centers around the world, and a <em>New Reads</em> book series, featuring recent book publications by hazards and disaster researchers.
