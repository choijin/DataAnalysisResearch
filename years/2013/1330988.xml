<AbstractNarration>Jennifer Patico of the Georgia State University will investigate how debates about food security unfold in and across households in urban communities. Social scientists agree that contemporary Americans tend to imbue both eating and child-rearing with strong moral meanings. At the same time, they observe the "time bind" faced by double-earner families, whereby parents balance ever-lengthening professional work days with the labor of housekeeping and child-raising. The charged issue of children's food provides a strategic opportunity to examine standards for parental care and how these are negotiated under conditions of material and/or temporal strain in the United States. Based in an economically and racially diverse area of urban Atlanta, the study more specifically investigates how parental and institutional concerns about children's food might reinforce (or challenge) social inequalities by providing an arena in which the experiences, knowledge and values of different groups are communicated and/or evaluated.  In-depth interviews will be held with adults from a total of sixty households that reflect the economic diversity of a local elementary and middle school. Other ethnographic methods include the observation of food-related practices within a select sample of individual households. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will illuminate how measures intended to improve the health of children - such as public service announcements or guidelines for "healthy" school snacks - are perceived and managed by caretakers and school employees. Further, it will show how these measures can have complex, unintended effects on the ground. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Children's food has been framed as an American "crisis" in recent years; it is a topic of active debate in the mass media, in public health research, and at the community level. These data will be of critical importance to public health professionals, school administrators, parent activists, community organizers and others who seek to mobilize concern around children's nutrition and find effective ways to shape community initiatives.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the wake of a national "childhood obesity epidemic," heated classroom cupcake wars, and other food-related health scares, the food children eat has become a topic of much attention and debate in the United States.  This ethnographic study explores how the feeding of children &ndash; and middle-class adults? often impassioned, worried talk about the foods children eat &ndash; not only addresses nutritional concerns but expresses key values and tensions that make up contemporary American styles of selfhood.  Drawing upon 50 in-depth interviews and extensive participant-observation in one urban charter school community, I have observed how many parents carry out vigilant oversight over what their children eat (lest children fall prey to harmful chemicals, excessive sugars, and eating habits understood to threaten their physical and emotional well-being) yet also fear controlling their children too much or coming across to others as overly anxious or judgmental.  Indeed, I found that adults who were explicitly talking about fostering their children?s physical health and psychological maturity through food were also, more implicitly yet consistently, expressing standards for adult styles of selfhood and relationship.  These standards entailed navigating between over- and under-control, between restricting their children and respecting their autonomy and desires, and between monitoring the food environments through which their children moved and embracing the social diversity of their urban neighborhoods.   Ethnographically embedding myself in school events, after-school meetings, school lunchrooms, and private homes, I observed how parents and caregivers in one Atlanta community navigated those conflicting objectives through innumerable mundane choices and commentaries: for example, when parents expressed displeasure about Rice Krispie treats being made at school, when they balanced concerns about price and appeal with healthfulness when choosing snacks to bring in for their children?s classrooms, or when they were distressed by the "fake" and "junky" snacks someone else had chosen.
