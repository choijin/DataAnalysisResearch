<AbstractNarration>This planning activity supports Wittenberg University's efforts in developing a plan to improve campus network infrastructure aligning with the goals and guidance described in NSF CISE/ACI's CC-NIE program. The 6-month planning period includes the following activities: assessing network infrastructure needs driven by science and education activities on campus; defining partnerships and collaborations on campus and elsewhere to create leveraging opportunities and help define those opportunities; and develop a complete plan documenting design, re-architecting, and implementation of an improved campus network that includes the science DMZ concept. Wittenberg University  will also host a "campus CI" day. The activity creates the opportunity to make the most of existing infrastructure, both locally and regionally, and in turn enhance research capabilities internally and with partners outside the institution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to develop a comprehensive plan to improve the Wittenberg University campus network infrastructure through the creation of a "Science DMZ" that not only supports the research and educational mission for science at Wittenberg University but also positions the University to seize future opportunities resulting from the rapid evolution in both high performance computing and the role of technology in education and research across scientific disciplines.  To achieve this goal, the principal investigators and partners set out to achieve three specific project outcomes. (1)performed a thorough assessment of the network infrastructure needs for current scientific research and explore how education and research endeavors could be enhanced by Cyberinfrastructure (CI); (2)built a coalition of partners and collaborators to expand opportunities and map community assets; and (3)developed a comprehensive planning document for designing and implementing a re-architecture of the campus network that incorporates building a "Science DMZ" to addresses identified research and education needs.  Perhaps the most important outcome of this planning grant is the formation of a strong group of collaborators and partners.  The formation of this group not only provided WittenbergÆs PIÆs and network specialists with an opportunity to consult with experts in CI to inform the development of a campus network plan but also exposed faculty and staff to new possibilities for expanded research and teaching with improved CI. The collaboration meetings also provided a mutual benefit to our partners, providing an opportunity for networking and sharing of information and ideas between our partners.  The planning period also enabled the campus IT specialists to identify important barriers existing in the national CI infrastructure to implementation of a science DMZ to smaller institutions with limited resources. While we are still working through developing plans,  negotiating fees and determining operational feasability, for small institutions, identifying the challenges and beginning the conversation is an important outcome for all small private institutions.
