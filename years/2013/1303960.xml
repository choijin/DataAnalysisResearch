<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2013 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Daniel Halpern-Leistner is "Derived Categories of Coherent Sheaves and Geometric Invariant Theory." The host institution for the fellowship is Columbia University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Andrei Okounkov.</AbstractNarration>

The focus of algebraic geometry is to study the geometric properties of shapes defined by special kinds of equations called polynomials, and to use geometric methods to study the solutions of polynomial equations.  Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest subjects in mathematics, and polynomial equations have applications in many fields of science, including many of the probabilistic models used in empirical sciences.

This is the "D-equivalence" conjecture, which states that two birationally equivalent Calabi-Yau manifolds have equivalent "derived categories of coherent sheaves." The major contribution of this project has been to prove the first instances of the D-equivalence conjecture in all even dimensions greater than 3.  The proof involved the significant development of several different sub-fields of algebraic geometry -- the theory of moduli problems, the theory of derived categories, and the new and growing methods of "derived algebraic geometry." In fact, these intermediate developments are more impactful than the proof itself.  A "moduli problem" is basically the problem of understanding how the geometry of a certain kind of shape varies as the coefficients of the equations defining that shape vary.
