<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funds to support a School on Astroparticle and Underground Science to be held September 4-8, 2013, at the Asilomar Conference Grounds, Monterey, California, immediately preceding the 2013 International Conference on Topics in Astroparticle and Underground Physics (TAUP-13).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of particle astrophysics is a broad one, stretching from dark matter and its detection to neutrino physics and astrophysics, cosmic-ray physics, and the physics of gravitational waves.  The purpose of this School is to provide junior physicists with a broad perspective on the field, as presented by leading theorists and experimentalists.  The participants will also have the opportunity to discuss their own research with leading physicists in the field, and to prepare poster presentations on their work.  This event will also help to build a true "community" of junior physicists who are working in this field.  By holding this event immediately prior to the TAUP-13 Conference, it is hoped that the TAUP conference will help attract participants to the school (both in terms of senior lecturers and junior participants) and also provide an added bonus in providing the junior participants with exposure to cutting-edge research in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity will have significant broader impacts. NSF support of this event will enable young researchers (graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) to attend at reduced travel expense. Participation by students and post-docs will enhance their education and promote their research. It will permit face-to-face interactions between physicists at different stages in their careers, allow all to network in an informal setting, enable them to share ideas and establish personal contacts, and provide younger researchers the opportunity to exhibit their own expertise through presentations of their research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A summer school in nuclear and particle astrophysics, cosmology, and gravitation was held in September, 2013, coordinated with the 13th International Conference on Topics in Astroparticle and Underground Physics (TAUP2013). The school lectures were held over 5 days, and culminated with a student poster session, coordinated with the start of TAUP2013, that gave the students an opportunity to discuss their research with many of the world's leading researchers in the field.  The school helped broaden the educational backgrounds of the students and deepened their enthusiasm for research.  The 55 students who attended were selected from approximately 100 applicants: the interests of the students included theory, experiment, and observation.  The school served several purposes beyond the educational ones mentioned above.  It gave the students -- primarily advanced undergraduates and beginning postodoctoral researchers -- a chance to network with each other, with the lecturers, and with TAUP2013 participants.  We also invited the students to help with the TAUP2013 conference as session assistants: most accepted that opportunity, which further help them feel a part of the broader research community.  The lectures given at the school are archived on the school's web site.  These lectures are a permanent resource that the students and others can refer to in years to come.
