<AbstractNarration>Sensing systems are found everywhere in the modern world, ranging from the microphones, video cameras, and antennas found in everyday cellular phones, to the radar systems used for astronomy, meteorology, archaeology, and defense applications, to the biomedical imaging systems used to understand the human body and its diseases. Real-world sensing systems must always strike a practical balance between the cost of data acquisition and the quality of the measured data. The costs of acquiring a large amount of high-quality data are prohibitive for many important applications, and place practical limits our ability to explore and understand our bodies, our world, and our universe. This effect is exacerbated as new sensors become increasingly capable of acquiring multidimensional data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is focused on exploring the use of parsimonious low-rank signal models to extract information from incomplete and/or low-quality data.  Specifically, the investigators are developing theory and methods to unify and generalize a range of existing constrained signal reconstruction methods within a framework based on low-rank matrix embeddings.  While the new theory and methods can be applied in general sensing applications, the proposed models are being evaluated in the specific practical context of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where they can enable faster MRI experiments and more informative high-dimensional examinations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on the development of novel mathematical modeling methods that can enable the reconstruction of useful signals from incomplete or low-quality data.  Medical imaging was one of the primary motivating applications for this work, since enabling the reconstruction of high-quality medical images from lower-quality data can enable imaging technology that is faster, safer, and less prone to artifacts than conventional medical imaging acquisitions.    Structured low-rank matrix modeling was the primary mathematical modeling technique that we focused on.  This approach takes a lower-dimensional dataset and maps it into a higher-dimensional representation.  Our theoretical developments have proven that this higher-dimensional representation will have special low-dimensional structure in a wide variety of different practical contexts, and this special structure allows for the restoration of missing or corrupted data samples.  In addition to developing novel theory, we have also developed practical algorithms and techniques for applications in medical imaging (specifically magnetic resonance imaging and x-ray computed tomography), where we have demonstsrated state-of-the-art performance.  We have also identified strong connections between structured low-rank modeling methods and machine learning methods, and have used this connection to improve performance even further.  Through the course of this work, we have also developed novel tools for analyzing the quality and robustness of various nonlinear image reconstruction methods.  In addition to developing novel theory, algorithms, and tools and applying these ideas to important real-world imaging problems, this project has also resulted in the development of open-source software and datasets that are made freely available to the public, which are expected to be useful for both education and research.  This project has also assisted in the academic training of multiple students, and the development of new educational courses and programs.
