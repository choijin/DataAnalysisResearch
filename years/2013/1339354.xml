<AbstractNarration>The University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University will test and refine a Theory of Badges applied to Computer Science Education.  Given that badges have recently attracted a great deal of attention as both motivator and assessment marker, the goal of the project is to create a foundation of principles that will guide the design of future Computer Science badging initiatives.  The team will experimentally manipulate the use of badges within an ongoing Computer Science education development project that leverages highly popular robotics competitions as the distribution channel.  They will monitor and adapt the form and content of assessments and badge representations in computer science content modules to try to achieve the best possible outcomes for student participants (learner persistence, computer science content learning, and computer science career interest) as predicted by the current iteration of their badge theory.  Researchers will explicitly track and publish data for underrepresented minorities, women, and economically disadvantaged students to see whether badges are particularly effective or encounter obstacles specific to these populations.</AbstractNarration>

The project tests and iteratively refines a set badges designed to track students? performance and motivate them to engage in computer science activities. CMRA?s role in the project involves developing the educational technologies that are used in the project: the Computer Science STEM Network (www.cs2n.org ), Robot Virtual Worlds that include badges designed to track student progress, and the curriculum used in the project.

Designing a Badge System that is Desirable and Easily Understood by Students  In 2010, CMRA developed a robot programming tool called Robot Virtual Worlds (RVWs) www.robotvirtualworlds.com . RVWs enable students to program virtual robots using the same programming languages that they use on their LEGO or VEX school robots. Initial RVWs used badges to track students? progress; complete a programming task and earn a badge. This badge system was designed as a tool for teachers enabling them to track student progress, our research found that student felt that there was little incentive for them to earn badges except to prove to their teacher that they completed their programming assignments.  Improving the Motivational Effects of Badges/Pathways to Certifications  In order to make the badges more interesting to students, the project team designed several mapped badged pathways that led to student certifications. The idea of a badged pathway to a certification was tested multiple times over the life of the project in classrooms, in camps, and during CMRA?s annual "Robotics Summer of Learning" project.   Four Levels of Badges  Over the three year project, the project team developed a system of badges that involved four levels: Activity Badges, Skill Badges, Competency Badges, and Certification Badges.  Level 1 Activity Badges &ndash; activity badges are earned as a student completes an activity that aligns with a skill. For example, in the picture on the left, to earn the Calculated Distance Skill badge a student has to program their robot to travel to the correct spot five times in a row earning five activity badges.    Level 2 Skill Badges &ndash; skill badges are earned by accruing the required number of activity badges, taking a quiz, and by earning an endorsement.  Level 3 Competency Badges &ndash; competency badges require students to earn a composite set of related Skill badges. In the example pictured at the left, in order to earn the Robot Math competency badge students would have needed to earn the Calculated Distance, Calculated Turns, and Calculated Movement skills badges.     Level 4 Certification Badges &ndash; Certification badges are earned by completing all of the badges in the certification, receiving a teacher endorsement, and by passing the certification test. In the example shown directly below, the Introduction to Programming certification, the student needs to earn the Robot Math badge, the Data Logging badge, the Basic Movement badge, the Sensor badge, and the Program Flow badge plus receive a teacher endorsement before they can take the certification test to earn the certification.   Designing a System that is an Accurate Indicator of Performance  Badges are only worthwhile if they are an accurate indicator of performance. CS2N?s badge system is designed to enable badge earners to attach evidence to the badges that they earn. Evidence includes:  1.   A description of the activity level badges earned  2.  Computational artifact that can be attached to a badge (i.e. a program, a PDF or Word Doc, a drawing or portfolio, or a web page or link to a video)  3.  An endorsement from a peer or teacher, including a completed rubric  4. The result of a quiz and/or example questions from the quiz.   The Future of the Project  The Computer Science STEM Network is a tool used by CMRA to certify that teachers have passed their Robotics Teacher Certification course. Currently, only teachers that have passed their certification test are eligible to us CS2N in their classrooms; CS2N has awarded 1,075,694 badges and over 10,000 certifications.
