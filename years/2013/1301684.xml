<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for participants, especially women and mathematicians from other under-represented groups, graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty, to the Maryland Dynamics Conference. This is a long-standing series of conferences that are held each spring at the University of Maryland at College Park.  The award will fund the 2013, 2014 and 2015 iterations of this conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The semi-annual  Maryland Dynamics Conference is a spring workshop/conference. This workshop first met at Penn State in 1991. It has hosted  by Maryland each spring and by Penn State each fall since 1992. The workshop is devoted to recent progress in dynamical systems and related fields. It have been regularly attracting leading experts in the field. Such outstanding mathematicians as Fefferman, Furstenberg, Lindenstrauss. Margulis, Mather, Ornstein, Sinai, Yoccoz took part in the past conferences.</AbstractNarration>
