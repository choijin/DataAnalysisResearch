<AbstractNarration>This project examines the values embedded in formal mechanisms, such as risk assessment and cost benefit analysis, that could be used to assess the impact of emerging technologies, with synthetic biology as a case study. The project aims to refine the understanding of these mechanisms, facilitate their thoughtful use in policy-making, deepen the social debate about synthetic biology, and advance the debate about the values that ought to guide impact assessment for emerging technologies generally. The project sets out three applications of synthetic biology, develops formal impact assessments for them, and convenes a panel of experts who, collectively, have expertise in synthetic biology, governance of technologies, and the theory and use of impact assessments. With the help of this panel, the project's leadership team will engage in conceptual and philosophical analysis of the role of values in impact assessments. The project draws on literature in policy analysis, political science, economics, philosophy, and bioethics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meeting the goals indicated above could contribute to the growing effort to develop strategies that ensure the governance of emerging technologies aligns appropriately with public values. The project will lead to a report that examines the role of values in formal impact assessment mechanisms, an additional report on how impact assessment mechanisms square with the recommendation by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues for "prudent vigilance" in policy on synthetic biology and other emerging biotechnologies, and scholarly papers reassessing the debate about proactionary (promoting freedom to innovate) versus precautionary (constraining innovation until there is sound evidence that no harm will result) approaches to policy-making. The work will also be disseminated through publications intended for a general audiences, interactions with journalists, public presentations, and on the web.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[A. Overview  The Hastings Center project "Values in Impact Assessment" examined the mechanisms by which society can decide when and how to make use of an emerging biotechnology such as synthetic biology. The focal point of the examination was the role of the public?s values in cost-benefit analysis and other formal, evidence-based mechanisms for studying a proposed use?s potential outcomes. The project considered both how CBA incorporates the public?s values and whether the public?s values are integrated in appropriate ways in those formal mechanisms. In the United States, CBA is the most widely accepted mechanism for evaluating any industrial or technological proposal, and commentary on the governance of emerging technologies often uses language that reflects the ascendancy of CBA. Proponents of CBA hold that it reflects the public?s values because it relies on evidence of the public?s choices and prevents powerful individuals or groups from skewing the analysis. Critics, however, hold that CBA tends to exclude important values and support special interests, and they often call for a "precautionary" approach in place of CBA. B. Intellectual Merit   The project?s method was to consider the hypothetical application of CBA to several proposed applications of synthetic biology, including the production of ethanol using modified cyanobacteria, the production of a malarial drug using modified yeast, and a genetic alteration to wild populations of the North African desert locust to prevent them from swarming. A working group of experts in the governance of emerging technologies used the cases develop new lines of thinking about CBA and its possible alternatives.  The group's findings are laid out in a 96-page open access report published as a supplement to the Hastings Center Report, a leading bioethics journal.  An introduction to the report lays out the pros and cons of CBA, and eight following essays extend the analysis and either propose corrections to CBA or call for augmenting or replacing CBA with alternative approaches. Two of the essays defend CBA while noting its limits. One essay divides the process of policy analysis into ten "phases" and identifies 65 different value-laden judgments that a policy analysis must make; the essay argues that recognizing and being explicit about these judgments can allow for more thoughtful and defensible use of CBA. Other essays describe institutional structures that can create better science-policy interfaces for the use of CBA.  Many of the essays give room for some version of a precautionary approach, and two essays in the set develop a pragmatic, process-oriented understanding of precaution that departs from common views of precaution as a "principle" and may even open the way to integrating precaution with CBA. Precaution is commonly understood as a principle that can be used to generate substantive guidance: applying the general principle to specific cases supposedly leads as a matter of logic to recommendations appropriate to the case. These essays, however, argue that the core idea of precaution is less about the substance of recommendations than about the structure of policy analysis, and that additional discussions and arguments are necessary to come up with substantive recommendations for policy analysis. In other words, precaution does not tell us what to do, but it gives insight into how to think&mdash;what to think about and how to organize the thinking. This understanding makes the principle of precaution more customizable and flexible than many proponents of precaution have assumed, yet it also makes precaution more meaningful than critics have argued. C. Broader Impact  An improved understanding of impact assessment mechanisms and of the debate about CBA and precaution has the potential to lead to better governance of emerging technologies. During the course of the project, the principal investigator also participated in the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Committee on Gene Drive Research in Non-Human Organisms: Recommendations for Responsible Conduct, whose 2016 report, Gene Drives on the Horizon: Advancing Science, Navigating Uncertainty, and Aligning Research with Public Values, calls for precaution in research on and use of gene drives. The investigator later led a subgroup of the committee in writing an essay, published in Science magazine, that proposes a pragmatic understanding of precaution. The project?s findings were also discussed in presentations at the 2017 annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science; the 2017 World Conference of Science Journalists, the 2017 Association for Health Care Journalists annual conference; a meeting of the World Economic Forum?s Global Future Council on Technology, Values and Policy; and in community discussions in Garrison, New York, and at Arizona State University.
