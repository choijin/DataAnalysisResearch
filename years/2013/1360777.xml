<AbstractNarration>Building on the success of the 2012 Conference, Algebraic Statistics in the Alleghenies at Pennsylvania State University, a four day conference on Algebraic Statistics at the Illinois Institute of Technology, May 19-22, 2014 will provide a focus for the further development and maturation of this exciting area of research as well as its interconnections.  The unifying theme for the proposed workshop is provided by the common mathematical tool set as well as the increasingly close interaction between algebra and statistics.  The program will allow researchers working in statistics to interact with those working in algebra, algebraic geometry, and discrete mathematics, and make fundamental advances in the development and application of algebraic methods to statistics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic statistics advocates polynomial algebra as a tool for addressing problems in statistics and its applications, and it motivates further developments in theoretical and computational algebraic geometry.  The program will foster international collaborations between U.S.-based participants and their international counterparts. This funding will allow junior researchers to attend the meeting and present their work, and interact with the broader community of researchers in algebraic statistics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Researchers from 11 countries and more than 30 universities gethered at IIT for as2014, an international conference on algebraic statistics, May 19-22, 2014.  The unifying theme of the conference was the increasingly close interaction between algebra and statistics, and the goal is to perpetuate further development in these interconnected areas of research.  Algebraic statistics exploits algebraic geometry and related fields to solve problems in statistics and its applications. Methods from algebraic statistics have been successfully applied to address many problems including construction of Markov bases for testing goodness of fit of various statistical models, theoretical study of phylogenetic mixture models, ecological inference, identifiability problems for graphical models, Bayesian integrals and singular learning theory, social networks, and coalescent theory. In addition to algebraic statisticsÆ successes in solving statistical problems, its research objectives have driven theoretical developments in algebra. Among other things, as2014 highlighted how algebraic statistics can help people working in diverse areas. For example, data scientists who are interested in development of or research about new tools for data analysis found speakers of interest, as will social scientists who need new tools to analyze social network and other relational data and causal inference. One keynote speaker, Peter Spirtes of Carnegie Mellon University, works on epidemiology, econometrics, sociology and political science. Other keynote speakersÆ topics include Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods in statistics, computational phylogenetics, data ranking problems, reliability analysis, graphical models, random graphs and social networks. The full schedule for the conference, along with titles and abstracts for the talks and posters, is available on the conference information page. The program included 12 plenary talks (one hour, including questions), 16 contributed talks (30 minutes, including questions), an extensive poster session, and a brief open problems session. 60% of the conference attendees were junior researchers and PhD students. Undergraduate and graduate students and faculty members from IIT and other area universities were encouraged to participate.
