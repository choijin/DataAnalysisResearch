<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator (PI) will explore and test a number of hardware platforms and software algorithms whose goal is to facilitate sub-second human-robot synchronization.  To this end the PI will utilize the medium of music, one of the most time-demanding media where accuracy in milliseconds is critical because asynchronous operations of more than 10 ms are noticeable by listeners.  Specifically, the PI will develop up to three different kinds of robotic devices intended to allow a drummer, whose arm was recently amputated from the elbow down, to play and synchronize between his organic functioning arm and the newly developed robotic devices.  In addition, he will develop and investigate the efficiency of novel anticipation algorithms designed to foresee human actions before they take place and trigger robotic actions with low-latency and in a timely manner.  This research will advance our understanding in a variety of areas, including the biomechanics of limb operations, machine-learning techniques for the anticipation and prediction of human gestures, and highly accurate myoelectric robotic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This project will ultimately benefit a large population of amputees whose quality of life could improve through the use of low-latency robotic limbs with sub-second synchronization.  Facilitating such accurate sub-second human-robot synchronization could also improve efficiency and flow in other human-robot interaction scenarios where humans and robots must collaborate to achieve time-demanding common goals.  The novel solenoid-based robotic device(s) created in this research should also benefit musicians in general (that is to say, who are not disabled), who will be able to explore novel drumming techniques and create novel musical results.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A robotic drumming prosthesis was developed to simulate the role of fingers and palm grip for tansradial amputees. The arm utilizes DC brushless motors driven by a variable impedance control framework in a shared control environment. The device allows the amputees to control the  grip tightness of two drum sticks and the manner in which the sticks rebound after initial impact.     The first drumstick embedded in the arm is controlled both physically by the musiciansÆ stump and electronically using electromyography (EMG) muscle sensors attached to the userÆs forearm. The drummerÆs ability to perform with and control the prosthesis was evaluated using a musical synchronization study, which showed that using EEG signal to anticipate drum hits improves time synchronization between prosthesis and biological arm as well between the drummer and his co-players.     The second stick that was embedded in the arm addressed the second objective of the project &ndash; exploring the implications of musical expression and human-robotic interaction when a semi-autonomous prosthesis interacts with the amputee by listening to the acoustic environment and responding through improvisation, pushing the musical capabilities and virtuosity of the user to uncharted territories.     The project has lead to multiple papers submitted including to the Journal of Human Robot Interaction and the Journal of Robotic and Automation, as well an MS Thesis by Deepak Gopniath, the first MS Music Technology student whose thesis in robotic musicianship led to PhD studied in a prestigious robotic program (Northwestern University).     The project was also disseminated through multiple concerts and workshops including the premier at the Bailey Performance Center at KSU, Geek Picnic Festival in St. Petersburg Russia, and the upcoming concert at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC (July 22, 2015) as part of the ADA 25th Anniversary Celebration, which also includes panel participation and workshops.
