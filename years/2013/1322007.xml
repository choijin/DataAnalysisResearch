<AbstractNarration>SES-1322738&lt;br/&gt;Lisa Keister&lt;br/&gt;Duke University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-1322007&lt;br/&gt;Jody Vallejo&lt;br/&gt;University of Southern California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chinese immigrants to the United States and their descendants are a large, growing, and diverse group whose members are following a variety of paths of adaptation. This research asks: what factors account for wealth accumulation patterns for Chinese immigrants, and how can these patterns inform understanding of immigrant adaptation? Chinese immigrants and their descendants are often discussed in terms of their high median levels of achievement, but Chinese Americans vary considerably on education, income, occupation, and labor market mobility. For example, although their median income is high, Chinese Americans are more likely than white natives to live in poverty. Given their size and within-group heterogeneity, this case provides an occasion to study the factors that enhance or impede immigrant adaptation in general. This study will contribute to the immigration literature by providing a detailed within-group study of this important group and by focusing on their wealth (or net worth) accumulation, an important but understudied measure of adaptation. The project has three specific objectives. First, it will provide a detailed portrait of wealth for Chinese immigrants and their children. It will describe wealth ownership for households at all points in the wealth distribution, comparing Chinese Americans with other Americans, other recent immigrants and descendants of immigrants, and other Asians. Second, it will identify unique wealth accumulation trajectories for Chinese immigrants and their American-born children to distinguish patterns of immigrant adaptation. Third, it will assess the degree to which entrepreneurship contributes to wealth accumulation for Chinese immigrants and their children by using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to construct a portrait of Chinese business networks in Southern California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute to research in many academic disciplines including immigration studies, the sociology of race/ethnicity, Chinese American studies, entrepreneurship, stratification and inequality, and economic sociology. This research has the potential to shed new light on an important and growing segment of U.S. society and to broaden understanding of immigration and adaptation processes and pathways more generally. The research is also likely to have important broader social impacts. This proposed research has the potential to inform discussions on immigration, wealth ownership, and inequality. The investigators anticipate disseminating the findings widely, including to non-academics, through publications in non-academic journals, op-ed pieces, and press releases. In addition, the investigators will involve graduate students in all aspects of the research and will draw on the work in their graduate and undergraduate courses on social stratification, immigration, and economic sociology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Wealth is an important indicator of class status and economic incorporation, and immigrant wealth ownership is critical to understanding immigrant mobility, the integration of the immigrant second generation, and global patterns of inequality. We investigate patterns of wealth accumulation among new immigrant groups, how wealth varies by immigrant-entry status, national origin, tenure in the U.S., and cross-border ties, and how these factors affect business ownership in the U.S. Our results reveal grave disparities in wealth between today?s new immigrants. Chinese immigrants have significantly higher net worth than Latino immigrants and native blacks, reflecting selection on education and income status. However, delving within the Chinese immigrant population, we find important differences in wealth owenership by national origin. Immigrants from Hong Kong and Taiwain have higher levels of wealth compared to immigrants from Mainland China due to their hyperselection and economic advantages stemming from home country development. These findings provide important details about the role that within-group heterogeneity among Chinese immigrants may have for their adaptation and long-term class status stability and, thus, answer a growing call from immigration scholars to look more closely at differences within national-origin groups. While there is heterogeneity in wealth among Chinese immigrants, we find a pattern of accelerated economic adaptation, especially for those from HK-T, where wealth exceeds that of native-born whites and blacks, and nearly all other immigrant groups.   Delving further within the Chinese-origin population, we investigate how family wealth, transnational connections, human capital, and educational resources, influence access to capital and entrepreneurial pathways among the Chinese-American first and second generations. We find differences within and between the first and second generation. Among the first generation, class background, education, visa entry category, and current legal status, intersect to stratify entrepreneurial pathways, access to start-up capital, and wealth. High-skill Chinese immigrants who obtain education in the U.S., especially in STEM fields, often begin their careers working for large corporations but eventually venture into business ownership using capital acquired from white-collar occupations. Other Chinese immigrants, especially the wives of high-skill visa holders, choose to start small cash businesses off the books that target a coethnics clientele because their visa status prevents them from employment in the formal labor market. In contrast, second-generation Chinese Americans experience a range of business pathways and access to capital that are structured by family wealth, educational resources, and generational advantages.

Education also plays a role but in ways that matter beyond simply attaining a college degree. Discipline of study and school prestige structures access to information, networks, and funding sources.   Ultimately, our work contributes to the literature on immigrant adaptation and mobility by documenting heterogeneity in wealth ownership and by studying the factors that contribute to wealth accumulation.
