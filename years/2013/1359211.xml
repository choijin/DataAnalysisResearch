<AbstractNarration>This award creates a new NSF REU site focused on climate change and sea level rise (SLR) within the Department of Ocean, Earth and Atmospheric Science (OEAS) at Old Dominion University (ODU), in Norfolk, VA. ODU is located in a coastal urban environment that is directly affected by coastal flooding and hazards.  The PI's will bring 10 students to OEAS each summer for two years to complete a 10 week REU program.  Students will be engaged in research projects in the laboratories of their mentors. To garner a broader understanding of climate science and SLR, students will be informed with lectures from each mentor on their respective research related to urban climate change and SLR and a variety of lab tours and field trips. The PI's will also conduct tutorials on: 1) keeping a proper laboratory notebook, 2) writing a research prospectus, 3) critically reading journal articles, 4) creating effective presentations, and 5) delivering oral and written (e.g., poster) scientific presentations. Students will present their research in a final paper and a symposium.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2014, we were awarded a 2-year REU site program focusing on the very relevant issue of Sea-Level rise and Climate in Metropolitan Coastal Environments.  We initiated the program by development of a web site (https://www.odu.edu/oeas/reu) and advertised the program via direct emails, social media, and through word of mouth with faculty contacts and departmental contacts.  Although given only a short time frame to recruit and select students in our first year, 76% of applicants came from universities with limited undergraduate or graduate research programs  Nine undergraduates from various backgrounds and disciplines were selected, 7 of which came from universities with limited exposure to research opportunities during their undergraduate career. Our REU student cohort consisted of freshmen (1), sophomores (3), and juniors (5). Our students included a cross section of students with majors in meteorology, biology, and marine and aquatic biology. All students developed heir own independent research project with their facuty mentor, conducted field work, executed experiments and/or developed models, evaluated results, and presented findings to the entire OEAS Department at ODU at the end of the summer with a required paper.   During the spring of 2015 and our second year of the REU program, we doubled the number of applicants and accepted 10 students for our summer program.  Through targeted advertisement,  institutional contacts that have already provided excellent students, and social media we obtained applicants ranging from freshmen to juniors with varied research experience (60% acknowledged to having little to no research exposure). With the help of NSF, in 2015 we were also able to include a talented high school student in the program. This student participated in on-going research with an REU student, helping us to broaden the research experience to a younger audience in the surrounding Hampton Roads area.  The range of student projects was diverse:  SUMMER 2014 RESEARCH PROJECTS  The impact of wet atmospheric nutrient deposition on phytoplankton growth and productivity The exploration of the use of dehydrogenase enzyme activity to quantify overall microbial activity Evaluating surface heat fluxes in the Antarctica Ross Sea The effects of wind events on sedimentary nutrient inputs and phytoplankton growth in the lower Chesapeake Bay estuary Atmospheric variability along the Antarctic coast The effects of elevated CO2 levels and nutrient enrichment on the growth and metabolism of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) Polycyclic aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons in Lafayette River sediment and Chesapeake blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus Dissecting the sea level rise signal in the Hampton Roads and Chesapeake Bay area Antibiotic resistance of Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolated from organic marine aggregates   SUMMER 2015 RESEARCH PROJECTS (* a talented high school student as a local participant)  The investigation of coal dust and its transport in the Lafayette River Responses to iron in recent diatom isolates from the Southern Ocean  Improved estimate of 20th century global mean sea level using tide gauge clustering Using iLiDAR to measure water column optical properties Started from the bottom: Sedimentary influence and vertical movement of dinoflagellate communities A comparative study of sediment chemistry as a function of oyster reef presence in the Lafayette river  Contribution of sea surface height changes and subsidence to local sea level changes at the U.S. east and west coasts Sediment as a potential nutrient source fueling algae blooms in the Lafayette River  Eddy length scales in the Ross Sea from observations and a model Antibiotic susceptibility of vibrios isolated from microplastics in the Elizabeth River, Norfolk, Virginia *Analysis of temperature and irradiance measured under the Arctic seasonal ice pack   As part of their program, all of our summer scholars returned to their home institutions ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
