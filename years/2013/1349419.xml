<AbstractNarration>Alaska represents about 20% of the land area of the United States. It hosts diverse assemblages of New World and Old World birds and an endemic regional avifauna. The Bird Collection at the University of Alaska Museum (UAM) is one of growing national and international importance, representing many preparation types that enhance its utility. Additionally, UAM now houses the 8th-largest vouchered avian tissue collection in the world. This collection is rather heavily used, probably because it contains the best (and only modern) bird specimens from this vast region, and supports research in biodiversity, evolutionary history, management, and conservation. It is also used by artists, birdwatchers, social scientists, ecologists, ecosystem biologists, and toxicologists. Thus, the collection informs studies including assessments of contaminants and stable isotopes, climate change, human artifacts and art, and the historic diets of Alaska Natives. These collections contribute to our ability to address large-scale societal challenges such as health, food, and the environment. The collection's impact is exemplified by its citation in at least 115 publications and 28 student theses in recent years, and its Google Scholar profile (UAM Birds) further shows its high impact. The collection also serves as a focus for training and education at undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels, and as a showpiece for public engagement in science. However, the collection is severely overcrowded and is becoming inaccessible as portions are forced into unsorted and substandard housing. Skin, skeleton, and open-wing specimens are inadequately stored, inaccessible to users, and decisions about collection growth now focus on the size of the specimen being considered. These problems severely impact the use of this research resource by its diverse community of users. This project addresses these problems by installing new specimen cabinets on a compactor system and supporting student trainees to work closely with museum staff in rehousing the entire collection and in developing and implementing public outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports infrastructure that is critical to many types of studies requiring avian samples. It will enable the purchase and installation of 92 new specimen cabinets on a new mobile storage system, maximizing the use of space following the museum's expansion and renovation. This cabinet installation will adequately house and make accessible overcrowded specimens and provide room for growth for the next decade. Importantly, this project will train students in collections-based science, thus helping prepare the 21st century STEM workforce. It also engages the public locally and globally in the excitement of biological collections, fostering a better understanding of science and its role in serving society.

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Alaska has the most diverse bird communities of the world&rsquo;s high-latitude regions. Through its &nbsp;size and geographic proximity to Asia, Alaska acts as a nexus for Asia and North America, making its diverse avifauna not only regionally but globally important. Birds come to Alaska to breed from every continent except Europe. This creates a complex web of diverse connections that we are only beginning to understand. The University of Alaska Museum (UAM) bird collection documents this diversity and provides samples for students and researchers from throughout the U.S. and the world. Because this is the only active bird collection in this vast and complex region, it is heavily used. Common research topics include biodiversity, systematics, zoonotic diseases, evolution, management, and conservation. We preserve an array of preparation types, such as skins, skeletons, and tissue samples to enhance the collection&rsquo;s utility. The collection serves as a focus for training and education at undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels, and also as a showpiece for many public exposures to science. The collection is fully computerized, and collections data, loan policies, contact information, and other details are available online.</p> <p>This project addressed a terrible specimen overcrowding problem. We had thousands of bird specimens improperly stored and inaccessible, which was a hazard to long-term preservation and a serious impediment to many researchers. The largest part of the project was to build a compactor system and install new specimen cabinets to provide appropriate housing and space for the collection. Other materials were included for properly archiving skins, skeletons, and open wings, such as archival quality paper and boxes. This project was an excellent opportunity for training students as the next generation of 21<sup>st</sup> century STEM scientists. Student assistants helped with moving cabinets, with moving and rearranging the collections, with rehousing improperly housed specimens, and in personal and online public outreach.</p> <p>In addition to traditional scientific questions, this collection is used by artists, birdwatchers, social scientists, ecologists, ecosystem biologists, and toxicologists for studies ranging from contaminants and stable isotopes to climate change, human artifacts and art, and the historic diets of Alaska Natives. It thus has broad impacts in many areas. These areas include some of society&rsquo;s biggest challenges, such as health, food, and the environment.
