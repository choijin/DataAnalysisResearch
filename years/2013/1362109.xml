<AbstractNarration>The objectives of the proposed RAPID project are to deploy an array of five moored ocean current, salinity, temperature, and two subsurface pressure sensors across the 200-400 m deep Norske Ore Trough in the summer of 2014 from aboard the R/V Polarstern, a German research icebreaker.  The proposed array will observe the circulation within this channel system at dynamically relevant time and space scales.  Ultimately, the recovered data will be used to test the hypothesis that a clock-wise shelf circulation off north-east Greenland between 76N and 82N latitude provides warm Atlantic waters towards one of the last remaining stable floating ice-shelves in Greenland (Niog-halvfjerdsfjorden Gletscher called 79N Glacier) via a 20-40 km wide system of troughs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Degradation of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets is a major contributor to global sea level rise.  One cause of the accelerating degradation of these ice sheets is believed to be the transport of heat from the continental slope to the face of tidewater glaciers.  Models and qualitative arguments suggest that this transport is enhanced by cross-shelf channels that minimize mixing of the transported waters with cold, ambient shelf waters.  This project is an attempt to observe the importance of such transport mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funded activities support a nascent international collaboration.  The resultant data set will add to both public and scientific debate related to climate change.  Public outreach and engagement will be facilitated via http://IcySeas.org, a research blog established and maintained by the PI as part of NSF?s ?Science: Becoming the Messenger? program.</AbstractNarration>

Yes, air temperatures continue to increase, but what does it matter, if those temperatures are above freezing most of the time. What if the ocean does most of the melting a few 100 m below the surface rather than the air above? It means that gut feelings and everyday experiences can be poor guides for science, it means that there is more than meets the eye, and it means that some of GreenlandÃ†s melting happens out of sight entirely without the dramatic imagery of a rapidly disintegrating glacier that sends icebergs out to sea.  [Figure-1]  In order to "see" where changes may happen out of sight American tax payers supported me via the National Science Foundation (NSF) to use available University of Delaware ocean sensors from an available German ship to investigate the ocean near two large glaciers off north-east Greenland. The sensors are in the water for over a year now and will stay there for another to collect data every half hour. The data are stored on computers inside the sensors and it is a marvel of smart engineering that we can measure water temperature, salinity, and velocity at the bottom of an ice-covered ocean. Now what would I do with such data?  [Figure-2]  First, one needs to know that in the Arctic Ocean temperature increases as one moves a thermometer from the surface towards the bottom for the first 900 feet or 300 meters. This only make sense, if the warm water is heavier than the cold water above. This is the case in the Arctic, however, because the warm water at depth is also very salty.

The surface waters contain sea ice and its fresh melt water and thus are always close to the freezing point, so lets call them Polar Waters.   [Figure-3]  All along the East Coast of Greenland, we find a strong southward flow of ice and Polar Water called the East Greenland Current. On a rare clear day one can "see" this flow as a beautifully structured undulating band separating the deep Greenland Sea from the shallow and broad continental shelves.

Such sloping contours represent a flow out of the page at km-80 and into the page at km-10 which is exactly the opposite of what I expected.
