<AbstractNarration>Working with a team of industry partners, this project is developing four competency-based stackable credentials that lead to a new Associate Degree in Analytical and Quality Technology (AQT) at Mount Wachusett Community College.   The project is preparing diverse, rural community college students for employment in quality-related jobs in biopharmaceutical and biomedical device manufacturing.  Products being developed include curriculum modules, stackable certificates, and a capstone course.   Through short duration programs with contextualized and successively increasing levels of content that ultimately stack into certificate and Associate degree programs, the stackable approach provides flexible technical education entry points to students with varying levels of preparation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The AQT curriculum is being established in a modular format and incorporated into credit-bearing courses and is also being prepared for integration into non-credit workforce training courses to meet specific needs of students and incumbent workers. Students who complete non-credit training receive credit when all modules associated with a credit-bearing course are satisfactorily completed. A capstone course is being developed that integrates time spent in class and industry-based experiences. This course reinforces student competencies and enhances job opportunities for graduates through industry internships and exposure to the workplace via industry guest speakers, industry tours, trade shows and professional meetings, and targeted industry research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project is establishing an integrated technical education and workforce training program that responds to critical employment demands in a region of the country with an exceptionally high concentration of biopharmaceutical and biomedical device manufacturing. This effort builds on the Ohio Stackable Certificates Initiative and utilizes the modular curriculum delivery process developed therein. The evaluation effort employs the Kirkpatrick four levels model of evaluation to monitor the processes and outcomes of project objectives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The industry-informed curriculum development is designed to meet the technical workforce demands of regional employers, including the need to advance incumbent worker skills. It will promote diversity in the technical workforce by creating opportunities for diverse, rural students and unemployed workers in need of educational opportunities to reenter the workforce. The curriculum developed for the AQT associate degree program serves as a model for other institutions to adopt and implement. Dissemination activities include writing a technical paper, giving presentations at conferences, providing access of the curriculum to all Massachusett's community colleges, and making all curricular content available online.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary outcome of this Project is the development of a set of modular curriculum that introduces and builds upon content addressing Quality Systems.  The result is a series of training and education programs that provide career pathways for individuals in a variety of industries including biopharmaceutical processing and advanced manufacturing.  The products were developed to address employer-identified skills gaps and provide multiple entry and exit points for students.  All curriculum was developed with specific Student Learning Outcomes incorporated and aligned with pathways to certification and/or college credit.  Mount Wachusett Community College continues use of the curriculum through ongoing programs, sharing with other institutions and expanded it in partnership with three other community colleges in Massachusetts.  The project also provided access to the curriculum to secondary school students through dual enrollment and outreach activities.              The first level of curriculum was developed as part of a pre-employment / college bridge program entitled Industry Readiness Training.  The content comprised 12 hours of Quality Systems in 4 modules and 8 hours of Measurement Tools in 3 modules.  The content provides an introduction to Quality and Measurement.  Student knowledge was measured through pre- and post-testing and the Quality and Measurement portion of the Manufacturing Skills Standard Council Certified Production Technician Training.  Student Learning Outcomes for this content include:      &bull;          Explain how a quality system is implemented.  &bull;           Recognize and apply good documentation practices.  &bull;           Explain the cost-of-quality.  &bull;           Describe how inspection processes are used.                 The second level of curriculum is a 40-hour Quality Systems Training program.  Students completing this program are prepared to sit for the American Society for Quality Certified Quality Improvement Associate examination and the Challenge Exam for AQS 115 (described below).  Students successfully completing this program will be able to:  &bull;           Recognize and distinguish ISO 9001:2015 and FDA 21CFR Quality Management Systems.  &bull;           Recognize and distinguish the roles and responsibilities of Quality Assurance and Quality Control personnel in organizations.  &bull;           Understand and describe auditing principles.  &bull;           Identify and apply sampling methods, inspection measurement and test equipment as quality control techniques.  &bull;           Understand and describe metrology and calibration concepts.  &bull;           Recognize and understand how basic quality tools are used for continuous improvement.              The third level of curriculum includes the creation of credit coursework and the establishment of a one year credit certificate (Analytical Laboratory and Quality Systems; 29 credits) and an Associate degree (Biotechnology/Biomanufacturing Quality; 61 credits).   These programs include newly developed courses whose learning objectives are presented below.  AQS110 Introduction to Metrology     Students learn the fundamentals of Metrology including procedures and processes to control and evaluate quality. Includes measurements and associated error/uncertainty, calibration, statistical process control tools, lean six sigma practices and quality assurance/control concepts.  AQS115 Quality Systems and Auditing Principles     Students learn the components of a quality system.  The ISO library of standards and auditing principles is explored. Students learn to identify standards and demonstrate their knowledge using auditing tools. Students learn about the formal audit cycle: scope, preparation, performing the audit, reporting and follow-up actions.  AQS200 Root Cause Analysis                       Students learn problem solving methods used in industry to investigate and correct issues faced in a real-world setting. The student will apply the tools, analyze the data and evaluate the results to demonstrate an understanding of root cause analysis.  This course serves as a capstone class for the Associate degree.  CHE180          Instrumental Analysis             This course provides an introduction to the use of instruments a Laboratory Quality Technician will encounter. The fundamentals of using instrumentation to measure chemical properties and concentrations is covered, including sample preparation, calibration, and data analysis. The lab portion provides hands-on experience with a variety of different analytical chemistry techniques and instruments, as well as physical measurements.              The final set of curriculum developed comprises two short term non-credit trainings for employees looking to expand their skill set.  This was done in partnership with an area employer, Masy Bioservices.  The focus of these trainings were Calibration and Validation and each were presented as a 10-hour, 4 class format.              In addition to curriculum development, a major objective of the Project connected prospective students with career pathways in the area of Quality Systems, especially those from diverse backgrounds.  The AQS110 Introduction to Metrology course was provided to students from Worcester Technical High School, an urban school with a diverse student base.  Students received coursework at their school as well as coming to the Mount Wachusett campus for laboratory exercises.  In addition to this effort, numerous outreach events were held both at the MWCC Devens campus and throughout the college service area.  This included Career EXPO events attended by high school students where Quality professionals described their work, as well as company tours and classroom demonstrations.
