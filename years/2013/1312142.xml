<AbstractNarration>The proposal investigates, theoretically and numerically, a wide spectrum of particle's systems found in various applications. The dimension of those systems is proportional to the number of particles involved which can be quite large, up to 10^{25} in some settings. This makes them too complex to analyze and too costly to solve numerically. However a key feature of those large systems is their multiscale nature: It makes the dynamics extremely complex at the microscopic level of an individual particle. But it can also lead to a drastic reduction in the complexity of the system by approximating it at the mesoscopic or macroscopic level with PDE's in lower dimensions; the main difficulty in that case is the study and control of the correlations between particles. A classical example is the usual mean field limit problem for kinetic equations in statistical physics for which the investigator will develop novel techniques in order to handle singular potentials. New extensions will be investigated as well in order to push beyond the classical framework, including bacterial suspensions, mean field games models and applications to social sciences (consensus formation...). The bacterial suspensions under study have a relatively high number density with hence non negligible correlations between the particles or bacteria. The investigator and collaborators introduce a new numerical scheme to calculate those correlations. In the case of mean field games, in addition of "classical" interactions between the particles or agents, a control on the dynamics is optimized by a central agent. The usual techniques, propagation of chaos on the joint law for instance, are no more applicable and we develop a new approach, based on the minimization of  N and 1 agent energies.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Systems with a very large number of particles are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Indeed depending on the context and the model, the term "particle" may represent very different objects; in the scope of this project, a particle could for instance be as "simple" as an electron or ion (particles in a plasma), or more complex like a bacteria, an economical or social agent or even a very large structure like a galaxy (dynamics of clusters in astrophysics). Reducing the complexity of such large systems, for instance by approximating them by Partial Differential Equations, is a critical step to be able to use them (numerical simulations...).  The project will contribute to the understanding of this phenomenon for a few important applications: the classical framework of statistical physics, suspensions of bacteria with critical density, multi-agent systems in economy and consensus formation. The project also has a direct impact on the education and future careers of graduate students and will also involve undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Models based on large systems of particles are now widely used in very diverse settings. Particles     can represent many different objects: In Physics they can     represent ions and electrons in plasmas, or molecules in a fluid, or     even galaxies in some cosmological models; in the Biosciences     particles typically model micro-organisms (cells or bacteria); in     Economics or Social Sciences, particles are individual ``agents''.  While the underlying microscopic interactions are often conceptually simple, such systems are analytically and computationally very complex due to the large number of particles or agents; from sometimes only 10^3-10^4 in some models in Social Sciences, to 10^12 in the Biosciences and up to 10^25 in typical physical settings.  The main challenge in the project was to reduce the     complexity of such systems by understanding how the transport of the     particles may amplify correlations between them.     A first classical approach to this reduction in complexity is the so-called mean field limit. Those consists in reducing the system to a macroscopic set of equations, which can easily be studied or simulated numerically, by proving that correlations between particles remain negligible.  The traditional technique to prove this consists in following the trajectory of each particle. But this requires some strong regularity (typically so-called Lipschitz regularity in mathematical terms) on the interaction between particles; so that a small error in  the position of one particle will not modify the dynamics. Unfortunately many important examples (the two-dimensional vortex dynamics in physics to quote only one) are not compatible with such regularity assumption.  The project has hence introduced a completely new perspective by considering instead the statistical properties of the cloud of particles. This is represented at the level of the so-called Liouville equation. The Liouville eqquation is an equation in large dimension on the joint law of the particles which contains all the information about the correlations between them but does not directly see individual trajectories.The Liouville equation had so far been considered untractable and using it in the project was only made possible by several new ideas such as critical entropy estimates coupled with new laws of large numbers at the right scale.  With those new techniques, this change of point of view allowed us to derive the mean field limit with very few assumptions on the interactions, thus opening many important cases to the analysis for the first time. Just as importantly for applications, we are able to obtain explicit error bounds to compare the original system to the approximate, macroscopic set of equations.     Our better understanding of the propagation of correlations also proved critical in settings where the density of particles is too large to apply the mean field limit. In that case, one cannot anymore neglect the correlations between the particles and instead those correlations are essential to the properties of the system. One of our main motivation here was a set of experiments on self-propelled micro-organisms, i.e. swimming bacteria, that show a reduction in the viscosity of the bio-fluid when the density of bacteria is large enough.

We were, as a consequence, able to show for the first time that some models are in fact well behaved even though they are not thermodynamically stable because oscillations persist at the thermodynamical equilibrium.
