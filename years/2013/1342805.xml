<AbstractNarration>Relationships among flowering plants and insects represent one of the great engines of terrestrial diversity. Plant scents are important drivers of these relationships (herbivory, plant defense, pollination), but remain poorly integrated into our understanding of floral evolution and pollination ecology. This study examines the role of floral scent in the diversification of the western North American evening primroses (Onagraceae) and their pollinators (hawkmoths, bees) and floral and seed predators (Mompha moths). Hypotheses that integrate across the genetic, phylogenetic, and functional dimensions of biodiversity are developed from the Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution, which posits that variation in plant-animal interactions across the distribution of a species creates shifting evolutionary trajectories that drive local diversification. The research examines functional trait variation and selective forces in the field and experimental arrays, the genetic basis of the variation from the population to phylogenetic level using comparative genomics, and patterns of phylogenetic diversity in Onagraceae and Mompha. Mompha is a poorly understood genus that is the only known lepidopteran group to specialize on Onagraceae.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few studies have tested the full spectrum of plant fitness outcomes when volatiles attract both mutualists and enemies, and no current studies have investigated scent-driven, geographic diversification in groups of interacting organisms. The hidden diversity of floral and seed predators and their potential as selective agents constitutes a considerable gap in pollinator-centric understanding of floral evolution. The integration of chemical ecology and comparative genomics provides a first attempt to explore the impact of past selective pressures on current patterns of diversity in non-model organisms. Additionally, the investigators will engage over 200 students (high school - graduate school, interns, and postdocs) in field work, experiments, and genomics/informatics activities. Private and public land owners and volunteers will participate in and/or be informed of conservation-focused components of this study.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project centered on exploring how chemically-mediated interactions between flowering plants, pollinators, and enemies affect diversification at population, species and higher levels. Specifically, the focus was a group of plants within the Evening primrose family (Onagraceae), which has proven to be a valuable system in which to study plant-insect interactions and the drivers of variation in floral morphology and fragrance.  This project moved beyond traditional approaches to better understand evolutionary relationships across the plant family.  At a finer scale, almost all species across tribe Onagreae were included to understand relationships among these mostly North American species.  Intense sampling within groups of closely related species allowed inference of phylogeographic relationships and infer pollinator shifts, as well as shifts in other traits of interest.   With field research in diverse geographic locations across western North America, this research has generated thousands of new collections including seeds and leaf material, as well as contributing accessions for deposition in herbaria.  Additionally, this research developed extensive genomic resources including genome-wide data.  These data include broad sampling across Onagraceae, intensive sampling of almost all species within tribe Onagreae, and more focused studies of the small section Pachylophus, within which there has been a single shift from outcross pollination to self-pollination, as well as evidence for speciation of range-restricted species from more widespread species due to local environmental specialization.  The intellectual merit of this work lies in its significant contributions to the study of the Evening Primrose family and the larger scientific community via the development of genomic resources for use in evolutionary and phylogeographic studies.  This research has importantly contributed significantly to undergraduate education and training by involving diverse students at various stages of their careers in all aspects of the project, including summer research at the Chicago Botanic Garden, attendance at professional meetings to present their research, and co-authorship of publications.  Students were trained in fragrance collection, comparative transcriptomics, bioinformatics, phylogenomics, and plant-herbivore assays. These students have gone on to graduate school, veterinary school, and research technician positions.             Last Modified: 01/02/2020       Submitted by: Rachel A Levin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
