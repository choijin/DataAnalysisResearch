<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Chicago, located in Chicago, IL, will support the training of 8 students for 10 weeks, during the summers of 2014-2016. The program offers research training to improve understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the organization, development and mechanics of all living organisms. The Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology has about 20 faculty members participating as mentors. The projects available in their laboratories are wide-ranging but all are focused on cutting edge research, using a variety of model organisms including viruses, bacteria, yeast, protozoa, fruit flies, plants, and nematode worms, and involving both biological manipulation and observation, and mathematical modeling. The 8 students each summer will engage in full-time lab research as well as participate in seminars and focused workshops on responsible conduct in research and scientific ethics, on how to prepare for advanced training in biological sciences, and on professional communication skills. REU students have access to the individual mentor's facilities as well as many core facilities such as advanced light microscopy, electron microscopy and tomography, next-generation DNA sequencing, and flow cytometry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will be recruited to the program, particularly from disadvantaged groups, including through established informal collaborative agreements with a variety of undergraduate colleges. The program is focused on students attending institutions with limited research opportunities. Students are selected on the basis of their academic record and perceived potential for outstanding research, with preference given to those between their junior and senior years. Faculty mentors remain in contact with students after the program to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of the BIO REU common assessment tool. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://mgcb.bsd.uchicago.edu/reu/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Aaron Turkewitz at apturkew@uchicago.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Lucia Rothman-Denes at lbrd@uchicago.edu).</AbstractNarration>
