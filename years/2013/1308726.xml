<AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports the research of Professors Weile Yan and Moira K. Ridley both at Texas Tech University who will investigate the surface chemistry of iron-enriched silica and alumina surfaces and their catalytic reactivity towards model contaminants in water. The researchers will take a multi-pronged approach to examine the surface and material chemistry of iron-enriched mineral surfaces using a suite of surface and solid characterization techniques, including HR-XPS, ATR-FTIR, TEM, AFM, and XRD. Additionally, solid-solution potentiometric titrations and surface complexation modeling (SCM) will be performed. This combination will establish an understanding of the surface coverage, nature of dispersion, chemical state, and coordination environment of iron attached to alumina and silica surfaces. Oxidative transformations of model contaminants mediated by these iron-enriched surfaces will be investigated. Findings from this study will provide fundamental insights into the relationship between surface chemistry and the reactivity of iron-impregnated alumina and silica surfaces and the role of these reactive interfaces in contaminant degradation and redox cycling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will integrate research and education in two closely related disciplines, Environmental Engineering and Geosciences, by involving students in cross-disciplinary research and by introducing the topic of interfacial aqueous geochemistry in formal courses. Students will be trained in both experimental and computational techniques, thereby building a well-rounded foundation critically needed by the next generation of environmental professionals and educators. Additionally, outreach activities will extend to supporting university-sponsored summer science camps for girls in 5th through 11th grades, and providing students at Angelo State University (ASU), a minority-serving institution in the TTU system, an early exposure to ENVE and Geosciences trainings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research project generated the following major outcomes.    The research team conducted detailed characterizations of Fe-laden silica and alumina colloids, which were chosen as mimics of natural colloids. Following that, the catalytic activity of these colloids was examined in different oxidation systems (peroxide and persulfate). This led to the following findings. First, it was concluded that the structure of surface Fe casts a strong influence on its redox activity. The dispersed, monomeric Fe species is the most active at converting hydrogen peroxide to hydroxyl radical, while the polymerized Fe species tend to decompose hydrogen peroxide to nonreactive products (water and oxygen). The speciation of Fe is dependent on the nature of the mineral substrate and the deposition history. At equal aqueous concentrations, Fe deposited on TiO2 is more active than that on SiO2 or Al2O3 particles.  Furthermore, deposition of ferrous ion (Fe(II)) followed by surface oxidation generates more active species than direct deposition of Fe(III).  Overall, these results provide new insights into the genesis of reactive Fe surface in the aqueous environment.  As a continuation of the above project, experiments involving peroxide activation by Fe(III)-enriched colloids for As(III) oxidation were conducted. This effort specifically looked at Fe(III)-enriched particles arising in a typical coagulation process. The data showed that the colloidal particles generated during Fe(III) coagulation process have significant catalytic activity to transform molecular oxygen (O2) or hydrogen peroxide to reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS can efficiently oxidize trivalent arsenic (the more mobile and toxic form of arsenic) to pentavalent arsenic. The outcome presents a new approach to the removal of arsenic from drinking water sources and it points out the inherent catalytic activity embedded in the conventional coagulation process, which was largely overlooked in prior studies.

The interaction of H2O at or near the surface, H-bonding, Bader charge analysis, 1-D density profiles, and vibrational density of states were evaluated. This simulation results would be used to understand Al2O3dissolution in water and the latter would be incorporated into a comprehensive surface complexation model for Al2O3 or other minerals of environmental interest.
