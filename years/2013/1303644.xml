<AbstractNarration>This awards sustains sampling of the upper Arctic Ocean water properties through all seasons using Ice-Tethered Profiler (ITP) instruments. Studies conducted over the last decade indicate that the Arctic is both a sensitive indicator of climate change and an active driver of climate variability. As evidenced by the strikingly low summer sea ice extent estimates recorded since August 2007 and large anomalies in liquid fresh water content (manifested by upper-ocean salinity), significant changes in the Arctic appear to be underway now. It is critical that we continue to observe the Arctic during this time of rapid evolution to quantify the physical changes that are occurring, to better understand their causes, and to assess their impacts on the Arctic Ocean climate system. We will construct and deploy 6 ITP instrument systems annually throughout the Arctic Ocean to acquire, process and make the data from these instruments freely and immediately available to all interested parties to support science and operational activities via our project web site, the GTS and the Argo float program data assembly centers.  Improvements to sensor design and added variables will be tested during deployments to increase the platform lifetime and expand the measurement suite on board the ITP.  On-going partnerships with European and Japanese investigators employing the WHOI ITP and other similar instruments holds promise for continued broad spatial coverage of the Arctic. We will continue to use the ITP program to support outreach activities designed for both specialized and general audiences including giving briefings to teachers, science journalists, policy makers and operational groups, contributing to museum presentations, making school visits and continuing to evolve our project web site http://www.whoi.edu/itp .</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Progress developing understanding of the Arctic's coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean system has been hindered by a lack of data, particularly of the ocean below sea ice. Addressing this observational gap, the Ice-Tethered Profiler instrument system (ITP) was conceived to repeatedly sample the properties of the ice-covered Arctic Ocean at high vertical and temporal resolution over extended time (see accompanying figures). With funding provided from the U.S. National Science Foundation's Arctic Observing Network (AON) program, the ITP principal investigators are working together with fellow North American, European and Asian investigators to maintain an array of ITPs and other similar instruments throughout the ice-covered Arctic. It is hoped that the analysis of data from these instruments will lead to better appreciation of the Arctic Ocean's response to, and role in global climate change. The present grant supported the construction and deployment of a total of 20 ITP systems over the 2015 to 2019 period, the recovery and distribution of the raw observations from these instruments in near real time, the calibration, editing and creation of science quality data products, and submission of the data to national centers for archival and general distribution (in parallel with the project's website www.whoi.edu). The WHOI ITP program is the product of many technical support personnel drawn from all ranks, including junior engineers and technicians, students and young investigators. Experience gained by those younger individuals through the ITP program broadens their skill sets and general oceanographic knowledge. Data deriving from the ITP program are freely distributed to researchers and students the world over. An increasing number of student, postdoc and junior-scientist research papers and dissertations build on data from the program. Over the duration of this grant, more than 100 peer-reviewed papers that utilize ITP observations have been published.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/01/2020<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;M&nbsp;Toole</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1303644/1303644_10294340_1584972841051_fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1303644/1303644_10294340_1584972841051_fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The ITP system"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1303644/1303644_10294340_1584972841051_fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The ITP system"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic drawing of the Ice-Tethered Profiler system (left) and photograph of an ITP underwater vehicle being mounted on its tether (right).</div> <div class="imageCredit">WHOI</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">John&nbsp;M&nbsp;Toole</div> <div class="imageTitle">The ITP system</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1303644/1303644_10294340_1584972968277_fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1303644/1303644_10294340_1584972968277_fig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Installed ITP system"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1303644/1303644_10294340_1584972968277_fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Installed ITP system"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Photograph of an Ice-Tethered Profiler system installed on an ice floe in the Arctic.
