<AbstractNarration>The latitudinal gradient in species diversity is one of the most striking biogeographic patterns in nature, with species richness peaking in equatorial regions for nearly all groups. Despite considerable effort to understand the origin and maintenance of latitudinal gradients in species diversity, a multitude of potentially interacting, non-mutually exclusive hypotheses exist, and no single over-riding explanation has emerged. However, multiple hypotheses link the latitudinal diversity gradient to a presumed gradient in the strength of biotic interactions between temperate and tropical environments. While biotic interactions are believed to play a major role in the origin and maintenance of diversity and may drive increased rates of adaptation and speciation in tropical regions, this hypothesis remains virtually untested. To bridge this gap, a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary mechanisms underlying adaptive phenotypic variation in color, vision, and smell across a rapidly diversifying lineage of butterflies will be performed together with field-studies. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Understanding the ecological and evolutionary processes that shape temporal and spatial patterns of biodiversity is a central goal of biology, and an increasingly important facet of the endangered species management, particularly in a time of rapid global climate change. This proposal links biodiversity researchers across the US and Latin America, and will lead to sustained international collaboration; broadened access to STEM fields for women and minorities through targeted recruitment; substantial employment opportunities across institutions and countries; and an enhanced public understanding of biodiversity science and threats to global biodiversity.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overall goal of my lab's work on this grant was to gather an extensive dataset on biotic interactions of <em>Adelpha</em> butterflies to test the extent to which biotic interactions drive diversification in this species-rich insect lineage. We met this goal by collecting data to directly measure the intensity of biotic interactions such as predation, competition, parasitism and niche breadth of adults and immature stages in the field at sites spanning a temperate to tropical gradient from California to Costa Rica to Ecuador.</p> <p>For adult <em>Adelpha</em>, we gathered data on habitat use and abundance in California and Costa Rica to inform studies on predation, competition and niche breadth. We gathered data using traps baited with rotten shrimp or banana, positioned in the canopy (10-25m) and understory (~1m), as well as hand-held aerial nets. Traps were outfitted with data loggers that recorded temperature and light, and vegetation structure was measured near each trap. Data from two sites in California demonstrated the importance of predation in survivorship of a palatable Batesian mimic <em>Limenitis lorquini</em> when the unpalatable model <em>Adelpha californica</em> was very abundant or relatively rare (Kristiansen, E. et. al. 2018). Our abundance data in Costa Rica was used to demonstrate the role of predation in another paper comparing predation rates on artificial model butterflies in Costa Rica and Ecuador. We demonstrated that the putative mimic <em>A. serpa</em> has lower survivorship in Costa Rica where the abundance of the model <em>A. iphiclus</em> is similar to the mimic, whereas in Ecuador the survivorship of <em>A. serpa</em> is similar to <em>A. iphiclus</em> when the model <em>A. iphiclus</em> is much more abundant (Finkbeiner, S. D. et. al. 2018). Natural history observations suggest that adult flower feeding could be an additional mechanism for obtaining unpalatability (Hill &amp; Mullen 2019). In addition, the trap data are being used in conjunction with data collected by colleagues in Ecuador to investigate niche breadth across latitudes to directly examine niche breadth. The masters thesis of L. Prusa illustrated how the dynamics of microhabitat use by mimic <em>L. lorquini </em>fits predictions of Batesian mimicry by being less abundant, being present for a shorter time, flying shorter distances, and using fewer microhabitats, compared to the model <em>A. californica</em>.</p> <p>For <em>Adelpha</em> immatures, we gathered data on habitat use, host plant use, and parasitism rates in Costa Rica and Ecuador to understand competition, parasitism and the role of host use in diversification. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of key <em>Adelpha</em> species, we demonstrated an increased diversification rate associated with a switch to the hostplant family Rubiaceae (Ebel, E. R. et. al. 2015). Further work on this topic has uncovered 50 new <em>Adelpha</em>-host interactions including two new host families, nine new genera and 42 new species. Host and immature stage information was documented for seven <em>Adelpha</em> species for the first time. Examples of this include <em>Adelpha</em><em> naxia</em> described from Costa Rica (Rush, C.<sup> </sup>&amp; R. I. Hill. 2017), a country where extensive work has already been done, and <em>Adelpha attica</em> in Ecuador (Torres, K. et. al. 2019). The masters thesis of C. Rush investigated mitochondrial DNA and morphology in <em>A. serpa</em> to test whether this generalist species that feeds on more than 10 different host families contains multiple "cryptic" species. She did not find strong evidence of multiple species in<em> A. serpa,</em> but did find interesting patterns suggesting species level differences within close relatives. Data are currently being analyzed indicating that parasitism rates are higher in Ecuador consistent with predictions that biotic interactions are more intense at the equator.&nbsp;</p> <p>Broader impacts from my lab as a result of this grant are centered on education of undergraduate and graduate students, and K-12 students in Stockton, California, as well as the extensive data sets produced. The Department of Biological Sciences at University of the Pacific has a strong commitment to involving undergraduates in research, and 35 undergraduates received training working directly with the data collected during this support. Four undergraduates conducted extensive summer field research (2-3 months in the field) giving them vital experience for the biodiversity work force. Graduate students also received vital field experience, with nine students working on projects or data related to the grant. Three masters theses were made possible by field collected data. In addition, Hill facilitated analysis modules on color pattern and abiotic data analysis in his Methods in Field Biology class, exposing 48 undergraduate students to data products and methodology of the grant. In addition, students from multiple 2<sup>nd</sup>-3<sup>rd</sup> grade classes at Don Riggio Elementary School in Stockton participated in activities exploring insect morphology, diversity and butterfly mimicry. Finally, with the help of the undergraduates mentioned above, the curated datasets on <em>Adelpha</em> morphology, behavior, microhabitat and host plant breadth, are available for analysis and will continue to provide insights into the evolution of this very diversity lineage of insects.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/18/2019<br>      Modified by: Ryan&nbsp;I&nbsp;Hill</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1342706/1342706_10277349_1576705239301_RIMG7353--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1342706/1342706_10277349_1576705239301_RIMG7353--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Adelpha iphiclus"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1342706/1342706_10277349_1576705239301_RIMG7353--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Adelpha iphiclus"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Adelpha iphiclus individual "423" trapped with rotten shrimp in understory trap in Costa Rica.</div> <div class="imageCredit">R.I.Hill and D.Villegas</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ryan&nbsp;I&nbsp;Hill</div> <div class="imageTitle">Adelpha iphiclus</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1342706/1342706_10277349_1576697528601_Prusa_fieldwork--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1342706/1342706_10277349_1576697528601_Prusa_fieldwork--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Mark-recapture field work."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1342706/1342706_10277349_1576697528601_Prusa_fieldwork--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Mark-recapture field work."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">L.
