<AbstractNarration>This research is focused on the atmosphere-biosphere exchange of nitrogen compounds in the environment. The emphasis is on nitrogen compounds in forests and areas with abundant plant material. Forests can emit volatile organic gases, known as biogenic emissions, that can react and condense to form very small particles, known as secondary organic aerosol. This project includes laboratory studies to identify the chemical reactions of the biogenic emissions that can occur in the presence of nitrogen compounds. The results will improve models that predict air quality and climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory flux measurements will focus on investigating the fate of nitrogen species as they are emitted from the plant/forest canopy to the free atmosphere and the chemical, physical, and/or biological mechanisms for the formation of oxidized compounds. Data from the SAS campaign, held in Alabama in the summer of 2013, will be analyzed with the use of chemical transport models and compared with data from other field campaigns. The resulting information will provide a comparison of the sources and sinks of nitrogen species, the observations of oxidation products and secondary organic aerosol, and the influence of anthropogenic emissions on the concentration and distribution of oxidized species. Finally, laboratory experiments will be conducted in the Caltech chamber to improve understanding of the production of organic nitrate from the oxidation of isoprene and other compounds produced from biogenic emissions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The nitrogen oxides, NO and NO2, are major players in the chemistry of the atmosphere. They control the rates of many processes, contribute to the formation of acid rains, and when they end up as excess, nitrate in water contributes to contaminated drinking water, and more broadly to eutrophication, dead zones and other ecological problems. In this research project we studied pathways by which NO and NO2 enter and exit the atmosphere and the chemistry that occurs while the molecules reside in the atmosphere. We showed that: 1) Emissions of nitrogen oxides associated biological process in soils have a temperature dependent signature that can be observed in the atmosphere and that contributes to more frequent large scale episodes of high ozone when it is hot. 2) Outside cities, the primary chemical pathway for deactivating NO and NO2 is formation of an organic nitrate, of the form CH3ONO2, or more generally, RONO2. In most cases the organic, R, is derived from a molecule emitted by forests. These molecules are formed rapidly on the continent and their formation and removal set the terms of the background chemistry against which we should measure the role of human perturbations. and finally, 3) we showed that one example tree species removes NO2 from the atmosphere while it is photosynthesizing. It does so, rapidly affecting the time NO2 spends in the atmosphere and dramatically reducing the extent to which NO and NO2 rising into the air as a result of soil biochemistry passes through the forest into the free atmosphere above. Taken together these new results and ideas support a qualitative assessment that the dominant features of the chemistry of NO and NO2 are controlled by the Earth?s biosphere and the details of the research provide a more quantitative window into the life cycle of atmospheric NOx.
