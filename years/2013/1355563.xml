<AbstractNarration>Through this S-STEM project, the University of Saint Mary (USM) is supporting a total of 14 academically talented students with financial need who are majoring in biology, chemistry, or mathematics through scholarships and a coordinated set of student support structures.  The project goals of increasing the number of students enrolled in these majors at USM by 16%, increasing the retention rates in these programs by 12%, and graduating 80% of the Scholars within four years align with the workforce needs in the Kansas City area and statewide. Moreover, USM is leveraging partnerships with local industries to engage students through monthly lecture series, service learning projects, and coordinated internship opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;USM is implementing a holistic set of evidence-based interventions and practices shown to increase retention and success, including as a two-semester First Year Experience program that incorporates service learning projects and develops students' study, critical thinking, and writing skills, tutoring, and peer review sessions.  Scholars also participate in bi-weekly individual advising and cohort meetings and professional development activities, which are intended to support student success.  Formal structures that provide scholars opportunities to participate in research or internships are expected to increase the retention of the scholars and provide career preparation.  These professional development and research-oriented activities are strategies for the project to achieve the goal that 75% of Scholars are employed in a STEM field or enter a STEM graduate program within one year of graduation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of the University of Saint Mary&prime;s Aspire to Succeed project were to:  1.     Recruit 7 academically talented yet financially needy S-STEM Scholars for the academic year 2015-16 and another seven for 2016-17.  Results: 15 academically talented students with financial need in USM&prime;s math, chemistry, or biology programs received aid and have graduated.  A further two students still have 1 year until graduation; one of these has received 4 years of funding and the other is a replacement scholar (a few students graduated in 3 or 3.5 years, leaving extra funds to distribute).  2.     Mentor those students through their undergraduate studies.  Results: 23 scholars have been recipients of S-STEM awards under  &Prime;Aspire to Succeed&Prime;. Six left the program after 1 to 3 semesters, either voluntarily or having been dismissed because of poor academic performance. The graduation rate, assuming that the two S-STEM Scholars with a year to go graduate, is thus 17/23 (74%).  3.     Place those students into STEM employment or STEM graduate programs.  Results: Of the 15 scholarship recipients who have already graduated, 10 are in STEM graduate programs and three are employed in a STEM field.  Thus, even before the 1-year post-graduation target date, 13/15 (87%) of scholarship recipients that have graduated are employed in a STEM field or are in a STEM graduate program. Of note, one is teaching science in middle school. Two students will take one more year to graduate.   An array of programmatic features were available to the STEM scholars including i) a STEM cohort model, ii) STEM service-learning projects, iii) monthly one-on-one and group mentoring, iv) peer-review sessions before critical science and math assignments, v) science and math tutoring, and vi) faculty-supervised semester-long and summer research opportunities.  The program also implemented i) a monthly Lunchtime Lecture Series, during which regional STEM industry leaders met with S-STEM scholars, ii) GRE preparation, iii) an annual USM research forum, iv) increased student participation in professional STEM conferences, v) STEM internship opportunities, and vi) STEM field trips.
