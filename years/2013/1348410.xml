<AbstractNarration>The underrepresentation of American Indian people in graduate level science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research and education is an issue that must be addressed in order to safeguard the future of Native American communities and Nations, and to ensure a viable, healthy, national STEM workforce. This project creates a national program for Indigenous STEM Research and Graduate Education (ISTEM) that has a focus of a Regional Native Network (RN2) of nine institutions of higher education. Led by the University of Idaho, ISTEM aims to increase the number of Native American students obtaining Masters and PhD degrees in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ISTEM program is a unique national program that provides comprehensive STEM graduate training to address the needs and desires of Native American peoples. In consultation with tribal communities and a Native American national advisory board, ISTEM addresses the specific needs of both Native American graduate students and their tribes through a collaborative approach (RN2) to recruitment, research design, and retention of STEM graduate students. During the project period, ISTEM is partially experimental with ongoing program modifications based on assessment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Many components of the ISTEM curriculum and programmatic structure are drawn from existing models that have been effective in the training of graduate students from underrepresented minority populations. The program will incorporate both accepted and experimental components, including: (1) new modalities of teaching and learning that have American Indian input; (2) collaborative, interdisciplinary research based on a cohort model of students interacting with stakeholders; and (3) situating STEM into social and cultural contexts so that the theory of knowledge is woven into good teaching and learning. The results of the program will inform future program design in graduate STEM education, and encourage research into delivering more effective graduate education to underrepresented segments of the population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The ISTEM program is focused on the creation of a core of STEM professionals from an underrepresented group, namely American Indian peoples of the United States. The program directly benefits society by providing American Indian scholars access to research facilities and methodologies for exploring ongoing issues of concern to tribal and Native American lands and peoples. Additionally, ISTEM is advancing STEM discovery and understanding through RN2, its collaborative, stakeholder-centric approach to research and education design.  The ISTEM concept is scalable and adaptable to other regions of the country, and will be sustained by partner campuses once the project ends.</AbstractNarration>

One of the students was the first STEM doctorate earned by his respective tribe. Our students demonstrated the importance of research that addresses issues facing their Tribal communities. They have come to understand that they are the next generation of American Indian ISTEM Scholars and the mentoring, role model responsibilities that they carry. ISTEM Scholars have created knowledge across a variety of areas in the STEM disciplines. This knowledge creation was done through Two-Eyed Seeing, the importance of a Native worldview brought together with a Western academic worldview. Through the broadening of participation, these ISTEM Scholars are positioned to ask questions and conduct research that it is on the cutting edge.</p> <p>Here is what some of the ISEM students thought about the ISTEM program.</p> <p><strong>What does it mean to you to be an ISTEM Scholar?</strong></p> <p><strong>S1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>?It means that I have the opportunity to give back to my community in a way that can help improve the quality of life for Indigenous people and provide a pathway to students beginning or currently on their educational journey.?</p> <p><strong>S2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?</strong>It?s definitely the crucial lifeline I needed, which interestingly presented itself in a timely fashion, to continue forward toward completing a Master?s degree in biology.?</p> <p><strong>S3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?</strong>It means quite a lot to me! I have spent much of my academic career teaching American Indian Studies courses, advising native students, and working more recently on environmental issues and co-management of resources and lands directly relevant to American Indian communities in the Western US. I was very fortunate to have worked with Dr. Galindo on writing a previous iteration of the ISTEM grant to the NSF, and feel honored that I?ve been chosen as an ISTEM scholar. This is, to me, the greatest honor I?ve received so far in my academic life.?</p> <p><strong>S4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?</strong>For me, being a student in the ISTEM program represents an opportunity. Having this scholarship has allowed me to take a course from my local university while remaining at home. If not for this scholarship, I would not have had the financial means to enroll in classes. I am very proud to be an ISTEM scholar and hope that I can continue to be a part of this exciting journey.?</p> <p><strong>S5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?</strong>Up until this point I never really realized the distinction that is accompanied by being recognized as an ISTEM scholar. I understand now this honor exhibits each scholar?s potential to do great science and their potential to be the next great intellectuals of this time period. We are a group of students that can break barriers and open new opportunities for others like ourselves.?</p> <p><strong>S6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?</strong>I am supported as an indigenous scientist to express my nativeness in the realm of science without a community of other scholars like me.?</p> <p><strong>S7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?</strong>Being an ISTEM scholar has allowed me to communicate with other native scholars from diverse tribal backgrounds. This has been a valuable experience and has help to define what it means to be an ISTEM scholar. This ability to connect with other native scholar provides a level of accountability in our discipline specific scholarly work and in understandings of native perspectives within the academic community.?</p> <p><strong>What is your intellectual motivation? </strong></p> <p><strong>S1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>?I am always looking to learn new things, particularly in the areas of cosmology and astrophysics.&nbsp; There is so much we don't know about the universe (multiverses) and I am intrigued by the prospect of one day finding life exists outside of our own sphere of influence.?</p> <p><strong>S2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?</strong>I believe it stems from my upbringing and family history.
