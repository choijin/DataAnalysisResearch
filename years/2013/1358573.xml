<AbstractNarration>Non-technical summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geodesy -- the study of the shape of the Earth and its changes over time -- helps researchers gain insight into how the Earth's surface deforms in response to faulting, volcanism, hydrologic cycles, landslides, and human activity. Observations of deformation can inform assessments of the hazard associated with individual faults or volcanoes, models of the forces driving plate tectonics, as well as identification of new modes of deformation such as the slow slip events now observed at subduction zones and strike-slip faults worldwide. However, the available data are rarely optimal for the studies that rely on them -- campaign and continuous GPS observations are at isolated points that are usually separated by 10s of km or more, and place less of a constraint on deformation in the vertical direction than in horizontal ones. Space-based geodetic imaging such as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) provides observations over large areas (100s of km) at high spatial resolution (few 10s of meters), but only constrains a near-vertical component of deformation and lacks the temporal resolution of continuous GPS.   Tradeoffs between potential models of behavior can usually be greatly reduced when observations of more than one component of the 3D deformation field are available.  This project is providing key information about how best to combine these diverse data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Southern California, with its high population density and complex, evolving network of faults, is a region where spatially dense 3-dimensional observations of ground displacements are particularly important.  In many cases, the long-term rate and even the fault plane geometry of structures that make up the San Andreas system are poorly understood, as is the manner in which parallel faults accommodate the plate motion over time.  The characteristics of the seismic cycle along these faults -- how regular they are, whether earthquakes occur in clusters along one fault followed by hiatuses during which activity shifts to a different structure, etc. -- are necessary inputs into attempts to assess seismic hazard in the region.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;This project involves assimilation of available GPS and InSAR data into a combined, 3-dimensional map of ground deformation over a study region within Southern California, taking full advantage of the complementary strengths of the two data types.  The proposed work includes close examination of the characteristics of seasonal signals, data quality and anthropogenic sources of ground deformation that may contaminate the tectonic signal as well as being of interest in their own right.  This project focuses on the transition from the Los Angeles basin through Banning Pass down through the Salton Trough -- an area of interest both because it covers the southern San Andreas fault, but also because it is expected to experience vertical deformation due to both the convergence across many faults in the region and anthropogenic withdrawal of subsurface fluids.  The project is developing combined models, and making available to the wider community the underlying data, the models, and the software used to generate those models those models.  The project is also supporting the training of a graduate student and formal outreach to female high school students at the CURIE program for STEM development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our work advances the understanding of how the ground surface deforms over time in response to earthquakes, hydrology and other changes in the subsurface.  In recent years, the availability of high resolution (~5-10 meters/pixel) radar imagery has improved dramatically, allowing imaging of the ground surface through clouds, at night, and extraction of deformation rates with precisions that approach a few mm/yr in some areas.  The biggest change has been in the frequency with which images are acquired - in the early 2000's, images were acquired very irregularly, with months or even years in between.  Changes to the land surface were often too great to even make any measurement at all.  Now, satellite agencies from around the world are acquiring data over California at time intervals of even as short as 6 days (12 days is more common), which has allowed the generation of time series with interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) in areas with agriculture and other rapid change.     This data has brought with it new challenges - with higher fidelity on the temporal variations, we now are able to see the effect of variations in soil moisture that must be addressed if we want to fully take advantage of this dataset.  Therefore, our work has focused on a few key areas.     1: Incorporation of weather models into InSAR time series analysis - we have developed methods to assess how well weather models perform in areas with no expected deformation, and how we can propogate those uncertainties all the way through inversions for geophysical parameters.     2: Improvements to interferogram formation and time series analysis - even at 6-day intervals, plants grow, fields are tilled, etc., degrading the data in some areas and not in others.  We have developed a time-varying measure of data quality that allows us to perform our analysis on the spatial areas that are good quality without being negatively impacted by the other regions.  We have also pursued methods for analyzing interferograms in the presences of very large deformation fields that are sometimes as large as the region of interest (e.g., Central Valley of California and associated subsidence).     3: Soil moisture effects were recognized when satellite-based InSAR first enjoyed widespread use, but it is impossible to model them using the phase, amplitude or coherence of each interferogram on its own.  The massive time series that are now available, spanning multiple seasonal cycles and rain events, allow us to begin to separate out the effects on interferograms that are due to soil moisture, rather than to actual ground displacements.
