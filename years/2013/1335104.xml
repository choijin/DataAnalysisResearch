<AbstractNarration>The objective of this collaborative award is to provide insights into links between direct-marketing strategies and their impact on the performance (revenue generation, member retention) of nonprofit organizations, through the linkage of a general class of sophisticated optimization tools (stochastic optimal control) with state-of-the-art estimation methods (finite mixture models). This integration allows the proposed framework to serve as a practical tool to segment alumni/donor populations into homogeneous groups, based on their contribution sequences, which can be targeted with specific marketing actions. The framework's capability to process contribution sequences, i.e., longitudinal data, provides fundamental new insights into how direct-marketing strategies affect donor contribution behavior, and informs data acquisition strategies (via surveys and field experiments) aimed at model calibration and validation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide a rigorous mechanism to infer and segment the population based on unobserved heterogeneities, e.g., personality traits that influence the propensity of an individual to donate in response to solicitations. While there is ample empirical evidence that such differences can be statistically significant, existing models to support direct marketing activities are only capable of explaining these differences as random variations within the population. In contrast, the methodology provides a basis to tailor direct-marketing policies to optimize specific performance criteria. Moreover, the research will develop methodological tools that can guide decision-making for a broad set of segmentation, estimation and control problems in other areas. For example, in the management of transportation systems, the problem is to segment facilities that share similar characteristics, and to find optimal resource allocation policies for each of the groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The motivation for the project was related funding pressures in the last decade that have forced not-for-profit organizations to increase the volume and sophistication of their direct marketing activities for fundraising. Such organizations constitute a significant and growing part of the nation?s economy (about 5% of the US GDP), and often provide critical social services, ranging from health care and delivery of food, clothing and shelter, to educational, cultural, artistic and environmental protection services.   Fundraising is a critical part of their operations because, often, donations from individuals account for well over 50% of the revenue that these organizations generate.  While computing and communications technologies have allowed non-profits to increase the volume and types of data that they collect, a lack of resources and expertise has handicapped their ability to improve the efficiency of their direct-marketing strategies.  In terms of intellectual merit, little attention had been paid to dynamic segmentation modeling in the marketing literature, perhaps because detailed longitudinal data sets have not been available until recently.  In this regard, and building on state-of-the art tools in econometrics and operations research, fundamentally, we contribute a dynamic segmentation framework that can be used to support resource allocation.  With respect to the motivating application, we show that significant, but unobserved, behavioral differences manifest themselves in the dynamics that characterize each of the segments, and, importantly, that these differences can be exploited for direct-marketing.  Importantly, we show that the modeling framework and analysis tools developed as part of this work have broad applicability beyond fundraising.  For example, we have used them to analyze data related to infrastructure performance, as well as to study travel behavior patterns in the Chicago Metropolitan Area.  In terms of broader impacts, the two main outcomes of the project are related to successful implementations of the framework at two partner organizations, as well as training and professional development opportunities for the graduate students who were supported by the project.  In particular, the partner organizations used the results of our work to set suggested donation amount strings in FYs 2016 and 2017.  One of the partners also used the results to identify individuals that would receive follow-up solicitations by phone.  Participation rates and donation amounts have increased significantly at both institutions.  Moreover, our work has proved effective at automating what used to be a cumbersome, inefficient, and informal/non-technical process.  Over the project duration, 4 PhD students and 1 MS student were supported.  In addition to supporting their research, throughout the project all students have been thoroughly involved with our partner organizations, including full time work at their facilitiesduring the summer months.  All but 1 PhD student working on the project have graduated, and moved on to positions where they build on the research to develop synergistic tools for various organizations, e.g., marketing analysts for online retailers.
