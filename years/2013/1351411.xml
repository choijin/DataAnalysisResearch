<AbstractNarration>PI: Bailey, Sean&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1351411&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this proposal is to explore and model the structure of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) using instrumentation mounted on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. The scientific goals are to directly observe the hierarchy of length and time scales in flow structures (eddies) within the ABL, develop a predictive framework for these eddies, and understand how the dynamics of these structures contribute to transport processes within the ABL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed work rests on resolving a wide range of spatial scales within one of the most challenging flows in turbulence research - the ABL. These measurements, using a combination of experimental tools and analysis techniques, will fill a void in traditional ABL research capabilities and create new understanding of the ABL organization and of the effects of the flow structures on transport processes, such as pollutant dispersion, heat and temperature fluctuations in the atmosphere. The knowledge generated by these experiments will lead to (a) the development of a framework of the hierarchy of the flow structures which form in the ABL; (b) the characterization of the effects of the terrain on the behavior of these structures; and (c) the understanding of how the dynamics of these structures contribute to transport processes within the atmospheric boundary layer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our climate, agriculture, and commerce are affected by the turbulence within the atmospheric layer closest to the earth surface, and this proposal's goal to decipher the chaotic dynamics of this layer has both fundamental and practical importance. Better understanding in this scientific area can lead to improvements in modeling weather and climate patterns, energy recovery in wind farms or tracking pollutants in the atmosphere. Graduate, undergraduate and high school students will participate in this project. &lt;br/&gt;The educational and outreach plan of this proposal leverages the popular appeal of drones (UAVs) to pursue recruiting high school students into STEM programs, motivate undergraduate students to enroll in graduate programs, and retain undergraduate students within engineering programs. Specifically, the PI is a co-organizer of the Kentucky Institute for Aerospace Education (KIAE) since 2010, and he will leverage his CAREER educational activities with KIAE to expand the wing design competition to include hands-on learning exercises for the KIAE high school students at the University of Kentucky. For undergraduate students, he is planning the development of Boundary Layer UAV Experiment for the Characterization of Atmospheric Turbulence (BLUECAT) team design, in which undergraduate students will become active with his research..</AbstractNarration>

These systems were used during numerous flight tests, which required navigating the FAA?s evolving regulatory landscape.  Initially, flights had to be carried out under a blanket area Certificate of Authorization (COA) granted to the University of Kentucky. Later, we were able to operate under Part 107 rules, with additional COAs and permissions for Transport Canada obtained when Part 107 rules did not apply.    As a result, the focus of years 3 and on in the research program has been the usage of these systems   The airframes and ground systems were used in 3 multi-university test campaigns in Oklahoma and Colorado in the summers of 2016-2018 where a large focus was the measurement of turbulent fluxes during the morning transitions of the atmospheric boundary layer and collaborate in the measurement of cold-air drainage flows in the Alamosa valley.   In 2019, the aircraft and systems were implemented in a field campaign in Southwestern Ontario Canada, where the focus was the measurement of wind turbine wakes and wake steering.  An exemplar of the use of these systems was being a significant contributor to the Lower Atmospheric Process Studies at Elevation - a Remotely-piloted Aircraft Team Experiment (LAPSE-RATE) in 2018.

Over the course of six days, over 100 participants supported the coordinated deployment of 50 different unmanned aircraft to complete 1287 total flights, accumulating 262.4 flight hours. These flights were conducted under both FAA Certificates of Authorization (COAs) and FAA Part 107, with the COAs generally supporting flights up to altitudes of 3000 feet above ground level.  The data from these campaigns was applied towards achieving increased understanding of turbulence and its behavior within the atmospheric boundary layer.  The data from these initial campaigns were used to generate measurements of the atmospheric boundary layer transition process, which have been analyzed to extract information about the formation of large-scale horizontal convective rolls during the morning boundary layer transition, as well as the evolution of turbulence quantities at largely unexplored altitudes.

Additional measurements have revealed asymmetry and instability within mountain valley drainage flows.  Finally, these systems were used to quantify and verify the behavior of wind turbine wakes during morning boundary layer transition and during the implementation of wake steering for wind farms efficiency.     Broader impacts of this award were produced by engaging the broader community, high-school and undergraduate students in the engineering and scientific work core to this research project.  Workforce development was an important focus of these activities.
