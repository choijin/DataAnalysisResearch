<AbstractNarration>The Equitable Science Curriculum for integrating Arts in Public Education (ESCAPE) addresses a profound problem: science learning deficits among the growing population of elementary students who are non-native English speakers. Focusing on six high-need Southern California school districts, ESCAPE targets grade 3-5 English Language Learners (ELLs) in developing the academic language needed to understand scientific concepts. To address learning challenges posed by difficult scientific vocabulary, the project integrates the arts' more concrete strategies to illustrate the sciences' more abstract concepts, exploiting similarities between these disciplines' shared basis in crosscutting concepts like pattern, cause/effect, scale, proportion, and quantity. The grade 3-5 focus is crucial because comprehension at this level is pivotal to future achievement. Led by University of California-Irvine STEM faculty (with support from UCI's CalTeach preservice science teacher development program), the partnership includes teachers and administrators from the Orange County Department of Education and six school districts, WestEd educational consultants, and the Segerstrom Center for the Arts. ESCAPE expects to increase: 1) teacher content and pedagogical knowledge in Earth, Physical, and Life Science; 2) integration of arts to boost ELL learning; and 3) student achievement on science and language development tests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over four years, each of 150 teachers receives 220 hours of team-based professional development in using science kits and illustrating science concepts through the arts. Program effectiveness is measured using a random assignment design. Principals in each of the six districts volunteer their schools for the project; within each district schools are randomly assigned to treatment or control conditions. Program effects on students' and teachers' science knowledge and achievement are measured by pre- and post-tests for students and teachers. The goal of the research is to measure the effect of the intervention on teachers' science content and pedagogical knowledge, as well as the effect on student science achievement.  Causal mechanisms are investigated, including how school and teacher characteristics modify the effects as well as differential effects on ELLs and native English speakers, and the mechanisms underlying these differential effects. The quantitative analyses is based on multilevel regression models, with students nested in classrooms (teachers) that are nested in schools, and accounting for a host of control variables. These methods provide unbiased estimates of program effects. Qualitative data include teacher implementation logs, feedback forms, and focus groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ESCAPE aims to provide sustainable teacher professional development that increases teachers' science content and pedagogical knowledge, while overcoming impediments to ELLs' STEM learning. Over the project's five years, 150 teachers will teach ~21,000 students, and ~180 CalTeach preservice teachers will be trained. Among the project's products is an ELL-accessible curriculum for Earth, Physical, and Life Science in grades 3-5 and a video-based online system for training teachers (providing a university Certificate in Teaching Science through the Arts), which will be deployed and tested with CalTeach pre-service teachers and teachers in Southern California school districts. This will assist in the national dissemination of this model for improving teacher and student achievement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Equitable Science Curriculum integrating Arts in Public Education (ESCAPE)   is an innovative professional development program with a rigorous research component developed at the University of California, Irvine, under the leadership  of Professor Brad Hughes Ph.D. &amp; P.I., in partnership with the Segerstrom Center for the Arts and the Orange County Department of Education.  ESCAPE introduces teachers to new NGSS-aligned STEM curricular units along with NGSS+Arts integrated STEAM curricular units contributing to STEAM education and research. The program leverages STEAM integration in training teachers to help students better understand scientific concepts, correct scientific misconceptions, and reduce cognitive load, while increasing learning achievement for all students and closing achievement gaps for English language learners (ELLs). Both traditional in person and online cohorts of upper elementary school teachers participated in the arts and science integrated training, providing these teachers with advanced tools for implementing the new NGSS standards with innovative research-based pedagogical STEAM methods.  ESCAPE aims to increase content and pedagogical knowledge in the areas of earth, life and physical science and provides foundational support for teaching science through STEM NGSS and STEAM NGSS+Arts approaches. ESCAPE explores the potential efficacies of arts-integrated science, including the correction of misconceptions and the development of academic language in elementary students, particularly ELLs.  From 2014 through 2020, a total of over 300 teachers were recruited to participate in ESCAPE from 70 California schools located in Orange and Los Angeles counties. The development of the curriculum and professional development training program first involved groups of teachers from Orange County, who completed three intensive years of in person training, followed by implementation in their classrooms to reach increasing numbers of students in grades 3, 4, and 5.  Comprehensive multimedia training was professionally produced in 4K UHD video to form the basis of the interactive online courses that followed, utilizing state of the art experimental instructional design media tools for implementing and analyzing the sustainable ESCAPE online program. These modules were designed to be interactive and learner-centered, replicating the in person version classroom implementation of ESCAPE in an online environment.

The research findings indicate that:   Teachers experienced significant gains (p&lt;0.0001) from pre- to post-test in their content and pedagogical knowledge in earth, life, &amp; physical science;   STEM NGSS units and STEAM NGSS+Arts units both significantly increased student science knowledge, and the combined effect of integrating them significantly increased learning;   The order of implementation STEAM NGSS+Arts before STEM NGSS leads to significantly higher gains in achievement for all students, particularly closing learning gaps for ELLs;   Arts-integrated approaches can correct misconceptions in science for all populations, and most substantially for ELLs;   The high average total program evaluation score of 90.1% garnered the ESCAPE online course the official Quality Matters Certification during the first quarter of implementation, further validating the study of the ESCAPE program to inform decisions about how online courses can be designed and evaluated in order to promote the quality and continuous improvement of online professional development.   The ESCAPE research initiated an exploration into the efficacy of arts  approaches when integrated with STEM disciplines. The ESCAPE program shows great promise in making arts and science education more accessible to students, increasing student achievement, and correcting science misconceptions. Additionally, these results have implications for how arts-integrated strategies might best be designed and implemented across classrooms, schools, and districts to teach science. ESCAPE online provides a highly interactive learning experience for teachers that can continue to evolve with new technologies. ESCAPE is a rigorous long-term study with great promise for continued development in the future, and thanks to it?s online sustainables content it?s opening up new frontiers for STEAM research. The ESCAPE vision is moving into the future with new research and developments in virtual reality, augmented reality, and digital storytelling to support learning STEM for all with STEAM.
