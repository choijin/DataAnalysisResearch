<AbstractNarration>This project will take the perspective of phylogenetic diversity in order to understand biodiversity with an emphasis on evolutionary history. Biodiversity hot spots, and endemism, are traditionally measured by changes in the number of species across a region. Such studies miss the full richness of analyses that a phylogenetic approach can provide.  The investigators will use a combination of spatial distribution data, phylogenetic relationships, and new analysis tools to provide exciting new insights into the patterns of vascular plant diversity within California, a globally recognized region of high plant diversity. Plants currently missing from phylogenetic analyses will be collected, and this project promises to provide new information about patterns of plant diversity that will be useful not only to researchers, but also conservation planners and amateur plant enthusiasts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One postdoctoral researcher and several undergraduates will be trained in the methods being used to investigate phylogenetic endemism. These training activities will be coupled with extensive outreach to citizen scientists and amateur botanists through talks highlighting the importance of integrating information on phylogenetic relationships when evaluating patterns of biological diversity. The suite of analysis tools generated by this project will also provide a model for future analyses of phylogenetic endemism that could be used in diverse organisms throughout the world.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             Understanding patterns of biodiversity on the landscape is important for conservation planning, given the urgent need to prioritize efforts in the face of rapid habitat loss and human-induced climate change.  Biodiversity is usually measured by counting the number of species in a location and examining the extent of their distribution, to identify areas of particularly high species diversity and endemism (i.e., species with small ranges).  However, investigation of species distribution alone misses the full richness of analyses that can result from taking a phylogenetic approach that takes into account the branching evolutionary relationships among species.  Biodiversity is the whole tree of life, not just the twigs (species).  New phylogenetic methods incorporate knowledge about the relationships of species to provide deeper insights into the distribution of biodiversity.  They can tell us how well currently protected lands cover the phylogenetic tree, and identify high-priority unprotected areas containing unique evolutionary histories in need of conservation.              This NSF-funded project applied this new suite of phylogenetic tools to the exceptionally rich flora of California.  In the research, we made use of the Consortium of California Herbaria database (http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/consortium/) and the online Jepson eFlora (http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/eflora/).   We focused on two key concepts: phylogenetic diversity (the portion of the overall phylogeny that is present in a local place), and phylogenetic endemism (the geographic rarity of that portion of the phylogeny). We developed a comprehensive phylogeny for California plants using existing data from Genbank (an international databank of DNA information) as well as fresh and herbarium material for taxa whose DNA has not yet been sequenced.              We found that high species richness was sometimes associated with significantly high endemism (e.g., Klamath Ranges).  However, in a major, previously recognized endemism hotspot, Southwestern California, we found that while species richness is high across much of the Peninsular and Transverse ranges, significantly high endemism is mostly localized to the Santa Rosa and San Bernardino mountains.  In the South Coast Ranges, southern Great Valley, and deserts of California, plants were significantly more closely related to each other than under a null model, indicating evolutionarily conserved habitat preference.  Significant concentrations of paleo-endemism (rare long branches) were found in Northwestern California, northern Great Valley, and western Sonoran Desert, while significant concentrations of neo-endemism  (rare short branches) were found in the White-Inyo Range, Death Valley, northern Mojave Desert, and southern Channel Islands.  We found an interesting relationship between significant endemism and more arid regions of California, which extends previous ideas about aridity as an evolutionary stimulus.              We explored the conservation implications of using phylodiversity to perform a conservation gap analysis of California (i.e., to locate areas with unique biodiversity that are in need of protection).  Our analysis incorporated a novel continuous metric of current land protection status, fine-scale data on landscape intactness, and an optimization algorithm used to identify priority sites containing concentrations of lineages that are evolutionarily unique, vulnerable due to small range size, and poorly protected across their ranges.  Top conservation priorities identified included pockets of coastal and northern California; these will be presented to private and governmental conservation organizations.              Broader impacts: The grant included financial support for an innovative collaboration with California Native Plant Society citizen scientists with knowledge and interest in California native plants and their phylogenetic history.  Educational workshops were held and financial and logistical support provided for fieldwork to collect target plants for this project.  Graduate students participated in several aspects of the project, and got a well-rounded exposure to this new research approach including spatial data handling and large-scale phylogenetics.  Several undergrads participated as well, primarily learning about DNA sequencing and data handling.  These new spatial phylogenetic methods were incorporated undergraduate classes on the UC Berkeley campus as well.              The campus news service published a very nice release on our project, that received wide coverage in the media: http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/12/04/californias-dry-regions-are-hotspots-of-plant-diversity/          Last Modified: 06/08/2018       Submitted by: Brent Mishler]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
