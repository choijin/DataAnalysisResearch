<AbstractNarration>In life, the order of doing things is extremely important. Doing job A before B may produce a completely different result from doing A after B. Noncommutative geometry studies this phenomena using ideas from geometry. While coordinate functions in classical geometry all commute, in the sense that the product AB equals BA, they do not commute in noncommutative geometry, where AB can be different from BA. In the last thirty years, noncommutative geometry has quickly grown into one of most active research areas in mathematics, with applications in many branches of mathematics and physics. In this project the principal investigator will study several interesting and important problems in noncommutative geometry and index theory, some of which are motivated by quantum field theory in physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will pursue three research projects in noncommutative geometry and index theory. (1) He will study a long-standing index problem, raised by Alain Connes, about the index of a groupoid elliptic differential operator on a  general Lie groupoid. (2) He will continue his program of using the joint force of noncommutative geometry and symplectic topology to study a duality conjecture, inspired from string theory in physics, about gerbes on orbifolds. (3) He will investigate an interesting index problem, motivated by multivariate operator theory, about some essentially normal Hilbert modules using the recent developments in complex analysis and noncommutative geometry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI's research was supported by National Science Foundation DMS #1363250 Noncom- mutative Geometry and Index Theory, 2014-2019, $162,000.   Intellectual Merit:    The PI's research focused on noncommutative geometry and its applications to multiple areas of mathematics, e.g. geometry, topology, and analysis. The PI investigated several problems in noncommutative geometry, including Lie groupoid index theory, the Arveson-Douglas conjecture and the analytic Grothendieck Riemann Roch theorem, and duality of gerbes on orbifolds. Significant progress have been made on these problems.  A groupoid Roe C*-algebra was introduced to study the index theory of longitudinal elliptic operators for foliations on open manifolds;   Important new cases of the Arveson-Douglas conjecture and the analytic Grothendieck Riemann Roch theorem were established;   Quantum Leray-Hirsch principle was discovered for the quantum geometry of gerbes on orbifolds.   Broader Impacts:   Three Ph.D. students supported by the grant complete their Ph.D. thesis. The PI mentored one postdoc during 2013-2016. In the grant period, the PI supervised seven undergraduate researchers conducting their summer research.    Besides giving lecture series all over the world introducing his research to the next generation researchers, the PI is active in organizing conferences.
