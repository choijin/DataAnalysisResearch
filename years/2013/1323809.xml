<AbstractNarration>This project is expanding and enhancing a series of courses focused on DNA sequencing technology, an area of science that is expanding rapidly and requiring skilled students to meet the challenges that are presented by the genomics era. The development and implementation of these courses is responsive to "Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education" in providing undergraduates with competencies in conducting science. Additionally, the project is facilitating the teaching of similar courses across a range of institutions. The project is:1) Vertically integrating metagenomics and developing a Metagenomic Certificate at San Diego State University (SDSU), a Hispanic Serving University, 2) Integrating DNA sequencing and metagenomic analysis across institutions via faculty workshops, 3) Facilitating teaching of metagenomics through the development of dynamic web-based modules, and 4) Analyzing the effectiveness of the programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: DNA sequencing technology is enabling an ever increasing range of organisms to be sequenced quickly, cheaply and with high accuracy. DNA sequencing of microbial communities is becoming important in medicine and life science research and students require training in designing, conducting and interpreting microbial experiments. This project is developing strategies to facilitate the teaching of metagenomics in a wide range of institutions, enabling students to conduct research and adding to scientific knowledge on outstanding questions in microbial ecology. The project is providing undergraduate students with the knowledge to use the latest technologies, practice at thinking critically and forming partnerships across disciplines, and empowering them to solve the complex problems of the 21 century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project is providing students with unique opportunities to work and interact with scientists from Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Australia. To date SDSU students have sequenced 40 microbes, 60 metagenomes and a marine mammal, learned how to analyze the data and become part of an international collaboration to identify the genomic signature in sea lion carcinomas. Additionally, project personnel and students are involved in describing the response of kelp forests and coral reef microbial communities to human activities. Data generated is used by policy officials in natural resource management. To inform the general community, project personnel lecture at public forums, and for the popular press, such as National Geographic, and Good Morning Brazil on Rede TV, and present at schools in San Diego, Australia, and Brazil about environmental microbes, oceanography, conservation and college education. Project results are being disseminated through websites and publication in peer-reviewed journals.</AbstractNarration>
