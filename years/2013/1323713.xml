<AbstractNarration>This integrated research and implementation project would advance the understanding of how interconnected transmedia platforms build children's motivation to take part in Citizen Science and contributes to girl's science self-identify. This project would deepen the engagement of girl's in Citizen Science projects by leveraging the success of SciGirls, the transmedia TV and web series, as well as other NSF investments in citizen science evaluation methods and instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project deliverables include 6 Citizen SciGirls TV programs for PBS broadcast and online streaming; Spanish translations; a mobile citizen science app; a SciGirls web portal for each featured Citizen Science project; activity guides and outreach.  Project partners include the National Girls Collaborative Project (4-H, Girls, Inc., and Girl Scouts among others) that will conduct national outreach, and AAAS that will develop the open source SciGirls app.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research component will build on the NSF funded DEVISE project adapting the Citizen Science research instruments for use with younger audiences.  Research questions include:  Does audience identification with media characters influence participation in Citizen Science Projects?  Does watching Citizen SciGirls programs influence development of science identity among girls?  What role do demographic factors (ethnicity /age/gender) have in influencing learning outcomes and participation in Citizen Science projects?&lt;br/&gt;The formative evaluation will apply iterative small-group studies of the transmedia deliverables in order to improve the user experience and learning outcomes.  The summative evaluation will focus on in-depth observational, non-experimental studies of selected groups of girls in afterschool settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reach of the project will be extensive via PBS with a projected broadcast coverage of 90% of TV households and a million unique online users of the games and apps.  Projected learning outcomes include girl's increased knowledge and interest in science and the environment, their skills of science inquiry, and behavior change resulting from participation in Citizen Science projects.</AbstractNarration>

Conference, participants commented on the ongoing relevance and popularity of the SciGirls brand, and expressed interest in repeating the Citizen SciGirls episodes prior to the launch of SciGirls? fourth season in February 2018.

This coverage is remarkable, particularly in comparison to subscription services (i.e. Amazon, Hulu, HBO) that still only appear in a fraction of American viewing households, and are not available free-of-charge.  Citizen SciGirls Online   SciGirls? third season focused heavily on using digital tools to explore, learn and share information about citizen science inquiry. The TPT digital team:  Produced two new games: Creature Features, a classic platformer game and Rule the Roost, a monthly challenge game featuring both online and IRL (in-real-life) activities. Revised the SciGirls PBS Kids site, improving the user experience around the most-visited assets (videos, games and profiles) and strengthening the link between the site and the episodes, in which the site is consistently referenced.   Citizen SciGirls: Outreach and Professional Development  Since 2015, the SciGirls outreach team:  Researched and published SciGirls Participate! Citizen Science Adventures educators guide and the Nature Nurture Journal for youth; Trained National Girls Collaborative (NGC) state representatives to train 200+ educators to use Citizen SciGirls content. The NGC also provided mini-grants for educators to implement Citizen SciGirls-inspired programming; Leveraged Citizen SciGirls content into new Minnesota county-funded STEM programming; Provided leadership at the 2017 Citizen Science Association Conference, holding a plenary session, media screening and hands-on activity station;  Integrated all Citizen SciGirls resources into NSF-supported SciGirls CONNECT programming which serves over 175 partner organizations, 3,000 educators and 60,000+ children. Conducted an evaluation of educators trained on Citizen SciGirls content showing that after participating in the training, educators? skill level with regard to citizen science increased.   Citizen SciGirls Evaluation  Dr. Barbara Flagg,  Multimedia Research, completed two formative evaluations around the Rule the Roost online game. In addition, Dr. Flagg's summative evaluation examined how engaging in SciGirls media prior to participating in hands-on citizen science activities contributed to their interest in and self-efficacy around citizen science.  49 fifth grade girls at five nationally distributed sites were randomly assigned to one of two groups:  A treatment group that experienced two hours of SciGirls multimedia at home followed by participation in an outdoor citizen science activity; and a control group that experienced the activity without prior exposure to SciGirls.  Evaluation illuminated the following:  The treatment group demonstrated significantly higher levels of interest than the control group in their hands-on citizen science activity and significantly better understanding of the unique practice of citizen science.     Within the treatment group, pre-exposure to SciGirls produced a significantly stronger impact on minority girls than non-minority girls. Girls displayed a higher interest in doing their citizen science activity, in finding out about other citizen science projects, greater perceived efficacy in doing citizen science, more similarity to the onscreen girls, and stronger interest in their SciGirls experience.    In 2016, Dr. Flagg?s summative evaluation was peer-reviewed and published in the Citizen Science: Theory and Practice journal.
