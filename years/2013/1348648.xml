<AbstractNarration>EHR Core Research&lt;br/&gt;Workforce Development&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on workplace expectations for STEM related competencies and the subsequent design of educational curricula in postsecondary institutions and STEM education interventions. It responds to the need to produce empirical evidence regarding employer expectations in STEM related fields that would enable the integration of these expectations into educational practice. Thus, the project goals are to (1) identify employer expectations for the types of skills, knowledge, and competencies required for success; (2) ascertain the degree to which these expectations are integrated into the design of educational curricula and STEM education interventions; and (3) explore the implications of employer desires for hard and soft skills for the postsecondary curriculum. These issues will be examined in regard to the advanced manufacturing and biotechnology industries within the State of Wisconsin. It expands a small-scale study on these topics that was launched in 2012 by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Center for Education and Work. That study draws on a sociotechnical theory of organizations by focusing on the ways in which successful employees are able to bring a variety of skills and competencies obtained through their education to navigate workplace complexities and maximize their performance. The PIs will use a comparative qualitative case study design where in-depth interviews</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This study addressed an urgent issue facing our society, economy, and educational system: To what degree are the nation's colleges and universities preparing students with the skills demanded in the labor market?  Between 2013 and 2015 a team of researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison traveled throughout the state, interviewing 145 individuals that represented the biotechnology and manufacturing industries (CEOs and HR directors) and educators working in these fields (2- and 4-year institutions).  The following questions were asked: What skills are essential for workplace success? How do you teach or train these skillsets? What forms of cross-sector collaborations are you involved in, and how (if at all) do they impact students' skill development?  Major results from the study include the following: (1) That employers seek applicants with a combination of technical expertise and intra- and inter-personal competencies unique to the profession, (2) Work ethic is the most in-demand competency among employers, but it is cultivated not only by college educators but parents, peers, and the culture, (3) Active learning is an important strategy educators use to cultivate these diversified skillsets, (4) While some employers had robust training programs, only 15% offered formal training while 42% relied on informal job shadowing, (5) 74% of employers also screened applicant for "fit" with the organizational culture, which is an important business strategy but also raises questions about discrimination, and (6) Students social and cultural capital can be cultivated through a variety of cross-sector partnerships including internships, curricular co-construction, and career advising.   Broad conclusions from the research are that the higher education sector can improve how it provides career competencies to students and articulates career pathways, primarily via active learning and improved career services.  Additionally, employers have an important role to play in these areas by providing workplace training and engaging with local educational institutions.  However, some valued competencies are beyond the purview of educators and employers, such as work ethic and lifelong learning, which highlights the role of culture, parenting, and society in skills debates.  Results from this study led to the publication of a book in 2016 by Harvard Educational Press titled "Beyond the skills gap: Preparing college students for life and work," 4 research papers for scholarly journals, 2 policy briefs (1 on study findings, 1 on the nature of STEM jobs), an article in the National Association for Colleges and Employers (NACE) magazine, media coverage of the study, a presentation to Wisconsin state legislators, and several presentations at professional meetings. Ongoing analysis of the data will explore students' career decision-making patterns over the long-term, highlighting the key decision points that shape decisions about jobs and life after graduation.  The study is re-focusing the importance of teaching and learning in debates about jobs and college education, and the need to provide institutional supports for faculty professional development and student career advising.  Research products are also highlighting promising practices identified in the study, including innovative approaches to curricular co-construction between educators and employers and classroom teaching methods that integrate real-world situations intended to facilitate transfer and career competencies. The study also represents a conceptual advance in the field by viewing college-to-workforce pathways in terms of students' cultural and social capital development, as well as the structural features of colleges and labor markets that shape post-graduate outcomes.  Broader impacts of the study include expanding conversations about active learning to professional communities including career and academic advisors, legislators engaged in skills gap issues, and technical college instructors.  Additionally, via findings regarding the prevalence of cultural matchign during the hiring process, a new line of research on the implications of this practice for corporate productivity and hiring discrimination is being launched.  This study has also led to additional research examining higher education-employer relations in 4 high-STEM jobs regions in the US, with a focus on whether educators and employers are cultivating non-cognitive skillsets in their students and employees.  That study is intended to provide systemic overviews of municipal college-to-work pathways so that stakeholders can identify strengths and weaknesses in local systems for improvement and reform.
