<AbstractNarration>Title: Collaborative Research: Studies of ULF waves associated with solar wind coupling to the magnetosphere and ionosphere&lt;br/&gt;PLR-1341677 PI: Marc Lessard, University of New Hampshire (Lead)&lt;br/&gt;PLR-1341493 PI: Mark Engebretson, Augsburg College (Non-Lead)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the beginning of the space age, increasingly sophisticated efforts have been made to explore and understand Earth?s space environment. Because those parts of Earth?s magnetic field that reach farthest out into space intersect the ground at high latitudes, arrays of ground magnetometers and auroral imagers at these polar regions have long been a valued means of monitoring processes in remote parts of Earth's magnetosphere. This award is to continue to operate and analyze data from six ground-based  induction (search coil) magnetometers located in Antarctica (U.S. stations at South Pole and McMurdo, and the British Halley and Rothera stations), and two in the Arctic (Sondrestromfjord, Greenland, and Iqaluit, Canada). This research includes also the comparative analysis of search coil data from the array of automatic geophysical observatories (AGOs), a widely spaced array at Southern Polar Cap latitudes ranging from the auroral zone to near the geomagnetic pole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stations in this project are key links in arrays of ground-based ionospheric and magnetospheric observatories in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions. With data from other instruments located at these sites and utilizing data from Antarctic arrays of automated instruments and from both low-altitude and high-altitude NASA spacecraft, these instruments play a significant role in a variety of studies of geospace phenomena including the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction and geomagnetic storms and substorms. Taken together, these instruments make it possible to study the entire range of Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) variations, from Pc1 and Pi1 pulsations down to Pc5 pulsations, magnetic impulse events, sudden electromagnetic impulses, and substorm disturbances with high sensitivity. Studies of these waves in conjunction with other instruments and spacecraft observations greatly enhance the scientific potential of the wave observations to provide new physical insights into Geospace dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solid science, collaborative effort, international partners, and travel to Antarctica provide an ideal opportunity to achieve education and outreach goals. Operation of the search coil magnetometers at the U.S. Antarctic stations provides excellent opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students at the University of New Hampshire and Augsburg College in Minnesota to make meaningful contributions to cutting-edge science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Search coils data are broadly employed by other research groups, with applications in studying solar-terrestrial relationships, magnetospheric physics, and space weather. These instruments are critical for the study of Earth's space environment, which has become increasingly important to our technologically advanced society. Improving the capability to forecast and characterize major space weather events has direct societal benefit.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF grant PLR-1341493 to Augsburg University, together with NSF grant PLR-1341677 to the University of New Hampshire, supported the continued operation of, and analysis of data from, five induction (search coil) magnetometers at high latitude sites, three in Antarctica and two in the Arctic, as part of international efforts to study Earth?s space environment that include observations from both ground-based instruments and research satellites.  The scientific focus of efforts at Augsburg was on observations of ultra-low-frequency (ULF band) waves generated in near-Earth space.  Induction magnetometers are the only widely-deployed ground-based instruments capable of detecting one class of ULF waves, electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves.  Recent studies have confirmed that these waves play an important role in depleting the most energetic electrons from the outer Van Allen radiation belt.  Because these waves are highly localized in space, worldwide arrays of these instruments are necessary in order to observe waves associated with specific radiation belt depletion events.   During the period of this grant (2014-2018), members of the Augsburg team were first authors of ten published refereed research papers, and were co-authors of seventeen more.  Highlights include:  -- Engebretson et al. [2015] showed an unusually strong and spatially widespread EMIC wave event, first noted in induction magnetometer data at Halley, which was observed both in space and by ground-based induction magnetometers worldwide, and caused a rapid and deep depletion of radiation belt electrons.  This paper was cited by Journal of Geophysical Research -- Space Physics Editor-in-Chief Mike Liemohn as one of "the Top-10 Most Cited Papers published in 2015 in JGR Space Physics."  As of September 24, 2018 it has been cited by 43 other published studies.  -- Prof. Engebretson was asked by a group of radiation belt researchers at the 2017 GEM Workshop in June 2017 to identify and present all the EMIC wave events that could be observed during four GEM radiation belt challenge event intervals in 2013.  The resulting paper (Engebretson et al., 2018a] included all available ground-based induction magnetometer data worldwide as well as data from the Van Allen Probes, THEMIS, GOES, and POES satellites during these intervals.  Radiation belt observations by the Van Allen Probes during these events showed two intervals during which EMIC waves were likely to have played an important role in causing major flux dropouts of radiation belt electrons.  In three other intervals, identifiable smaller and more short-lived dropouts appeared, and in five other intervals these waves evidently had little or no effect.  It is hoped that these observations will be compared to and/or incorporated in various theoretical models of radiation belt dynamics.     --  Papers by Fedorov et al. [2016 and 2018] and Pilipenko et al. [2018] continued this group?s series of  theoretical investigations of ULF waves, preparing realistic models of their generation and propagation through the ionosphere and to the ground.   This grant has also provided research training to five undergraduate physics majors at Augsburg College.  Of the four who have now graduated, two are employed in STEM fields in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, and two are in graduate Ph. D programs in STEM fields.
