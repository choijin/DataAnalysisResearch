<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an adaptive learning system for early childhood care and education to aid parents and childcare providers in fostering the development of young children and assist them in preparing children for academic success beginning in kindergarten. The system will establish an interactive learning environment - delivered via smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop computer - to provide caregivers with a virtual teaching partner and mentor that is accessible at any time or place. Additionally, the system will enable the formation of social networks among parents and caregivers, build awareness of local childcare resources, and provide access to professional childcare and pediatric services. The project will develop a technology framework for data collection through smart devices and interactive educational programs to advance the use of learning analytics in early childhood education. This capability will enable longitudinal collection of data on early childhood development and learning across large populations and demographics to refine current understanding and methodologies, enhance professional knowledge among childcare providers, and inform a new generation of childcare and family support services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact is the project's potential to addresses the lack of infrastructure to deliver quality early childhood care and education that is accessible and affordable to all families. Research has indicated only a minority of parents with pre-kindergarten age children gain access to services that could ensure their children enter school fully ready to learn as determined by kindergarten entry assessments. This need is particularly acute in underserved communities that lack resources to support positive parenting skills and quality early childhood experiences. National studies have consistently demonstrated the benefits to society of early childhood education in improved high school and college graduation rates, reduced juvenile crime, greater adult productivity, enhanced wage-earning potential, and increased tax revenues. To address this shortfall in capacity, this project will identify educational content appropriate for delivery via information technologies and develop an adaptive learning system to aid parents and caregivers in establishing effective learning environments for their young children. The widespread availability of mobile digital devices and the trajectory of future development and use, particularly among young parents and caregivers' present an opportunity for innovation in early childhood care and education that will greatly enhance access to knowledge of parenting skills and child development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report  Adaptive Learning System for Early Childhood Education from Birth to Kindergarten (eB2K)    This report summarizes the findings of the feasibility study for developing an Adaptive Learning System for Early Childhood Education from Birth to Kindergarten (eB2K). The study was conducted from January-June 2014 by the Aethena Group, LLC as Phase 1 of a National Science Foundation Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project.  The goal of this study was to determine the technical feasibility and commercial potential for an Adaptive Learning System for Early Childhood Education that could deliver educational products on early childhood development via information technologies to aid parents and caregivers in establishing effective learning environments for their young children in order to prepare the child to enter kindergarten "fully ready to learn."  This project is directed at addressing the shortage of effective infrastructure to deliver quality early childhood care and education that is affordable and accessible to all families. National studies have consistently demonstrated the benefits to society of early childhood education in improved high school and college graduation rates, reduced juvenile crime, greater adult productivity, enhanced wage-earning potential, and increased tax revenues. And yet, research indicates that less than 10% of parents with pre-kindergarten age children gain access to services that could ensure their children enter school fully ready to learn, as determined by kindergarten entry assessments. This need is particularly acute in underserved communities that lack resources to support positive parenting skills and quality early childhood experiences.  Project objectives were to (1) identify educational content and skills in early childhood development appropriate for delivery via information technologies; (2) develop the functional requirements and concept of operations for the system; and (3) build a prototype to test feasibility and refine the product to meet the needs of parents and caregivers in providing for and establishing effective learning environments for their young children.  A broader objective is that the "eB2K system" enable longitudinal collection of anonymized data on early childhood development and learning across large populations and demographics. This aspect would advance the use of data analytics in early childhood education to refine current understanding and methodologies, enhance professional knowledge among childcare providers, and inform a new generation of childcare practitioners and family support services.  A principle identified during the research is that the correct starting point for early childhood care and education is immediately upon the birth of the child. The logical entry point for an early childhood education program or system is therefore the nexus of the relationship between the parent, the child, and the pediatrician. This perspective acknowledges that the early and continuing health of the child is fundamental to the childÆs cognitive, emotional, and physical development, and serves as the foundation for educational achievement in later years.  Moreover, the current national emphasis on improving health care quality, personalizing delivery of services, and improving patient satisfaction&mdash;all the while reducing redundancies and the costs of service&mdash;have raised the potential for use of an IT-based system in pediatric management and coordination. This opens the opportunity for this project to have a significant impact on improving service delivery and patient satisfaction while improving infant and child health, and potentially reducing the costs of healthcare service.  Significant accomplishments achieved in this SBIR Phase 1 project:    Developed a conceptual model for the eB2K Adaptive Learning System comprising a network of caregiver knowledge and skills, partnerships, resources and support to be incorporated into the...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
