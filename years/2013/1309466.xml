<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to develop a compact, practical, novel 3-terminal approach to sensing and distinguishing emissions gases using graphene's intrinsic single molecule sensitivity. This is to be accomplished using a subthreshold Silicon Carbide Metal Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor with an active epitaxially grown graphene gate as the active transducer to provide performance advantages not possible with SiC and graphene alone.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit lies in applying subthrehsold design principles to SiC devices, as well as to gas sensors, neither of which has been done to date. Furthermore, the modes of distinguishing between gases using a compact solid-state device will be investigated, a potentially transformative concept in the realm of gas sensing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this include applications in harsh-environment sensing, emissions monitoring and low-cost gas-monitoring for homes. If successful, this will provide transformational low-cost solutions to these monitoring problems, some of which are currently un-enforceable. Finally, this effort will fund 3 professional 10-minute videos (by Co-PI &amp; Emmy-nominated documentary maker L. Kissel) documenting the scientific process in this project for the layman, and to develop materials for recruitment of students into Science and Technology, Engineering and Math fields. This project will continue University of South Carolina's commitment to expanding diversity, by seeking to match the University demographic makeup with that of the surrounding counties, through recruitment of minority students. This project will involve at least 1 African-American PhD student.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intellectual Merit:</span> In this project, we demonstrated how graphene, a single atomic layer of graphitic carbon, found in pencil lead, is used to electronically detect trace amounts of NO<sub>2</sub> gas, a smog-causing and respiratory health issue inducing byproduct of combustion engines in vehicles and power plants. Our approach differs from previous ones in that instead of using graphene by itself, we used interfaces of graphene with another material, such as SiC (used for power switches), or MoS<sub>2</sub> (used in lubricants), to amplify changes in the electrical properties of the graphene by ~100x, leading to a corresponding improvement in the sensitivity of our sensors. This enabled &lt;1ppm NO<sub>2</sub> to be routinely detected, well below the 10ppm current enforcement capability of the EPA in day-to-day situations, where 10ppm exposure can cause respiratory issues. Achieving this required the development of new crystal growth techniques for graphene, SiC and MoS<sub>2</sub>, along with advances in the architecture of the electronic sensors. Finally, we were able to demonstrate a certain degree of selectivity i.e. the ability to distinguish between various other potential contaminants, such as ammonia, by applying a voltage to enhance or suppress a certain contaminant&rsquo;s electrical signature. This is one of the key first steps to realizing an electronic-nose functionality in nanoelectronic devices, a potentially transformative goal of various gas detection technologies.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Broader Impacts:</span> This project led to the publication of 15 journal articles, &gt;30 conference presentations and 3 provisional/full patent applications.

The PhD graduates have gone onto positions in industry, such as at Intel, on the manufacturing of nanoscale devices for microprocessors. 2 undergraduates went onto highly ranked electrical engineering PhD programs, including 1 Latina woman. One student, an African American working on this project in the first year has recently accepted a tenure-track position at an R1 university. Finally, this led to the production of 3 short videos by two-time Emmy nominated filmmaker Co-PI Kissel for popularizing this work for the layperson.
