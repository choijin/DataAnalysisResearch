<AbstractNarration>1336872 (Bakshi) and 1334083 (Daily). Even though all human activities depend on goods and services obtained from nature, modern technological advances and prosperity have resulted in increasing ignorance of this dependence, leading to severe degradation in the ability of ecosystems to provide services for sustaining human activities and well-being. This research is a step toward restoring this connection, and is based on the premise that understanding and accounting for the interaction and interdependence between technological and ecological systems can result in new insights about the sustainability of human activities, and the discovery of innovative designs based on synergies between technological and ecological systems. This work will develop the new framework of techno-ecological synergy (TES) that integrates data and models of technological and ecological systems at multiple spatial scales. Relevant information will be obtained from engineering models, life cycle inventories, input-output models, and ecological data and models. Such information will be used to develop TES models at spatial scales such as local, regional, and national. Design of synergies will be enabled by a multiobjective optimization framework that will combine process and input-output models of technological and ecological systems. As a way of developing this framework, these methods will be applied to assessing the sustainability of The Ohio State University campus based on its demand and supply for ecosystem services. Strategies will be suggested for enhancing campus sustainability and for meeting the University President?s commitment of carbon neutrality. The proposed activities will bring together the expertise of leaders in Sustainable Engineering and Ecosystem Services.  Understanding the synergy between existing systems is expected to result in a novel approach for assessing system sustainability. TES models at a spatial scale will indicate the extent of overshoot between the demand and supply for individual ecosystem services. This will provide insight into the options and appropriate scale for closing material cycles, and encourage the development of "islands of sustainability." Such models across scales will be used to develop hybrid models that consider the entire life cycle, supporting ecosystems, and their capacity. Designing techno-ecological synergy will expand the design space to include innovative solutions that are beneficial to the economy and the environment. These solutions cannot be found by traditional engineering design since it ignores the role of ecosystems. A unique feature of the optimization framework will be its ability to utilize process models from existing software and input-output models built from economic and environmental data. Through this work, methods for ecosystem services modeling will expand their reach into industrial supply chains, life cycles, and technology design and assessment. Application to campus sustainability will advance methods for developing green buildings and sustainable habitats. Application of the proposed framework to the OSU campus will provide unique opportunities for education and outreach to students, staff and faculty, and to enhance public engagement with science and technology. This will be enabled by working with the campus Office of Energy Services and Sustainability, and two student groups: the local chapter of Engineers for a Sustainable World, and the Ecological Engineering Society. The results of this work will be disseminated by means of on-campus exhibits organized by these groups; web-based tools to explore campus sustainability options; short courses to policy makers and engineers, organized by the Natural Capital Project and the MIT Summer Program, respectively; elective courses and graduate student training; and through academic publications and presentations. Involvement of underrepresented minorities and women will be ensured not just through graduate student recruitment, but also via the student groups associated with this work. The proposed framework will open many new avenues for further work such as the effect of techno-ecological synergies on the resilience of spatial regions, integration with social and behavioral aspects, etc. This work will contribute to reestablishing a mutually beneficial connection between technology and ecology, which is needed for keeping engineering and other human activities within ecological constraints, and to ensure human well-being and sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Every day we witness the importance of natural ecosystems in sustaining all human activities.  These sustaining functions include the provision of clean air, foodstuffs, and clean water, among countless others.  Current methods for the design of man-made systems and built environments such as manufacturing facilities, transportation systems, buildings, and even entire cities, fail to recognize the importance of these natural ecosystems in supporting human activities. This failure to recognize the very foundations of human well-being can result in perverse outcomes from decisions meant to enhance sustainability and lost opportunities for the ability of nature to satisfy our collective human needs. This project developed a new framework for understanding and designing synergies between man-made systems and natural ecosystems to encourage greater harmony between human activities and nature. This framework considers man-made systems ranging from individual processes to supply chains and life cycles, along with corresponding ecological systems at multiple scales ranging from local communities to the entire planet.  Applying the framework to an actual industrial, man-made system, a biodiesel manufacturing site was investigated for redesign.  The demand for ecosystem services was quantified by emissions and resources used in the production of biodiesel, while the supply was provided by local ecosystems on the manufacturing site. This real-world application demonstrated that ecosystems can be economically and environmentally superior to man-made technologies for making progress toward zero emissions and ultimate environmental sustainability.  Building on the success of the application of the framework to the biodiesel manufacturing site, the framework was to extended to quantify the air pollution removal capacity of grasslands and shrublands at the county-level in the United States and estimate the human health benefits associated with pollution removal by these ecosystems.  Vegetation including canopy, grasslands, and shrublands can directly sequester pollutants onto the plant surface, resulting in an improvement in air quality.  This portion of the project quantified the air pollution removal capacity of grasslands and shrublands using the i-Tree Eco model.  Calculation of pollution removal capacity using local environmental data indicated that grasslands and shrublands remove a total of 6.42 million tonnes of air pollutants in the United States, with an associated monetary benefit of $268 million.  Further, human health impacts and associated monetary value due to pollution removal was observed to be significantly higher in urban areas indicating that grasslands and shrublands are equally critical as canopy in improving air quality and human health in cities.  The broadest application of the new framework investigated the nexus between buildings and the natural environments in which they are located.  Specifically, this application investigated the use of the new frameworks as a built environment design target.  Design targets are a central component of modern design of buildings and other infrastructure. However, design targets for sustainability-focused design of built environments have yet to be rigorously implemented throughout practice.  This project introduced the consideration of two types of limit states; engineering design targets and sustainability design targets.  Both types of targets are essential to sustainability-focused design.  Engineering design targets, such as design to prevent building collapse, have long been used and are well understood.  Sustainability design targets were introduced into building design by balancing the supply and demand of natural ecosystem services, which underpin our biosphere?s life support systems.  By introducing both engineering design targets and sustainability design targets, this project created an improved basis for design of buildings and other infrastructure that balance man-made built environments with the natural ecosystems they inhabit.  Throughout this project, real-world applications of this new framework have demonstrated that natural ecosystems can be economically and environmentally superior to man-made technologies for making progress toward zero emissions and ultimate sustainability.  Such conclusions have major impacts for all facets of society as we look to shift from an economy that co-opts natural ecosystems to an economy that is in harmony with natural ecosystems.
