<AbstractNarration>Biological processes play an important but under-appreciated role in shaping the land.  Indeed, in some places, plants and animals are the most important factors controlling variation in topography and thus patterns of habitats and hydrology on the land surface.  This work explores the role of biology in shaping the land surface in Big Cypress National Preserve (BICY), a complex and beautiful mosaic of cypress wetlands, pine uplands and deep water sloughs in southwest Florida.  BICY is a karst landscape, where limestone bedrock is present at the land surface.  While the landscape is almost perfectly flat, small wetland depressions carved into the limestone rock are crucially important for storing water and thus providing habitat for a wide array of plants and animals.  The origin of these wetland depressions is unknown.  This research will determine if these depressions, and their remarkably regular spacing on the landscape, are created by biological processes that naturally occur in wetlands that accelerate the rate at which limestone dissolves.  This creates the tantalizing possibility that the organisms populating these wetlands are slowly creating their own habitat by initiating and expanding topographic depressions.  The research team consists of scientists across a variety of disciplines, including hydrologists, geologists, biologists and modelers, creating the type of collaborative integration required to answer these types of research questions. Combining satellite and airborne data with detailed field measurements will allow the team to address how and how fast these depressions form, what that means for regional water flow and water quality, and how the topography and resulting patterns of habitats on the land surface were created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work contributes to an understanding of how ecological and geological processes work together to shape the land surface.  The central idea that patterns on the earth's surface arise spontaneously from interactions between plants and animals, on one hand, and rocks and water on the other, is a reminder of the strong and sometimes surprising links that exist in ecosystems.  In this case, wetland ecosystems are thought to change the shape of the land over thousands of years by dissolving rock.  This type of insight will contribute to understanding the origins of this landscape, which supports a remarkable array of organisms and habitats.  It will also improve understanding of hydrologic characteristics, and the impact of water movements on the greater South Florida system, including important elements of the Everglades.  Moreover, this work will help predict how ecosystem and biological processes may change as this very low altitude landscape is altered by sea-level rise.  Finally, the impacts of this work extend beyond south Florida because the project will contribute to an understanding of how karst landscapes form (20% of the earth's land surface) and how small geographically-isolated wetlands interact with their surroundings, a topic relevant to federal wetland protections.  A partnership with scientists within the National Park Service has been established to help communicate the results of the work, and the researchers will lead tours that allow the public to appreciate the subtleties of this captivating landscape.  The student participants will be exposed to a wide variety of disciplines and approaches, which is integral to training to address the complex questions and challenges society faces.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to understand the origins of wetland depressions in the Big Cypress National Preserve.  These wetlands occur in a regular spatial pattern, with wetlands rarely occurring in close proximity to one another. Our efforts to understand this unique landscape have yielded new insights into the role of plants in bedrock weathering, new ideas about how spatial patterns arise in ecological systems, and new ways to measure the hydrologic connections between wetlands and their surroundings.   To understand how wetlands form in the limestone bedrock of Big Cypress, we first developed a new model of limestone weathering that includes water movement down through and over soils and the release of acids from plant roots.  This model shows that plant roots accelerate weathering rates twenty-fold, and are as important as climate, topography, and soil depth in determining how quickly bedrock dissolves. Although developed to understand Big Cypress, it is likely that vegetation plays a major role in weathering in all landscapes that has been underappreciated.    This model also predicts that 2 meter deep wetlands (such as occur in Bid Cypress) would have taken about 10,000 years to develop.  We tested this prediction by comparing the volume of depressions to current export of calcium (a major element in limestone), by comparing deposition of the macronutrient phosophorus to its rate of accumulation in soils, and by measuring the age of insoluble organic matter in deep wetland soils using radioisotopes of carbon.  All of these approaches support the model prediction that wetlands are ~10,000 years old, which also corresponds to date of current sea levels.   The arrangement of wetlands in the Big Cypress landscape suggests that the depressions compete with one another, but prior to this project we did not know how.  We developed a second model that represents the growth of depressions in three dimensions and the connection between depressions and surrounding uplands.  This model shows that as depressions grow, they drain water from the surrounding landscape, which prevents nearby small depressions from growing and coalescing.  This negative feedback at a distance is what explains the regular arrangement of wetlands in Big Cypress.     One surprising finding of our model is that the wetland depressions are still growing.   This is surprising in part because of the regular arrangement of depressions indicates that the landscape has reached an equilibrium.  By turning off and on different processes in the model, we showed that wetland depressions would grow until their soil became too deep to allow acid to reach the bedrock.  Wetland growth also slows as they became too deep for trees to survive, at which point the acidity produced by the trees would no longer promote weathering.  Contrary to our initial hypothesis, evaporation of water by trees played little role in the growth of wetland depressions.  Together, these findings show that the varied and distinct landscapes that develop in limestone (or karst) terrain reflect a suite of ecological as well as geologic processes.  Finally, our efforts to understand how weathering products are removed from wetlands has led to new approaches to measure connections between wetlands and their surroundings.  Every day, trees transpire water while they absorb carbon dioxide.  At night, trees close their pores (stomates) and stop pulling water upwards.  By measuring the water level in wetlands at very fine intervals, we estimated the amount of water lost to trees, based on the rise and fall of water during the day.  This same record allows us to calculate the amount of water that enters the wetland through the ground or over the land surface.  In Big Cypress, the greatest inflow and outflow of water occurs when the water level is high, which means that most of the water movement in and out of these wetlands occurs as surface flow rather than groundwater.  We compared the water level threshold where surface flows begin with high-resolution LiDAR maps of wetland topography, and found that the water level records and the digital maps produced similar estimates of when wetlands are connected.  This method could be applied to many other landscapes where nominally isolated wetlands may play a major role in controlling floods and water quality.
