<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to establish the inter-relationship between dielectric breakdown and electric-field induced deformation of elastomeric materials. Integral to the research objective will be quantifying the role of defects as well as electric-field induced mechanical localization produced by conducting fibers and electrode geometry. The approach will be largely experimental with direct measurements of the deformation fields produced by pre-straining and applied voltages for different fiber electrode arrangements and for a variety of device geometries. The observations will be compared with and complemented by modeling studies based on theories of nonlinear electro-mechanical coupling of deformable dielectrics. Together, these will be used to design and construct proof-of-concept electrically controlled devices capable of extreme strains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits of this research will include simplified designs for utilizing dielectric elastomers in engineering applications including energy harvesting devices, linear actuators and displays.  The project will also contribute to Harvard's existing outreach programs involving undergraduate research and local high-school outreach, other community outreach programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In our project, we have been studying an unusual class of materials, soft rubber-like materials (elastomers) that respond to an electric field by changing their shape. Formally, these materials are known as dielectric elastomers. Because they can change shape when an electric field is applied, are transparent and are as soft and flexible as human skin, there is great interest in using them in "soft robotics" and in optical devices.  Our research began at a rather fundamental level by addressing two related questions: (1) how we could engineer the internal structure of the elastomer to alter the shape change when a voltage is applied through its thickness and (2) what are the details of the local deformation of the elastomer in the vicinity of a cylindrical fiber when an electric field is applied.  On the basis of the coupling between the electrical and mechanical interactions involved, and solving the appropriate equations, we found that by incorporating a few, stiff fibers into the elastomer we could produce a preferred direction to the shape change perpendicular to the fiber direction. This naturally led to the ability to create specific shape changes by selecting the internal architecture of a few stiffeners, much as a few "spars" are used in sailing boats to change the shape of sails in response to a wind. At smaller lengths, where the fibers are nanofibers, there is a different response when the fibers are used to form the electrodes.  In this case, the electric field induced force on the nanofibers pushes them into the elastomer causing an initially flat elastomer surface to roughen. This was revealed in detail using confocal and scanning microscopy but we found that the effects could also be seen by eye in an apparent loss of transparency.  The loss of transparency we observed depended on the voltage but full transparency was restored when the voltage was removed. This was a wholly unexpected result and led to the demonstration of a new voltage tunable window, whose transmittance could be quickly be altered between being fully transparent and opaque. (Extensive world-wide publicity of the work was received at the time in both the news press, TV and the popular science press).  An attractive feature of the device is that it can be made on existing large glass windows using thin sheets of a commercial elastomer materials with sprayed carbon or silver nanowires as transparent electrodes, so it is intrinsically suited to large scale manufacture.  A provisional patent has been applied for and the device is being investigated together with an industrial partner.  The electro-mechanical mechanisms underlying the voltage tunable window have been identified and studied further. These mechanisms will be part of the PhD theses of two woman who are studying for their PhD.  The project has also been used for three undergraduate students and one high school student to gain practical experience in performing research as well as in learning some elements of mechanics of materials.  In another outgrowth of the project as it developed, a third graduate student has been awarded his PhD for combining dielectric elastomers, as a mechanical tuning element, with silicon-based metalenses to create a flat, adaptive optical lens with simultaneous electrical control of focal length, astigmatism and image shift. This, too, is being patented.          Last Modified: 04/05/2018       Submitted by: David R Clarke]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
