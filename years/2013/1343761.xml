<AbstractNarration>This EarthCube Building Blocks project intends to build  ODSIP (Open Data Services Invocation Protocol) to provide a range of open specification in client/server libraries. The core idea is that key parts of EarthCube can be built effectively around clients and servers that employ a common and conceptually rich protocols for data acquisition. The components will be developed 1) an open specification for ODSIP (as a DAP4 extension); 2) a reference implementation of ODSIP in open-source libraries; and&lt;br/&gt;3) client-server demonstrations that show how ODSIP supports three selected geoscience scenarios, each demonstration to be guided by a geoscientist. The three scenarios are: 1) accelerated visualization/analysis of model outputs on non-rectangular&lt;br/&gt;meshes (over coastal North Carolina); 2) dynamic downscaling of climate predictions for regional utility (over Hawaii); and 3) feature-oriented retrievals of satellite imagery (focusing on satellite-derived sea-surface-temperature fronts).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader implications of ODSIP include democratizing the use of geoscience data, illustrated in particular by how two of the three geoscience scenarios will benefit emergency managers and inform decision makers about region-specific risks of climate change. The broader implications also include strengthening common understandings across the EarthCube community.</AbstractNarration>
