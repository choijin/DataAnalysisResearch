<AbstractNarration>Unlike traditional fast SPICE simulation techniques that rely on a variety of approximation approaches to trade off simulation accuracy for greater speed, SPICE-accurate integrated circuit (IC) simulations can truthfully predict circuit electrical behaviors, and therefore become indispensable for design and verification of nanoscale ICs. However, for post-layout nanoscale circuits, using traditional SPICE-accurate simulation techniques to encapsulate multi-million or even multi-billion devices coupled through complex parasitics can be prohibitively expensive, and thus not applicable to large IC designs, since the runtime and memory cost for solving large sparse matrix problems using direct solution methods will increase quickly with the growing circuit sizes and parasitics densities. To achieve greater simulation efficiency and capacity during post-layout simulations, preconditioned iterative solution techniques have been recently proposed to substitute the direct solution methods. However, existing preconditioned methods for post-layout circuit simulations are typically designed with various assumptions and constraints on the circuit and systems to be analyzed, which therefore cannot be effectively and reliably applied to general-purpose SPICE-accurate circuit simulations. In this research project, the PI will study efficient yet robust circuit-oriented preconditioning approaches for scalable SPICE-accurate post-layout IC simulations by leveraging recent graph sparsification research. By systematically sparsifying linear/nonlinear dynamic networks originated from dense parasitics components and complex device elements of post-layout circuits, scalable, and more importantly, parallelizable preconditioned iterative algorithms will be investigated and developed by the PI to enable much greater speed and capacity for SPICE-accurate IC simulations in both time and frequency domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful completion of this work will immediately benefit the semiconductor industries. The algorithms and methodologies to be developed through this project will be integrated into undergraduate/graduate level VLSI design/CAD courses, while the research results will be broadly disseminated to major semiconductor and EDA companies for potential industrial applications. The CAD tools developed under this research plan will also be exchanged with collaborating industrial partners. The acquired experience in the proposed research plan is also likely to contribute to computing advances in other science and engineering fields, impacting broader research areas that are related to large/complex system modeling and simulation.</AbstractNarration>

We have also developed a highly-parallel graph-theoretic preconditioning method for Harmonic Balance analysis of microwave and RF circuits, which achieved up to 20X speedups compared to the state-of-the-art HB simulation algorithm published in DAC?09 by Berkeley Design Automation. The new method is built upon our recent graph sparsification research as well as a sparse block matrix solver optimized for modern CPU-GPU heterogeneous computing platforms.  We developed a nearly-linear time yet practically-efficient spectral graph sparsification algorithm that can immediately lead to the development of nearly-linear time sparse symmetric diagonally-dominant (SDD) matrix solvers and spectral graph (data) partitioning (clustering) algorithms. This work can potentially allow constructing circuit proxies with guaranteed high quality and sparsity, which will be critical for future nanoscale IC designs that involve increasingly stronger couplings due to complex parasitics components. We have released a preliminary software "GRASS: GRAph Spectral Sparsifier" (https://sites.google.com/mtu.edu/zhuofeng-graphspar/home). GRASS is the first highly efficient graph spectral sparsification engine that scales almost linearly with the size of the input graph Laplacian. The spectrally sparsified graphs computed by GRASS can approximately preserve the distances or effective resistances between vertices so that much faster numerical and graph-related algorithms can be developed based on these sparsified graphs. For example, spectrally sparsified social (data) networks may allow for more efficiently modeling, mining and analysis of large social (data) networks, spectrally sparsified circuit networks may lead to more efficient simulation, optimization and verification of large integrated circuit systems, etc. We have been trying hard to disseminate the research outcome of this research in the industrial and academic sectors by publishing in top IEEE/ACM conferences and journals. We also have delivered many research presentations to industrial partners, such as Cadence Design Systems and Intel Corporation, as well as many universities, such as University of California San Diego, Duke University, Carnegie Mellon University, The University of Pittsburgh, University at Buffalo, Lehigh University, University of Houston, Tsinghua University, Peking University, The University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Shenzhen University, Fudan University, ShanghaiTech University, Sun Yat-Sen University, etc, to disseminate our latest research results.   The research investigation of graph sparsification techniques for IC simulations will immediately benefit the solver developments for large-scale sparse matrix problems involved in other engineering fields that require solving large linear/nonlinear partial differential equations, such as computational fluid dynamics, and computational electromagnetics. It is expected that graph sparsification related research outcome will immediately benefit other research communities that heavily rely on scientific computing, such as machine learning, data mining, computer vision, image processing, network analysis, and computational biology.
