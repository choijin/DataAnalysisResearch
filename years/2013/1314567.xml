<AbstractNarration>Marine oil spills can release large volumes of persistently toxic chemicals into the environment, and many large active oil fields are in close proximity to high-density coastal human populations where humans can be exposed through clean-up and remediation efforts, through contact with oiled media in popular vacation areas, and through the food chain. Despite many large oil spills in recent years close to populated regions, and a few studies testing for acute and psychological impacts in humans, remarkably little is known of the medium and long-term health impacts of oil spills on important biological processes such as reproduction, development, growth, and performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, a research team from the University of California at Davis, the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, and the Louisiana State University and A &amp; M College will explore the biological impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to study such effects. They will use the Gulf killifish as a sentinel animal model because they offer an opportunity to carefully link cause with effect by virtue of their relatively short life cycle, a well-provisioned molecular and physiological toolkit, their local residence and well-documented exposure to the event in the field, and because they are tractable for laboratory and field studies providing an opportunity to verify predicted effects in the real world. Fish are established models for human health and development, and killifish are particularly appropriate for studying consequences of the DWH oil spill specifically because they are abundant, local, and non-migratory residents of Gulf of Mexico regions directly affected by the spill event. The team already has evidence that killifish were exposed and affected by the event. Now their objectives are to test for oil spill effects at various sensitive stages of the vertebrate life cycle including effects that span generations, to characterize the spatial and temporal extent of vertebrate risk from the spill, and to test for the influence of individual and population genetic variation on sensitivity to oil pollution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: There remains a clear deficiency in our understanding of health effects from hydrocarbon exposures that emerge over the medium and long term.  This research will offer insight into risk and mechanisms of oil spill impacts in a vertebrate model, offer biomarkers predictive or reflective of impaired biological processes, and accelerate the discovery of genetic and physiological risk factors. The project will support the training of PhD students and undergraduate researchers. PhD students from both LSU and UC-Davis will participate in EnvironMentors, a program that pairs graduate students with students from local high schools for an academic year, during which time participants are guided in the completion of an independent research project to be presented as a scientific poster at a local science fair. The LSU group will also present these posters and other summarized research results at Ocean Commotion, a yearly event organized by the Louisiana Sea Grant College Program, which attract thousands of local K-8 students. Given the socio-economical landscape of Louisiana, a diverse elementary school and undergraduate student body will be engaged by these outreach efforts. Furthermore, undergraduate research participation of groups that are historically underrepresented in the sciences will be supported through programs offered by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (LSU), the Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation (LSU), and Aggie Ambassadors program (UC Davis). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;JOINT FUNDING BY NSF AND NIEHS:  The original proposal on which this project is based (R01 ES021934-01) was submitted to the National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences (NIH/NIEHS) in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement RFA-ES-11-013 , "Oceans, Great Lakes and Human Health (R01)", an opportunity jointly sponsored by NSF.   This project is cooperatively funded through separate awards from NSF and NIEHS.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We sought to explore the sub-lethal impacts of oil exposure in developing fish. Furthermore, we were interested in whether populations differed in their responses to oil, and whether exposure in one generation affected the general health and the sensitivity to oil in the next generation. We found that hatching success and heart rate were sensitive indicators of the impacts of exposures to crude oil in developing Gulf killifish embryos. We also found that exposure to low doses of oil during embryogenesis had negative neurological effects once those fish had hatched; these effects included changes in swim behavior, elevated excitability, and altered location preference, which could adversely affect sensitivity to predation. We exposed adult killifish to crude oil, then moved them to clean water and tested their ability to spawn, and tested the health of their offspring. We found that fish exposed to oil had significantly reduced fertilization success. Furthermore, embryos that were fertilized from exposed parents tended to have elevated sensitivity to oil toxicity compared to embryos from parents that were not exposed to oil. This indicates that the negative impacts of oiling on fish development are enhanced if exposures span a generation. Gene expression during development also differed between lineages with different exposure histories in the previous generation, offering insight into the molecular mechanisms that mediate trans-generational impacts of oil. Populations differed in their response to oil. Most populations showed a consistently negative and similar impact of oil on development. However, a population collected from the historically polluted Houston Ship Channel (TX) exhibited resistance to the impacts of oil on adult fertilization success and embryo development. This population also did not exhibit any trans-generational impacts of oil exposure. Data from population genetics studies indicates that this resistance emerged from natural selection that impaired the function of a key signaling pathway following dozens of generations of exposure to PCBs and other pollutants in the Houston Ship Channel. This adaptation likely offered cross-resistance to oil since oil and PCBs share similar mechanisms of toxicity.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/12/2018<br>      Modified by: Andrew&nbsp;Whitehead</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
