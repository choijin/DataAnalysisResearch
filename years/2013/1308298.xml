<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Dvora Perahia of Clemson University will resolve the internal structure and dynamics of poly-dots, new soft nanoparticles, and probe their interaction with the environment. The research will provide a fundamental structural understanding of the factors that control the light emitting and absorbing properties of these particles through the combination of molecular dynamics simulations and neutron scattering methods.  In the first stage, nanoparticles will be made from di-alkyl poly(paraphenylene ethynylene)s, and then the complexity of the nanoparticle will be increased by substituting the side chains of the polymer with various types of groups. The broader impacts of the research project include training graduate and undergraduate students in combined neutron scattering and computational methods, and engaging local high school students via a science club and directing them towards summer research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plastics are long chain organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life, including food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and lightweight electronic devices.    Electrically conducting carbon-based (organic) molecules and polymers hold enormous promise for realizing highly efficient, affordable, and broadly available electronic and optical devices.  This research explores the molecular picture of a new type of very small conducting polymer particle, and resolves the effects of specific chemistries on the structure and behavior of the molecules that build these new materials.</AbstractNarration>

These are often referred to as polydots. To realize their full potential and move these NPs from a laboratory idea into use, their structure, stability and the motion have been studied using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations accompanied by neutron experimental techniques. &nbsp;These studies resulted in numerous publications and presentations that describe a new understanding of the factors that control soft nanoparticles. This knowledge will significantly accelerate the transition of polydots from a fundamental idea to biotechnology.&nbsp; In parallel, the efforts impact broader activities that have enhanced the accessibility of graduate students to computational tools in the US and across the world.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The study focused on one family of polymers, di-substituted poly(<em>para</em>phe&shy;ny&shy;lene&shy;&shy;ethynylene)s (PPEs). &nbsp;The first phase of the research probed non-ionic PPEs followed by a second phase where the effects of ionic groups on structure and stability of the nanoparticle were studied. &nbsp;The success of the project stems from our computational efforts, that together with insight from neutrons where able to resolve the structure and dynamics of polydots.&nbsp;&nbsp; Underling the entire project has been our first success where we were able to develop a computational method to prepare the soft nanoparticles in a manner similar to the experimental procedures.

This structure remains when quenched back below the glass transition temperature, enabling the encapsulation of cargo. (S. Maskey et al., Macromolecules 2016).
