<AbstractNarration>The Division of Chemistry supports the efforts of Professor Pinjing Zhao of North Dakota State University Fargo for catalyst development and increased mechanistic understanding of rhodium-and ruthenium-mediated carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond activation and decarboxylation.  This research project develops the [3+2] reaction of unsubstituted imines, further develops catalytic C-H alkylation of electron deficient arenes, and investigates rhodium-mediated stoichiometric and catalytic decarboxylation.   A number of rhodium(I) and ruthenium(II) complexes with phosphine  and N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands are isolated and characterized.  The research plan is integrated with educational and outreach activities through the COINS (Career Opportunities In Natural Sciences) Program.  This program encourages undergraduate and graduate students to explore various career opportunities in the natural sciences and reaches out to rural communities in the region to enhance public awareness of scientific research and career opportunities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF Division of Chemistry supports the efforts of Professor Pinjing Zhao of North Dakota State University Fargo for the development of transition metal-based homogeneous catalysts.  Rational design of efficient catalytic processes relies heavily on mechanistic understanding of relevant elementary organometallic reactions. Towards this goal, Professor Zhao and his group develop metal-catalyzed coupling reactions for the efficient carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bond formations needed for the synthesis of new pharmaceuticals and commodity chemicals.  In addition to his research, Professor Zhao initiated and leads the educational and outreach program, Career Opportunities in Natural Sciences (COINS).  Through this award and the COINS Program, Professor Zhao organizes annual summer workshops for 15-20 high school students and their science teachers in rural North Dakota and western Minnesota.  Students and faculty participate in discussions on the social and economic impacts of research advances, technology transfer and commercialization, and career opportunities in chemistry and other natural sciences.</AbstractNarration>
