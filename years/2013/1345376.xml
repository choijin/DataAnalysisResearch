<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and commercialize an online video-sharing platform that scales math teacher education and training.  The platform embeds a novel pedagogical method that combines gamification, algorithm-based peer review processes, and social learning technologies.  The platform allows aspiring and new math teachers to develop and hone their teaching skills through frequent practice, observation of self, observation of others, and peer and expert feedback loops. The goal for the project is to beta test a prototype of the platform, collect survey responses, and iterate the prototype in response to the users' experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project is to provide a platform for math teachers dispersed across the U.S. to learn from each other and strengthen their teaching skills by providing multiple opportunities for the teachers to practice skills, observe themselves, observe and collaborate with other teachers, and learn from mentors. Each of these steps has been identified as critical to effective teacher training.  Recent meta-analyses of research show that teacher professional development has a significant positive effect on student achievement.  Compared to 60 world education systems, the U.S. ranked ninth in fourth grade math and twelfth in eighth grade math.  The proposed training platform is an innovative response to the need for low-cost, high-scale math teacher training.  Investing in innovative math teacher education and training will foster higher student achievement in math and consequently, fill existing high skill jobs, spur innovation, and play a role in the growth of the U.S. economy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ApprenNet platform provides instructors tools to build exercises that replicate key components of a successful live classroom or training experience without losing the quality of instruction associated with these live experiences when moving the exercises online. Learners develop and hone skills on ApprenNet through role-playing, peer review, and access to expert demonstration and feedback.  This Phase I research project was to test whether the ApprenNet platform could be used successfully to scale the training of teachers with a particular focus on middle school math teachers.  The significance of this Phase I research project lies in the role teachers play in society. An effective teacher is the critical component to a studentÆs success; therefore, supporting the development of effective teachers is essential to economic growth that relies on a vibrant public education system. Both graduate schools of education and school districts have long struggled with how to effectively and cost-efficiently hone and develop high quality teachers. The need for an economic and scalable solution has only become more acute as more and more schools and districts face steep budgets cut.  In Phase I, ApprenNet successfully tested its patent-pending, simulation-based online learning platform with a meaningful group of novice and master teachers, adapted the platform in response to user feedback, and demonstrated the platform to dozens of potential clients.  The primary objective of the Phase I research was to beta test a prototype of the platform, collect user feedback, and iterate the prototype in response to usersÆ experience. While extendable to every aspect of teacher training, the initial focus of our Phase I research was math teacher education and training.  ApprenNet beta tested the platform with twenty classroom teachers and instructional coaches.  In addition to the original Phase I objectives, ApprenNet conducted a small efficacy test to determine if educators who used the platform experienced increased teaching competency. The study included an analysis of pre- and post-videos teachers submitted to a three-month online course ApprenNet developed and launched in February 2014. In scoring and comparing the videos to detect growth, researchers analyzed four standards on the Mathematical Quality of Instruction (MQI) rubric. Five teachers completed the entire course. Each of theses five teachers demonstrated significant gains in teacher quality.  Subsequent to completion of the Phase I research project, ApprenNet entered into an agreement with a major publisher to pilot the platform with one of its client school districts.  The pilot is currently underway.  If successful, the intent is to incorporate the platform into the publisherÆs new teacher training curriculum.
