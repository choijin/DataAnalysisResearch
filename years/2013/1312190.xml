<AbstractNarration>This award supports an international workshop to be convened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2013 by Dr. James H. Smith (University of California, Davis). The purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers from the United States, Europe, and Africa who are experts on the social consequences of the extractive mining of mineral resources. The conference will enable scientists to share their findings to date, to establish international research collaborations, and to plan for future research. Minerals such as coltan, cassiterite, and wolframite are of critical importance both for local African economies and governments and also for modern technologies and global trade.  The workshop will also support graduate education by including American graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funding was for a foiur day academic conference on artisanal  mining, and the conflict between industrial and artisanal mining.  The conference was carried out in Luhwindja, South Kivu, in the Eastern DR Congo.  This is a region that has experienced a great deal of conflict and resistance to the Canadian gold mining company, Banro, which has tried to expel local artisanal miners from the land that it has purchased from the central government, with much local opposition.  Economists and policy makers tend to associate industrial mining with national development and progress, and often portray artisanal mining as a chaotic, even criminal, activity.  But artisanal mining is highly organized and generative of complex social and political orders.  Moreover, artisanal miners and traders are integrated in complex regional networks.  Wherever they spring up, communities of miners generate complex divisions of labor that often resist industrialized mining while contributing to local economies.  Moreover, the social and political organization of mining is not necessarily criminal, and varies greatly from site to site, and nowhere is this truer than in the Eastern DRC.  At the same time, artisanal mining poses many challenges to sustainable food production, ecology and, perhaps, to the creation of a coherent national state.   Intellectual Merits and Broader Impacts  Luhwindja was an exceptionally productive place to have a discussion about the conflicts and contrasts between industrial and artisanal mining, and the impact of both.  It a major site for artisanal mining but, in recent years, Luhwindja has shifted to industrial gold mining under the auspices of the  Canadian company Banro, which promotes itself as an engine of development for the region. Luhwindja is the staging ground for a tense collision of viewpoints and agendas over natural resources and modes of extraction, a context defined by a new form of resource extraction and a new mode of state governance, in which a foreign corporation subsidizes the state on the ground.  Predictably, there has been a great deal of misunderstanding on all sides, and the citizens of Luhwindja and Banro have very different ideas about BanroÆs activities, the value of industrial and artisanal mining, and the organization of mining prior to BanroÆs entry into the community. Conference participants were able to talk with community members about the nature of these recent changes, and community members had an amazing opportunity to listen to academics and experts in the field of mining.  The conference enabled scholars and students interested in resource extraction in Africa to develop connections with each other and with African researchers, and for Congolese researchers and institutions to develop insights and connections with scholars from outside the Congo.   Over the course of three days, we held 6 separate panels, each with four scholars.  There were Congolese scholars from multiple disciplines (anthropology, economics, political science, ecology, and others), and four American scholars.  The conference was attended by local leaders and Banro representatives, and included sustained discussion and interaction between academics, company representatives, and local residents of varying backgrounds. In addition, a local institute, the Institute for Development Research in the Congo, helped organize the event, and this was an opportunities for their scholars and undergraduate students to interact with other academics and to make connections in a rural community.    Some of the issues we discussed included:     The social and political consequences of mining in Luhwindja, and howthe Luhwindja case compare with other places with an experience of industrial mining.  Moreover, how the history of mining, in Luhwindja and elsewhere, affects the experience of mining today.  Whether mining (industrial and artisanal) can contribute to economic growth and political stability, and under what conditions.  ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
