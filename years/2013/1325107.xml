<AbstractNarration>Colombia is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world, and broader societal participation is urgently needed to prevent ecosystem degradation, extinction of irreplaceable endemic species, and fair distribution of natural resource benefits. In rural Colombia, however, where biodiversity, ecosystem services, and local livelihoods intersect, pervasive inequity and social unrest has persisted for decades and challenged sustainable development progress. Nonetheless, in the midst of those difficulties, some rural communities have self-organized to integrate their livelihoods with biodiversity conservation. Examples of those grassroots initiatives are the Networks of Reserves of the Civil Society, known locally as "Redes de Reservas de la Sociedad Civil"  which emerged 20 years ago as a conservation and development initiative in the Southern Colombian Andes and now boasts of more than 400 Reserves most of them owned by small farmers. These reserves play an important role in protecting biodiversity and ecosystem services, and many are officially considered part of Colombia's National System of Protected Areas. This research explores the factors that motivate farmers and rural landowners to strive for a balance between conservation and rural development through those grassroots initiatives, and to assess the effectiveness of these reserves in terms of conservation and sustainable livelihoods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Considering biodiversity and ecosystem services as common pool resources in urgent need of sustainable management, the researchers focus on resource users and the governance system, two components of the theoretical framework for socio-ecological systems developed by the late Nobel Laureate, Elinor Ostrom. This research explores both socio-economic factors, the farmers' psychological characteristics, and personal social/professional networks. Elements of social-psychology theories of Value-Belief-Norm and Self-determination are incorporated to analyze decision making at the individual level. Social networks analysis are used to understand how structural properties of land owners' informal and formal personal networks influence social learning and participation on decisions for natural resource governance.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide new insights from the under-represented perspective of small rural landowners - information that can directly contribute to the design of public policies that advance both biodiversity conservation and community well-being. Improvement of rural livelihoods is vital to foster economic stability, food security, and better and diverse sources of legal employment; and ultimately, to advance the goals of social stability, national security and democracy. Results from this research will provide new insights on the factors that foster or hinder conservation and sustainable rural development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ "From individual decisions to collective action for biodiversity conservation: Networks of Reserves of the Civil Society in Colombia"  This research focused on voluntary forest conservation initiatives linked through a network of reserves of Colombian civil society. For more than two decades Colombian farmers and rural landowners have been working to integrate forest conservation and sustainable agriculture on their own private properties, setting aside forest reserves of diverse sizes, ranging from less than one to thousands of hectares. Owners can be subsistence farmers, but also commercial farmers or wealthy landowners. These reserves play a key role not only in terms of positive ecological outcomes, but also in terms of social wellbeing, community engagement and development. Conservation through civil society reserves is widespread, and private landowners officially enrolled in those organizational networks that were studied are just a small portion of a growing movement of unregistered and self-declared reserves that is promoting voluntary conservation in different regions of the country.  While most of these reserves provide ecosystem services to surrounding communities, less than 10% of reserve owners interviewed had received any economic incentive (such as small tax breaks) to preserve forest on their land. To the contrary, all pay taxes for their forested land, and for some, this may represent a significant portion of their income. Most Landowners do not exploit the forest for commercial purposes, and our study will quantify the opportunity costs they bear as most have decided to forego other productive uses on suitable land.  Rational choice and economic theories are the basis for most current conservation strategies, and extensive efforts have been focused on understanding the causes of land use change and forest degradation. Our research, however, employs a different approach by trying to understand the decision making process of those who are voluntarily working towards a more sustainable use of fragile forest ecosystems in the Colombian Andes.  Research analyses are ongoing, however data obtained through extensive interviews and field visits to 182 reserves clearly point out that economic factors are just one of the many variables individuals weigh when making conservations decisions. Evidence from our study suggest that those decisions are far from economically "rational", and that social, psychological, emotional and even spiritual factors can be stronger motivators than economic factors to preserve forest on their land. As one of the participants who is protecting 5 ha of forest in his 12 ha property said: "Money sometimes can be a limitation, but it has never been a motivation".  One of the main questions of our research was: Why did you decide to conserve that forest on your land? Qualitative analysis of the interviews has revealed four main thematic responses:  (1) Enhance ecosystem services such as water, soil and biodiversity, as they recognize the benefits for their own livelihoods as well as for family and community wellbeing.  (2) Social support and learning opportunities obtained through social interactions with like-minded people.  (3) Emotional reasons such as love for nature, trees, and animals, childhood experiences with nature and a concern for future generations.  (4) Psychological motivations. Research participants articulated being moved to action by their own personal values, a sense of place and identity, individual agency, and self-determination.  Given the complexity of current socio-ecological issues in rural areas in Colombia and other developing countries, it may be wise to promote civil society involvement in conservation. Our research suggests that a viable complement to traditional protected area approaches is rapidly gaining ground &ndash; one that considers the agency of rural landowners and the diversity of factors that influence their decisions to conserve natural areas that are...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
