<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation's (NSF) Historically Black College's and Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) is providing support to Virginia State University (VSU) through its Targeted Infusion Project (TIP) funding opportunity to increase the quality of science teaching at the K-6 grade level.  This teacher preparation project represents a joint venture between the College of Natural and Health Sciences and College of Education as well as local school districts in central Virginia to increase interest, pedagogical skills, confidence and expertise of preservice elementary education teachers to teach science utilizing research-based instructional methods.  The project will pair preservice teachers with science majors and biology faculty to work collaboratively on interdisciplinary projects, allow for field-based experiences that incorporate applied knowledge, practices, and hands-on learning by exposing preservice teachers to practical application of science concepts, enable preservice teachers' participation in professional development conferences and activities; and enhance VSU's College of Education Teaching and Learning Resource Center with science resources.  The project supports both formal and informal learning for thirty (30) pre-service teachers over a three-year period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be evaluated using the Teaching Science as Inquiry (TSI) survey instrument to measure teacher's self-efficacy as it relates specifically to classroom practice.</AbstractNarration>

From the University perspective, greater interest and confidence among preservice teachers should translate into more scientifically literate students with enhanced teaching skills, who are better prepared to enter the workforce.
