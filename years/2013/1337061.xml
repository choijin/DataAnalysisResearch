<AbstractNarration>1337061&lt;br/&gt;PI: Bothun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A versatile process will be created where small lipid bilayer vesicles or liposomes will be used as biocompatible templates for creating magnetic-gold core-shell nanoparticles with varying core and shell morphologies. The core-shell nanoparticles will provide a structure where the magnetic core responds to permanent magnetic or alternating radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields, and the gold shell responds photonically to ultraviolet-visible or near infrared (NIR) light. RF and NIR absorbance will be examined as a function of core-shell structure, including spherical and tubular geometries. By exploiting the ability of the core-shell nanoparticles to convert the absorbed field energy into heat, controlled release from liposome-templated nanoparticles using dual NIR and RF triggers will be examined. This approach represents an original strategy and the project is expected to lead to transformative advances in the way multifunctional nanoparticles are synthesized and the way nanoparticles respond and react to simultaneous NIR and RF fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rises in the spread and severity of chronic diseases coupled with the need for selective, non-invasive treatments have created a demand for more effective therapies. In addition to being economical and having long-term chemical and physical stability, the ideal therapeutic system would be multifunctional providing disease targeting, imaging, diagnostic, and drug delivery capabilities. Magnetic-gold core-shell nanoparticles represent such a system where multiple therapeutic objectives can be realized. Students will impacted by this work through direct training, curriculum development, and STEM outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by Particulate and Multiphase Processes and Thermal Transport Processing Programs in Chemical, Biological, Environmental, and Transport Division in Engineering Directorate.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Through this award we examined a new method using small, soft biological materials as templates to create particles that combined gold and iron oxide. The template comprised of lipid bilayer vesicles or liposomes containing a coating of naturally derived charge polymers, which formed hollow capsules in the nanometer size range. These hollow templates were used to encapsulate iron nanoparticles and then guide the synthesis of a thin gold nanoshell on the template surface. Iron oxide nanoparticles are used as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and can be heated in the presence of electromagnetic field that are safe for human exposure.

A total of five graduate students and three undergraduate students in engineering disciplines were involved in this project. Through their work, it was demonstrated that (1) the templating technique can be used to control the shape and morphology of gold nanoshells and that these nanoshells exhibit high near infrared absorbance and heating in the region associated with tissue penetration; (2) that computer simulations can be used to guide the design of gold nanoshells with high near infrared activity; and (3) that multifunctional iron oxide/gold nanoshells structures can be formed and be activated to produce heat through alternating electromagnetic and near infrared fields.
