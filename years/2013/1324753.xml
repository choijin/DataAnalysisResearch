<AbstractNarration>In this Cyberlearning: Transforming Education DIP project, the PIs are building and evaluating a technological and curricular infrastructure to empower scalable, low-cost experimentations for undergraduates and K-12 students in the life sciences. The infrastructure exploits two technologies that have been developed by the PIs: biotic systems, which enable low-cost remote experimentation in biology, and bifocal modeling, which motivates students to engage in deep scientific inquiry by comparing physical and virtual models in real time.  Using a low-cost local or remote Biological Printing Unit (BPU), learners will 'print' organisms into petri dishes and run experiments with live materials. Each learner will have control over the empirical apparatus for as long as needed, due to the low cost and scalability of the system. The living material itself has a small footprint, and ever-advancing high-throughput technologies, such as automated microscopy and DNA sequencing, enable cost-effective, automated multiplexing of massive numbers of simple, learner-guided experiments, allowing learners to each personally carry out successions of experiments. The second innovation is juxtaposition, in real time, of the physical experimentation with  computer modeling, known as Bifocal Modeling, allowing students to observe and explore the real-world growth, interactions, and characteristics of their organisms in parallel with observing outcomes of models representing their understanding of the biological phenomena underlying organism activity and subsequently refine their explanations and understanding. Research focuses on cognitive affordances and constraints of this new bifocal epistemic form, the supports needed by learners to handle the complexities of this potentially powerful approach, and the progressions in student proficiency in design and execution of experiments when they have both real and virtual models available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs are addressing the significant challenge of how to bring modern bioscience into classrooms and informal learning environments, at low cost and with substantial variety. The platform they are creating, which integrates Biological Printing Devices with Bifocal Modeling, provides for more open exploration and realism in what learners can experience than is possible simply with simulations and virtual experiments. Schools and universities will be able to integrate more advanced biology experiments into their lab curricula as a result of this investigation, broadening exposure of all students, especially the less privileged, to the life sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Computer technology has evolved from large number-crunching machines in the 1950s to today's interactive devices of ubiquitous professional and personal use. People like Douglas Engelbart, Joseph Licklider, Ralph Baer, and Seymour Papert made computing interactive, accessible, intuitive, affordable, and fun. We are inspired to enable equivalent devices and human-computer interactions for the life-sciences by utilizing constantly advancing technologies like microfluidics, lab robotics, and genetic engineering.</p> <p>Many access barriers to life-science experimentation currently exist for education as well as for research, e.g., due to training needs, equipment costs, and safety considerations. The goal of this Cyberlearning project was to conceptualize, implement, and user test biology cloud labs (BCL) that could significantly lower these access barriers. Akin to the cloud computation paradigm, a BCL enables remote users, e.g., students or scientists, to perform biology experiments through a web interface on an automated lab that is housed at a different location and which can be time-shared between many users.</p> <p>Our project leadership consisted of Bioengineering Professor Ingmar Riedel-Kruse and Education Professor Paulo Blikstein. Specifically, we were driven to develop BCLs that could resolve substantial educational needs: Familiarity with advanced scientific practices and 'authentic inquiry' are imperative for K12 and college education (see Next Generation Science Standards, NGSS) but are difficult to achieve in real-world classrooms given logistics and cost. In addition to traditional physical hands-on labs, virtual and remote labs have recently been successfully deployed in various STEM disciplines. But remote labs for life science education did not exist - in large part because of the associated logistics of handling living specimen. We set out to solve this challenge and to develop the corresponding concepts and technologies for biology education. We also rationalized that our work will be applicable for professional and citizen science research.</p> <p>Our project Outcomes and Intellectual Merits fall into engineering and educational components:</p> <p>First, we developed foundational hardware and programming concepts to make interaction with biology accessible: (i) In analogy to CPUs/GPUs, we conceptualized Biotic Processing Units (BPUs) that house, actuate, and measure microbiological systems robustly long term, and where digital stimulus instructions convert to digital output of analog biological behavior. We then investigated different domain-specific BPU designs suited for different biology experiments. (ii) We implemented programming languages to instruct such BPUs to enable the development of versatile real-time interactive applications such experiments, art, and games.</p> <p>We then developed and implemented two BCLs that also demonstrate the two major (and fundamentally different) biology interaction paradigms: (i) Turn-based batch experimentation, where 1-day long experiments on slime-mold (Physarum) chemotaxis from multiple users are executed in parallel on one BPU. (ii) Real-time interactive experimentation, where 1-minute long experiments on microswimmer (Euglena) phototaxis are executed sequentially on one BPU. In both cases, we set up a cluster of BPUs to increase throughput. Especially the Euglena based cloud lab could scale cost-effectively to millions of phototaxis experiments/year (~1 cent/ experiment) - sufficient to support a nation-wide educational impact.</p> <p>We then developed lesson plans and instructional materials around these BCL, furthermore a modeling platform that allows students to develop quantitative mathematical and biophysical models to compare to their experiments, i.e., to engage in Bifocal Modeling. We deployed and user-tested these BCL in various educational settings: (i) We run multiple user studies in K12 and university settings. (ii) We delivered the first massive open online course (MOOC) that enabled students globally to execute key scientific practices including real biology experiments and open-ended, self-driven inquiry. (iii) In collaborated with Prof. Kemi Jona (Northwestern University) we evaluated BCL integration into third-party platforms (iLab) and ran teacher training workshops. (iv) We let three teachers design their own lesson plans and integrate the BCL into their regular curriculum.</p> <p>Regarding Broader Impact, more than 1,000 students (from over 40 countries) and more than 10 instructors (teachers) have participated in these studies; ~100 teachers have been reached during training - demonstrating scalability, versatility, and educational effectiveness of BCLs. Logging of diverse user data enabled large-scale learning analytics to understand more generally how students learn, perform experiments, and build computational models. Students were enabled to perform self-guided investigations, and increased student motivation compared to usage of simulations alone was found. We also derived general recommendations for cloud lab design and deployment.</p> <p>We published 14 peer-reviewed journal and conference papers (more are pending) and 1 invited review in the monograph 'Cyber-Physical Laboratories in Engineering and Science Education.' About 40 presentation were given at conferences and university seminars by the project participants. 11 undergraduate students, 3 high-school students, and 1 science teacher gained research experience working in our labs and received co-authorship on peer-reviewed publications.</p> <p>Synergistically, we developed educational NSF-funded spin-off projects on interactive biology museum exhibits and liquid handling robots.</p> <p>Overall, this project established a paradigm shift from observational biology experimentation towards truly realtime interactive experiences between macroscopic humans and microscopic living cells.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/18/2018<br>      Modified by: Hans&nbsp;I&nbsp;Riedel-Kruse</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1324753/1324753_10276978_1545182558318_Global_MOOC--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1324753/1324753_10276978_1545182558318_Global_MOOC--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig.5: Cloud Lab user testing at global scale"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1324753/1324753_10276978_1545182558318_Global_MOOC--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig.5: Cloud Lab user testing at global scale"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Biology Cloud Lab was tested in versatile educational settings including a MOOC, where students from all over the world took a microbiology course, ran real experiments online, formulated and tested their own hypotheses, and analyzed their data.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ingmar H Riedel-Kruse</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Hans&nbsp;I&nbsp;Riedel-Kruse</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig.5: Cloud Lab user testing at global scale</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1324753/1324753_10276978_1545173644298_BPU--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1324753/1324753_10276978_1545173644298_BPU--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig.1: Biotic Processing Unit (BPU)"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1324753/1324753_10276978_1545173644298_BPU--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig.1: Biotic Processing Unit (BPU)"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A Biotic Processing Unit that enables realtime interactive experiments with phototactic Euglena cells.
