<AbstractNarration>1335766&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dimitrakopoulos&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The squeezing motion of capsules and erythrocytes in narrow microfluidic channels and vascular capillaries has wide applications in many biomedical and physiological processes including targeted drug delivery, cell sorting and characterization lab-on-a-chip devices, hemopathology, and oxygen delivery to body?s tissues via the capillary network. However, there is limited understanding of the involved lubrication physics of membrane interfaces with the confined solid walls for the fully three-dimensional dynamics. To elucidate the realistic motion of capsules and erythrocytes in narrow solid vessels, the proposal plans to investigate: (a) the squeezing motion in narrow square and rectangular microchannels with various configurations, and (b) the squeezing motion of capsules and erythrocytes in vascular capillaries with a diameter of 3-8 microns. Both healthy cells and erythrocytes affected by hereditary elliptocytosis will be considered. The computational study of these challenging systems will be facilitated via the non-stiff Membrane Spectral Boundary Element algorithms developed by the PI and his research group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research has the potential to make a significant contribution in the physical understanding of the realistic motion of capsules and erythrocytes in microfluidic channels and vascular capillaries, and thus elucidate the targeted drug delivery, the resistance of blood flow and the cell deformation which affect the erythrocytes? aging and lifetime. These findings can be used to improve lab-on-a-chip devices and the control of hereditary elliptocytosis, and thus enhance public health. The results of the proposal will be integrated into the education program of the University of Maryland and become generally known via scientific meetings, journal publications and the web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by Mathematical Biology of the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the BioMaPS fundings from the Chemical, Biological, Environmental, and Transport Division in Engineering and the Division of Mathematical Ssciences.</AbstractNarration>

The motion of capsules and erythrocytes in narrow microfluidic channels and vascular capillaries has wide applications in many biomedical and physiological processes including targeted drug delivery, cell sorting and characterization lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices, hemopathology, and oxygen delivery to body's tissues via the capillary network. However, there is limited understanding of the involved lubrication physics of membrane interfaces with the confined solid walls for the fully three-dimensional dynamics.  During the entire period of the award, we investigated the deformation of elastic capsules in a variety of microfluidic channels, the lateral capsule migration in a variety of microfluidic devices, the capsule dynamics in complex non-linear extensional Stokes flows, as well as we identified new microfluidic devices which can be used for the accurate and efficient determination of the membrane's mechanical properties.  Broader Impacts:  With the support of this award, our work has resulted in a number of significant publications as well as many conference talks and proceedings at national and international meetings.  This award also supported three graduate students for their studies on the squeezing motion of capsules in micro-vessels.  In addition, our results has been integrated into the education program of the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and the College of Engineering at the University of Maryland.
