<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to Washington University to organize and conduct a workshop from April 12-14, 2013 in support of the Partnership for Undergraduate Life Science Education (PULSE). Last September, the PULSE partners (HHMI, NIH, and NSF) appointed 40 Vision and Change Leadership Fellows to stimulate transformative changes in the undergraduate life science education community. All Fellows met in October, 2012 and have since organized into four working groups to address different challenges to reforming how biology is taught at all types of undergraduate institutions. The Vision and Change Leadership Fellows are focusing on how life science departments can encourage and reward faculty members' efforts to improve undergraduate life sciences education.  Such improvements should increase student learning, should increase retention rates for students in the sciences, and should prepare all students to be more curious and scientifically literate citizens.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current award is to fund a workshop in St. Louis, MO for nine of the Leadership Fellows from a variety of institution types located within the Midwest and Great Plains region. One of the participants is a member of the Leadership Council that is coordinating the efforts of all 40 Fellow and the other participants are members of the four PULSE working groups. The major goal of this workshop is to plan a regional conference on adopting the Vision and Change recommendations that will coincide with a fall meeting of the Association of College and University Biology Educators (ACUBE). It is hoped that the conference will catalyze formation of a regional network that will begin coordinating educational reform efforts in this large geographic area. This regional conference will expand the impact of PULSE by reaching out to institutions from adjacent states such as North and South Dakota, Kansas, Illinois, Michigan, and Kentucky, that are currently not represented by the PULSE Leadership Fellows. While this regional network will be one of several "laboratories" for testing the resources being developed by the four PULSE working groups, the workshop organizers recognize that each region of the country faces somewhat different challenges in moving Vision and Change efforts forward.  One challenge for the Midwest is to engage a larger number of community college faculty in future Vision and Change activities. Results from the workshop and the larger conference will be shared with the life sciences community, primarily via the www.pulsecommunity.org website.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project was to develop a plan for a regional network of institutions of higher education that would promote the transformation of life sciences education in line with the recommendations of many recent reports on STEM Education, including the æVision and Change in Undergraduate Biology EducationÆ report.  These reports call for the widespread adoption of active-learning and inquiry-based student engagement methods (evidence-based teaching practice).  The aim of this reform effort is better learning for all our students and better retention of students from all backgrounds, racial and ethnic groups, and across the spectrum of socio-economic status, in science and technology career paths.   To help calatyze this transformation, Forty Partnership for Life Sciences Education (PULSE) Vision and Change Leadership Fellows were selected from an applicant pool of ife sciences department chairs and deans to develop strategies for widespread implementation of V&amp;C.   These PULSE Fellows have worked since 2012 on projects that are designed to realize this goal.  This grant proposed holding a planning meeting of eight PULSE Fellows from Midwestern and Great Plains (MWGP) region institutions. The grant supported development of strategies for outreach to engage additional institutions beyond the fellows own institutions and recruit them into the effort, and to begin planning regional activities for the network institutions.  These activities include a series of conferences to provide forums for information exchange, mutual support, and development of plans for concrete steps toward implementation of evidence-based teaching practice and inquiry at each institution in the network.  A planning meeting was held at Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL) on April 12-14 2013 for seven of the MWGP PULSE Fellows.  Two short follow up planning sessions at conferences that were already being attended by the MWGP group of fellows were also partly funded by this award.   These meetings (half-day on June 6 and a session Aug 29th in the Washington, DC area) continued the planning process.  At these meetings outreach strategies were developed and a plan for a series of conferences was projected that would bring teams from potential network member institutions together.    The network development strategy is based on local æhubsÆ of 3-5 institutions that are relatively close to each other (less than a dayÆs drive) as the initial network seeds, and using those seeds as the basis for local interactions to support changes at each participant institution and for continued recruitment of new members.  in the plan, a series of conferences was laid out for education and follow up support of network members.  These conferences were to be organized by representatives from each of those æhubÆ institutions.  These conferences would be forums to engage teams from each institution in activities that would generate plans for concrete steps towards change at their own institutions.  In-person meetings would occur at regular intervals to report on progress and support ongoing efforts at transformation.  In addition, plans for interactions of the hub schools and strategies to engage more institutions were projected.   More than 20 institutions have now been engaged in the pilot network.  Additional support for network activities has been acquired from an NSF EAGER award.  This additional award supported a 20-institution æcharterÆ network meeting January 16-17 2014 at WUSTL that developed the goals, logistics and agenda for the ÆteamÆ conference at which institutional/departmental change plans would be generated, in line iwth our inital plan.   The team conference itself, which was held June 6-8 2014 at WUSTL, engaged 79 participants in teams of 2-6 from 23 institutions in activities that led to concrete action plans for each institution.  Activities are ongoing to implement plans, continue hub engagement, and begin additional recruitment.  Plan...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
