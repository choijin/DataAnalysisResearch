<AbstractNarration>The highest rates of erosion of bedrock on Earth are generally thought to occur&lt;br/&gt;in steep areas subject to the action of large rivers and glaciers. However, &lt;br/&gt;there are many deserts around the world where wind and wind-blown sand are the &lt;br/&gt;dominant agents of erosion and where even relatively flat bedrock landforms can be &lt;br/&gt;eroded as quickly as the fastest eroding rivers and glacial valleys on Earth. &lt;br/&gt;Relatively little is known about how wind and wind-blown sand erodes bedrock and&lt;br/&gt;what variables control the morphology of yardangs, the dominant landforms created&lt;br/&gt;in such areas. Wind erosion can also influence the behavior of faults and folds &lt;br/&gt;in the Earth's crust by reducing the stress caused by topography in areas of high &lt;br/&gt;erosion (i.e. on the windward side of a slipping fault or growing fold). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further global climate changes will likely lead to more desertification, making &lt;br/&gt;wind erosion and its impacts on humans (e.g. reduced air quality) even more &lt;br/&gt;important to understand and predict. This project will improve our ability to &lt;br/&gt;quantify wind erosion, a process influencing human health and land sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;The project includes field areas in southern California and the Qaidam &lt;br/&gt;Basin of the Tibetan Plateau (in collaboration with Chinese colleagues). We will combine field work, remote sensing, numerical &lt;br/&gt;modeling, and geochronology to quantify the interaction between the flow of wind and&lt;br/&gt;wind-blown sand over topography, the erosion of that topography, and the behavior&lt;br/&gt;of faults and folds in Earth's crust. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly supported by the Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics Program, Tectonics Program, and NSF's OIIA International Science and Engineering Section.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In many dry climates the abrasion of rock by wind-driven sand can outpace water-driven erosion. The objective of this project was to acquire measurements in the field to better understand the abrasion of bedrock by wind-driven sand and to numerically model the landforms that result from this process. Working in Ocotillo Wells, California, we quantified the rates of wind-driven erosion over both short (~1 yr) and long (~1 million yr) time scales and found these to be approximately equal, indicating the wind-driven erosion can be a steadily dominant process over geologic time scales. We also documented how wind and bedrock structure influence the geometry of the resulting landforms (yardangs). We developed a numerical model that includes the physics of the wind in conjunction with sand transport and abrasion. This model is capable of reproducing many of the patterns in yardang geometry observed at Ocotillo Wells and elsewhere. We also worked in the Mu Us Desert and Qaidam Basin of China, home to the largest yardangs on Earth. There we were able to measure erosion rates and document feedbacks between wind erosion and tectonic uplift that result in an enhancement of both processes.We documented how wind erosion can also feed back on water-driven processes to generate both unusually large and also reversed (blunt-side downwind) yardangs. We also documented an expansion of the Mu Us Desert in response to climate changes of the past few million years. Finally, we documented that water-driven and wind-driven erosion can feed back on one another to influence yardang morphology. Educational outreach materials were developed based on our work at Ocotillo Wells, California. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/28/2018<br>      Modified by: Jon&nbsp;D&nbsp;Pelletier</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
