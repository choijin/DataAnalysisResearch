<AbstractNarration>Many useful materials are made up of interconnected networks of fibers. This is observed both in biological materials (such as tissues and cells) as well as in man-made materials (such as paper and textiles). Resistance to external forces is a key property of these materials. Still, it is not understood how the mechanical characteristics of the fibers and the distribution of the cross-links between fibers determine the stiffness of the entire network. Here, fibrous networks with precise control over network architecture will be created. These materials will then be tested mechanically. Thereby, this research will reveal exactly which microscopic parameters matter most in defining network stiffness. Specific results will test a recent predictive model of network mechanics and contribute to the  fundamental understanding of the mechanical properties of biomaterials.  General outcomes will influence the use of artificial fibrous materials, with potential impacts for the design of prosthetics and/or tissue implants. The Principal Investigators will contribute to human resource development in Science, Technology, Math and Engineering.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will synthesize fibrous networks using sequence-based self-assembly of DNA, and test their mechanical properties using an array of methods of rheology.  Networks will be designed using a two-component strategy in which linkers are attached to multi-armed nodes. As a result, it will be possible to independently vary the bend stiffness and stretch stiffness of the linkers, as well as the connectivity of the nodes. Investigation will focus on so-called "marginal gels" (i.e. networks whose connectivity is in the vicinity of the Maxwell isostatic point) that are predicted to have dramatic mechanical properties associated with thermodynamic critical behavior, including a sudden stiffening with connectivity, and critical fluctuations.  College internship opportunities and through cross-disciplinary graduate student training will be provided. International collaboration via student exchanges and through an international summer workshop on biomolecular networks will be conducted.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Various materials, including those in medical devices, food products, or even biological tissues, consist of polymers or particles that are linked together to form a network, and infused with water. The behavior and utility of these 'hydrogels' is linked to their stiffness, which is typically understood using concepts derived from the properties of rubber. However, the particles within hydrogels are frequently stiff and rod-like, unlike the flexible chains within rubber; thus, new concepts are needed.     In this work, we explored the relevance to hydrogel stiffness of a different concept: The Maxwell rigidity criterion. In 1864, Maxwell pointed out that trussed structures, such as those used to support bridges, must have at least six beams emanating from a junction in order to maintain rigidity.     We have found that the Maxwell criterion also controls the rigidity of hydrogels. We demonstrated this by constructing hydrogels out of precisely-designed, multi-armed DNA particles. We then measured the stiffness of these gels while varying the number of arms. We found that particles with 6 arms show markedly different mechanical properties than those with fewer arms: 6-armed networks are stiffer; their stiffness increases in a simple linear manner with DNA particle concentration; and their stiffness is relatively constant when placed under increasing strain. In contrast, hydrogels made of particles with fewer arms are less stiff; they show a complex power-law dependence of modulus on concentration; and they tend to have non-constant stiffness as strain is varied.     Overall, our work provides firm experimental evidence for a novel conceptual approach to hydrogel mechanics. These concepts provide means to engineer hydrogels with desired properties, and thus could be used to create materials for various applications.
