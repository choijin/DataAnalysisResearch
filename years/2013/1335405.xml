<AbstractNarration>The primary science objective of this award is to develop new methods of simultaneous flow and flight control for microjet actuator-based unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the presence of uncertain operating conditions and uncertain nonlinear actuator dynamics.  Microjet actuators transfer linear momentum to a flow system by using a vibrating diaphragm, which creates trains of vortices through the alternating ejection and suction of fluid through a small orifice.  Microjets can be utilized to modify the boundary layer flow field near the surface of an aircraft wing, which can improve UAV aerodynamic performance and maneuverability.  Benefits of the use of microjet actuators include small size, ease of operation, low cost, and no requirement for a separate fuel supply.  The study will investigate new methods of nonlinear control, which incorporate the complete nonlinear UAV dynamics in addition to the boundary-layer flow field dynamics in the design.  A focus of the proposed research will be the development of practical control designs that require minimal computational complexity.  Deliverables include new theoretical control design techniques, demonstrations via numerical simulations, performance validation via wind-tunnel experiments, engineering student education and research experiences, and hands-on student projects.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;It is expected that the results of this research will reduce implementation cost and improve performance of UAV control systems.  Moreover, the research will create practical microjet-based control methods that can be applied over a wide range of operating conditions.  This will enable the development of cost-effective UAV systems that are capable for real-life implementation. The result of the research will be document in research papers that will be disseminated in conference proceedings and high-impact academic journals. Graduate and undergraduate students will benefit through involvement in research and hands-on projects, which they will draw on throughout their academic or industrial careers.</AbstractNarration>

Since these vortices (i.e., jets) are formed entirely from the fluid (i.e., air) of the flow system, a key benefit of SJAs is that they achieve this transfer of momentum with zero net mass injection across the flow boundary. Thus, SJAs do not require space for a fuel supply. SJAs can be utilized to modify the boundary layer flow field near the surface of an UAV wing, which can improve aerodynamic performance. Moreover, arrays consisting of several SJAs can be employed to achieve maneuvering control of UAVs, possibly eliminating the need for mechanical control surfaces.</p> <p class="Default">Specific challenges addressed in this project include new, practically implementable control methods to compensate for the parametric uncertainty and nonlinearity inherent in the mathematical model describing the SJA control force. Eschewing computationally cumbersome control methods that employ time-varying parameter identification algorithms or computational intelligence (e.g., neural networks) to compensate for the SJA model uncertainty, the newly developed control methods employ constant feedforward &ldquo;best guess&rdquo; estimates of the uncertain SJA parameters. By leveraging advantageous mathematical properties in the control law derivations, the resulting control systems are shown to completely compensate for the SJA uncertainty using computationally simplistic control strategies using the constant estimates.</p> <p class="Default">The control applications addressed in the research project include 1) UAV trajectory tracking control; 2) Limit cycle oscillation (LCO) (or wing vibration) suppression; and 3) Fluid flow velocity regulation.

The specific outcomes for the LCO suppression control objective include 1) A new method of SJA-based LCO control using an output feedback control method, which eliminates the need for noisy and inaccurate sensor measurements of LCO velocity and 2) The first robust nonlinear control design to rigorously prove zero steady-state error LCO regulation for so-called dual-parallel underactuated systems, where a single control signal is simultaneously coupled to both the pitching (twisting motion) and plunging (vertical motion) LCO states.
