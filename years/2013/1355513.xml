<AbstractNarration>Miami University is increasing the number of women in its computer science majors by establishing a living-learning community with service learning at its core. Connecting computer science and engineering course work to local community-based problems (e.g. "design a low-cost lightweight playground kit for elementary school students and simulate its strength characteristics before building a prototype"), increases the attractiveness of such courses to all students. Increased enrollment and persistence in such courses contributes in turn to the pool of well-motivated and capable STEM graduates, with direct consequences on meeting national workforce development needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical features of the project's implementation include creating a service learning living community in the residential halls for two cohorts of thirty students each. The project builds on converging theory and evidence that points to motivational, rather than ability-based, explanations for gender imbalance in the participation of undergraduates in STEM fields. By focusing on service-oriented curricular and co-curricular offerings, gender balance and diversity within the institution's computer science, software engineering, computer engineering, and electrical engineering majors are expected to improve. This project is unique in that it focuses on the service-oriented learning living community, rather than just the disbursement of scholarship funds. This emphasis holds promise to help ensure that the students participate not just for the financial benefits and that the project can continue after funding for the scholarships has ended.</AbstractNarration>

As a scholarship program, the broader impacts including supporting students with financial need to complete a BS degree in a computing field and to enter the workforce in areas that are vital for our country's future.        The primary impact of this NSF-sponsored S-STEM project entitled "Electronics and Computing Service Scholars" is the validation that an emphasis on the application of computing to service, that is, helping students understand how a person working in these computing fields can make a positive difference in the lives of other people, can contribute to recruiting more female students and to their successful completion of a computing degree (including computer science, software engineering, and computer engineering.).  As a scholarship program, the broader impacts including supporting students with financial need to complete a BS degree in a computing field and to enter the workforce in areas that are vital for our country's future.   The program supported two cohorts for students for their four years as scholars.  They were recruited through an application process in which they were asked to reflect on previous service activities and the importance of this type of service.  In their first year, each cohort was enrolled in a common section of our beginning programming course, a course that was supplemented with a service-learning component.  These students built a community through this shared course and their residence in a common residence hall (a living-learning community.).  As they progressed through their academic careers, they were asked to report on the service activities in which they had participated.   The average of the scholars graduating GPA was over 3.3.  Almost all of these students graduated in four years and are now employed in computing-related positions.                Last Modified: 06/30/2020       Submitted by: James D Kiper]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
