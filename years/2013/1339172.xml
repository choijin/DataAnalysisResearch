<AbstractNarration>SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The Physics Division and the Division of Materials Research contribute funds to this award. This award supports the participation of four early career investigators to attend the IUPAP Conference on Computational Physics which will be held in Moscow, Russia August 20-24, 2013. The early career investigators may be graduate students in their final year before their expected dissertation defense, or post-docs within a year from their PhD degree. Their research area will be computational, but may be from any subfield of computational physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computational physics has become a third method of investigation in physics. The Conference on Computational Physics is the international meeting that focuses exclusively on the computational investigations in physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The early career investigators working in computational physics will participate in a focused international conference. Attending and presenting at international focused meetings is a fundamental step in the career of young investigators. These young investigators will both attend the conference and make an oral presentation. Every effort will be made to include in the travel awards individuals of underrepresented groups in computational physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Broader Impact of the award enabled four young investigators to participate in the XXV IUPAP Conference on Computational Physics (CCP 2013).  The CCP conference rotates on a triennial basis between the Americas, Europe/Africa, and Asia/Australia.  In 2013 it was held August 20-24 in Moscow, Russia.  The opportunity for young investigators to attend CCP 2013 was widely advertised, including by the Division of Computational Physics (DCOMP) of the American Physical Society (APS).  Four young scientists with computationally intensive research were chosen by the PIs to attend CCP 2013.  None of the chosen young investigators were from the universities of the PIs, in order to avoid any conflict of interest issues.   Members of the CCP 2013 Local Organizing Committee, in Russia, worked closely with the PIs to ensure that all four young investigators had well-placed oral presentations on their research.  One of the young US investigators, Ehsan Khatami, published an article entitled "Fluctuation-dissipation theorem in isolated quantum systems out of equilibrium" in the proceedings of the conference, which was published in 2014 in Journal of Physics Conference Series, volume 510.  Travel and visa arrangements for the four young investigators were coordinated and approved by the CCP 2013 Local Organizing Committee and the PIs.    The Intellectual Merit of the grant was supplied by the four young investigators, both in their presentations and in a published conference proceedings article.  The scientific contacts made by the young investigators, as well as the opportunity to fully participate in an international scientific conference, will help launch their budding careers.
