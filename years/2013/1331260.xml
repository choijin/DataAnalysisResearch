<AbstractNarration>Recent research on the relationship between tropical cyclones (TC) and climate, suggests that years with enhanced TC activity may lead to decreased atmospheric poleward heat transports during the following winter possibly due to significant atmospheric poleward heat transports by TCs. Supporting this hypothesis are several studies showing that TCs are responsible for significant short-term reductions in hemispheric zonal available potential energy due to poleward moist static energy transports by TCs. Past research by the Principal Investigator (PI) has also shown that Western North Pacific TCs are responsible for significant cross-hemispheric transports of dry static energy into the Southern Hemisphere. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PI will undertake a comprehensive quantification of meridional energy transports by TCs to serve as a foundation for establishing the climate role of TCs. He will test the hypothesis that Northern Hemisphere TCs constitute a significant portion of global atmospheric dry static energy (DSE) transports from the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere during boreal summer and fall due to the upper tropospheric equator ward outflow jets associated with the TCs. Analyzing the composited meridional DSE transports by TCs within the Eastern North Pacific, North Atlantic, and West Pacific, the PI will determine whether the mean response is significant within each basin. Next the PI will quantify zonally integrated cross-hemispheric DSE transports at the equator by each Best-Track TC from reanalysis to determine the significance of aggregate dry static energy transports relative to the total atmosphere on time scales ranging from weeks to years. Finally the PI will examine Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) simulations to compare results from reanalysis to determine the fidelity of the role of TCs as evidenced in general circulation models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this project is to examine the role of tropical cyclones in transporting energy in their upper-tropospheric outflow jet from the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere.  This research builds upon the foundation of prior work by the PI and others that suggest that Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclones are responsible for significant meridional total energy transport both southward across the equator and northward into the midlatitudes. Together with previous studies, this work can be used to construct a more complete picture of the potential role of tropical cyclones in the climate, which has generally assumed to be insignificant in prior work.     During the fellowship period, the PI found three major sets of results pertaining to meridional energy transport by tropical cyclones.  First, the PI found that western North Pacific tropical cyclones significantly redistribute and converge energy primarily as moisture during tropical cyclone passage within their large-scale environment in the Northern Hemisphere as well as the Southern Hemisphere.  Second, the PI noted that western North Pacific tropical cyclones extract significant quantities of moist static energy from their large-scale Northern Hemisphere environment yielding anomalies that take months to recover back to climatology following tropical cyclone passage.  These results also suggest that western North Pacific tropical cyclones are responsible for triggering seedling disturbances that may eventually form into additional tropical cyclones.  Third, a composite analysis revealed that western North Pacific tropical cyclones are responsible for significant total energy transport from the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere.  However, this transport did not yield significant total energy anomalies potentially due to compensation from other phenomena.  This work has been detailed in two peer-reviewed publications in the Journal of Climate with a third manuscript in preparation:     1)  Schenkel B., and R.E. Hart, 2015: An analysis of the environmental moisture impacts of western North Pacific tropical cyclones. J. Climate, 28, 2600&ndash;2622, doi:10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00213.1.     2)  Schenkel, B., and R.E. Hart, 2015: An Examination of the Thermodynamic Impacts of Western North Pacific  Tropical Cyclones on Their Tropical Tropospheric Environment. J. Climate, 28, 2600&ndash;2622, doi:10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00213.1.     3)  Schenkel, B., Bosart, L., and Keyser, D., 2016: A Climatological Analysis of Cross-Equatorial Total Energy Transport by Tropical Cyclones.  Mon. Wea. Rev., in preparation.     A climatology of multiple simultaneous tropical cyclones was also examined given the possibility that a large fraction of tropical cyclones occur in the presence of additional tropical cyclones.   If true, such a result could lead to meridional total energy transport attributed to a single tropical cyclones being overestimated due to the presence of multiple tropical cyclones.  The PI examined multiple simultaneous tropical cyclone characteristics in each Northern Hemisphere basin concluding that a substantial fraction of tropical cyclones occur in the presence of additional tropical cyclones.  Remarkable similarity is noted in the spatiotemporal separation among multiple tropical cyclones.  Furthermore, the large-scale environment within a basin may be pre-conditioned for tropical cyclone formation prior to multiple tropical cyclone occurrence with preexisting tropical cyclones serving as a trigger for subsequent tropical cyclone formation.  This work has been detailed in a peer-reviewed publication in review:     4) Schenkel, B., 2016: A Climatology of Multiple Tropical Cyclone Events. Journal of Climate, in review.     Lastly, the PI co-advised an undergraduate honors thesis student who examined intraseasonal variability in tropical cyclone activity during the 2008 Atlantic tropical cyclone season.
