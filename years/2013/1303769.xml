<AbstractNarration>Indian Hills Community College (IHCC) requests funding for a Planning Grant to research the feasibility of establishing a Regional ATE Center focused on bioenergy called the Bioenergy Technology Education Center (B-TEC).  The goals of this planning grant are to: 1) Determine the current and future bioenergy workforce need in a 12 state Midwest region; 2) Identify the colleges serving this need or wanting to serve this need; 3) Determine additional educational resources required to meet current and future need; 4) Identify how the Bioenergy Technology Education Center could support colleges serving the bioenergy industry; and 5) Determine what partner resources and management systems are needed in order to sustain an ATE Regional Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a well-conceived planning grant that could potentially lead to a Center that focuses on a growing industry. The development of alternative fuels, especially biofuels, could be an important economic resource in the near future.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was a planning grant to explore the feasibility of establishing an upper Midwest regional training center called the Bioenergy Technology Education Center.  As a part of the grant, suveys were conducted of both bioenergy industries and community colleges to understand what the industry's workforce training needs were and the resources that are in place to meet those needs.  This project culminated in a Partner  Summit that brought together representatives from community colleges, workforce development, government agencies, universities, other NSF regional centers, and industry to review the survey results and determine if there is a need for a coordinated bioenergy education/training center for the uper Midwest.  Employer Survey  A total of 36 companies responded to the survey representing over 100 bioenergy plants.  Although 55% of employers responded that they saw no change in technician-level employment in their industry, 42% saw a future need to increase the number of employed technicians.  Only 3% saw a decreasing need for technicians in the future.  Given new technological advances in the industry, 76% of employers said technicians will need new skills including an "understanding new process technologies" and "skills to perform analytical quality assurance" or other analytical procedures.  To find qualified technicians, 63% of employers look to educational institutions, with 82% of those looking to community and technical colleges, 41% looking to, or also to, four-year institutions and 9% looking to a local high school.  Twenty-three percent responded that they hire only experienced technicians from other plants, from venders and from in-house promotions.  Only 14% said that they had no requirements for employment.  When asked to design the ideal training program, employers listed five critical areas of study that should be emphasized:  41% referenced Basic Chemistry and Laboratory Techniques  25% listed Process Control, Operating Systems, Fermentation Basics, Distillation  25% listed Safety  17% listed General Plant Operations or Processes, Production Chemistry, or Specific Laboratory Equipment  17% included Biology or Chemical Engineering  14% noted Troubleshooting, QA/QC, Business, Economics, Logistics, Water Treatment  Community College Survey  Initially, surveys were sent to 74 colleges and a total of 59 were resent a couple months later.  A total of 21 responses were collected from colleges. Forty eight percent (48%) indicated they offer courses or a degree related to bioenergy.  Of the 52% that did not offer courses or a degree, 70% indicated interest in offerings.   Of the responders, 80% indicated bioenergy producers were located in their areas but did not provide data as to numbers of technicians.  Several indicated that they did not know, so they could not provide data.  Sixty-two percent (81%) indicated that there were other providers of training in their area, other colleges or plant operation companies.  Minnesota West was listed twice as a provider.  Eighty one percent (81%) indicated interest in participating in a regional NSF BTEC Center.  All others did not answer the question; no one responded "no".  To the question "what assistance could be offered by a Regional Center," responses included:          (In Rank Order - 0 to 35 Scale)  Instructor workshops                    35  Student internships                      31  Shared curriculum                        29  Joint curriculum development    27  Instructor internships                   27  Student scholarships                   27  Web resources                             27  Equipment acquisition                25  Student associations                  23  Student publications                  19  Juried electronic library             19  Newsletter                                    17  Partner Summit  The BTEC Partner Summit was held at IowaÆs Honey Creek Resort on Lake Rathbun, June 23-25, 2014.
