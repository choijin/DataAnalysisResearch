<AbstractNarration>Technical summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education to study novel Mott insulating states of electronic matter. Specific phases of interest are quantum spin liquids, and phases of quantum magnetism that are the spin analogs of interacting topological insulators. The emphasis will be on the development of theoretical concepts and methods which will be placed in the context of experiments and/or numerical work. The PI will pursue three topics: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(i) the theory and phenomenology of quantum spin liquids in the organic salts and other materials;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(ii)  a theoretical description of a new class of gapless quantum spin liquid states that are likely beyond the existing paradigm;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(iii) the theory and realization of spin analogs of topological insulators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Projects (i) and (ii) are motivated by experiments on many Mott insulators that provide evidence for various kinds of quantum spin liquid phases, typically with gapless excitations. Project (iii) is on a new and rapidly evolving area which can deepen our understanding both of quantum magnetism and topological insulators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award supports the training of graduate students in modern concepts and methods in condensed matter physics. Undergraduates will be involved in the research. The PI will develop lectures to expose graduate students to the phenomenology of correlated materials and their experimental probes. He will also develop lectures to convey the excitement of condensed matter physics to other scientists.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education on interesting new kinds of insulating states of matter. It has long been known that in certain materials insulating behavior develops as a result of the Coulomb interaction between the electrons rather than due to the filling of quantum mechanical energy bands. Modern developments show that some of these Mott insulators can be in very novel states of matter where the microscopic degrees of freedom are quantum mechanically entangled over macroscopic distances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several unusual counter intuitive phenomena arise as a result of the long range quantum mechanical entanglement. The PI will develop new concepts and methods to deal with insulators with long range quantum entanglement, and their experimental signatures. He will also develop a deeper understanding of the interplay between symmetry and quantum effects in such interaction driven insulators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fundamental research has potential to generate concepts that will underlie future quantum technologies.  The study of long range entangled phases is a relatively new chapter in condensed matter physics which holds promise to have similar impact on technology as the previous chapter of the study of long range ordered phases. This award also supports the training of graduate students in modern concepts and methods in condensed matter physics. Undergraduates will be involved in the research. The PI will develop lectures to expose graduate students to the phenomenology of correlated materials and their experimental probes. He will also develop lectures to convey the excitement of condensed matter physics to other scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of this project was on  theoretical research and education on interesting new kinds of insulating states of matter.       Intellectual merit:   Electrical insulation in many materials is explained well by the concept of electron waves filling energy bands.    It has long been known though that in certain materials insulating behavior develops as a result of the Coulomb interaction between the electrons rather than due to the filling of quantum mechanical energy bands. Further even within the band-filling framework it was recognized only fairly recently that there may be multiple varieties depending on the symmetry of the solid, and global (``topological") properties of the quantum mechanical ground state wave function of the electrons. These have come to be known as topological insulators.         One of the main research outcomes of this project was the development of the theory of the interplay between symmetry, quantum effects, and Coulomb interactions between the electrons in  insulators. Some specific advances are (1) an understanding of the role of electron-electron interactions on the distinct varieties of three dimensional  topological insulators  (2) development of the theory of magnetic insulators where quantum effects have destroyed long range magnetic order of the underlying magnetic moments (3) development of theory of new experimental probes of the quantum physics of materials.      Another remarkable research outcome is the unification of many seemingly distinct topics in the study of quantum materials. The first two topics mentioned above were surprisingly shown to be related to the physics of electrons moving in two space dimensions in the presence of a strong perpendicular magnetic field. This system shows many novel phenomena that have fascinated physicists for 3 decades. The connections to three dimensional topological insulators and to quantum magnetism enabled new insights and the solution of some old unresolved problems. Specifically a novel metallic state that exists in this two dimensional system (and which plays a  fundamental role in the understanding of other phenomena) was shown to be described by a new theory which was able to accommodate a known symmetry of the problem. The role of this symmetry was obscure in the previous 20 years of work on this problem.      Finally the research unearthed some previously unsuspected relationships (known as dualities) between quantum field theories in two space dimensions. Such dualities are much cherished by theoretical physicists as they provide a powerful window into the physics of strongly coupled quantum field theories. This is of central  interest in both condensed matter physics and high energy physics.  The new dualities found by the PI and others have already been applied to several problems in condensed matter physics. They are likely to become powerful theoretical tools for analyzing some kinds of strongly interacting electronic systems.      Broader impact:   The broader impacts come from the education of two graduate students, one of whom has successfully defended his PhD thesis. In addition the PI has lectured at many summer schools intended for graduate students and has written a review of some of the results.
