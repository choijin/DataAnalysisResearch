<AbstractNarration>The project will develop new dynamical methods to control the resonant light-matter interaction through modulation in time and/or in space of the parameters of the resonant atomic transition (frequencies and/or line widths) by means of the strong off-resonant control field. It includes the development of (i) a new highly efficient method for the formation of the VUV and XUV attosecond pulses via the spectrum broadening by means of the temporal modulation of the atomic parameters and (ii) a method to produce and to control optically the photonic structures in a homogeneous atomic media via special modulation of the refractive index induced by the strong laser field. A theory of the VUV and XUV radiation transformation during its propagation through an optically thick resonantly absorbing atomic medium, dynamically perturbed by a strong IR or optical laser radiation, will be developed. It will advance understanding and control of the strong ultrafast light-matter interactions, including appreciation of the role of the resonant, interference, and cooperative effects in such interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attosec pulses provide a unique ultrafast tool for recording and control of the electronic motion in atoms, molecules, and nanostructures, leading to profound applications in chemistry and biology, medicine and energetics. Development of the new method of attosecond pulse formation with the pulse characteristics superior or complementary to those produced by the current high-harmonic-generation technique will further push those strategically and fundamentally important applications. Development of the new method for an optical production of the photonic structures in the homogeneously distributed atomic ensembles with the widely variable parameters, determined by the intensity and frequency of the control field, will essentially extend the applications of such structures for the control and manipulation of the flow of light. The graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in these interdisciplinary fields of atomic, molecular, and optical science, learning and developing the methods of coherent control of the light-matter interaction in the ultrafast strong-field regimes based on the modern laser technologies. Collaboration with experimental groups will be initiated, aiming at implementation of the newly developed dynamical methods of coherent control in the experimental investigations.</AbstractNarration>

It led to our recently established collaboration with the experimental group of Prof. Szymon Suckewer at Princeton. Testing of our proposal for realization of attosecond X-ray laser is one of the goals of the current NSF INSPIRE project: "Compact X-Ray Laser in "Water Window", led by Prof. Suckewer.  2) New all-optical technique of quantum memories based on continues phase-matching control was proposed via the off-resonant Raman interaction of a single-photon with a control classical field  a)  by variation in time of its propagation direction (angular scanning), or b) a variation in space of its frequency (spatial frequency chirp).

Broader Impact   The project addressed a number of high impact potential applications in the diverse fields of multidisciplinary research and modern areas of technological development, including attosecond science, quantum information processing and quantum X-ray optics. The results obtained within this project will further push the development of those strategically and fundamentally important applications.  The suggested technique for production of the novel coherent intense attosecond X-ray pulses in a "water window" range could lead to a fast dynamical imaging of the biological macro-molecules and other material nanostructures with a unique combination of a record high temporal and spatial resolution.  Our proof of principal experiment demonstrating the suggested technique in the gamma-ray range as well as its application for coherent control of the waveforms of the individual gamma-photons, which were performed and developed by our group, strongly stimulated further theoretical and experimental research in the field of emerging quantum X-ray optics.  The new technique of optical memory based on angular modulation of the propagation direction or spatial frequency chirp of the control field may lead to a dramatic improve of a long distance quantum optical communication.    Two Ph. D. students, were trained in theoretical quantum optics. They received Ph. D. in the frame of this project and got further research positions (one in academy, one in business).
