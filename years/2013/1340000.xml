<AbstractNarration>Bringing Engineers into STEM Teaching (BEST) Project is a collaboration of the School of Education and the College of Engineering at Boston University and six schools or districts in the Boston area. This project is focusing on bringing the mathematical, technological, and design expertise of engineers into secondary classrooms. It is providing scholarships to 37 students and engineering professionals to enroll in a one-year program that leads to a master's degree and licensure to teach secondary mathematics. The project provides 8 scholarships per year in years 1-4 and 5 in the fifth year. It is facilitating the participation of undergraduate engineering students in a newly launched 4 + 1 program at BU in which students receive a BS degree in engineering and a master's degree in education in five years. Summer internships and academic year programs for undergraduate engineers to work with middle school students on design projects (Innovations in a Box) are being used to motivate and develop interest in education. The project is also recruiting practicing engineers. During the induction years, teachers will be supported through summer and academic-year workshops, seminars and mentoring. The BEST program is providing an exemplar for an experience-rich and inquiry-based teacher preparation program that addresses the recommendations from the Mathematics Education of Teachers (MET II) Report and makes it possible for engineers to become teachers. This project is supplying high-need districts with teachers who are knowledgeable about state mathematics standards and Massachusetts engineering education standards and as a consequence, is positively affecting thousands of secondary school students. The project is testing a model for recruiting, training and retaining highly qualified engineers in teaching.</AbstractNarration>

It was also accomplished by providing individual mentoring to the Scholars by engineers, mathematicians, and mathematics educators. In addition, professional development activities such as summer institutes were held.  Outcomes  This program successfully recruited 34 outstanding students in seven Cohorts to become mathematics teachers; all had majored as undergraduates in STEM fields. Ten (10) of these students had an undergraduate or graduate degree in engineering. These 34 students had a mean undergraduate GPA of 3.55 (out of 4).   The BEST program provided scholarships to the 34 Noyce Scholars and enrolled them in a one-year program that led to a Master?s of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree at Boston University. BU?s MAT program in mathematics has three distinct components: 1) courses focused on pedagogical content knowledge; 2) courses and experiences designed to support teachers working in high need districts and schools; and 3) practicum experiences that support the development of student-centered teaching. The BEST program also included opportunities for scholars to learn about and apply engineering design principles to the teaching of mathematics.  Thirty-three (33) of the 34 Scholars (97%) completed the MAT degree program and earned a license to teach secondary mathematics. Their mean GPA in the graduate program was 3.875 (out of 4).  Two scholars completed the MAT degree program but chose to leave the Noyce program; one left teaching and the other decided not to teach in a high-need school or district.  Of the 31 BEST Scholars who went on to teach in high needs districts, 26 have satisfied the scholarship requirements.  All of these scholars (100%) are currently mathematics teachers and still work in high-need districts. The remaining five BEST Scholars have completed a portion of their two-year commitment to teach in a high-need school or district.  Each of the BEST Scholars have taught approximately 100 students per year; about 12,700 secondary students in high-need districts have been positively affected to date. This record of placement and retention is impressive since nationally a relatively high proportion of teachers in high-need schools leave within the first four years (Baker-Doyle, 2010).  Faculty members associated with the BEST program facilitated the creation of the STEM Educator Engineering Program (STEEP) at Boston University in which students receive a BS degree in engineering and a master?s degree in education in five years. Three of the BEST Scholars subsequently came through the STEEP program. In addition, the BEST project worked with the Technology Innovation Scholars Program (TISP) in BU?s College of Engineering. This program has undergraduate engineering students designing and presenting projects to middle and high school students on how engineering impacts the world. Finally, the BEST project awarded summer internships to 10 undergraduate engineers to work on engineering design projects to motivate and develop secondary students? interest in education and engineering.
