<AbstractNarration>Traits that influence reproductive success can be both remarkably elaborate and differ greatly between related species. Variation in such traits not only influences an individual?s success in populations, but can also help form new species when groups differ in characteristics important to choosing a mate. Measuring reproductive success becomes more complex when animals mate with multiple individuals within a single breeding cycle, a common occurrence. Reproductive success, a major influence on trait evolution, is then shaped not only by success in achieving matings, but also by competitively fertilizing eggs, and producing high quality offspring. Using lines of flour beetles whose males? produce sperm with red or green fluorescent tagged heads, this research will evaluate the outcome of these different selective episodes and identify their contribution to reproductive success. The use of the fluorescent sperm lines also enables identification of mechanisms underlying differences in competitive fertilization success within populations, as well as differences in fertilization capability in hybrid versus same species matings. Finally, this research will explore how repeated matings influence offspring production in this highly promiscuous species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because flour beetles are economically significant stored grain pests, insight to their reproductive system can inform management efforts. Additionally, the project will include involvement of multiple undergraduate researchers and outreach to the Syracuse City School District.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Because females of most internally fertilizing animals mate with multiple males within a single breeding cycle, reproductive success is influenced not only by success in achieving matings, but also by competitively fertilizing eggs, and producing high quality offspring. Sexual selection occurring after mating (i.e., sperm competition and cryptic female choice) is recognized as a potent force driving evolutionary diversification in reproductive traits, and even important in the formation of new species. However, due to inherent difficulties in observing events within the female reproductive tract, the male and female traits contributing to variation in competitive fertilization success are not well understood.   Genetic engineering of populations of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, such that their sperm heads express a green or red fluorescent protein, have recently revolutionized the study of postcopulatory sexual selection by enabling detailed, real-time observation of sperm behavior within the female reproductive tract coupled with the ability to discriminate among the sperm of competing males.  This grant supported research by the same research team to genetically engineer similar green- and red-tagged sperm lines of another model insect system: the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum.  Because this species is a major worldwide pest of stored grains, knowledge of its reproductive biology is important.  In addition, the structure of its sperm and of the female reproductive tract are radically different from that of the fruit fly, making the knowledge gained valuable for our understanding of diversity in mechanisms of male-male and ejaculate-female interaction. This beetles mating system is also unique, as both sexes exhibit extreme promiscuity, mating with numerous sexual partners every day.  Results indicate that a given T. castaneum maleÆs sperm persist and fertilize eggs through at least seven rematings by the female. Additionally, the proportion of a maleÆs sperm in the bursa (the site of spermatophore deposition), which is influenced by both timing of femaleÆs ejecting excess sperm and male size, significantly predicted paternity share in the 24 hours following a mating. Contrary to expectation, proportional representation of sperm within the femaleÆs specialized sperm-storage organ did not significantly predict paternity, though spermathecal sperm may play a role in fertilization when females do not have access to mates for longer time periods. These results allowed us to address the adaptive significance of the identified reproductive mechanisms in the context of T. castaneumÆs unique mating system and ecology.  Experiments were also conducted to examining the female fitness consequences of exposure to differing humidity and nutrition environments and exposure to males manipulated to deliver different ejaculate products during mating.  The results support the hypothesis that extreme female promiscuity is an adaptation to "forage" for moisture contained in ejaculates, which comes at a cost to males. This pattern is in contrast to the frequently found pattern of sexual antagonism in which males benefit from an elevated mating rate at a cost to female fitness.  This award supported the successful completion of a female studentÆs doctoral dissertation, as well as the research training of several undergraduate students, of which two (both females from groups under-represented in science) have coauthored publications in quality peer-reviewed journals.
