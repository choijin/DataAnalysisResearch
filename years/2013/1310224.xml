<AbstractNarration>The 7th International Conference on Levy Processes: Theory and Applications  will be held on July 15 - 19, 2013 in Wroclaw, Poland.  Levy processes are stochastic processes that evolve in continuous time on  a continuous state space. They include Poisson processes, Brownian motion, and any other process with independent and stationary increments.  Levy processes provide a useful class of processes with jumps for applications in many diverse fields of  science and engineering, as well as many useful models in mathematics and statistics.  This conference is held every other year, and brings together leading researchers in the field.  There is also a strong tradition of including students and beginning reserchers, includign a "summer school" that precedes the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF travel grant will provide financial support for attendees, with preference given to students and beginnign researchers.  This technical conference brings togetherleading international researchers in random process modeling, including both deep theory and practical applications.  Important applications include finance, physics, climate, and water resources.  This series of  conferences has become a valuable resource for students and beginning researchers, exposing them to the latest advances, and providing useful networking opportunities.  There is also a "summer school" to prepare for the meeting, so that attendees can clearly understand the advanced topics.
