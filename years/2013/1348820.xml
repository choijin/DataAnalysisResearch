<AbstractNarration>EHR Core Research&lt;br/&gt;Workforce Development&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is conducting a workforce development capacity building project that is designed to advance the strategic integration of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) into graduate and professional STEM programs in 21st century research universities by setting the stage for robust research studies. The PI proposes to conduct a workshop to explore pedagogical issues such as the effectiveness of flipped classrooms merged with MOOCs through a rigorous experimental design, data collection, and analysis process. The workshop will provide a platform for thought leaders and key stakeholders, including employers, to discuss paths for incorporating these emerging educational portals and platforms into the existing fabric of universities. They will discuss the findings of the workshop and identify research questions about technology, pedagogy, widespread implementation, and specific implications for graduate education.</AbstractNarration>

The methodology called for comparing the outcomes of on-campus and MOOC course to see if outcomes differ when the same or similar content is offered in two different settings. Data collection has included pre- and post-course attitude and behavioral surveys of students in MOOCs, real-time observation of Coursera MOOC activities, and data collection through Coursera of student performance.

This was realized through a campus-wide survey of University of Illinois instructional staff. The development of the survey involved conducting interviews with selected faculty and staff with knowledge of MOOCs to determine appropriate questioning, gain an understanding of the key issues related to MOOCs at a research university, and to examine the particular nuances related to MOOCs in STEM fields.
