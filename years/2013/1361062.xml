<AbstractNarration>This is a project to develop a tutor that will teach the skills of innovation through invention.  The Invention Tutor will simulate the guidance of a well-trained inquiry teacher, who asks critical questions and gives feedback just at the right time, to push students' thinking forward. By tracking student trajectories through the Invention process, the Invention Tutor will respond adaptively to student moves. Most importantly, the tutor will eliminate the constraint of needing a large teacher: student ratio to implement the Invention method successfully. This work will have broader impact by scaling up a successful instructional technique, with the ultimate goal of enhancing deep learning and transfer in science domains, for both  high and low-achieving student populations. The project also has significant intellectual merit. The research will identify effective forms of support for Invention tasks and expand our understanding of the Invention process itself. More generally, findings will inform the field's understanding of the process of discovery and how best to guide it. In addition, the Invention Tutor will represent a new kind of tutor that guides open-ended discovery tasks, as opposed to the more typical tutor that guides students to solve well-defined problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innovation is an important 21st century skill. The Invention tutor strives to teach that skill without the high teacher:student ratio typically required when teaching such soft skills. Most intelligent tutoring systems rely on a fixed set of rules that guide how the tutor interacts with students that are derived from a study of the tutor's discipline and a cognitive task analysis of what is required to learn the subject. The Invention tutor has no such underlying cognitive task analysis and the challenge of building the tutor will lie in uncovering the rules that guide tutor-student interactions and building upon previous tutor-student successful interactions. The intelligent tutoring system will be disseminated through free web access and the data collected in the project will be available for secondary analyses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A challenge for the field of learning sciences is understanding how technology can best support open-ended learning activities that involve exploration, ill-structured problem-solving, and/or inquiry.  A key question is how technology can provide enough structure to keep students from floundering without suppressing the exploratory nature of the task.  We investigated this question in the context of Invention &ndash; a form of open-ended learning activity in which students invent their own equations for physical science phenomena.  Invention has been shown to enhance the transfer of STEM concepts to novel domains, however students need some guidance in constructing their inventions.  Thus, a major goal of this research was to design and implement the Invention Coach &ndash; a computerized environment that scaffolds students as they develop their inventions.  In the process of designing the Coach, we conducted several studies to identify the optimal level and form of guidance for Invention activities.      To design our Invention Coach system, we began with an exploratory study of human teacher guidance of Invention.  We found that teachers adopted an "ask more, tell less" style of guidance, where they asked far more questions than they gave explanations.  Moreover, the more teachers posed deep questions and the less they explained, the more students were able to transfer their understandings of physical science equations to novel situations.  We incorporated this style of guidance into our Invention Coach system, refraining from giving didactic explanations and instead prompting students with open-ended questions.  Building on the literature on computer-based guidance for inquiry and Invention specifically, we designed our Coach guidance so that it (1) problematizes students? solutions by contradicting and poking holes in students? incorrect invention attempts, (2) evokes core learning processes that underlie Invention &ndash; activating prior knowledge, identifying knowledge gaps, and noticing deep features of the domain, and (3) provides adaptive guidance based on students? knowledge gaps.  After several cycles of building prototypes and pilot testing them, we constructed our final, full guidance Invention Coach and contrasted it with minimal- and no-guidance versions of the same system in a classroom study with middle schoolers.  We found that our designed guidance was effective at enhancing transfer.   We also found that our full guidance version was more effective than the no guidance version, which adds evidence to a debate in the literature about whether guidance during the Invention process is beneficial at all.      The Invention Coach project provides evidence for the optimal level and type of guidance for scaffolding students through Invention and other open-ended learning activities, when the goal is transfer. Our results indicate that guidance that adaptively problematizes student solution attempts while encouraging core learning processes can effectively enhance transfer of deep structures in STEM domains.  Moreover, the work provides a blueprint of how to create other technology that supports open-ended learning activities though an effective design process that combines the study of naturalistic human guidance, best practices from the literature, cycles of prototyping and testing, along with formative evaluation studies of more advanced versions of the technology. Finally, we have built the first educational technology to support Invention with an adaptive coaching strategy.  Our hope is that eventually, after further perfecting and generalization, the Invention Coach will help spread and scale the proven instructional method of Invention to many classrooms and teachers.
