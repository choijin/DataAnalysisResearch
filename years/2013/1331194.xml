<AbstractNarration>INTELLECTUAL MERIT&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal in this project is to develop the design principles to establish nitrogen fixing ability in the unicellular cyanobacterium, Synechocystis 6803, an oxygenic photosynthetic organism. Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth. While a few plants acquire fixed nitrogen via symbioses with microorganisms, most plants obtain nitrogen through uptake of nitrogenous compounds from the soil. The application of nitrogen-containing fertilizers is widely used to enhance plant growth. However, artificial fertilizers are expensive and have serious negative environmental effects, including degradation of soil quality and runoff and contamination of water sources. A solution to the problem of nitrogen availability to crop plants is to engineer plant cells with the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen into usable compounds.  Presently, a major challenge in developing such a system is the fact that photosynthesis in chloroplasts generates oxygen, a potent inhibitor of nitrogenase, the key enzyme for nitrogen fixation.  Interestingly, a number of cyanobacterial strains have the ability to perform both nitrogen fixation and oxygenic photosynthesis, using ingenious strategies that separate these two processes temporally.  This project uses synthetic biology tools to engineer a non-diazotrophic cyanobacterium to fix nitrogen, thereby defining the minimum requirements for nitrogen fixation to occur in photosynthetic cells including those in crop plants. If successful, this effort will usher a new paradigm for integrating seemingly incompatible metabolic functions in a photosynthetic cell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS&lt;br/&gt;Enhanced production of crop plants is an urgent need for the production of food, feed and fuel for an ever-increasing human population on this planet, and efficient use of nitrogen is a key factor to meet such a need. The knowledgebase created in this project will be directly applicable to engineer nitrogen-fixing crop plants, and will thus have enormous potentials for societal benefits. The project team has broad expertise in cyanobacterial systems biology, computational modeling, and synthetic biology, and plans to develop innovative interdisciplinary educational programs focused on the application of such approaches to photosynthetic organisms. In particular, emphasis will be placed on (1) Development of an inter-institutional iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) training program for undergraduate students; and (2) Engagement of international partners at two academic institutions in India. Both set of activities will be intimately linked to the research goals of this project, and will be aimed at providing hands on training opportunities for students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this collaborative project, we have determined the diurnal regulation of cellular processes in the cyanobacterium <em>Synechocystis</em> sp. strain PCC 6803.

We then illuminated the regulatory networks for both <em>Synechocystis</em> and <em>Cyanothece</em>. In <em>Cyanothece</em> ATCC 51142, a number of cellular processes, such as glycolysis, the OPPP, amino acid biosynthesis, the TCA cycle, nitrogen fixation, and cyanophycin biosynthesis, are upregulated mostly during the dark period, while in <em>Synechocystis</em> PCC 6803, only cyanophycin biosynthesis is upregulated in the dark.

The <em>Cyanothece</em> network was examined to identify regulatory genes that may control the <em>nif</em> cluster. Of 33 cycling genes in the <em>nif</em> cluster, 27 (belonging to 11 different clusters) had a set of regulatory influences that included either <em>patB</em> or <em>sigE</em> and <em>sigD</em> genes, which are identified as components of nitrogen fixation in <em>Anabaena</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Meanwhile, we developed native genetic elements and synthetic biology toolbox for biotechnology application in <em>Synechocystis</em> 6803.

The <em>nif</em> gene cluster from <em>Cyanothece</em> 51142 was cloned and expressed in <em>Synechocystis</em> 6803.

Nitrogen fixation reached an activity level of 2% relative to that in <em>Cyanothece</em> 51142 grown under similar conditions. This is the first time that a nondiazotrophic phototroph has been engineered for biosynthesis of a fully functional nitrogenase enzyme and has been found to exhibit detectible and stable nitrogen fixation activity. We then identified a minimal <em>nif</em> cluster for nitrogen fixation using a &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; method, which determines the influence of a gene on nitrogenase activity by selectively removing individual genes from the <em>nif</em> cluster. Intriguingly, an engineered TSyNif-2 strain with a reduced cluster of 24 genes has a 3-fold increase in nitrogen fixation activity compared to strain TSyNif-1 with more <em>nif</em> genes.
