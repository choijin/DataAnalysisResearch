<AbstractNarration>Volcanic and igneous activity, which involve through production of melts known as magmas and their subsequent transport and cooling, play a crucial role in how Earth's layered structure has evolved and cooled over time. Melts differing in composition from their source produce various rock types found on the Earth.  Earth's cooling rate is affected because melts can move, carrying heat with them, but impede heat conduction if stationary, because they have low thermal diffusivity (D). Up to the present, methods to accurately measure D were not available. The proposed work is timely because accurate measurements of D at high temperatures (T) are now possible. The proposed study is made possible by technology transfer from materials science to geoscience.  Although the immediate use for these new data is to better understand the processes of rock melting and volcanism, and the balance of heat transport by flow and heat impedance by slow conduction, the findings will help us to understand microscopic processes and therefore reveal the basic physics of heat transport. Thus, this study thus will potentially contribute to our understanding of the Earth's history of internal differentiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, heat transport in melts well above melting temperature will be quantified using laser flash analysis (LFA) which lacks commonly occutring systematic errors of contact losses and spurious radiative transfer gains. Although LFA is the industry standard in materials science, the investigator's  laboratory is the only one in Earth science pursuing this technique. Thus far they have measured D of a small number of glass compositions and to at most a few hundred degrees above the glass transition temperature (because flow terminates data collection from suspended samples), yet these few results have provided important insights into melt behavior. Results just above melting of a small number of compositions have provided new insight into microscopic behavior of complex magmas, but the findings of an heretofore unrecognized radiative mechanism involving IR photons, needs to be verified before accurate models can be constructed that permit extrapolation of these data to conditions in Earth's interior. It is proposed to: (1) Develop a new graphite cell enabling measurement of D for 'fragile' silicate liquids above liquidus over a large T range; (2) Independently measure dD/dT of several geologically important melts by applying their current technique to glasses with varying H2O contents, for which the glass transition temperature varies drastically; (3) Determine D as a function of T for diverse lavas from through the glass transition to superliquidus conditions;  (4) Quantify effects of Si, Fe, and Ca which their present data indicate are important; (5) Construct a new microscopic model based on the results and formulae for Dmelt(T,X,P), for subsequent use for a variety of Earth Sciences applications that require thermal modeling.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of the project is to better understand heat transport properties associated with molten Earth materials.  These materials are silicate magmas and lavas present at shallow levels (crust and mantle) and metals buried in the core.  Efforts centered on laboratory measurements of thermal diffusivity using a laser flash apparatus, which provides data free of systematic errors. Because almost all previous measurements include two systematic errors, one positive and one negative, heat transport has been greatly misunderstood.  Accordingly, this project returned to the basics of heat and light being the same phenomenon.  Measurements were made of glasses and metals as a function of time and length, which are the key variables describing diffusion.  Effects of chemical composition and polymerization were also probed. Our results show that all heat inside matter is diffused radiatively, where the frequency of light diffusing depends on the temperature.  The findings are presented in a book (Hofmeister, A.M. Measurements, Mechanisms, and Models of Heat Transport in Condensed Matter. Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2018). The new model differs from the previous models, stemming from the work of Debye near 1900 and earlier, which assumed that heat and sound are the same phenomenon, which is not true, but was hidden by the inaccurate experimental data, and fealty to centuries old ideas, which were never proven. This study performed the needed experiments to test the hypotheses and developed a new model.  Regarding broader impacts, the book pertains to astrophysics, applied physics, basic physics, engineering, planetary science and geoscience in general.  Specific research areas are thermodynamics, spectroscopy, kinetic theory, heat transfer, radiative transfer, and mass diffusion. Glass is used in many technological devices, and so understanding heat transfer arising from diffusion and also that crossing these transparent materials without interaction are  important to improving devices such as tablets.  Broader impacts are also met in that the PI is a woman with a disability; both categories are underrepresented in science.  Regarding specific behavior of silicate rocks, magmas and melts, most of the project involved providing the best data possible for futher use in thermal models. Some thermal models were constructed, focusing on the lower mantle, which showed that the interior is heating up, while the exterior cools, due to the slow diffusion of heat and the large size of the earth. Our work points towards magmatism, not convection, being the primary means by which Earth overall cools.  Our work also shows that the core is melting, not freezing as commonly assumed.  The end of the project involved coordinated measurements of thermal diffusivity, thermal expansivity, and viscosity of mid-ocean ridge basalts, which are the most important rocks near Earth?s surface and are primary melts from the upper mantle.  We discovered that basaltic melts are far more impacted by hydration than is currently realized.  This discovery pertains to generation of melts and their ascent, and constrains the amount of hydration in Earth's interior.
