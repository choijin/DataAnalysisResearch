<AbstractNarration>Objective: To provide financial support for invited speakers to attend the IEEE Photonics Society Topical Conference on Non-reciprocal Photonic Devices, to be held in Hawaii from July 8-10, 2013. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;This meeting will bring together experts to discuss research opportunities and to address the challenges associated with non-reciprocal photonic devices. Non-reciprocal optical devices, including isolators and circulators, are important in optical communication networks to prevent adverse backward reflection, interference and feedback. The advantages and disadvantages of different existing approaches, including both magnetic and non-magnetic concepts, will be reviewed at this meeting. Members from academia, national labs, industry, and government labs will be invited to workshop. These areas of research are of considerable interest to many current programs of the ECCS division. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;The meeting aims to bring together international researchers from academia, government and industry to assess the current state-of-the-art of non-reciprocal photonic devices. The advantages and disadvantages of different approaches, including magnetic and non-magnetic concepts, for non-reciprocity in photonic systems will be addressed. Participation of junior faculty and members of underrepresented groups in science and engineering will be fostered based on NSF funds to partially cover registration and travel expenses. In addition, the workshop will set broad directions for future research and will impact interdisciplinary scientific efforts.</AbstractNarration>
