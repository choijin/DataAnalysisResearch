<AbstractNarration>This NUE in Engineering program entitled, "NUE: Development of Multidisciplinary Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education Program at the University of Rochester Integrated Nanosystems Center", at the University of Rochester (UR), is under the direction of Dr. Nicholas P. Bigelow. The Integrated Nanosystems Center (URNano) is truly interdisciplary, and involves faculty and students from the Departments of Optics, Chemistry, Physics, Biomedical, Chemical, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, as well as the UR Medical Center. The primary goals of this NUE project are: 1) creating a coherent education program at the UR, promoting collaboration between several UR departments to introduce undergraduate students to the field of nanotechnology; 2) creating a transformable model of collaboration in nanotechnology between a university with state-of-the-art, experimental facilities, and Monroe Community College (MCC); and 3) developing reproducible hands-on experiments ("mini-labs"), learning materials and pedagogical methods to educate students with diverse backgrounds, including freshmen and non-STEM-major community college students.  The same "mini-labs" will be introduced in various UR courses for UR freshmen and sophomores.  Based on earlier NSF supported collaboration between the UR and MCC, both institutions will continue this collaboration to educate nanotechnology students with diverse backgrounds.  Establishing  the URNano education program and involving in it MCC will lay the foundation for future projects of the UR and MCC with other community colleges of Upstate New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project impacts a variety of science and engineering students with diverse backgrounds including under-represented groups (~34% of MCC students are minorities and over 50% are women).  This project will attract more community college students to the universities involved in this NUE program. Summer NSF REU and RET programs and interactive workshops including participation in the ALPhA immersion program will provide students and teachers from other institutions, especially community colleges and small univesities, with an opportunity to learn about affordable "mini-labs' at the UR and MCC.  Teachers from the City of Rochester Northwest College Preparatory School serving mostly minority students will be invited to the interactive workshop.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A training program was created for the University of Rochester (UR) undergraduate students specializing in different areas of nanotechnology, with a Certificate in Nanoscience and Nanoengineering issued upon program completion. 9 students were awarded the Certificate and 10 other students are working in this direction. To complete this Program, students have to pass through the specially developed Nanometrology&nbsp; Laboratory course, two other courses on nanotechnology which were already offered at the UR, and either a research or design project on nanotechnology&nbsp; involving an industrial partner. Nanoscience and nanotechnology materials and lab experiments were included into several other classes for students outside the Certificate program. More than 130 UR students including freshmen benefited from this project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to offering a Certificate Program, the goal of this project was also to develop and test various versions of mini-labs and supporting materials to facilitate understanding concepts and tools of nanotechnology by students with <em>diverse backgrounds</em>. Collaboration with Monroe Community College (MCC) led to development of&nbsp; a combination of lecture modules on modern physics and nanotechnology with experimental demonstrations and hands-on experiments for both lower-division, general-education students and STEM majors. MCC students carried out some of these hand-on experiments at the UR as part of the laboratory portion of MCC courses on Modern Physics both for Engineering and Liberal Arts students. At the UR, MCC students carried out UV photolithography in a clean room and atomic force microscopy of nanoparticles. UR instructors delivered the lectures to MCC students with demonstration of capabilities of the multi-million-dollar-federal-funding UR Integrated Nanosystems Center. 52 MCC students were taught at the UR. This project demonstrates a reproducible model of collaboration between a university with  strong programs in science and technology and modern experimental  facilities, and a nearby, two-year community college.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual merit:</strong> The project addressed one of the most important concepts of modern science and engineering education that is now being applied to important technological problems.
