<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Lisa M. Berreau of the Department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry at Utah State University will develop a fundamentally new type of photoinduced carbon monoxide (CO) releasing molecules (photoCORMs). Such molecules are of significant interest for the administration of small amounts of CO that produces anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects, as well as vasodilation and protection of tissues against reperfusion injury. The modular design to be pursued involves the use of a 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone unit as the CO release motif. Studies of zinc complexes wherein the structure of the pyrone and a supporting chelate ligand are systematically modified will enable elucidation of chemical factors that influence structure/physical property relationships and CO release reactivity. Complementary computational and mechanistic studies will provide insight into the reaction pathway involved in CO release and will provide guidance in the design of subsequent generations of pyrone-based CO release agents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new photoCORMs to be developed have the potential for use in biological and medicinal chemistry investigations, as well as applications in chemical synthesis. This project is fully integrated with the recruitment and training of undergraduate and graduate students, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.  Students will receive training in synthesis and photochemistry, and will benefit from interactions with domestic and international collaborators.</AbstractNarration>
