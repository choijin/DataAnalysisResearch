<AbstractNarration>With this award, the University of Central Florida develops an I-Corps Site to enhance technology commercialization to develop a world-class innovation ecosystem. The goal of the UCF I-Corps Sites program is to enhance the transition of UCF research into the marketplace, and to increase the number of I-Corps teams, ventures, and spin-off companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UCF I-Corps Sites program will enable the university to expand its entrepreneurship offerings to reach additional prospective and under-represented participants, and to realign its entrepreneurship programming across campus in order to create a steady supply of entrepreneurial teams. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UCF I-Corps Sites program will provide entrepreneurial services to approximately 32 teams per year and consist of the following elements: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Recruiting technology entrepreneurial teams across UCF campus with special efforts to recruit women, underrepresented minorities, and graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;(2) Implementation of the Business Model Canvas workshop as a prerequisite for the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Direct team support will be coordinated by the existing UCF Venture Accelerator for activities such as: acquisition of fabrication materials and work at two prototyping labs; travel expenses; entrepreneurial training; booth at the "Innovation Concourse of the Southeast"; market research, ombudsman assistance, business planning, SBRI assistance, coaching network, investment capital assistance, and shared office space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The University of Central Florida I-Corps Sites program will serve to enhance and strengthen Central Florida's growing innovation ecosystem, contributing towards the development of a stronger national ecosystem. UCF is an active leader and an engaged partner in the Central Florida innovation ecosystem and cultivates new and nurtures existing partnerships that bring together businesses, academia, research centers, and communities to jointly deliver societal benefits such as high-value job creation, and economic growth for the region.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The UCF I-Corps Site project leveraged the collective power of UCF?s research and commercialization assets to achieve its vision to enhance technology commercialization, to develop a world-class innovation ecosystem, and to commercialize innovative research for real-world applications. The project was extended for one year through a supplemental grant to pilot the I-Corps Inclusive Entrepreneurship &ndash; Hispanic Entrepreneurship (IE-HE), a six (6) week program to address the growing Hispanic population of student and community innovators in Central Florida.  Led by an interdisciplinary team of researchers, educators, and experienced entrepreneurs and investors, the UCF I-Corps Site project encompassed a continuing cultural shift within the university towards entrepreneurship and innovation as well as UCF?s historical involvement and dedication to being a core component and a catalyst for venture creation in the Central Florida regional ecosystem. In total, 107 teams were competitively selected and completed the UCF I-Corps program, either direct or through community and other university partners.  Of the 232 people who have participated in the UCF I-Corps Site program, 53 (22.8%) have been female and 80 (34%) have been under-represented minorities. Research to capture and analyze the effects that entrepreneurial assistance programs and entrepreneurial education have on technology commercialization enabled us to curate a deeper understanding of (1) the processes, methodologies and programs for entrepreneurship education and technology commercialization and (2) best practices for transitioning research from the bench top into the marketplace.  The broader impact of the UCF I-Corps Site project has been to enhance and strengthen Central Florida?s vibrant innovation ecosystem by infusing the I-Corps methodology, curriculum, and approach throughout the region?s entrepreneurial community, thereby amplifying the collective impact.
