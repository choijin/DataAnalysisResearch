<AbstractNarration>1140384 (Ramaswami). This award is funded under NSF's Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability (SEES) activities, which aims to address the challenges of creating a sustainable world.  This project will develop a research collaboration network (RCN) across 20+ US universities and 2 national labs to coordinate work on the overarching theme of sustainable cities, with focus on reducing energy use, carbon emissions and mitigating climate-risks to water supply and public health in cities. The US network will collaborate with international sustainability research networks (in Australia, EU, Asia) and with a network of practitioners and policymakers in US and global cities.  RCN activities will lead to the development of (a) inter-disciplinary systems framework(s) to represent linkages between people, infrastructures and the natural system, from the city-scale to the global scale, that shape sustainability outcomes in cities, (b) harmonized methods and international data standards to operationalize the framework, to report, for example, the carbon footprints of cities, water vulnerability of cities, or to analyze social actors who shape urban infrastructures and consumption patterns toward sustainability, (c) a network of 12 global cities for testing the framework and its component theories and models/methods in cities with different natural, infrastructural, socioeconomic and cultural characteristics, (d) a virtual collaborative forum to share research methods, experiences and teaching tools across more than 20+ US universities on the common thematic area of sustainable cities.  The RCN will provide science based systems analysis tools, much needed by more than 1000 cities worldwide that are developing sustainability plans addressing energy, water and climate change. A unique aspect of this RCN is broad-based integration across urban ecology, industrial ecology, atmospheric sciences, infrastructure engineering, architecture, urban planning, behavioral sciences, public affairs and public health  toward the goal of sustainable cities. Cross-discipline integration, coordination of data across scales, and cross-city comparisons are expected to advance the science of sustainable cities.  The RCN has potential to impact more than 1200 students in participating US universities and 65 million people in the network of cities where field work will be coordinated. Dissemination potential is high through network links with policy groups such as ICLEI-USA and The World Bank who work with cities worldwide.</AbstractNarration>

Develop a network of researchers who are aware of each other?s work and have formed partnerships to develop new grants Create opportunities for students to network and discuss their research and professional opportunities    These goals were accomplished, which led to the following outcomes.     Outcomes   1a) Creating a virtual collaborative forum   The following virtual collaborative forums were created:  Website: http://www.rcnsustainablecities.com/  Blog: https://sustainablecitiesrcn.wordpress.com/ LinkedIn: RCN Sustainable Cities Twitter: https://twitter.com/RCNcities   At the completion of this grant the blog had over 276 followers and a total of 2,217 file downloads.

The RCN Newsletter has since been expanded to include the SRN Sustainable Healthy Cities Network, and is now called the RCN-SRN Newsletter.     1c) Developing products such as review papers, policy papers, and synthesis papers  Eight publications were produced through this RCN, including "Translating Research to Policy for Sustainable Cities," published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology, and "Capturing Structural and Functional Diversity through Institutional Analysis: The Mayor Position in City Charters" published in Urban Affairs Review.  In addition, commentaries on UN-Habitat issue papers were published, and RCN members Clint Andrews and Anu Ramaswami were quoted in a New York Times article which focused on metrics to compare sustainability of cities.  In August 2017, RCN-SRN researchers met to plan for a journal special issue on interdisciplinary perspectives on distributed infrastructure. The outcome of this workshop will be a publication submitted in 2018.     1d) Reporting on harmonized methods and data standards  The first RCN supported workshop hosted in 2012 led to the development of the U.S. Community Protocol for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, a collaborative effort between the RCN and the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI).

Attendees came together to discuss topics ranging from the latest in distributed infrastructure research to pathways for tribal college students to attend 4-year degree Universities.  Outcomes of these activities included the sharing of best practices for interdisciplinary education on sustainable cities; identification of collaborative research projects; graduate students obtaining a deeper understanding of interdisciplinary research; and multi-sectoral approaches for developing solutions to urban challenges.     2) Develop a network of researchers who are aware of each other?s work and have formed partnerships to develop new grants  Valuable partnerships were developed through the collaborative forums, e-newsletter, and workshops, which helped U.S. and international researchers come together to share their research.

Many presented their research findings at the workshops as well and took advantage of opportunities to network with city, state, utility and other public and private representatives. Three of the workshops were designed specifically with student training and professional development in mind.       Last Modified: 01/15/2018       Submitted by: Anu Ramaswami]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
