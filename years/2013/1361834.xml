<AbstractNarration>The planned I/UCRC for Windstorm Hazard Mitigation intends to undertake functions at the interface between basic and applied research and between private and public interests. Working with its members, the Center will focus on seeking solutions to real world problems encountered by industry members and improve their performance and competitiveness; enhancing government agencies and NGOs capabilities to prepare for and respond to future windstorms; transferring findings from federally sponsored research to products and intellectual properties that benefit researchers, university, and industry; and facilitating collaboration between Center members by developing long-term strategies for enhancing community resiliency to wind and other hazards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned center aims to protect homeowners, businesses, and communities through collaborative research in windstorm mitigation and the implementation of innovations will enhance the Nation's resiliency to future disasters. Integrated in the project are several initiatives aimed at increasing diversity and collectively they contribute to the development of a more diverse workforce and business environment. Meanwhile, the planning activities provide a unique opportunity for students to interact with the industry, improve their communication skills, and enhance their employment potentials. The project helps develop students with strong problem solving, marketable capabilities. The project also helps train Center faculty on how to work with the industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Aimed to improve our Nation's ability to manage risk and improve resiliency of critical infrastructure against extreme wind hazards, Texas Tech University, Louisiana State University, and University of Alabama teamed up to establish the Center for Wind Hazard and Infrastructure Performance (WHIP). The objective of the planning grant awarded by the NSF was to organize meetings between potential members and participating faculty to agree on the initial research agenda and secure financial commitment.  Two planning meetings were held in 2014 and 2016, participanted by 55 people, including 24 from industry and government agencies. Feedbacks were gathered from perspective members and used for refine project proposals, time line, and Center agreement.       Students were supported to travel to the 1st planning meeting, interacting with practitioners from industry and government agencies and learning about their needs. Faculty who participated had the opportunity to connect their knowhow to real&shy;-world problems.               Results from the planning meetings are likely to make an impact on finding solutions to real-world problems encountered by industry members and improve their performance and competitiveness; enhancing government agencies and NGOs capabilities to prepare for and respond to future windstorms.       This award is likely to lead to the establishment of a multi-university I/UCRC to provide sustained and coordinated funding opportunities to multidisciplinary teams of researchers and practitioners for enhancing our Nation's capacity to manage the risk of future windstorms.
