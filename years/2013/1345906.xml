<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a novel Multivariate Optical Element (MOE) technology platform for fluorescence biomarker applications with superior spectroscopic discrimination performance as compared to traditional bandpass filter techniques. Life science assays utilizing fluorescence for discrimination employ a non-trivial compensation strategy for detecting more than one biomarker at a time using optical bandpass filters. The MOE platform combines the data collection and processing steps of a traditional multivariate chemical analysis into a single step via an all-optical computing technology with little to no moving parts as well as exhibits a multiplexing advantage as compared to optical bandpass filters. This optical regression can offer real-time measurements with relatively high signal-to-noise ratio that realize the advantages of multiplexed detection and pattern recognition in a simple optical instrument. The objectives of this research are two-fold: design and fabrication of a compressed detection MOE filter set for detecting multiple fluorescent biomarkers simultaneously with strong spectroscopic interference as well as comparing the detection performance of the MOE sensor with traditional optical bandpass filter methodologies. It is anticipated that the sensitivity and specificity of an MOE detection mechanism will be superior to bandpass filter detection of fluorescent biomarkers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be a novel technology that will provide an optical detection platform for fluorescence biomarker applications with superior spectroscopic discrimination performance as compared to current bandpass filter techniques. The success of a commercial fluorescent diagnostic assay is dependent on the selection of a fluorescent biomarker; due to the broad nature of fluorescence biomarker emission profiles, only a small number of fluorescence biomarkers may be discriminated from each other as a function of excitation source. The specificity advantage of MOE-based sensors will allow fluorescent biomarkers that were once incapable of discrimination from one another via optical bandpass filters to be employed in a common assay panel. As more discrete biomarkers may be detected simultaneously, more specific diagnostic assay panels may be constructed. A simplified MOE-based sensor may ultimately reduce the requirement for highly trained operators as well as move certain life science applications like disease prognostication from the laboratory to the point of care.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  CIRTEMO's results of this Phase I SBIR demonstrate that routine laboratory instrumentation which employ optical fluorescence as a mechanism for detection of a disease state may be reduced in both optical design and cost. This may allow less expensive laboratory tests for the general health care market in addition to instrumentation platforms that can travel outside of the laboratory to the point of care.   Fluorescence analytical instrumentation are expensive instruments to own and maintain in addition to requiring complex assay development inclusive of matching fluorescence biomarkers to various filter/mirror combinations.  The success of a commercial fluorescent diagnostic assay is dependent on the selection of a fluorescent biomarker.  Due to the broad nature of fluorescence biomarker emission profiles, only a small number of fluorescence biomarkers may be discriminated from each other as a function of excitation source (eg. laser, LED, etc.). As part of this SBIR Phase I award, CIRTEMO has developed a novel optical platform based on optical computing technology for fluorescence biomarker detection.  CIRTEMOÆs Multivariate Optical Element (MOE) technology is capable of detecting optical analytical signals in the presence of strongly overlapping/interfering species. This technology platform has the potential for disrupting the application-specific, point of care and medical device market space by allowing strongly overlapping emission biomarkers to be employed under a common optical excitation source with a superior detection sensitivity and specificity as compared to traditional band pass optical configuration systems.   The following major milestones have been accomplished as part of this award:  MOEs have historically been matched 1:1 to a discrete analyte or class prediction; however, MOE filter sets are capable of sensing projections of the original sparse spectroscopic space enabling a small set of MOEs to discriminate a multitude of target analytes. An MOE family consisting of 2 MOEs has been designed for the detection and discrimination of more than 2 fluorescent analytes with spectroscopic overlap (FITC, PE and PE-CF594). A comparison was made with a traditional optical band pass filter approach which required a discrete band pass filter for each fluorescent analyte. Three approaches for designing MOEs for compressed detection were also identified and discussed.    Optical regression with MOEs can offer real-time measurements with relatively high signal-to-noise ratio that realize the advantages of multiplexed detection and pattern recognition in a simple optical instrument.  Although not discussed at length, the total physical thicknesses of the MOEs are tremendously thinner and require far fewer layers to fabricate than traditional band pass filters.  The specificity advantage of MOE-based sensors allows fluorescent biomarkers that were once incapable of discrimination from one another via optical band pass filters to be employed in a common assay panel along with the potential reduction of optical filters and less complicated filters to fabricate. A simplified MOE-based sensor may ultimately reduce the requirement for highly trained operators as well as move certain life science applications like disease prognostication from the laboratory to the point of care.
