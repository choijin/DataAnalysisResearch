<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Descripition of the Project's Significance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grant (BRIGE) provides funding to develop a framework for structural health monitoring, diagnosis and prognosis of fracture critical structures. Fracture critical structures are those in which the failure of a single component can generate the failure of the complete system or a large portion of it. Recent catastrophic failures of these types of structures, especially bridges, have highlighted the need for a new and transformative approach to the problem. This project will develop the computational and data analysis tools necessary to continuously monitor fracture critical structures and help prevent such failures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description of the Project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multiscale model-data fusion framework relies on a series of models, which represent the mechanical behavior of the structure at various scales of interest, and vibration measurements of local and global structural response. The project will develop algorithms capable of optimally combining the predictive capabilities of multiscale finite element models and sensor measurements, to reconstruct in real-time the complete response of the structure. The reconstructed response allows assessment of the current state of cumulative fatigue damage throughout the structure, thus anticipating potential damage before it reaches a critical level. The estimated damage condition, with its associated uncertainty is projected into the future and an estimate of the structural reliability can be obtained. The research involves development of computational algorithms, laboratory experiments and field validation using real data from an instrumented operational bridge in Vermont. The methods developed in this project will aide engineers to perform smarter early diagnosis and predictive maintenance of a multitude of conventional and non-conventional structural systems spanning civil, mechanical, biomedical and electrical applications. This project will also provide an opportunity to foster collaborations and potential applications of the research idea into medical diagnosis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities to Broaden the Participation of Underrepresented Groups in Engineering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding from this project will enable the principal investigator to recruit under-represented minorities into engineering education, research and mentoring. It will also allow him to undertake K-12 activities aimed at educating students about engineering, diversity and its critical importance in our society. This project will facilitate collaborations with existing initiatives at the University of Vermont aimed at recruiting undergraduate and graduate students, especially female and Latinos interested in pursuing careers in engineering. The PI will work with various student groups, such as the chapters of the Society of Women Engineers and American Society of Civil Engineers, which have volunteered to take part in sharing the engineering experience with K-12 students. These groups will join the PI in visiting local schools and hosting recruiting and educational activities at the university. The educational component of the project involves the development of a hands-on structural engineering lab designed to help students appreciate the role of models and sensors in understanding the behavior of structures. The PI will also develop a multidisciplinary course titled Reliability of Engineering System aimed at graduate students from all engineering disciplines. This course will incorporate data and findings from the research project into the course learning objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has been funded through the Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering solicitation, which is part of the Broadening Participation in Engineering Program of the Engineering Education and Centers Division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is also funded through the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), which is part of the Office of International and Integrative Activities.</AbstractNarration>

Fracture critical structures are those in which the failure of a single component can produce the failure of the complete structure or of a large portion of it. Recent failures of these type of structures, especially bridges, have highlighted the inefficacy of existing structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms based on "damage" detection and the need to develop new methods that allow engineers to track the accumulation of invisible damage in real-time.
