<AbstractNarration>An important component of healthy human brain function is inhibitory control, the ability to stop the currently adopted behavioral strategies in response to changing task demands. Traditionally, it has been thought that the capacity for inhibitory control is fairly stable in an individual; however, recent experimental data have revealed that human subjects readily alter their measured inhibitory control capacity in response to environmental changes. In this proposal, Dr. Angela Yu of the University of California, San Diego and Dr. Chiang-Shan Li of Yale University will use a new computational framework to account for such flexibility in terms of the underlying component processes in the brain.  They will record brain activity from the volunteers when they must interrupt a habitual response and utilize a Bayesian ideal observer framework to model subjects, internal representation of the task demands, and dynamic adjustment of that representation and consequent changes in behavioral strategy based on experienced outcomes. This project is expected to facilitate an integrated theoretical and neurobiological understanding of human cognitive control as a more dynamic and adaptive phenomenon than traditionally envisioned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deficits in inhibitory control afflict a number of psychiatric conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, drug abuse, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Understanding the brain's computational and organizational principles underlying inhibitory control would help to unravel how malfunctions of the underlying components may lead to different types of pathology, a focus of Dr. Li's current research. This proposal will allow Dr. Yu to continue to train graduate and undergraduate students in cognitive neuroscience research and, in particular, to support women scientists, who are under-represented in this field. This effort will also allow Dr. Li to broaden his participation in the Perspectives in Science and Engineering, a research program at Yale University dedicated to training undergraduates with advanced knowledge in science and engineering. Finally, Dr. Yu and Dr. Li will participate in the big data sharing effort by making the data available to support other efforts that aim to make use of real data in the teaching of STEM-related courses and to enable participation in discovery science by those who would otherwise have no access to such data.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Cognitive control is a brain function critical to our daily activities. We make plans, execute plans, detect deviance of actual from expected outcomes (surprise), and make adjustments to our plans. This sequence of cognitive activities constitutes cognitive control. In human neuroscience research we are interested in understanding the neural processes of cognitive control, not only because the knowledge gained will inform us of how we behave and act intelligently but also because the findings will help us understand why and how we sometimes make poor decisions. For instance, many studies have shown that individuals addicted to alcohol or substances are compromised in cognitive control. Because they are unable to inhibit an inappropriate habit (habitual drug use), detect error (all the negative consequences associated with drug use after the initial &ldquo;high&rdquo;), or adjust behavior, addicted individuals continue to engage in drug abuse despite knowledge of all the negative consequences.</p> <p>The overarching goal of this CRCNS project is to understand the roles of the medial prefrontal cortex &ndash; a specific area situated along the midline of the brain - in prediction and learning during cognitive control. The specific aims are achieved through a combination of computational modeling and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of a laboratory task. We use fMRI because it provides a non-invasive tool for us to examine how brain responds to certain events, such as making decision and detecting errors. We use a laboratory task because this would allow us to examine brain responses to similar events repeatedly (so we have enough samples to test statistically) and in a controlled manner (in contrast to a real-life setting, where many variables cannot be controlled). We use computational modeling because a mathematical model allows us to quantify participants&rsquo; psychological state, such as how much they expect things will go wrong&nbsp; when they perform an action.</p> <p>We have answered all three questions proposed in the application. First, we showed that distinct areas of the medial prefrontal cortex respond to conflict anticipation (how likely things are to go wrong), response adjustment (we will do things differently if things are more likely to go wrong), and prediction error (surprise &ndash; actual outcome deviates from expected outcome). These distinct areas are shown in Figure 1. We also conducted an additional experiment to verify that a brain region called dorsal anterior cingulate cortex indeed responds to prediction error when other confounding psychological factors are controlled for (Figure 2). Second, we showed that the relative timing of conflicting inputs (a stimulus signaling you to act and another one instructing you not to act) engages a different brain region in the posterior part of the brain and responses from this brain region can influence learning and how well we are able to inhibit an inappropriate response. Third, we showed that when we are specifically rewarded to act (by receiving monetary compensation when we are very fast in executing a response), we are compromised in the ability to inhibit an inappropriate response. Further, we extended this research to alcohol and substance abusing populations and demonstrated how individuals addicted to cocaine or engaged in heavy drinking are compromised in these processes. They performed poorly on the task and showed different patterns of brain response, in contrast to non-drug using individuals. Importantly, the poorer the performance, the more likely they will relapse to drug use after treatment.</p> <p>Together, these findings have a significant impact on systems/cognitive and clinical neuroscience. The study characterized the component neural processes of cognitive control and how these processes are altered in drug/alcohol addicted individuals. As deficits in cognitive control represent a primary etiological process of many other &ldquo;externalizing&rdquo; disorders, we expect the current results would have broad impact on clinical neuroscience research.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/15/2017<br>      Modified by: Chiang-Shan&nbsp;Li</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1309260/1309260_10278893_1505144598098_Li_BCSOutcome_2017_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1309260/1309260_10278893_1505144598098_Li_BCSOutcome_2017_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Li_BCS1309260_Outcome_2017_Fig1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1309260/1309260_10278893_1505144598098_Li_BCSOutcome_2017_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Li_BCS1309260_Outcome_2017_Fig1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1</div> <div class="imageCredit">Elsevier</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Chiang-Shan&nbsp;Li</div> <div class="imageTitle">Li_BCS1309260_Outcome_2017_Fig1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1309260/1309260_10278893_1505144662670_Li_BCSOutcome_2017_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1309260/1309260_10278893_1505144662670_Li_BCSOutcome_2017_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Li_BCS1309260_Outcome_2017_Fig2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1309260/1309260_10278893_1505144662670_Li_BCSOutcome_2017_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Li_BCS1309260_Outcome_2017_Fig2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2</div> <div class="imageCredit">Elsevier</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Chiang-Shan&nbsp;Li</div> <div class="imageTitle">Li_BCS1309260_Outcome_2017_Fig2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1309260/1309260_10278893_1505144732646_Li_BCSOutcome_2017_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1309260/1309260_10278893_1505144732646_Li_BCSOutcome_2017_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Li_BCS1309260_Outcome_2017_Fig3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1309260/1309260_10278893_1505144732646_Li_BCSOutcome_2017_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Li_BCS1309260_Outcome_2017_Fig3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 3</div> <div class="imageCredit">Society for Neuroscience</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Chiang-Shan&nbsp;Li</div> <div class="imageTitle">Li_BCS1309260_Outcome_2017_Fig3</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
