<AbstractNarration>The PIs of this proposal are developing a collaborative community to support data-intensive research in education regionally in the Silicon Valley, California. A team of researchers in education, the social sciences and engineering from the University of California, Santa Cruz have engaged in a partnership with researchers from the National Laboratory for Educational Transformation, a private non-profit organization. The collaborative team is structuring a network of other regional agencies to expand capacity around four challenges: cultural, legal and regulatory issues that prevent sharing data across institutions, analytical approaches, technical infrastructure issues to integrate and manage the data set, and ethical issues including data security and privacy. Regional stakeholders from public agencies and the private sector are coming together with the researchers in five meetings over the course of the year to expand the scope of research that can be addressed with the multiple datasets that are being integrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the states develop more sophisticated longitudinal data systems, the need to increased collaboration and interoperability becomes more important. This project develops a model of such collaboration from a regional perspective to expand on data available from the state longitudinal data systems and to incorporate local data from a number of agencies. This collaboration also addresses more than just the coordination of data and identification of research agendas with an additional emphasis on analytical approaches. The work in this project expands the efforts on the part of the Directorate for Education and Human Resources to strengthen the relationship between STEM education researchers and the state, regional, and local longitudinal data system. The project connects to multiple national efforts that support the use of data in education with the work of the Regional Education Laboratories. It also connects to other state and national efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Educational researchers are compromised in their ability to answer key questions regarding causes of academic performance in K-12 schools because the data to which they have access are often deficient in 2 key ways: a) data are restricted geographically to single schools and/or school districts, not enabling research to follow students whose families move and b) data do not reflect factors that lie outside of schools but influence students? academic performance.  The goal of this project was to plan and design a regional education data set in Silicon Valley, California that will support data-intensive research in education by a) providing regional data from San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz counties and b) combining data from K-12 public schools and health and human service agencies in these 3 counties.  A team of professors from the University of California, Santa Cruz worked with consultants from the National Laboratory for Educational Transformation (NLET to conduct a "regional scan" to identify opportunities and challenges that must be considered in planning and designing the database.  Meeting individually with policy leaders and with leaders from public education and health and human service agencies in the 3 counties, the project team developed a plan to establish the Silicon Valley Regional Data Trust (SVRDT), which will provide a secure data-sharing environment for public schools and health and human service agencies in the 3 county region.  To move towards implementation, the team accomplished the following:  a)     San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz County Boards of Education adopted resolutions to support and participate in SVRDT.   b)    Santa Clara and Santa Cruz County Boards of Supervisors adopted resolutions to support and participate in SVRDT.  c)     Assembly Member Mark Stone sponsored a joint resolution designating SVRDT as a pilot for interagency data sharing in California.  The resolution was adopted by the state Assembly and Senate in August 2016.   d)    Santa Clara County Office of Education offers its data warehouse (DataZone) as technical infrastructure for educational data in SVRDT.  To date, 14 districts in Santa Clara County are connected to the DataZone.   e)     In 2016-2017 2 districts from San Mateo County will be connected to the DataZone hosted by Santa Clara County.  f)     SVRDT has developed relationship with Stewards of Change, a non-profit organization that supports interagency data use. Stewards of Change will provide expert consultation in developing interagency data-sharing agreements among SVRDT stakeholder organizations.  g)     SVRDT has developed relationship with the IJIS Institute, a non-profit organization that develops data-sharing environments. IJIS will provide expert consultation in designing and developing a secure information-sharing environment that will be hosted by SVRDT.   h)    The University of California, Santa Cruz and Santa Clara County Office of Education have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to partner in developing and operating SVRDT.  i)      SVRDT, in conjunction with the Santa Clara County Office of Education, has launched a pilot project to demonstrate the utility of linking data across public agencies.  Foster Vision links data from public schools, social services, and juvenile justice in Santa Clara County to provide better support to children/youth in foster care and involved in multiple agencies? programs.  SVRDT?s core team, which is comprised of the team that led the NSF-sponsored project, continues to work toward completing the comprehensive regional education data set.  It is pursuing funding from private foundations, government sources, and corporations to complete the data trust?s development, which will include: developing and gaining approval of interagency data-sharing agreements, designing and constructing the secure information-sharing environment (which will link data from school data in the DataZone to data from health and human service agencies), and developing the trust?s governance structure, policies, and procedures.  The core team has organized 4 work groups comprised of representatives from SVRDT?s partner education and health and human service agencies and UC Santa Cruz. The Executive Leadership work group develops and approves SVRDT?s principles of agreement, governance structure, and strategic plan, monitors performance, and communicates with member agencies and policy leaders.

The legal work group interprets HIPAA, FERPA, COPPA, other federal and state laws as they apply to the interests and needs of SVRDT and develops data sharing agreements. The data management work group provides guidance over the management and integration of data assets to support the SVRDT mission.
