<AbstractNarration>The National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance proposes to conduct two "Lens of the Market workshops" (LOM) designed to provide science and engineering faculty, post docs and students with an introductory yet comprehensive core body of information, vocabulary and know-how needed for successful research to innovation translation all focused on and aligned to the research being conducted by the Center and its researchers. LOM eworkshops will mphasize the research of the Center and utilize aligned technical examples for addressing translation components known to be important for research translation success relevant to the interests of the Center.  The workshops will serve as the basis for unique translation plans to be developed by each Center based on their research.  Lens of the Market Workshops have covered a wide range of materials,chemistry and engineering critical research topics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Two ecosVC&reg; Lens of the Market&reg; Stage 1 one-day workshops (www.ecosvc.com/stage1/) were conducted - one at Duke University for the Triangle MRSEC (October 10, 2014) with graduate students and post doctorals and the other at the University of Texas at El Paso with primarily undergraduate UCSB-UTEP MRSEC PREM students (July 24, 2015). Each workshop was tailored to the research of the Center and research themes selected by each team of students participating.  Stage 1 Lens of the Market&reg;: Research2Innovation is a 1-day workshop based on the premise that successful translation of research to innovations is predicated on researchers having both knowledge of science&mdash;a lens of research&mdash;coupled with knowledge of market requirements&mdash;a lens of the market. Since technology translation, just as most careers, requires the "soft skill" ability of team interaction, Research2Innovation is completed by teams and is best when there are aligned scientific themes among the teams.   Research2Innovation educates and informs research teams by providing them with interactive and hands on experiences throughout the workshop as participants define and become conversant in key aspects of research to potential innovation translation &ndash; all based on their own research. Participants explore key facets of translating their research into innovations and come away with an introduction to:  A common vocabulary and set of skills for using both the "lens of the market" and the "lens of research" in developing innovations; A framework, process and plan outline they can use for translating research to innovations relevant to their technical areas and research;   More tools and skills to become an innovator as well as a researcher &ndash; regardless of their career aspirations; and, Defining how to potentially utilize their research to address challenges facing people and the nation.   During this grant a total of 49 students divided into ten (10) teams participated.  Students were asked to complete an anonymous satisfaction survey at the end of the workshop, rating various elements of their experience on a scale from 1 being low to 5 being high. On average students reported that their knowledge of the workshop subject matter before the workshop rated 2.1, and after the workshop was 3.9. The students rated the value of the session for helping them to consider how to translate their research into innovations at 4.1, and reported their personal desire to be a part of translating their research into innovations as 4.0.  Student responses to the question "What was most valuable for you about this workshop?" included:  "Learning a different perspective to innovation and the product development." "Learning more about feasibility of ideas and how to actually approach the market with your idea or product." "Learning why not all patents make it to market." "Learned about industrial perspective and how to translate technology to innovation." "Learning new vocab and perspective beyond the æacademic lensÆ."   Student responses to the question "Would you recommend this session to your friends/colleagues? Why?" included:  "Yes. There really is no other workshop I've seen that teaches students about the transition from research to innovation." "Yes. It is extremely relevant and important information for future scientific entrepreneurs. This is information we don't get to see in science classes." "Yes. Very informative for people who are curious or considering working in the industry." "Yes. I have several friends with great ideas and who are interested in start-ups." "Yes. It is a valuable opportunity to learn on how to jump into business with your career."   ecosVC&reg; believes effective translation of research to market solutions requires the direct involvement of the innovators&mdash;the scientists and engineers&mdash;who have created and will continue to improve the technology.
