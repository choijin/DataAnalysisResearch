<AbstractNarration>This award establishes a new Research Experiences for Teachers site at Drexel University. The Drexel team plans to create a summer research institute in computer science for STEM high school teachers and 2-year college faculty in the City of Philadelphia and Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area.   Teachers will spend the time performing research with faculty and students in the associated labs and initiating work on educational modules for use at their home institutions. They will prepare poster presentations and videos summarizing their projects, initial accomplishments, further expectations and descriptions of their modules.   Participants will remain engaged year-round by participating in Teacher2Teacher discussion groups, facilitated by the Math Forum@Drexel. They will also visit campus for quarterly meetings, culminating in a 1-day showcase event in the spring to present results, materials and posters, and to which their colleagues and students are invited.  The objectives of the program are to build partnerships between high schools, community colleges and the university, introduce teachers to cutting edge research in the computer science community, inform and excite them about computer science principles and computational thinking, produce learning materials for use in high school and community college STEM curricula, and expand the pipeline of students studying STEM and computing curricula in college.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit is in the strong research expertise of the participating faculty in research as well as their significant experience with pre-college education.  The focus is on important themes of big data and machine learning which are areas that are current and of importance all citizens. The translation of the research experiences into modules compatible with Computer Science Principles should also add to the significant body of work linking fundamental computer science to classroom practice and applications.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project makes significant outreach to the greater Philadelphia metropolitan area, with a population exceeding 5 million, and the eighth largest school district in the USA. The Math Forum involves a substantial community of mathematics teachers and professionals, providing a variety of services and resources. Through the partnership with these organizations and dissemination through other widely used services, the team expects to provide significant impact for these activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ REThink CS @ Drexel is a Research Experiences for Teachers in Engineering and Computer Science Site for Machine Learning, Big Data and CS Principles, CNS-1301171, 2013-2016. The summer institute was held annually for 7 weeks and involved 9-12 teachers per year.   Program objectives were to build partnerships between high schools, community colleges and the university, introduce teachers to cutting edge research in the computer science community, inform and excite them about computer science principles and computational thinking, produce learning materials for use in high school and community college STEM curricula, and expand the pipeline of students studying STEM and computing curricula in college.  In total, 9 Drexel faculty and their assistants worked with 32 teachers in areas of sentiment analysis, stylometry, histology image analysis, crowdsourcing, driver distraction, AI in gaming, brain-computer interfaces and cyber infrastructure risk management. Teachers remained engaged through the year, launched new CS Education Week events at their schools, and participated in public outreach events, including Girls Exploring Tomorrow?s Technology, Philly Tech Week, and Philadelphia Science Festival. Several papers for projects in which the teachers took part have been submitted and/or published.   Of the 32 participants, 17 were computer science or technology teachers, with the remainder in science/engineering (9), mathematics (3) and business (3).  Gender was nearly balanced, with 17 women and 15 men.  Five of the participants were from community colleges, with the remaining 27 from high schools.  Roughly 1/3 were from schools in Philadelphia (10).     Partnerships:  Partnerships were formed with the CSTA&gt;&gt;Philly and CSTA Southern NJ chapters; School Districts of Philadelphia, Downingtown, and Egg Harbor Township;  Montgomery County Community College; George Washington Carver High School of Engineering and Science and Central Bucks High School; and the Philadelphia Science Festival/Franklin Institute.  REThink scholars have served as officers of their CSTA chapters, and were involved in rejuvenating the CSTA Southern NJ chapter.  A strong network has developed between teachers outside the program, and they have frequently collaborated in professional and outreach activities, offering outreach activities for middle school and high school girls, co-advising student projects and participating in Philadelphia Science Festival events.     Research: REThink scholars participated in a variety of research endeavors beyond the scope of the summer institute.  Included were publications, presentations and workshops at regional (CCSC, CSTA chapter) and national (ISTE, CSTA) conferences.  Some have maintained ongoing relationships with the project directors and faculty mentors beyond their research projects, attending research conferences, and participating in workshops and funding proposals.   One scholar produced classroom materials that led his students to create a simple flood detection device which monitors water levels and sends tweets about rising levels.  The Downingtown Borough Council has authorized their use around the town, which experiences a high amount of flooding.      Computer Science Principles/Expanding the Pipeline: In the inaugural year of the AP course and exam, five REThink scholars are teaching a combined eight sections of AP CS Principles, with a total enrollment of 197.  Two others are teaching non-AP courses.  One community college teacher is working to develop a CS Principles course at her institution.   Four high school teachers began teaching computer science at their schools following their REThink experience.  Participating teachers uniformly report infusing concepts of big data and big ideas of CS Principles in their teaching, even for non-CS Principles courses, and for STEM (non-computer science) courses.  Those teaching AP Computer Science A also report using more CS Principles as part of their teaching.  One teacher has had nine students win regional Aspirations in Computing awards from NCWIT.     Intellectual Merit: This project combined strong research expertise of the participating faculty, focus on important themes of big data and machine learning, and translating research experiences into modules compatible with CS Principles. Graduate assistants and partner schools and organizations provided continuity and strength to the community.  Collaborative efforts between participating teachers and/or the university have strengthened efforts and provided leadership in the region.     Broader Impacts: This project makes significant outreach to the greater Philadelphia metropolitan area, with a population exceeding 5 million, and among the largest school districts in the USA. Partnerships with CSTA chapters help us reach a sizeable core of computing teachers in the area. Big data has wide applicability across disciplines, presenting technical problems even for non-technical domains. Our experiences have produced sizeable impact through the participating teachers and organizations involved, including production of teaching materials, development of CS Principles courses, student recruiting, collaborations, involvement in outreach activities, and leadership of CSTA chapters.
