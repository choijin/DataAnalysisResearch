<AbstractNarration>Information processing (IP) is at the heart of the modern economy.  The cutting edge of IP is a new paradigm -- "quantum information processing," (QIP)  -- where bits are encoded in microscopic states of light and matter.  The nonintuitive properties of quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement allow for computations, communications, and measurements beyond the power and any existing IP device.  This grant studies the implementation of QIP with atomic gasses cooled to ultralow temperatures.  Laser beams act as a quantum databus to entangle atoms with one another, and as a mechanism for reading out the information.  The control of atoms is studied to create new quantum states that have the unique properties necessary for QIP.  This work is theoretical, carried out in close collaboration with laboratory experiments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research contributes to the knowledge base of quantum information science, and to the training of future scientists in this highly interdisciplinary field. Students will be involved in all aspects of the project, including education, research, and the dissemination of results. The project is an integral part of the NSF-funded Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC). We use video conferencing to allow participation of CQuIC partners in the regular activities of CQuIC, including weekly group meetings and research seminars, and strengthen the connections between junior and senior members through an annual research retreat. All students and senior personnel actively participate in the Southwest Quantum Information Technology (SQuInT) network, including the annual workshop. During its 15-year history SQuInT has provided a vibrant avenue for exchange of ideas and results in QIS, with particular emphasis given to PhD students, postdocs, and new researchers in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 20th century beckoned the information age.  The 21st century will beckon the quantum information age.  As microprocessors at the heart of all of technology, like computers, smart phones and tablets, continue to shrink, eventually they reach their physical limit.  That is the limit of individual atoms, electrons, and photons.  The physics of this microscopic world is nothing like the world we know.  It is the quantum world, governed by entirely different laws of physics, which leads to counterintuitive effects.  It is a world of quantum logic, where true and false can exits simultaneously in a "superposition state" and where particles are entangled and linked inextricably together.  We have come to understand that this Alice in Wonderland quantum world opens the door to incredible new possibilities for information processing powers, where computers could break existing secret codes in a flash, where new quantum secret codes could be developed that are fundamentally unbreakable, where new drugs could be designed on a quantum computer, and where sensors able to detect the smallest signals, such as gravity waves, would reach unprecedented precision.    This grant explored the development of the basic physics needed for this quantum information technology revolution.  Two important components were explored &ndash; control and measurement.  Every piece of technology requires a control system so that it does what we want it to do, rather than what comes natural.  Computer microprocessors contain control systems that guide the computation.  A quantum information processor must also be so controlled to carry out the desired quantum logic.  Measurement is essential for reading out quantum information and for diagnosing the performance of the information-processing device.  Moreover, measurement in the quantum world has its own bizarre features.  When we measure a system we disturb it.  This quantum measurement "backaction" is a manifestation of the famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle, that enshrines the impossibility of be certain about all physical quantities simultaneously.  To address these problems of quantum control and measurement, we studied a particular atomic testbed &ndash; ultracold atomic gases, controlled and measured with electromagnetic waves.  Inside each atom is a tiny magnetic or "spin."  The spin is like a gyroscope that precesses is a magnetic field.  We can control them with radio-waves and microwaves and measure them with laser light that passes through the atomic cloud.  With this testbed, we have designed new protocols for sensing tiny magnetic fields and for improving the precision of atomic clocks at the heart of GPS.  This type of sensing is a key application of quantum technologies. We have developed detailed mathematical and computer modeling of our atom-laser system, which has predictive powers for understanding experiments.  We have also developed new methods for verifying and validating the performance of our devices by continuously monitoring laser light that probes the system.  This opens the door to fast, real-time diagnostics that can revolutionize our ability to understand the performance of our quantum devices. All of our research is published in peer reviewed high-impact journals.   This NSF grant also allowed for the development of human capital, in training the next generation of quantum information scientists, essential for this cutting edge research.  Two PhD students working on their PhD dissertations received stipends from this grant. The students developed new skills, including mathematical and computer modeling and working in collaborative teams with groups performing experiments in the laboratory. These next generation scientists, with highly specialized training, are a key outcome of this grant.          Last Modified: 09/14/2016       Submitted by: Ivan H Deutsch]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
