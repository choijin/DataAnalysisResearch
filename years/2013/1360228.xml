<AbstractNarration>Hundreds, possibly thousands, of research papers have used patent citation data to study innovative search and impact.  Recent critiques, however, have raised substantial questions about whether patent citation measures accurately capture a patent's novelty and importance.  Using big data techniques including LASSO content labels, semantic distance measures with those labels, and computational linguistics analysis of communication between patent applicants and their examiners, this research will supplement (or possibly even replace) existing approaches to measuring a patent's importance and its position relative to other patented inventions.  The new measure of patent importance is based on how many future patent applications are "blocked" by a particular patent, and the assumption to be validated is that "blocking patents" are valuable pieces of technology space. To characterize patents in technology space, this research will use computerized text analysis to identify the most differentiating words for a given patent, relative to all other patents granted since 1975, and test the hypothesis that similarly "tagged" patents are close to one another in technology space, and thus represent local search. The techniques and public data will open up research in the history of innovation, policy assessments of social welfare and technology and science policy, inventor and assignee disambiguation, prior art search, and matching of treated and control patents for econometric estimation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of patent data to study innovation and its social and economic impact has become increasingly common with the widespread availability of large databases.  The advantages of such approaches are easily calculated and consistent measures across millions of documents and thousands of technologies.  The disadvantages are that the measures (prior art references by patents, for example) provide poor and indirect correlations with actual phenomena (such as novelty, economic impact, job creation, or potential for patent litigation).  Using computational social science, this research applies improved big data techniques, combined with survey validation, that could ameliorate the disadvantages, and made available to researchers, significantly improve research in the innovation and technology strategy literatures.  In addition to enabling better research, this work provides wider societal benefit in helping inventors, lawyers, examiners, and investors in prior art search, improved disambiguation of the patent database, and faster identification of important patents.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our work seeks to understand how to measure innovation, in order to better understand its governance, funding, and impact.  In the wake of multiple accounting and governance scandals, Congress passed and President Bush signed Sarbanes Oxley.  The intent was to protect shareholders and root out malfeasance.  We make no comment on whether this was effective, however, we established that an unintended side effect was to make firms' innovation strategies more incremental and local (such firms "exploited" current technologies, rather than "explored" new technologies).  Using SOX as a "natural experiment", we illustrated how firms that changed their boards to become more independent patented more, but less novel, patents.  We developed a battery of measures that all paint a similar picture; firms work harder to protect their current technology assets, patenting closer to their prior work and not venturing into new fields.  Current research seeks to establish whether this was ultimately beneficial for shareholder value.  This work is an example of an application of our research on metrics of innovation.  While it is widely assumed that basic research and innovation drives our economy, we still lack the measures to quantify and techniques to visualize the impact of basic research.  Perhaps the most widely used metric of patent impact is prior art citations from future patents.  Prior art citations are required by law for every new patent granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  In order for a new patent to be granted, the applicant must list previous patents with similar ideas ("prior art") and then establish how their patent goes beyond that previous work.  Much academic work relies on a very rough correlation between financial value and the number of future prior art citations a patent receives.  Unfortunately, prior art citations have also been used as a measure of creativity, search, and risk-taking.  In the work mentioned above, we were able to illustrate strategies whereby firms could receive more citations, however to less novel, patents.  As mentioned above, we are attempting to disentangle conflicting results as to whether "exploration" or "exploitation" is a better strategy for shareholder value, in the short and long term.  To illustrate our visualization research, the figure illustrates how DARPA supported one of the biggest breakthroughs in recent semiconductor history.  We plotted the social network that gave rise to the FinFet, a new configuration of transistor that has provided many further generations of Moore's Law.  As illustrated by the figure, two of the three Principal Investigators (Hu, King, and Bokor, all from UC Berkeley), occupied a very central "brokerage" position.  It was this intermediate position, between a variety of industry and academic networks, that enabled them to see and invent the breakthrough (in the diagram, the nodes are inventors and the relationships are co-authorships).  Though not a "broker" in this diagram, the third inventor Bokor brought diversity to the breakthrough.       Last Modified: 09/06/2016       Submitted by: Lee Fleming]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
