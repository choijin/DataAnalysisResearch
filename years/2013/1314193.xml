<AbstractNarration>Biological diversity is critical to the function of the Earth's ecosystems, however our understanding of how that diversity evolved, how it is maintained, and the links between biodiversity and the services that ecosystems provide is still woefully incomplete. The Dimensions of Biodiversity program was established in 2010 with the goal of transforming our understanding of the scope and role of life on Earth. This workshop will bring together scientists and students from Panama and the United States to learn about the Dimensions of Biodiversity program and establish international collaborations that will lead to the development of proposals that are appropriate for submission to that program.  Panama is a strong candidate to be a partner in the Dimensions of Biodiversity Program because it harbors tremendous biological diversity and because there is scientific and institutional support for research in this area.&lt;br/&gt;There will be strong broader impacts of this workshop because it will include Panamanian post-doctoral researchers and graduate students and because it will develop new international collaborations between scientists in the United States and Panama.&lt;br/&gt;This award is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PANAMA-USA DIMENSIONS OF BIODIVERSITY WORKSHOP     The Panama-USA Dimensions of Biodiversity workshop was held in Panama on the 9th and 10th of April 2013 to discuss novel research projects exploring the classification of biodiversity, and its genetic, and functional components. The meeting was organized and co-sponsored by two entities of the Government of Panama: the National Secretariat for Science, Technology, and Innovation (SENACYT), and the Institute of Scientific Research and High Technology Services (INDICASAT), and by the United States National Science Foundation (NSF).     The objectives of the workshop were (1) To identify shared and complementary research interests among Panamanian US scientists with expertise in biodiversity research.

(3) To stimulate the development of preliminary research proposals that could provide the basis for future submission through the National Science Foundation Dimensions of Biodiversity program. (4) To develop joint educational and outreach programs that includes opportunities for research experience and training for US and Panamanian students and teachers.     The workshop was attended by a diverse group of US and Panamanian researchers, with an emphasis on participation by scientists at the early stages of their careers.  During the first day of the meeting US and Panamanian scientists gave presentations on their current biodiversity research and detailed opportunities for collaboration.
