<AbstractNarration>This project will extend and apply new computer simulation tools to predict the behavior of nanoscale &lt;br/&gt;electronic designs. The applications will be to designs with feature sizes so small that quantum mechanical effects&lt;br/&gt;(interference, quantum coherence and quantum correlation) play a central role, such that fundamental innovations in modeling are required to get affordable &lt;br/&gt;realistic calculations for multiterminal designs. There will be special focus on design and validation for quantum crossbar structures, built from nanotubes, graphene &lt;br/&gt;ribbons and nanowires.&lt;br/&gt;    The calculations will be based on a multi-scale time-dependent approach. The open-access simulation platform includes advanced first principles molecular dynamics calculations for structural predictions based on electronic structure calculations using density functional theory (DFT). The simulation codes include efficient quantum transport codes with multi terminal and first principles time-dependent transport simulation capabilities. The multidomain decomposition method used in these calculations allow the PI to simulate realistic systems containing tens of thousands of atoms. For the new simulation, starting from single devices at the quantum level, the PI plans to simulate complete quantum circuits.&lt;br/&gt;  The new research will be incorporated into future editions of the PI's book Computational Nanoscience, his open-access simulation tools,&lt;br/&gt;and his work with the Vanderbilt University summer schools and summer camps, and other streams of his substantial track record in education and outreach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Despite the rapid development of electronic device technology, the operational principles ofthese devices are still mostly based on the classical nature of charge carriers. The inevitable nextstep will be utilizing the quantum nature of particles by taking advantage of the wave-propertiesof electrons. These new quantum devices will use quantum interference, quantum coherence, andquantum correlation effects for logical operations and information storage.  The goal of the proposed research was to study the quantum interference,coherence and correlation effects in nanodevices and circuits using a recently developed, parameter-free quantum mechanical simulation platform. The simulation platforms we have developed  includes advanced first-principles molecular dynamics calculations for structural predictions based on density functional theory and efficient quantum transport codes for multiterminal systems.  We have investigated the electron pathway in graphene nanoribbons in various structures, in molecular junctions, and in black phosphorus nanoribbons. By analyzing the current flow through the structures, we have found strong dependence on the structural geometry and the energy of the injected electrons. The methods developed in this project  may be of general use in the study of nano-electronic materials and interfaces.  The results were published in 13 peer reviewed journal papers. The grant provided research opportunity to 7 undergraduate and 2 high school students, and most of these students are coauthors in the publications.
