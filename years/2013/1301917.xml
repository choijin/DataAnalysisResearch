<AbstractNarration>Drexel University, as a representative of the Greater Philadelphia Region Louis Stokes Alliance for&lt;br/&gt;Minority Participation (Philadelphia AMP), requests Bridge to the Doctorate funding for a two-year&lt;br/&gt;period for a Cohort XI program, to expand and intensify the consortium's on-going efforts to substantially&lt;br/&gt;increase the number of qualified African American, Hispanic and Native American (hereafter referred to&lt;br/&gt;as "minority") students entering graduate study in science, technology, engineering and mathematics&lt;br/&gt;(STEM), attaining doctoral degrees, and moving into the professoriate. The Philadelphia AMP represents&lt;br/&gt;a diverse alliance of nine institutions consisting of public and private, 2- and 4-year research and nonresearch,&lt;br/&gt;Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and majority institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of Philadelphia AMP's Bridge to the Doctorate (Cohort XI) project are to: (1) recruit twelve&lt;br/&gt;students into Master's or Ph.D. degree programs at Drexel University; (2) retain these students through the&lt;br/&gt;completion of the Master's or Ph.D. program, providing the Master?s students with full qualifications for&lt;br/&gt;admission into a highly regarded Ph.D. program in their chosen STEM specialty with full financial&lt;br/&gt;support; (3) enable the Master's student' admission and smooth transition into a Ph.D. program; and (4)&lt;br/&gt;monitor all student progress through Ph.D. completion into the professoriate and beyond. We aim to have&lt;br/&gt;100% of these students successfully complete their graduate study and enter a STEM career, with many&lt;br/&gt;progressing into the professoriate at institutions of higher education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Drexel University, as a representative of the Greater Philadelphia Region Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (Philadelphia AMP), was awarded Bridge to the Doctorate funding for a two-year period for a Cohort XI program, to expand and intensify the consortium's on-going efforts to substantially increase the number of qualified African American, Hispanic and Native American (hereafter referred to as "minority") students entering graduate study in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), attaining doctoral degrees, and moving into the professoriate.  The Philadelphia AMP represents a diverse alliance of nine institutions consisting of public and private, 2- and 4-year research and non-research, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and majority institutions.  Drexel University was selected to host the Bridge to the Doctorate (BTD) Cohort XI activities because of: 1) its historical success in achieving the objectives of the BTD program under Cohorts III and VIII with regard to Ph.D. productivity and scholarship, and 2) its institution-wide commitment to diversity in STEM at both the undergraduate and graduate level.  The goals of Philadelphia AMP's Bridge to the Doctorate (Cohort XI) project were to: (1) recruit twelve students into Master's or Ph.D. degree programs at Drexel University; (2) retain these students through the completion of the Master's or Ph.D. program, providing the Master's students with full qualifications for admission into a highly regarded Ph.D. program in their chosen STEM specialty with full financial support; (3) enable the Master's students' admission and smooth transition into a Ph.D. program; and (4) monitor all student progress through Ph.D. completion into the professoriate and beyond.  The BTD Cohort XI program enabled Drexel University to recruit and retain more underrepresented minority STEM students in graduate study by expanding its capabilities to develop and support STEM student talent, and to better identify potentially talented students. In addition, it has enhanced Drexel's capacity to boost STEM graduate productivity by providing a systematic, wider, and more targeted array of technical training, academic support and professional development programs.  In particular, it has assisted BTD fellows with the development of laboratory instrumentation skills, research presentation techniques, research ethics, and the development of inter-personal skills needed to successfully navigate graduate STEM education.  As a result of the program's activities, twelve (12) fellows or 92% of the thirteen (13) BTD Cohort XI program participants were retained; one (1) fellow was dropped for poor scholarship.  Of the retained fellows, eleven (11) fellows were enrolled in Ph.D. programs and one (1) fellow in a Master's degree program.  To date, ten (10) fellows have successfully completed the requirements of the M.S. degree within the 2-year window, nine (9) of which are committed to continuing their studies through completion of the doctoral degree; two of these fellows plan to pursue the Ph.D. at another institution to achieve a better fit with research interests.  Of the remaining three fellows, two fellows have obtained STEM industry positions, and one fellow is currently pursuing a K-12 teaching position.  In addition, to date, three (3) fellows have already passed the Ph.D. qualifying exam.  Broader impacts also include: (1) advancing knowledge in STEM disciplines through the promotion of research activity; (2) influencing changes in attitudes and perceptions of STEM faculty and administrators regarding the viability of underrepresented minority students having the capacity to succeed in advanced technological curricula; (3) disseminating information about best practices used to promote the retention of students from underrepresented groups; and (4) enhancing the infrastructure for research and education through the development of support networks and partnerships.
