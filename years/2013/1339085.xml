<AbstractNarration>The University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University will test and refine a Theory of Badges applied to Computer Science Education.  Given that badges have recently attracted a great deal of attention as both motivator and assessment marker, the goal of the project is to create a foundation of principles that will guide the design of future Computer Science badging initiatives.  The team will experimentally manipulate the use of badges within an ongoing Computer Science education development project that leverages highly popular robotics competitions as the distribution channel.  They will monitor and adapt the form and content of assessments and badge representations in computer science content modules to try to achieve the best possible outcomes for student participants (learner persistence, computer science content learning, and computer science career interest) as predicted by the current iteration of their badge theory.  Researchers will explicitly track and publish data for underrepresented minorities, women, and economically disadvantaged students to see whether badges are particularly effective or encounter obstacles specific to these populations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Digital badges are an increasingly popular approach to making key 21<sup>st</sup>century skills of value to the workplace be recognized and valued. They are also thought to serve as important motivators for students; however, some prior research has suggested that digital badges might act like an external motivator that hurts learning, similar to some prior research showing that paying students for good grades hurts their learning. Most importantly, the current project clearly found that digital badges generally improve student engagement in a wide variety of learning contexts: whether one-day programs, one-week programs or multi-month programs; focused on computational skills, socio-emotional skills, or artistic skills; or aimed at elementary school, middle school, or high school and beyond learners. But the project also showed that not all badges are the same, and that the most important feature is that the learners value the badges: the more than individual learners valued whatever badges were found in their program, the more cognitively, behaviorally, and emotionally engaged they were during the program&rsquo;s learning activities.</p> <p>The project also provides a model (broadly implemented in the widely used cs2n.org robotics, programming, and math learning system) of how digital badges can be implemented to balance many competing challenges: badges that include attached evidence of the kinds of projects the learner can complete, endorsements from teachers/experts/peers that the learner regularly shows the skills, a wide-range of experiences showing some generality of experience in applying the skills, and assessments that systematically probe mastery of the skill along key components.
