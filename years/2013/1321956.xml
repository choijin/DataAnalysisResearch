<AbstractNarration>The origin and subsequent evolution of the Earth and other planets in our own and other solar systems is dictated by several factors including original composition and the melt behavior of the constituent phases.  However, estimates of the melting temperature of Earth's mantle, which comprises more than three-quarters of the Earth's volume and nearly two-thirds of its mass, remain controversial and elusive.  The conditions at which the mantle melts and solidifies is especially important for understanding compositional heterogeneity, which constrains deep structure and mixing and is crucial for inferring the thermo-chemical evolution of the Earth, from planetary accretion and the magma ocean, to continental growth, the formation of the oceans and atmosphere, and the current state of the core-mantle boundary.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Currently the mantle is nearly entirely solid, but it has not always been this way.  During the formation of the Earth, the mantle was likely completely molten - a magma ocean - before it began to solidify as it cooled.  How the mantle crystallized, i.e., from the top, the bottom, or somewhere in between, is unknown.  Evidence for melt at the core-mantle boundary, at least in pockets, is strong, as it is near the surface.  Investigating the melt behavior of one of the most abundant minerals in the mantle, ferropericlase (Mg, Fe)O, at high pressures will test hypotheses on Earth's formation and elucidate the geochemistry of the deep mantle. Additionally, this experimental investigation will help constrain current temperatures of the Earth by estimating the temperatures at the core-mantle boundary.  The experiments will be studied by 2-dimensional mapping of temperature, composition and texture of sample materials placed under the extreme high-pressure, high-temperature conditions of the Earth's early mantle as produced by a laser-heated diamond-anvil cell, in order to identify the conditions at which melting occurs and its subsequent influence on the composition and morphology of the molten and surrounding regions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this project was to test hypotheses on Earth formation and the thermochemical evolution of the mantle by investigating the melt behavior of the second most abundant mineral in the Earth, ferropericlase (Mg, Fe)O, at high pressures using the laser-heated diamond-anvil cell.  To do so, we developed new methods to laser-heating samples prone to thermal runaway as well as improved ways to measure the extreme temperatures accessed.  Samples recovered from the high-pressure, high-temperature conditions yielded clear melt boundaries indicated by rounded edges and enhanced iron concentrations.  Directly resulting from this project was an improved melting curve of MgO at high pressures, which, until now had large discrepancies between studies. Additionally, new estimates on the rheological properties of solid and molten ferropericlase yield new constraints for viscosity of the mantle today as well as in the past as a magma ocean.  These constraints can be used to model mantle convection and the overall evolution of the solid Earth through time thus increasing our understanding of the Earth and the engine beneath our feet.     This project supported one graduate student, one undergraduate student and a lab manager, all mentored by the PI.  Additionally, the project supported technique development and engineering that can be used across the high-pressure community.
