<AbstractNarration>Muller, Susan &lt;br/&gt;1335653&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An experimental study of transitions and instabilities in shear banding fluids using wormlike micellar solutions as model fluids and measurements of velocity fields and critical conditions is proposed. While shear banding, i.e. discontinuities in the velocity gradient in a flowing material, has been reported in a broad range of important materials, including suspensions, emulsions, foams, granular materials, and liquid crystalline polymers, wormlike micellar solution provide a convenient paradigm for studies of shear banding fluids for many reasons. Wormlike micellar solutions show simple viscoelastic behavior that is characterized by a single relaxation time, are easy to prepare, and, in contrast to polymers, are not susceptible to shear-degradation or chain scission. Recent theoretical and experimental work suggests that both interfacial and purely elastic instabilities may occur in these systems. Inertial instabilities are also likely, and these systems thus promise incredibly rich dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposal lies in understanding these interactions and scaling in shear banding materials. A Taylor-Couette (TC) flow apparatus, where the flow occurs between concentric, rotating cylinders, will be the model flow for these experimental studies. The TC problem offers a number of unique features that make it ideal for teasing apart the forces that drive instability. First, the role of inertial destabilization for Newtonian fluids has been well-studied, and inertial (centrifugal) destabilization can be completely eliminated if the flow is generated through rotation of only the outer cylinder. Counter-rotation of the cylinders leads to a nodal surface in the base flow where the angular velocity is zero and leads to essentially an "inner" TC geometry bounded by the rotating inner cylinder and the stationary nodal surface, and an "outer" TC geometry bounded by the stationary nodal surface and the rotating outer cylinder. Counter-rotation thus provides a convenient mechanism for introducing both a free (rather than hard, no slip) boundary and a continuously variable length scale for the gap between the cylinders. Purely elastic instabilities in the TC problem are also well-understood  and progress has been made in understanding the combination of inertia and elasticity. Shear banding fluids introduce two additional wrinkles: the new length scale introduced by the shear band, and the potential for interfacial instabilities associated with the discontinuity in properties across the shear band. In contrast to elastic instabilities, interfacial instabilities are stabilized by increased curvature. Thus, the TC problem provides a platform for systematically isolating the effects of these three competing instability modes, for understanding the scaling of the modes with curvature, kinematic, and fluid parameters, and for understanding the role of rigid versus free boundary conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the study lie in processing of shear banding materials, which is relevant to a range of industrially important systems, including powders, suspensions, oil sands, and foams. A postdoctoral scientist will receive training and mentoring, as will approximately 6 undergraduates who will be recruited to participate in this research. This research will also be integrated into graduate coursework on transport phenomena and complex fluids at Berkeley.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project focused on gaining a better understanding of a class of complex fluids that exhibit a phenomenon called "shear-banding".  These fluids include a broad range of industrially important materials, including powders, suspensions, oil sands, and foams.  Shear-banding is characterized by the formation, in a uniform shear flow, of co-existing regions of fluid that undergo different shear rates.  Thus, while simple fluids like water will display a uniform velocity gradient, shear-banding fluids will split into distinct regions with different gradients in a way that is presently difficult to predict but which can dramatically impact their processing and use.  We used a very simple and classic flow, namely flow between concentric, rotating cylinders, to experimentally investigate shear-banding fluids and how they behave in flow.  This flow was selected as the platform for study because it is easy to realize and involves only two geometric characteristics:  the curvature ratio which governs how curved or straight the fluid streamlines are and the aspect ratio that governs the importance of end effects.  This makes the flow relatively easy to study via computer simulations.  Flow between concentric, rotating cylinders has received considerable study in the past, and even for water there is a now well-understood series of transitions from simple to increasingly complicated and turbulent flows that occur as the cylinder rotation speed is increased.  Thus, the extent to which these flow transitions are modified when the fluid is shear-banding provides insight into how complex processing flows may be affected.  Finally, this flow requires no inflow or outflow (that is, it is a closed system) and so requires only a limited amount of fluid in any experiment.   We examined a number of solutions that exhibit shear-banding in our concentric, rotating cylinders apparatus, and, through solution choice and cylinder rotation speed explored the effects of fluid properties (including, but not limited to shear banding) on the flow transitions.  These results were compared with both simple, Newtonian fluids (like water) and solutions of high molecular weight molecules that exhibit elasticity but not shear-banding.  In addition to quantifying changes in the conditions at which flow transitions occur due to the presence of shear-banding, we identified new flow transitions which are absent in other fluids.  The results provide insights into conditions where shear-banding may be expected to strongly affect complex processing flows, and they will serve as a benchmark for computer simulations aimed at attempting to predict shear-banding fluid behavior.  We extended our studies to consider flow transitions in other flow situations, and identified new phenomena in the behavior of shear-banding fluids in the classic problem of flow past a sphere and in flow around a sharp corner.  These latter experiments will also provide guidance to scientists performing theory and modeling.  During the course of this research project, two postdoctoral scientists received extensive training in experimental fluid dynamics and the characterization of complex fluids.  One has become an assistant professor and the second is continuing research on related topics and will seek industrial employment.  Two graduate students also received training in some aspects of the project, and are now working in industry.  Several undergraduates benefited through their involvement in undergraduate research.  The scientific results have been communicated through a number of presentations at technical meetings and conferences, and through publications in the scientific literature.  All of these presentations and publications involved the postdoctoral scientists and/or graduate students, and served as opportunities for the Principal Investigator to mentor them in scientific writing and communications.
