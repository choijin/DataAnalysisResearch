<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the UCLA ion microprobe as a national facility for research in the earth and planetary sciences by enabling access to qualified external investigators and supporting continued development of analytical methods that take advantage of the unique strengths of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) for in situ isotopic analyses.  Our vision is that costly geochemical tools, such as the CAMECA ims 1270 ion microprobe, should be a community resource supported in centers with the scientific and technical expertise needed to fully exploit their potential.  Prior NSF support has led to numerous significant discoveries in fields ranging from tectonics and igneous processes to sedimentology, paleoclimatology and paleobiology, Earth?s earliest history and the origin and early evolution of the Solar System.  In the current grant period, our goal is to ensure that the nation?s geochemists, cosmochemists, and geochronologists continue to have access to our world-leading facilities at a level commensurate with our historic productivity, provide UCLA scientists the resources to continue to develop and refine existing and new SIMS methods for research in geochemistry, cosmochemistry, and geochronology, and undertake instrument modifications that lead to improvements in data acquisition and expanded capabilities that facilitate new types of investigations.  During this funding cycle, the facility will commission a new scanning electron microscope with enhanced capabilities for cathodoluminescence imaging.  Research training will continue to be a high priority and UCLA scientists will engage in synergistic activities both locally and nationally, including our longstanding annual graduate SIMS Workshop.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant subsidizes the costs of operating a high resolution, high sensitivity ion microprobe facility thereby enabling us to provide external user access to highly specialized instrumentation.  Our dual role is to innovate new analytical methods for microscale isotopic analysis and enable access to these capabilities for the wider community.  We have continually improved our CAMECA ims1270 and during this grant period commissioned a CAMECA ims1290 featuring the Hyperion-II plasma ion source with ~10X higher brightness than the traditional duoplasmatron.  We have long established protocols for the routine measurement of U-Th-Pb in zircon, monazite, and baddelyite as well as stable isotope ratio analysis B, C, N, O, Mg, Si, and S and continue to provide these capabilities to external users.  In the project funding period, we discovered carbonaceous inclusions in &gt;4 Ga zircons that yield carbon isotopic compositions consistent with Hadean life, developed a simultaneous d18O and d30Si measurement protocol to distinguish S- and I-type sources from detrital zircon analysis, challenged the "cold storage" magma model through an integrated study of zircon geochronology and geochemistry, developed baddeleyite U-Th disequilibrium dating, and explored geoarchaeological applications, including using &delta;11B measurements to reveal that just under half of the artifacts confiscated by ICE officials in a massive seizure are almost certainly fakes.  We hosted three Ion Microprobe Student Workshops in which we bring over 20 graduate students to UCLA for five days of lectures and practical demonstrations. The lectures focus on the role of SIMS in geology and geochemistry with hands-on demonstrations of the UCLA ims1270 and 1290 ion microprobe and its auxiliary facilities by the facility's researchers and faculty.
