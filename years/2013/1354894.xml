<AbstractNarration>Females in a wide variety of animals pursue a remarkable reproductive behavior - they lay eggs in the nests of other individuals in the population and thereby parasitize the parental care of those females. Despite its widespread occurrence in birds (&gt; 200 species), the factors that promote this behavior remain poorly understood. The recent discovery that parasites and their hosts may be genetically related also raises the intriguing possibility that kinship plays some role, blurring the distinction between evolutionary parasitism and cooperation. This project undertakes one of the most comprehensive analyses of this breeding system ever done, focusing on the wood duck (Aix sponsa), a species of management concern, as a model system. The study employs population-wide DNA genotyping, detailed observational and experimental field studies, and RFID (radio frequency identification) technology to follow all nesting behaviors and social interactions among all breeding females. These data enable comprehensive tests of numerous but rarely tested hypotheses for parasitic reproductive behavior. The novel application of RFID tagging, where all individuals will be tagged and all nestboxes installed with readers, represents the first population-wide use of a technology that could revolutionize studies of animal social systems and demography in the wild.  The project provides a continuing undergraduate training program, which will engage 20-30 student interns each year in their first research experience. A collaborative partnership has also been formed with the California Waterfowl Association to provide hands-on education for K-12 school groups through the "Wood Duck Wonders" and "Youth Leadership" programs. These programs will bring urban school groups to the study site to participate directly in scientific research. Over 50% of the students in these programs are Title 1 low-income status. This project offers a huge potential to engage young people who have fewer opportunities to learn about science, the natural world and their own potential.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Females in some 250 bird species show a puzzling reproductive behavior&mdash;they lay eggs in each others&rsquo; nests. The evolutionary and ecological causes and consequences of this &lsquo;conspecific brood parasitism&rsquo; (CBP) are poorly understood but are of interest for both pure scientific and applied management reasons. CBP remains poorly understood, partly because it is difficult to identify the females involved but also because the costs and benefits from laying eggs in the nests of others are unclear. Additionally, the recent discovery in some species that brood parasites and their hosts may be related raises the intriguing possibility that parasitism could involve kin, blurring the distinction between parasitism and cooperation. In this four-year study we used a three pronged approach to gain an unprecedented understanding of the factors that promote CBP&mdash;detailed nest censuses, an automated Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) reader system that surveyed the nest visitation patterns of PIT tagged females, and a detailed genetic analysis to determine the maternity of all offspring and the degree of kinship between parasites and hosts.</p> <p>We assessed two main working hypotheses. First, brood parasitism is a facultative component of a flexible life history strategy that allows females to maximize their annual reproductive success by tailoring their reproductive investment to constraints and tradeoffs that vary across years and sites. Second, kinship between host and parasite is an important component of this brood parasitic breeding system. A critical requirement of any study of CBP is the ability to accurately identify parasitic offspring and their biological mothers&mdash;which females are parasitic and how much do they invest in parasitism? &nbsp;We used simulated genetic datasets to assess the reliability of two widely used parentage programs&mdash;the most popular program often struggled to reliably identify parasitic chicks and females, but the second program was extremely accurate and we used it.&nbsp; To address the flexibile life history hypothesis, we monitored almost 1900 nest attempts and 450 breeding females at five main study sites over four years. Our study, one of very few to follow females across several years, clearly shows that brood parasitism is a flexible strategy&mdash;most females switched among years between three different tactics: laying only parasitically, only nesting, and a dual strategy that combines nesting and brood parasitism. We found no evidence that females are professional parasites for their entire lives. Reproductive success varied significantly among these tactics, in accordance with predictions of the flexible life history model: females that only laid parasitically in a year had the lowest reproductive success while females that laid both parasitically and in their own nest had the highest success. In contrast to the kinship hypothesis, we did not find that host-parasite relatedness is a major component of brood parasitism in our populations. Understanding CBP therefore lies within the realm of life history theory, not kin selection theory. Turning to the host perspective, the degree to which CBP affects host reproductive success is very poorly understood for most species. We used egg addition experiments to assess these costs and found that incubating even large numbers of parasitic eggs has negligible costs to hosts.</p> <p>Our PIT tagging study revealed unique insights into the parasitic egg-laying behavior of females. We implanted PIT tags in 500 adult females and over 4000 ducklings, placed RFID readers at 173 nest boxes at three sites and recorded an astonishing 750,000 total reads. These reads revealed surprising and complex patterns of nest use and social networking among females not previously suspected for any bird. Box visitation patterns were not random but suggestive of two broad classes of females: &lsquo;rovers&rsquo; ranged widely visiting many boxes (up to 20 boxes) while &lsquo;stayers&rsquo; were site faithful and visited one or two boxes. Nest boxes vary in their social attractiveness&mdash;some boxes are highly attractive to females, whereas other boxes are never visited. An intriguing discovery is that distinct social groups of female are connected by nest visitation patterns and, moreover, that kinship is higher in these groups that expected by chance. The significance of these social groups is yet to be determined but kinship may play a more diverse role in CBP than previously recognized.</p> <p>Our project also involved a massive undergraduate training program. Interns were provided with their first experience collecting data in the field, including monitoring nests, measuring eggs, and banding and blood sampling females and ducklings. Over 200 undergraduates and 7 graduate students participated in this study.
