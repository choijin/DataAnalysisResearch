<AbstractNarration>Seogjoo Jang of CUNY Queens College is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division  to develop new classes of quantum master equation (QME) and generalized master equation (GME) that can bridge molecular level quantum dynamics with larger length and longer time scale dynamics. This is achieved by extending the recently developed polaronic QME (PQME) for a broader regime of parameters, and by developing new coarse-grained QME/GME approaches that can incorporate highly accurate calculation at small length scales into efficient calculation for larger length scales.  Another objective of the research is to enhance the reliability and capability of QME/GME approaches.  Jang and his coworkers are also developing a new kind of QME that can utilize information on adiabatic electronic states and their derivative couplings directly. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are being conducted to examine and modify the conventional form of the exciton-bath Hamiltonian for the photosynthetic light harvesting complex 2 (LH2) of purple bacteria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The methods developed in this research, quantum and generalized master equation approaches, offer natural frameworks for studying exciton and charge carrier dynamics in complex molecular environments, such as natural light harvesting complexes and organic photovoltaic devices. Jang and his research group are taking these approaches to a new level so that they can be applied in a more accurate and realistic manner without relying on simple model systems.  The result -- unified and reliable descriptions of quantum relaxation and transport dynamics across a wide range of length/time -- will help elucidate the quantum effects hidden in what appears to be the purely classical behavior of large scale exciton and charge transport dynamics in complex molecular systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this research project was to develop, test, and apply new kinds of master equation approaches applicable to the dynamics of excitons, electrons, and protons in complex molecular environments.  These have significant implications, for example, for energy conversion, optical sensing, and signal processing that involve novel molecular materials or biological systems.  Many phenomenological aspects of such dynamics at large length and coarse time scales appear to be describable by classical mechanics or simple rate processes.  However, detailed dynamical information at nanometer length and hundred femtosecond time scales for many of them reveal intriguing characteristics, which require fundamentally quantum mechanical consideration.  Understanding the connection between the two is important for elucidating quantum effects hidden in seemingly classical behavior, and can also help identify key molecular level features that can control the outcomes of such processes.  This entails development of both general and efficient quantum dynamics methods applicable to large scale systems while flexible enough to adjust the level of computational overhead depending on the level of accuracy needed.      The primary outcome of this project was the development of the generalized master equation for modular exciton density (GME-MED) and its extensive test/application to light harvesting 2 (LH2) complexes of photosynthetic purple bacteria.  The GME-MED method enables efficient description of the dynamics of excitons that are coarse-grained over the domains of their delocalization, especially when the effect of inter-module electronic coupling is approximated only up to the second order in evaluating the kernels of the GME. The efficiency of the method allowed sampling of the calculation over sufficiently large ensembles of disorder at various inter-LH2 distances.   The calculated results were shown to be consistent with available spectroscopic data, and offered important insights into the interplay of quantum delocalization and disorder.   Significant effort was also made for the modeling of the  exciton Hamiltonian that was employed for the application of the GME-MED method to LH2 complexes, by incorporating extensive classical simulation and quantum calculations.  This study also revealed a significant role of hydrogen bonding in fine-tuning the excitation energies of pigment molecules in the LH2 complex for optimal functionality.        Another important outcome of this project was to generalize the quantum Fokker-Planck equation (QFPE), a well-known approach for phase-space description of quantum particles in dissipative environments, for photo-induced processes.   This allows investigating the non-equilibrium and non-Markovian effects in fast electron/proton transfer reactions that are initiated by short laser pulses, without making an assumption of time scale separation between system and environment and without resorting to an unrealistic high temperature approximation.  Further test and application of this generalized QFPE will help establish it as an important theoretical tool for investigating detailed short time quantum dynamics of electrons and protons in complex molecular environments.       In addition, the project contributed to strengthening the foundation of quantum rate theories defined within the path integral formalism, and to clarifying why electron tunneling mechanism proposed in the vibrational theory of olfaction is not plausible.   The lessons gained through this research also helped developing a new kinetic theory of olfaction, which can have potentially significant effect on the field of chemical sensing in general.        While pursuing the major objectives of this research project as described above, which altogether helped establishing methods and knowledge set for understanding intricate quantum dynamics hidden in complex molecular processes, the PI has continued working on broader impacts activities such as completing a comprehensive review article on delocalized excitons in light harvesting complexes, initiating a book project on "Dynamics of Molecular Excitons: Theories and Applications", and organizing local and national level workshops.
