<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Kit Bowen of Johns Hopkins University and his graduate and undergraduate student researchers are conducting experiments to measure the strength of electron binding to neutral molecules.  The results from these experiments are important to other areas of chemistry, including mass spectrometry, enzymology and the chemistry of radiation damage.  Graduate and undergraduate students working on this project will receive excellent training in experimental physical chemistry.  Prof. Bowen also opens his laboratory to urban middle and high school students, exposing these students to state-of-the-art laboratory science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Bowen and his research group are conducting a large number of experiments on atoms and molecules, using laser-based photoelectron spectroscopy.  Among the projects being carried out are:  (1) the study of electron induced proton transfer; (2) the investigation of diffuse electron states in molecules and clusters including dipole-bound anions and double Rydberg anions; (3) the measurement of the electron affinities of nucleobases.  Over the course of these measurements, Prof. Bowen and his students will further develop new experimental tools and methods in cutting-edge gas-phase experimental chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Chemistry is largely about accepting and/or donating electrons. This project involved using negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy to study the effect of adding excess electrons to several different chemical systems. The topics we explored included electron-induced proton transfer, diffuse electron states, electron-induced activation of molecules, solvent stabilization of otherwise unstable anions, and several others. Electron-induced proton transfer was known to be important in radiation biology, where secondary electrons spawn by ionizing radiation caused proton transfer to occur from amino acids to the nucleobases in DNA. We have extended the study of those processes to many other chemical systems, some of those including aceto-acetic acid anions, and oxalic acid dimer and trimer anions. In studying diffuse electron states, we have explored the most subtle interactions of excess electrons with molecules. While the multipole moments of molecules, e.g., dipole and quadrupole moments, bind excess electrons only weakly, they are nevertheless important in the early stages of electron attachment and electron-molecule coupling. We also found that electrons are able to induce molecular activation in several systems, such as carbon dioxide and water. Molecular activation is often the first step in many chemical reactions. Also, while most organic molecules are thought to be unable to bind excess electrons in isolation (in gas phase), with the result that their electron affinities are listed as being negative, many of them are known or suspected to readily accept excess electrons in solution to form their corresponding negative ions. The secret is solvation. Solvating otherwise unstable anions stabiizes them. We have investigated a large number of such systems, forming them, and photodetaching electrons from them. This project has had broader impacts on organic chemistry, radiation biology, oncology, catalysis, and astrochemistry. Broader impacts of education have resulted from the training of graduate students, undergraduate researchers, two of which are now in graduate school at Chicago and MIT, a high school student who did a research internship with my group during both the school year and a summer, and lab visits by both elementary and middle school students.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/07/2018<br>      Modified by: Kit&nbsp;Bowen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
