<AbstractNarration>Raman-based microspectroscopy uses molecular low-frequency vibrational or rotational modes for the identification and imaging of systems. Despite intense efforts, the utility of Raman based microspectroscopy has been limited by limited detection sensitivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of the project is to develop a laser-based instrument capable of detecting and tracking major biological cell constituents. The instrument design will yield a portable and fully integrated laser instrument that is optimized to break existing detection sensitivity limits, thereby favoring use by a broad range of researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting device will open the way to wider applications of Raman based characterization techniques in biological media. Potential applications include the study of fundamental processes such as cell division, differentiation, or apoptosis (death), which are accompanied by a significant spatial reorganization of the cell constituents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Education program is based on efficient integration of applied and fundamental research for the training of undergraduate and graduate students. The plan offers several separate and unique projects for graduate students, which are challenging in both technical and scientific aspects and can constitute a core for the original scientific research required for a PhD degree. The program specifies sub-projects for undergraduate students majoring in the fields of science and engineering who are interested in interdisciplinary research experiences while having the opportunity to interact with professionals within academia and industry. The program offers a plan of close collaboration with different university schools and departments which will impact the research efforts of those outside the Physics Department while facilitating collaborative research between the University's research groups and Centers. Other contribution to teaching include improvement to the existing graduate level, Optical Properties of Solids, course, development of  a new graduate course (Quantum Electronics) and adding new laboratory modules to the existing undergraduate level, Advanced Physics Laboratory, course.&lt;br/&gt; Outreach activity includes participation in the statewide Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) program and organizing and hosting a summer research camp for high school students from underrepresented and minority groups.&lt;br/&gt;More information can be found at http://physics.wvu.edu/people/feruz_ganikhanov</AbstractNarration>
