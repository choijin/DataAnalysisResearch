<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project uses enhanced MIMO (multiple-input, multiple-output) technology to boost capacity, coverage, and enhance link robustness in wireless communications without using additional spectrum.  This is accomplished by transmitting independent data streams all at the same frequency but on different antennas. MIMO technologies have been widely adopted and have been incorporated into the 802.11n and 802.11ac WiFi, WiMax, and the LTE-A cellular standards.  However, for MIMO systems, the computational complexity required to detect data symbols increases dramatically as the system size (number of antennas) and data constellation size increases.  Thus, MIMO symbol detection has become a critical step for wireless communication systems.  Lattice-reduction (LR)-aided MIMO equalization has shown great potential to reduce complexity and improve the performance.  This research develops and transitions advanced LR-aided equalization technology to real-time, hardware implementations that meet the stringent requirements of next generation wireless communication systems.  These advanced LR-aided equalization techniques can reach near-optimal performance (an additional 5-20 dB of signal-to-noise-ratio gain relative to common equalizers currently used in industry). This project will result in the creation of a commercial-grade hardware implementation capable of realizing these gains in existing systems at only a slight increase in cost.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project extends to nearly all high-speed wireless data communications including WiFi, cellular, and backhaul/infrastructure.  The advanced LR technology can be implemented in MIMO receivers to improve range, power, and spectral efficiency without requiring changes to existing standards or infrastructure.  Furthermore, the advanced LR technology also enables the development of future systems with higher-order MIMO for higher data rates and better reliability.  This project will develop and commercialize integrated circuit designs that directly address the problem of spectrum crunch being experienced by wireless network providers seeking to supply ever increasing data rates to meet customers? demands.  This project will also establish a conduit for commercialization of further advances in communications and enhance the research partnership between the investigators and the researchers in the wireless communication industry facilitating application of scientific discoveries to the application domains.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Consumers place enormous demands for fast and reliable wireless data access, and radio frequency spectral resources are scarce.   MIMO technology offers a solution by allowing multiple parallel streams of information to share the same channel frequency.  Ratrix Technologies has developed a series of MIMO decoder products that can be used to significantly improve the speed, quality and robustness of wireless communications in WiFi access points and 5G cellular base stations.  Ratrix' products can support from 1-8 parallel streams today and can scale to cover 64 or more streams for massive MIMO solutions planned for 5G networks.  In addition, the patented methods developed provide superior performance for each user when multiple users share the same frequency channel (MU-MIMO).  The end result is significantly faster data for end consumers, and more efficient use of the frequency spectrum. This project successfully commercialized technology originally developed at Georgia Tech into a commercial quality IP core for implementation into wireless semiconductor IC?s.   The end result is near-ML (near ideal) performance for large MIMO systems up to 8x8 in a size and cost effective implementation.  Other key benefits include fixed latency, full diversity for all user streams, low computational complexity with fixed or soft outputs.  The products developed were demonstrated in both floating point and fixed point versions using off the shelf FPGAs with a custom RF circuit board design.  This project resulted in 5 patents (3 issues, 2 pending) and results in up to 2-8 times the data throughput for today?s wireless networks.   The market for this technology is enormous, with WiFi and cellular applications leading the way.   The products developed under this SBIR are currently targeted for implementation in Gigabit WiFi routers and 5G base stations and will provide significant improvements to the ability of consumers wireless stream video and data, and enable a new generation of wireless applications.
