<AbstractNarration>The University of Delaware and the University of Maryland Baltimore are awarded collaborative grants for improvements to a computational tool that will enable a broader community of life scientists, engineers, and geoscientists to access viral metagenomics for the next wave of scientific discoveries in microbiome research.  Eight percent of the human genome derives from retroviruses; these viral sequences differentiate the human genome from that of other primates. Within microbial communities, including those living in association with animal hosts, viruses are the most numerically abundant microorganisms, outnumbering all cellular microbes by 10 to 1,000 fold.  These natural viral communities are genetically diverse, containing a vast number of novel and unknown genes.  In the oceans, viral breakdown of microbial cells contributes to the chemical transformation of carbon and nutrient elements.  Ultimately, these transformations impact the productivity of marine ecosystems as well as regional and global climate.  While understanding of extant viral diversity and the role of viruses within natural systems is still rudimentary, there is evidence that viruses play critically important roles in the biology, ecology, and evolution of life on earth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enhance a newly developed computational tool, the Viral Informatics Resource for Metagenome Exploration (VIROME) to better facilitate the coming wave of discoveries surrounding the role of viruses in natural systems.  In particular, we will pursue three specific developmental goals: 1) leverage sources of long-length DNA sequence data to improve the quality of the information output from the VIROME bioinformatics pipeline; 2) utilize the VIROME gene classification scheme to develop a sustainable database of unknown viral genes, i.e., viral genetic dark matter; and 3) advance the sustainability of the VIROME resource through virtualization of its underlying computational workflow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given that viruses impact life on earth over evolutionary time and global scales, further development of VIROME will benefit researchers in the life sciences, engineering, and geosciences.  The project?s impact will be enhanced by directly training graduate and undergraduate students and by conducting twice yearly workshops on the use of VIROME for the analysis of viral metagenome sequence data.  The project will also advance public understanding of the emerging scientific consensus surrounding the nuanced and critical impacts of viruses on cellular life by hosting an informational booth at Ag Day, a public outreach event reaching thousands of residents in the quad state vicinity of the University of Delaware, Newark campus (DE, MD, PA, &amp; NJ).  Lastly, the team will reach out to K-12 students by hosting an annual ?Get to know viruses? STEM program at the Delaware Biotechnology Institute for groups of Cub Scouts and Girl Scouts in the Newark, Delaware area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Viruses are the most abundant biological entity on Earth.  Most viruses infect bacteria and other microbes, and impact ecosystems and nutrient cycles through infection of their microbial hosts.  Microbes (bacteria and unicellular protists) and viruses are often studied using metagenomics, the direct sequencing of DNA isolated from microbial cells or viruses within an environmental  sample, such as soil or water.   This direct sequencing strategy eliminates the need to grow viruses or microbes in the laboratory and thus more closely reveals the natural diversity of microbial life in the environment.  Viruses, however, are particularly difficult to study because their small, rapidly evolving genomes complicate gene sequencing analyses.  In addition, unlike cellular life, there is no single gene that is universally-shared among all viruses so categorizing the diversity of unknown viruses can be difficult.  Researchers often find that half or more of the genes identified within a viral metagenome cannot be assigned a function based on a match to a better known gene, and are thus unknown and completely new to science.   The Viral Informatics Resource for Metagenome Exploration (VIROME, virome.dbi.udel.edu) is a bioinformatics pipeline, developed by the University of Delaware and the University of Maryland, that improves the annotation of viral metagenomes for researchers around the globe.  VIROME reduces the number of viral proteins that are either unknown or new using a custom database of DNA sequences from environmental samples (Metagenomes Online, MgOl metagenomesonline.org) as well as several other reference sequence databases.  This project improved VIROME by incorporating long-length sequencing data, building additional reference databases and tools, and increasing the sustainability of this bioinformatics resource over a longer-term.  VIROME?s minimum sequence length requirement increases the number of genes or gene fragments that can be matched to reference databases.  Long-length sequencing reads are generated either directly from particular sequencing technologies, or indirectly from the assembly of shorter reads.  A minimum read length ensures high quality information for researchers, with annotations that are aligned with widely accepted and standardized databases and terms.  VIROME?s interactive web-application can be accessed using any web browser software which allows a user to explore each annotation within their sequence library with graphs and networks.  Extensive work has made VIROME a sustainable resource, using cloud-based resources to reduce the computational power required by the user.  VIROME has provided education and professional development for a diverse team of mostly graduate student researchers.  Work on VIROME has provided a valuable bioinformatics learning opportunity, requiring students to become fluent in different computational coding languages.  Many undergraduate and graduate students have successful projects advancing VIROME and other tools, and have gone on to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM fields.  Throughout the course of the project students translated their work to others in diverse fields, presenting at local, national, and international conferences as well as to K12 students in outreach education events.
