<AbstractNarration>PROJECT ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) in their February 2012 report noted that "Federal agencies should encourage projects that establish collaborations between research universities and community colleges or other institutions that do not have research programs."  In the 2010 Decadal Survey of Astronomy one of the top strategies to address the lack of diversity in astronomy and physics is "Partnerships of community colleges and minority serving institutions with research universities and with national centers and laboratories."  Cal-Bridge is exactly such a program.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission of the Cal-Bridge program, while open to all students who meet the selection criteria, is to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) and female students completing a bachelor's degree and entering a PhD program in astronomy, physics, or closely related fields.  The program leverages an ideal set of institutions to address this national problem.  The Cal-Bridge program comprises a diverse network of higher education institutions in southern California: 5 University of California (UC) campuses, 8 California State University (CSU) campuses, and 8 community colleges.  By identifying and mentoring students through the critical transition from undergraduate STEM major to top-level PhD programs, Cal-Bridge will have a significant national impact on the number of underrepresented minority and female students obtaining a PhD in physics and astronomy, thus serving as a model for minority-serving institutions nationwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission is achieved by providing intensive, sustained, joint mentoring of students by CSU and UC faculty, aimed at increasing the persistence of Cal-Bridge Scholars in completing their undergraduate degree, and successfully entering and completing a PhD program. The Cal-Bridge program will search for students with "untapped potential", using research-based criteria developed by successful bridge programs such as the Fisk-Vanderbilt Masters-to-PhD Bridge program. The recruiting pipeline will be via the highly successful CAMPARE summer research program and its feeder schools. This NSF-funded program has in the past 5 years successfully provided authentic summer research experiences at world-class research institutions to a large number students from a network of 20 CSUs and community colleges, mostly Hispanic-serving institutions, all of which are part of the Cal-Bridge program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Official transcripts are collected quarterly for each student. Mid-term progress reports, annual surveys, participant interviews, data collection/statistical analysis are provided annually to the external evaluator.  Continual formative feedback through the use of Mid-Term Progress reports ensures each student's progress and success.  In addition there is summative feedback for annual review by the Steering Committee.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Cal-Bridge program has the mission of creating opportunities for traditionally underrepresented groups to participate and advance in physics, astronomy, computer science, and computer engineering and to increase their numbers in PhD programs in those fields. Cal-Bridge consists of two programs: a CSU-UC PhD Bridge program and a summer research program (also known as CAMPARE).</p> <p>The main Cal-Bridge program is a partnership between 9 University of California (UC), 16 California State University (CSU), and over 30 community college campuses in California, with over 200 faculty from the two systems participating. Scholars are recruited from the CSU and community college campuses in our network, with the help of local faculty and/or staff liaisons at each campus. Community college students transfer to a participating CSU to join the program. Additional community colleges are joining the network as we find faculty and/or staff at those campuses to act as liaisons.</p> <p>The program uses research-validated selection methods to identify ?diamonds-in-the-rough?, students from underrepresented groups who display strong socioemotional competencies, along with academic potential, and provides them with the support necessary to successfully matriculate to a PhD program, targeted at the UC campuses in the Cal-Bridge network. Once selected, Cal-Bridge Scholars benefit from four pillars of support: substantial financial aid, allowing them to cut work hours and focus on school; 2) intensive, joint mentoring by both CSU and UC faculty; 3) professional development workshops; and 4) exposure to a wide variety of research opportunities, including at the participating UC campuses.</p> <p>One way that Cal-Bridge scholars participate in summer research, is through the Cal-Bridge summer research program, also known as CAMPARE. In the CAMPARE program students are selected from a network of over 60 California State University and community college campuses in California to spend 8-10 weeks conducting research in physics, astronomy, planetary science, and astrobiology at one of 20 major research institutions in California and across the country. In 11 summers 229 CAMPARE scholars have participated in the program. The program has grown over the years and currently about 40 scholars participate in summer research; about half these are Cal-Bridge bridge scholars. In addition to CAMPARE, Cal-Bridge bridge scholars participate in summer research through&nbsp;general REU programs, plus opportunities at some of the UCs in the Cal-Bridge network, which were negotiated specifically for Cal-Bridge scholars. Other CAMPARE scholars who are not in the bridge program subsequently apply and join the bridge program, thus providing another recruiting mechanism for the program.</p> <p>Since its inception in 2014, the Cal-Bridge program has selected 127 scholars in 7 cohorts, including 69 Latinx, 14 Black/African American, and 57 women scholars (30 of the 57 women are from underrepresented minority groups). Eighty-four (84) of the 127 Cal-Bridge Scholars are first-generation college students and 22 identify as LGBTQ+. A total of 61 Cal-Bridge Scholars have graduated with a BS and 38 (62%) of them are enrolled in PhD programs in physics or astronomy at top PhD programs nationally, 4 have received MS degrees, and another 17 are enrolled in a PhD bridge program or MS program, with plans to eventually earn a PhD. In total, 90% of Cal-Bridge scholars with a BS are either in a PhD program or hope to be soon.</p> <p>PhD programs where Cal-Bridge scholars are enrolled include 5 UC programs: UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Merced, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Santa Cruz, and 18 non-UC PhD programs: Arizona State University, University of Arizona, Caltech, University of Chicago, Dartmouth, Georgia State University, Harvard, University of Maryland, MIT, University of Nevada, Reno, Northwestern University, Ohio State University, Princeton, University of Pennsylvania, University of Southern California, Texas Christian University, Vanderbilt University, and University of Wyoming. Nine (9) of these scholars have won NSF Graduate Research Fellowships and five received an Honorable Mention.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/28/2020<br>      Modified by: Alexander&nbsp;L&nbsp;Rudolph</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1356133/1356133_10314371_1601341376007_2020WhereAreTheyNowMapv15--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1356133/1356133_10314371_1601341376007_2020WhereAreTheyNowMapv15--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Cal-Bridge outcomes map"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1356133/1356133_10314371_1601341376007_2020WhereAreTheyNowMapv15--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Cal-Bridge outcomes map"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Map showing where Cal-Bridge scholars who have graduated with a B.S. degree are currently</div> <div class="imageCredit">Cal-Bridge Program</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexander&nbsp;L&nbsp;Rudolph</div> <div class="imageTitle">Cal-Bridge outcomes map</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1356133/1356133_10314371_1601340905266_Cal-BridgeFactSheetv15.0--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1356133/1356133_10314371_1601340905266_Cal-BridgeFactSheetv15.0--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Cal-Bridge Fact Sheet"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1356133/1356133_10314371_1601340905266_Cal-BridgeFactSheetv15.0--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Cal-Bridge Fact Sheet"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This fact sheet contains a 2-page summary of the mission, operations, and outcomes of the Cal-Bridge program.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Cal-Bridge Program</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexander&nbsp;L&nbsp;Rudolph</div> <div class="imageTitle">Cal-Bridge Fact Sheet</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1356133/1356133_10314371_1601341461950_000NorthScholarscropped--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1356133/1356133_10314371_1601341461950_000NorthScholarscropped--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Cal-Bridge North Cohort 6"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1356133/1356133_10314371_1601341461950_000NorthScholarscropped--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Cal-Bridge North Cohort 6"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Scholars of Cal-Bridge North Cohort 6 at the 2019 Orientation</div> <div class="imageCredit">Cal-Bridge Program</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexander&nbsp;L&nbsp;Rudolph</div> <div class="imageTitle">Cal-Bridge North Cohort 6</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1356133/1356133_10314371_1601341629542_FileSep21,111756PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1356133/1356133_10314371_1601341629542_FileSep21,111756PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Cal-Bridge South Cohort 6"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1356133/1356133_10314371_1601341629542_FileSep21,111756PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Cal-Bridge South Cohort 6"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Scholars of Cal-Bridge South Cohort 6 at 2019 Orientation</div> <div class="imageCredit">Cal-Bridge Program</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexander&nbsp;L&nbsp;Rudolph</div> <div class="imageTitle">Cal-Bridge South Cohort 6</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1356133/1356133_10314371_1601341833616_Pillars-14ptcropped--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1356133/1356133_10314371_1601341833616_Pillars-14ptcropped--rgov-800width.jpg" title="4 Pillars of Cal-Bridge"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1356133/1356133_10314371_1601341833616_Pillars-14ptcropped--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="4 Pillars of Cal-Bridge"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The 4 Pillars of Support Provided by the Cal-Bridge Program</div> <div class="imageCredit">Cal-Bridge Program</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexander&nbsp;L&nbsp;Rudolph</div> <div class="imageTitle">4 Pillars of Cal-Bridge</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
