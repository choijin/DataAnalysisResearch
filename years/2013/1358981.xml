<AbstractNarration>Lepton particle beam colliders (the International Linear Collider (ILC), Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) and the Muon Collider) are among the priority projects being considered by the International High Energy Physics Community to advance the scientific knowledge of the field. This award provides partial support for US students and post docs to attend the Eighth International Accelerator School for Linear Colliders to be held in Antalya, Turkey, 4-8 December 2013. The program of the school will cover a wide range of topics related to lepton colliders, from beam dynamics to damping rings, from superconducting radio frequency technologies to precise instrumentation, from room temperature radio frequency technology to beam delivery systems. The broader impact of the school is the opportunity for US students and post docs to interact with their counterparts from other regions of the world and to form collaborations and partnerships. The program is supported by NSF Division of Physics, through its programs in Experimental Elementary Particle Physics and Accelerator Research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project provided financial support for young US scientists  attending the 2013 International Accelerator School for Linear  Colliders, which took place from December 4 to 15, 2013 at the Hotel Rixos, Antalya, Turkey. The school was endorsed by the  International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA), a leading  organization of the world high-energy physics (HEP) and the Linear Collider Collaboration (LCC, which includes both ILC and CLIC). Its goal was to train young generations for the  next big machine after the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), namely, a future  lepton collider. Since the time scale from conception to completion of  such a big machine is very long (15-25 years), the training and  education of scientists and engineers for tomorrow is of critical  importance. We must have a new army ready before the old soldiers fade  away. The world interest in such a big machine is strong. The number of  applications from 38 countries exceeded the number of students that we  could accommodate by a ratio of 5 to 1. The admitted students  represented a young, talented and highly motivated group. They received  the best education at the school from a dozen renowned physicists in  their respective fields: superconducting rf, room temperature rf,  instrumentation, rf controls, electron and positron sources, linear  accelerators, damping rings, ring colliders and beam delivery systems.  The training they received has a wide range of applications, not only  in HEP, but also in other research areas (such as light sources and  spallation neutron sources) as well as in industry, national security,  clean energy and medicine (isotope production, imaging and radiation  therapy). Many of them will merge as leaders in science and technology  10-20 years from now.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/06/2016<br>      Modified by: Weiren&nbsp;Chou</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1358981/1358981_10288508_1452129280683_LCS2013_photo1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1358981/1358981_10288508_1452129280683_LCS2013_photo1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2013 LC School group photo"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1358981/1358981_10288508_1452129280683_LCS2013_photo1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2013 LC School group photo"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2013 LC School group photo</div> <div class="imageCredit">2013 LC School</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Weiren&nbsp;Chou</div> <div class="imageTitle">2013 LC School group photo</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
