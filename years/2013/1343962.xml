<AbstractNarration>The Fields Institute, located in Toronto, Canada, is among the top international research institutes in the mathematical sciences. Its programs cover a broad spectrum of areas in pure and applied mathematics and statistics, as well as many related areas of computer sciences, physics, and theoretical biological sciences. The Institute provides a venue that facilitates interactions and communication among researchers. Its programs serve to train and inspire early career scientists and promote collaborations between university-based researchers and scientists working in industry, on topics that touch many aspects of mathematics, the physical and biological sciences, and society. The international reputation of the Fields Institute, the high level of its participants, and the broad scientific range of its programs provide numerous opportunities for researchers to pursue their own work, to learn about and to contribute to scientific advances, and to train advanced graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 4000 researchers from around the world participate in Fields Institute programs each year. On average 620 are U.S.-based researchers, about half of whom are offered support by the Institute. Also about one half of these U.S.-based researchers are junior faculty, postdoctoral researchers, or graduate students. Their time spent at the Institute as participants and speakers in conferences, workshops, advanced courses, and other events provides the opportunity for them to work with and learn from some of the top international researchers in their areas of specialization. This NSF grant award provides resources to support some of these U.S.-based researchers for their participation at the Fields Institute. The impact of this funding will be to provide travel and local support for approximately 92 US-based participants per year, for the most part early career mathematicians, including junior faculty, students, and postdoctoral fellows.</AbstractNarration>

From 2014 to 2017, NSF funds were directed toward programs in fundamental research, applied research, industrial partnerships, mathematics education, and outreach to the broader public. Successful flagship Thematic and Focus Programs brought together world leaders, junior researchers, postdocs, and students for sustained periods of communication and collaboration around important mathematical topics, leading to rapid progress on problems of great current significance, global research networks, and increased interdisciplinary research.<br /><br />Fields Centres (Centre for Mathematical Medicine, Centre for Mathematics Education, Centre for Financial Industries), also offered in-depth and a wide breadth of training for participants. A case of this is the Fields Commercial and Industrial Mathematics Program, which connected mathematical scientists with industry, exposing students and researchers to real-world challenges.<br /><br />Fields Institute [Images 1&amp;2]<br /><br />The centres and programs held at Fields attracted participants from across the globe. At the Geometric Analysis and Summer School program from July 10 &ndash; 21 2017, students, postdocs, and professors represented US institutions such as: Duke University, the University of Notre Dame, Ohio State University, Stanford University, the University of California (Irvine), the University of California (Santa Barbara), the University of Pennsylvania, and others. Participants were exposed to numerous fascinating problems and helped contribute to the field of quantum physics, shedding light on mathematical techniques that further our understanding of the origin of the universe.<br /><br />Geometric Analysis and Summer School program [Image 3]<br /><br />During the Fields Undergraduate Summer Research Program (2017), Fields hosted 35 students from around the world (Canada, USA, UK, Spain, Ukraine, Colombia, Mexico, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Ireland) to research one of ten projects (over a 2 month period). Among them, close to 25% (eight) were from US universities. Students worked on problems within the glass industry using mathematical tools, and translated their insights in a non-technical way for industry professionals and the public. The results were shared by the Globe and Mail, and is one example of how Fields Institute has placed itself at the intersection of mathematics and industry in an increasingly analytical and data-driven world.<br /><br />Fields Undergraduate Summer Research Program [Image 4]<br /><br />Many Fields events, such as the Fields Medal Symposium, coalesced brilliant researchers to help take mathematics to new frontiers, raise public awareness of mathematics, and inspire the next generation of researchers.<br /><br />Fields Medal Symposium [Image 5]<br /><br />With the NSF&rsquo;s support, the Fields Institute also continued to strengthen its commitment toward diversity by increasing its participation of younger researchers, women, and other traditionally under-represented groups in its programs. NSF funding had a direct impact on the training of a significant number of such US-based participants, including junior researchers (early career researchers, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students), who gained the opportunity to participate in activities at Fields.<br /><br />Fields greatly appreciates the funding and support provided by the NSF, and has shared the results of its programs to the public through the use of publications, websites and social media, webcasting and video archiving.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/14/2018<br>      Modified by:
