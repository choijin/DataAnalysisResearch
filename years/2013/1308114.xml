<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Yu Xia and her group at Purdue University expand the capability of mass spectrometry to study radical ions derived from biomolecules, which are significantly under-explored as compared to even electron ions.  New methods and instrumentation will be developed to form diverse types of peptide radical ions in gas-phase and extract their chemical property information including structures and intrinsic reactivity.  New analytical approaches based on peptide radical ion chemistry will be explored for protein structural characterization.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Xia proposes to study how radicals and ions interact with each other. The gained knowledge will provide insight on the fate of protein radical intermediates resulted from oxidative stress, which has been shown to be related to various biological processes, including aging and neurodegeneration. The proposed research and education activities will also establish fertile training ground for both graduate and undergraduate students with exposure to scientific instrumentation, reaction mechanisms, and bio-analysis. Broadening participation of female students and students from underrepresented groups will be one of the focuses of the proposed educational component.</AbstractNarration>
