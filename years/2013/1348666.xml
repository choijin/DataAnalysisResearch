<AbstractNarration>This project, conducted by the University of Pittsburgh and the University of California, Berkeley, seeks to discover what makes middle school students engaged in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  The researchers have developed a concept known as science learning activation, including dispositions, practices, and knowledge leading to successful STEM learning and engagement.  The project is intended to develop and validate a method of measuring science learning activation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first stage of the project involves developing the questions to measure science activation, with up to 300 8th graders participating.  The second stage is a 16-month longitudinal study of approximately 500 6th and 8th graders, examining how science learning activation changes over time.  The key question is what are the influencers on science activation, e.g., student background, classroom activities, and outside activities.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses important past research showing that middle school interest in STEM is predictive of actually completing a STEM degree, suggesting that experiences in middle school and even earlier may be crucial to developing interest in STEM.  This research goes beyond past work to find out what are the factors leading to STEM interest in middle school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work helps the Education and Human Resources directorate, and the Division of Research on Learning, pursue the mission of supporting STEM education research. In particular, this project focuses on improving STEM learning, as well as broadening participation in STEM education and ultimately the STEM workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This project?s research team investigated the malleable factors that position youth for success in science learning. In particular, we examined the dispositions, practices, and knowledge that serve as catalysts for developing necessary knowledge and career interest in science by the end of middle school, which is a significant predictor of pursuing future STEM learning and career pathways. Combining insights from science education and cognitive psychology on what supports learning with insights from educational psychology and social psychology about motivational and self-regulation constructs that support engagement and learning behaviors, we explored a new construct called science learning activation. We define science learning activation as a composition of dispositions, practices, and knowledge that enables success in proximal science learning experiences. More specifically, the activated science learner is fascinated by natural and physical phenomenon, values science, has high competency beliefs, and engages in scientific sensemaking. Intellectual Merit: This project included a multi-cohort 1.5-year longitudinal study that examined: (a) the relationship among the dimensions of activation and key dimensions of success in science learning (choice preferences towards science; perceived success in science learning experiences; engagement during science learning experiences; and science learning outcomes); (b) the relationship of science learning activation with critical outcomes of STEM career aspirations and the standardized state science test scores; (c) the malleability of the dimensions of activation by identifying predictors of variation in activation over time; and (d) the sources of activation malleability.  Through our work, we have found that the dimensions of science learning activation do, indeed, position youth for success in science learning and predict career preferences. More specifically, scientific sensemaking is a consistently strong predictor of content learning in science classrooms in middle school. Competency beliefs play a small role in predicting content learning overall, but the effect becomes larger in late middle school for girls (and actually becomes smaller for boys). Interest in STEM careers is primarily driven by fascination, and to a lessor extent by valuing science and scientific sensemaking ability (but not competency beliefs). Affective engagement drives changes in fascination, and to a lesser extent, values and competency beliefs. Behavioral-cognitive engagement in class drives content learning. Perceived success in class influences all variables, but competency beliefs most strongly. Science identity, both internal (I see myself as a science person) and external (others see me as a science person), has a significant role in predicting preferences and actions toward science learning, even when controlling for the other 4 dimensions of activation. Thus, collectively, we see that youth who with higher levels of the dimensions of activation are more likely to engage in science related activities and have STEM career aspirations by the end of middles school. Further, learners who are engaged and perceive themselves as successful in these learning environments increase their levels of activation. Analyses, publications, and presentations generated through this project, paid consistent attention to the degree to which results varied by gender, ethnicity, or socio-economic background.  Broader Impact. This project offered the opportunity to extend lessons learned from previous studies of science learning activation, improve the quality and utility of the instruments, and better understand the role that science learning activation plays in positioning youth for success in science learning and developing a science identity and STEM career preferences. It also contributed to the evolving body of literature exploring the role that demographic characteristics and intersectional identities play in shaping science learning experiences and outcomes.
