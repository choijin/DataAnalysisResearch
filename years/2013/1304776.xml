<AbstractNarration>This research will enhance our understanding of the underlying issues affecting the differential participation and success rates of community college students from underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The guiding questions for this study are: (1) What MESA Community College Program (MCCP) activities are especially helpful in improving self-efficacy or motivation in STEM for underrepresented students and, (2) How are students' perceptions of STEM disciplines influenced by their participation in MCCP activities? This project will ascertain the value of the MESA model as a method to develop local STEM talent and learning communities among underrepresented populations in varied settings (rural/urban).</AbstractNarration>
