<AbstractNarration>Primary nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are critical for all life on earth, and limited quantities in the marine environment can inhibit primary productivity. Atmospheric aerosols are a significant source of these nutrients to nutrient-poor ocean regions, such as the phosphorus-limited Mediterranean Sea. The availability of phosphorus in aerosols has traditionally been linked to the composition and abundance of different phosphorus phases present. Unfortunately, investigating phosphorus composition in aerosols has been challenging due to methodological limitations until recently.  In this study, researchers from Georgia Tech will use a new technique known as synchrotron-based P Near Edge X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy, in conjunction with X-ray fluorescence microscopy, to examine the diversity of aerosol phosphorus phases delivered to the Mediterranean Sea.  By defining the relationship between air mass source region, aerosol composition, and bioavailability, results from this work will improve current knowledge of the factors regulating productivity in the Mediterranean Sea and help to clarify the potential response of this region to different climate change scenarios. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: In addition to the valuable insights this project will provide on the controls on productivity and nutrient cycling in the Mediterranean Sea, this study will further education of young scientists, broaden participation of under-represented groups in ocean science, and enhance research infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main focus of this research was the examination of atmospheric aerosol chemistry. Aerosols are micron sized particles that are carried by winds all over the earth.   In many ocean regions aerosols are a significant source of limited nutrient elements that algae in the ocean need to grow.   Without the inputs of nutrients from aerosols, algae production becomes very limited.  Algae are at the base of the food chain in the ocean and the growth of every larger organism in the ocean, such as fish, ultimately depends on the production of algae.      The most significant findings of this research activity show that chemical transformations occurring during aerosol transport can greatly increase the solubility and thus potential bioavailability of nutrients like phosphorus and iron in aerosols. Overall these transformations are related to a number of factors including reactions that produce acid on aerosol surfaces, transport time, levels of anthropogenic contribution to an air mass and source region composition.  As part of this research, we developed new methods using a tool called a synchrotron.  These are instruments, located at US national laboratory facilities, that produce very powerful X-ray beams.  These X-ray beams allow us to analyze the chemical composition and mineralogy of very small particles like aerosols.   New synchrotron based analytical approaches and techniques for synchrotron data processing have been a key activity of this research.   A secondary activity of this grant was the development of techniques to extract and analyze marine dissolved organic matter.   Marine dissolved organic matter plays a role in atmospheric aerosol formation and it may be a source of ligands to aerosols that promote phosphorus and iron solubility.  Beyond the scientific achievements of this research, the principal investigator has spent approximately 250 contact hours working with Elementary, Middle and Elementary School teachers to enrich Science education. The investigator worked with teachers every year over the three years of this grant.  A typical year included 5 full day sessions on weekends throughout the school year as well as intensive summer activities (10 full day sessions during the summer). Numerous engaging, hands on exercises as well as field trips have been developed with the aim of giving teachers better resources to more effectively teach science in Georgia.
