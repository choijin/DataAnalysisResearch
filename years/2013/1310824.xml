<AbstractNarration>Organisms often form intimate relationships with one another called symbioses.  Sometimes these relationships result in the sharing of duties needed for each partner to survive.  For example, human head lice have bacterial symbionts that synthesize vitamins that are needed for louse survival.  A defining characteristic of bacterial symbionts is their very small genomes, which results from a process of gene loss during symbiosis.  There is strong evidence that gene loss is ongoing in the bacterial symbionts of human head lice, which makes them an ideal model system to study how symbiosis influences genome evolution.  The proposed research will use advanced DNA sequencing technologies and high-performance computing to sequence the genomes of bacterial symbionts of lice that infect humans and chimpanzees.  Using comparative genomics, the research team will determine which genes were lost in symbiosis and when.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is critical to understand how symbiosis rapidly alters genomes.  Although this research focuses on symbionts that are beneficial to their host, deadly pathogens undergo a similar process of gene loss, and the results of this study can be broadly applied to all symbionts, beneficial or otherwise.  This grant will also support the graduate student training in evolutionary genomics and a public high school teacher workshops in biotechnology and genomic data analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Bret Boyd completed his dissertation work on the bacterial symbionts of mammal lice with the support of this award.  This research sheds light on the origins of louse symbionts and the structure of their genomes.  Like other insect-associated bacteria, these symbionts have small genomes with unusual characteristics when compared to their free-living bacteria.  The symbionts of lice presented a unique opportunity to study the changes leading to these unusual genomes.  This is because the lice hosting these symbionts, are obligate parasites of mammals.  The evolutionary history of mammals is well understood and that information can be used to understand the history of lice and their symbionts.  Here host associations and species relationships as a framework to study genome changes.     More specifically this award provided support for the collection of genome data of primate and human louse symbionts.  Here we sequenced genomes from symbionts that diverged from one another recently and species that diverged millions of years ago.   By comparing their genomes we found more recent changes as well changes that happened millions of years ago.  This provides data insights into how symbiont genome evolution changes over time, hence elucidating the processes that lead to their unusual genomes.  The award also provided support for travel to a professional conference to disseminate these findings to the scientific community.     In addition to scientific research, this award provided support for the development of a workshop to provide Florida High School teachers with basic bioinformatics skills.  This workshop was offered as part of certificate program in Biotechnology.  Biotechnology is a growing field providing employment at different skill levels.  Providing opportunities for high school students to learn basic biotech skills, of which bioinformatics is big part, provides them with skills valuable to employers.
