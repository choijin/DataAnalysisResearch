<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is the development of decision-making mechanisms that maximize system benefit and minimize the negative impact of manipulation by agents that possess private information.  Potential decreases in overall benefit are motivated by differences in individual utility functions and are enabled by individual control of information. The potential decrease, the "price of deception," will be calculated as the worst case ratio of the expected system utility of a mixed or pure strategy Nash equilibrium of the game in which players submit statements of private information, to the system utility achievable by an omniscient impartial decision-maker. Preliminary research has demonstrated that similar mechanisms can have greatly different prices of deception. Existing procedures will be analyzed and new variations will be developed for voting, ranking, matching or assigning members of one group to members of another group, and facility location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will identify mechanisms for infrastructure planning, matching, voting, and aggregation of individual opinions that have a lesser price of deception, so that manipulation of private information will less significantly reduce the overall quality of the outcome.  The primary goal of this work is to better optimize system-wide or public goals through appropriate choices of decision mechanisms.  Better mechanisms will help improve the matching of organ donors to recipients, the assignment of medical students to hospital internships, generation of ratings over the web, and placement of public facilities, among other applications.  This work will also contribute to the basic algorithmic theory of games and competition.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ When a public decision, aggregate ranking, or assignment of people to schools or hospitals is to be made based on information provided by the parties involved, people may lie about themselves or their preferences to improve, for themselves, the outcome that would occur were people honest.  Lying may be benefiical to some individuals but it is harmful to the overall social welfare.  We analyzed the amount by which the total social welfare could decrease if some individuals are dishonest.  We discovered that some decision processes, ranking or voting methods, and assignment mechanisms put much less of the social welfare at risk than others.  We recommend that social planners employ mechanisms such as the ones we identify, that are less susceptible to substantial decreases in the general welfare. These are the mechanisms that have a relatively small "price of deception."   This research is the first to develop methods to calculate a price of deception and to compare widely-used decision mechanisms according to that criterion.   With regard to a decision to locate a facility such as a library, school, or fire station, the price of deception is least when tie-breaks are not random, and the set of alternatives is a rectangle.  Otherwise the price of deception can be unboundedly large.     With regard to ranking and voting, in general, the more information required of each voter, the larger the price of deception.  However, plurarlity voting, which is used throughout most of the USA, has the worst price of deception despite requiring little information (the identity of the most-preferred candidate).  To the extent that elections involve more than two candidates, as usually occurrs in presidentail primaries, and occurs in other elections as well, this research result makes one question the use of plurality voting as followed in most states.       With regard to matching, such as kidney-exchange  and the assignment of medical school interns to hospitals, we developed new techniques to assess the quality and stability of a matching assignment with respect to the true preferences of the parties involved, given that the true preferences cannot be observed directly.   Under the same assumption employed in the other analyses, that people will lie to the extent it benefits them, we discovered conditions satisified by many known stable-matching algorithms  that guarantee stability with respect to the true preferences, despite individual dishonesty.     This finding has significant potential social impact because the stable matchings now in use are one-sided.  That is, they completely favor the priorities of one group (e.g. the hospitals) over the priorities of the other group (e.g. interns).  Until now it had not been known that any algorithm other than the one--sided one woulld guarantee true stability when individuals were dishonest.  We now have serveral other algorithms treat the two sides in a more balanced way.  Unfortuantely, we also proved that the egalitarian-optimal stable matching  -- the one many would consider to be optimal amongst those that are balanced -- cannot always be the outcome of any mechanism satifsying our conditions.     In summary, the research compares the societal costs of different choice mechanisms, if people are selfishly dishonest rather than honest.  It identifies facility location and voting procedures that are considerably better than others.  Pluarality voting has the largest potential societal  cost of the voting procedures analyszed.  For stable matching in the kidney exchange, hospital residency, and other markets, there turn out to be several matching algorithms that lead to truly stable matchings, and are more balanced than the one-sided algorithm in use at present.
