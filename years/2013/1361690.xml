<AbstractNarration>Dialog-based technologies play an ever-increasing role in our lives. The interest in conversational interfaces stems not only from their importance for universal access, but also because they can be used in settings in which traditional hands-on interface devices are not practical. Efforts are underway to extend the use of dialog systems into new roles, including: becoming companions to help seniors remain independent; moving some aspects of healthcare outside of the clinical setting; providing entertainment and interactive theater experiences; and improving disaster response. In many of these systems, the computer conversational partner is presented as a talking head or graphical persona. Although designers of dialog systems aim to make them simple and natural to use, major gaps in our understanding of human-computer interaction create obstacles to achieving this goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of these gaps are likely to be filled by examining recent psycholinguistic models of human conversational interaction. These models explore the time-course with which information coming from the context of conversation affects language processing. This context includes the shared information, or common ground, between interlocutors, as well as the processes by which reference to items in common ground is coordinated. One property of negotiated reference concerns the establishment of conceptual pacts, which are a (usually implicit) agreement to refer to an item in common ground from the same conceptual perspective. Recent psycholinguistic findings have examined whether conceptual pacts in conversation are speaker-specific, and how quickly this information is used during comprehension. To the extent that speaker-specific conceptual pacts have significant and immediate effects on the interpretation of reference in human-human interaction, dialog systems utilizing computer-based partners should take these characteristics into account in human-computer interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Dialog-based technologies play an ever-increasing role in our lives.  These include technologies that allow people to speak with a computer in a conversational style to accomplish tasks such as navigating in a car, asking for help when calling customer service, and using the various functions in your mobile phone.  Designers of dialog systems aim to make them simple and natural to use, but major gaps in our understanding of how humans and computers can best interact create obstacles to achieving this goal.  Some of these gaps are likely to be filled by psycholinguistic models of human conversational interaction.  These models explore how information coming from the context of conversation affects language processing.  This conversational context includes the shared information, or common ground, between people who are conversing, as well as the ways in which people are able to successfully refer to items in common ground that they both know about.  One way that people refer to items in common ground consistently is by establishing conceptual pacts, which are a (usually implicit) agreement to refer to an item in common ground from the same conceptual perspective.  For example, in a two-car family everyone may know that they refer to the cars as the "blue car" and the "green car," and if someone in teh family tried to refer to the green car as "Mom's car" or "the Volvo" it might be jarring or cause confusion.  Our work was designed to investigate some of the ways in which people form conceptual pacts with computer-based, animated dialog partners.  We found that people do form conceptual pacts with these computer-based partners, and have an easier time if the computer partner continues to use the same words to refer to items in common ground, and have a harder time if the computer partner switches terms, or breaks the conceptual pact.  People also have an easier time if they begin speaking to a new computer-based partner, and that partner switches terms; this makes sense since they hadn't formed a conceptual pact with that partner, and we often expect someone new not to know how we've referred to objects in the past (in other words, a friend could come over to the house and refer to "the Volvo" and we wouldn't have as much trouble).  We also found that older adults do not seem to monitor who is talking to them as much as younger adults, showing less difficulty even when a computer-based partner that they've interacted with for a long time breaks an established conceptual pact.  These findings are poised to have significant impact on how our computers talk to and with us, given the types of technological advances being proposed (digital appointment planners, personal secretaries, etc) and their application to an aging population.
