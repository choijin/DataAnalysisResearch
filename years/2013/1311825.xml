<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project will produce a survey of hundreds of disks around young stellar objects (YSOs) in regions of massive star formation (including Orion) using observations obtained at radio, millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths using the Very Large Array (VLA) and Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescopes.  The investigators will use these telescopes to construct maps of molecular emission to study how massive star environments affects star and planet formation with a focus on the regions within 50-200 astronomical units (AU) of the host star. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts training two graduate students using the relatively new ALMA observatory, producing an audio-visual fly-through of the Orion star-forming region to share with the public what they learn and working with high school students to produce other multimedia presentations.</AbstractNarration>

Feedback mechanisms produced by the young stars (such as outflows, UV radiation, winds, and supernovae) shape the environment where stars and planets form. It is believed that our own solar system formed in a dense and relatively large cluster. The study of clusters is therefore crucial for developing an understanding of star and planet formation under typical conditions and in order to understand our own origins.      This project used observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and other telescopes to study the distribution of disks and protostars in clusters, and the impact of feedback on the star-forming environment.  We used ALMA's capability to simultaneously obtain multi-line and continuum emission data, and its unparalleled resolution and sensitivity. We used other telescopes to complement the ALMA data. We concentrated our observations on the closest region of high-mass star formation, the Orion molecular cloud, and a few other nearby star forming regions.   ALMA maps of a young, embedded region of high-mass star formation behind the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) show in great detail the structure and kinematics of a very powerful and  explosive outflow. The ALMA data confirm the explosive nature of this outflow and allowed us to obtain a more accurate measurement of its energetics and impact on the surrounding cloud than previous observations. Our results indicate that this was a major energetic event that had a serious impact on the surrounding environment and the stars that were forming around it. Our results also suggest that the explosive event that produced the outflow may be the prototype of a new class of stellar explosions responsible for luminous infrared-only transients recently observed in nearby galaxies.  Using  ALMA images of the continuum emission from dust we detect more than 100 protoplanetary disk in the Orion Nebula Clusters, with an unprecedented amount of detail. The continuum and molecular line emission from the dust and gas, respectively, will allow us to study the structure and kinematics of  the material that form planets with far better detail than what has been done before for disks in a cluster.  The ALMA continuum image of a protostellar cluster much younger than the ONC shows at least 50 sources. In this cluster we find a concentration of higher-mass sources (and a higher density of sources) near its center. This mass and spatial segregation is likely primordial (given the very young age of the cluster). This will help inform simulations that model the formation and evolution of stellar clusters.   We detected more than forty spherical shells, powered by young stars in the Orion molecular cloud (the parent cloud of the ONC), using large-scale maps of this region. These shells have enough energy to have a major impact on the kinematics of the gas in these clouds and possibly affect future star formation.
