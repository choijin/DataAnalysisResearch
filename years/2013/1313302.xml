<AbstractNarration>The goal of this program is to develop an innovative approach to galaxy redshift and distance estimation based on spatial clustering, a new and independent method.  Measuring galaxy distances is fundamental to many investigations in Cosmology, such as Dark Energy studies.   Knowledge of the redshifts of spectroscopically measured galaxies can be propagated to photometric objects using information extracted from spatial clustering.   Dr. Menard will improve and generalize this idea to the point of being able to apply it to existing and future datasets, such as those to be gathered by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of a postdoctoral researcher, sharing algorithms with the community, development of a graduate course on modern statistical analysis, and lecturing to Baltimore area high school students on distances in astronomy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Estimating the distance of celestial sources has always been one of the main challenges in astronomy. We observe the sky in 2 spatial dimensions but, in order to infer astrophysical information such as energy or size, one needs to infer the distance to those sources.  In the extragalactic context, distances are estimated using the Hubble flow, i.e. a relation between distance and velocity which applies on average. With typical broad-band photometric data, one cannot easily measure velocities through the Doppler shift. Instead, distances (or equivalently redshifts) are inferred from the apparent colors of the sources. This is a limitation as there is no unique mapping between colors and redshift, given that the intrinsic colors of galaxies can vary subtantially.  With this project we have been able to develop a new technique to infer redshift information from clustering measurements. This novel approach has a number of advantages: notably, in contrast to the classical photometric redshift technique, it does not involve any assumptions on the nature of the sources nor any physical understanding of their colors. It thus frees us from some of the limitations and uncertainties that plague current redshift determination methods. This "clustering-redshift technique" literally provides us with a new tool to observe the Universe and scan its third dimension.   To do so we have developed a new methodology and numerical tools that have allowed us to demonstrate the feasibility and power of clustering-based redshift estimation. We have first applied the technique to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We have shown that, after carefully controlling the sampling efficiency over the sky, we can accurately estimate redshift distributions. Probing the full color space of the SDSS galaxies, we have demonstrated the recovery of the mean redshift within z = 0.001 to 0.01. Through mapping the color space, we present a technique to infer the redshift probability distribution of a single galaxy. We have investigated comparisons between clustering redshifts and photometric redshifts for this dataset and show that clustering redshifts perform better in some cases.  We have been able to apply clustering-based redshift estimation with different samples:  - spectroscopic galaxies from the SDSS - photometric galaxies from the SDSS - photometric galaxies from the 2MASS survey - photometric sources from the WISE infrared survey  Our analysis has demonstrated, using real data, that clustering-based redshift inference provides a powerful data-driven technique to explore the redshift distribution of arbitrary datasets, without any prior knowledge on the spectral energy distribution of the sources.
