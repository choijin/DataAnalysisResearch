<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Grain growth is one of the most important unsolved riddles in metals science. It is understood in broad terms how and why it occurs, but the details necessary to quantitatively predict it remain elusive. This project takes a unique direction of attacking this unresolved, fundamental question by investigating the topological mechanisms of grain growth in metals to determine the influence of grain-size distribution on them. Investigations will use three-dimensional Monte Carlo computer simulations to explore varied virtual grain size distributions and interesting grain topologies. Simulations will provide information where experiments cannot. Experiments will be conducted to examine grain topologies and size distributions following growth. Serial sectioning will be used to accumulate three-dimensional data sets. This study will provide first-time results of the topological and distributional nature of grain growth. Education and training will be enabled for graduate and undergraduate students, who will engage in outreach activities at local schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Grain growth strongly affects the mechanical properties of materials and is prevalent in industrial processing, yet many details of its occurrence are not understood. This project addresses the need to better understand these aspects. The fundamental mechanisms that produce grain growth will be explored through a combination and computational simulations and laboratory experiments. Both approaches will produce three-dimensional sets of information that will be compared and used for scientific inquiry. An improved scientific understanding for the mechanisms that govern grain growth in metals is expected from these studies. Improved scientific understanding will impact future capabilities to predict and control grain growth in metals and alloys important to a wide range of technological applications, from bridges to automobiles to electronics. Education and training will be enabled for graduate and undergraduate students, who will engage in outreach activities at local schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Metals are comprised of crystals, called "grains" and if we could see through them they would look like smooth soap bubbles in a froth. Finer grains strengthen metals but when a metal is heated "grain growth" occurs and the large grains consume the finer ones, reducing the metal's strength. Sometimes a rogue "abnormal" grain goes haywire and consumes all the other grains! There are many theories of how this important process happens but many details  are unknown since we could not see the grains grow...till now!  This program has used 3D x-ray tomography and computer simulations to better see the grains and the way they grow, and has found that it mostly depends on their size, which determines their numbers of sides and the resulting curvature of their surfaces...a geometry problem in real life!  This program has developed for the first time methods for measuring this particular curvature called integral mean curvature and created a mathematical theory predicting that how fast a grain grows or shrinks is directly related to this curvature.   The 3D simulations and x-ray studies have shown that this idea is really true, even for the abnormal grains that grow so fast...they just have greater integral mean curvature than the others! The more faces grains have, the more their curvature and the faster they grow, consuming their neighbors .... Theory proved!
