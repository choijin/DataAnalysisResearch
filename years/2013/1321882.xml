<AbstractNarration>The overall goals of this project are to use experimental techniques to investigate : 1) the effect of chemical environment (water fugacity), strain rate, and temperature on the strength of quartz single crystals deformed in an axial compression; 2) the effect of the same parameters on the strength of synthetic quartzites (quartz aggregates) made from the same starting material as the single crystals; and 3) the fundamental relationship between the strengths of single crystals and polycrystals. These goals will be accomplished by performing experiments on annealed synthetic quartz single crystals and synthetic quartzites over a wide range of temperatures, water fugacities, and strain rates in a Griggs-type piston-cylinder rock deformation apparatus using a molten salt cell for precise determination of mechanical data. Specifically, the researchers will: 1) perform temperature-,strain rate-, and pressure-stepping experiments on single crystal cores in of synthetic quartz crystals, which have been heat-treated to establish a constant density and uniform distribution of freezable fluid inclusions, to investigate basal &lt;a&gt;, prism &lt;a&gt; and prism &lt;c&gt; slip systems; 2) reverse the sequence of experimental temperature, strain rate, and water fugacity conditions to test whether these rate laws are reversible; 3) hot-press polycrystalline quartz aggregates made of powders fabricated from the same heat-treated synthetic quartz materials, and subject these polycrystalline quartz samples to temperature-, strain rate-, and pressure-stepping experiments, testing for reversibility, and comparing the results with T, strain rate, and water fugacity sensitivities of basal and prism slip. The mechanical data from these experiments will be used to develop predictive models of deformation of natural quartzites at tectonic rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Displacements of middle to lower crustal thrust faults and low-angle normal detachments associated with collisional tectonics and channel flow are commonly localized within quartz-rich lithologies. Postseismic visco-elastic relaxations in quartzo-feldspathic rocks below plate-scale continental fault zones are therefore thought to be governed by quartz strength.  Motivated by the importance of quartz deformation to tectonics and rheology of the continental lithosphere, many experimental studies have been performed to investigate the deformation and recovery mechanisms of quartz, and quantify mechanical relations that can be applied to tectonic loading of the crust. Yet, the mechanism(s) of water weakening of quartz continues to be unresolved and little work has been performed to determine the effects of water fugacity, strain rate and temperature on the strength of the common slip systems in quartz. This project uses new experimental methods to address these problems. Simple models can be constructed that relate the strengths of the individual slip systems to the strengths of the quartzites over the range of experimental conditions and extrapolate the results to naturally deformed quartzites. Data from these experiments can be used in field-based research and numerical simulations of the viscosity of the continental crust at plate boundaries and may aid in the understanding of the processes in the continental crust that cause the deformations related to earthquakes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The strength of the Earth?s continental crust, plate tectonics involving continental plates, and maximum depths of continental earthquakes depend on the mechanical properties of the common mineral, quartz.  In turn, the mechanical properties of quartz at deep continental levels depend on trace levels of water that weaken quartz through atomic-scale physical-chemical processes.  Previous studies have led to the realization that trace H2O and hydrogen defects in quartz are incorporated differently in different varieties of quartz, complicating our understanding of water weakening.  In addition, it has not been demonstrated that experimentally determined flow laws of wet quartz are reversible, such that they define steady-state laws that reliably predict strengths at known temperatures and pressures.  This project has addressed the flow laws of wet quartz single crystals, and flow laws of polycrystalline quartz aggregates that have been prepared from the very same types of quartz.  We characterized the concentrations and types of water incorporated in single and polycrystalline quartz samples by infrared IR absorption spectroscopy.  We determined the flow laws for quartz single crystals and polycrystalline samples by performing high temperature, high pressure, compression experiments at constant strain rate.  Conditions of elevated water fugacity were established by the presence of liquid water as fluid inclusions in samples and the application of high pressure.  Individual quartz samples were subjected to a series of compression steps, changing temperature, strain rate, and pressure systematically between the experimental steps to determine the dependence of flow strength (measured as deviatoric stress, in excess of laterally applied stresses) on these parameters, and returning to the original conditions of each experiment to test for reversibility.  Intellectual Merits:  Mechanical flow laws have been determined for compression of quartz single crystals and polycrystalline quartz samples with comparable forms of fluid inclusions.  Synthetic quartz single crystals with hydrothermally incorporated water of 150-200 ppm (OH/106Si) were heat-treated at 900C and atmospheric pressure prior to deformation to precipitate water as nm-scale inclusions that resemble fluid inclusions of natural milky quartz.  Polycrystalline quartz aggregates were prepared by hot isostatic pressing fine-grained powders of natural milky quartz (4000 ppm) and heat-treated synthetic quartz (200 ppm) at 900C and 1.5 GPa.  Grain sizes of the polycrystalline quartz samples were controlled by high pressure heat treatment for 1 to 240 hours, resulting in mean grain sizes of 7 to 25 mm.  Deformation experiments on quartz single crystals were conducted at temperatures from T = 750 to 1000C, confining pressures Pc of 0.6 to 1.5 GPa, and strain rates from 10-4 to 10-6 s-1.  Deformation experiments on polycrystalline milky quartz samples were conducted at similar conditions while those on polycrystalline synthetic quartz samples were conducted at higher temperatures (T = 1200-1370C).   Mechanical results and deformation microstructures indicate that the quartz single crystals deform by motion of atomic-scale dislocations, but the types of dislocations (forming on planes parallel or perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis) at the same deformation conditions differ for natural milky quartz and heat-treated synthetic quartz.  The flow laws for these crystals are characterized by a nonlinear, power law between strain rate and stress with a power n of 3.3, an exponential dependence on temperature quantified by an activation enthalpy (H = 270 kJ/mol), a strong dependence on water content, and an inverse relationship between strain rate and the fugacity of water.  Results for fine-grained polycrystalline quartz samples reveal two distinct deformation regimes, one at low temperatures (or low water contents) that reflects similar deformation mechanisms as studied in single crystals and one at high temperatures that reflects mechanisms of deformation at grain boundaries.  At low temperatures, fine-grained quartz aggregates follow a power law between strain rate and stress with n = 3 to 6, depending on temperature and water content, activation enthalpies H of 150 to 270 kJ/mol, an inverse dependence of strain rate on water fugacity, and no dependence on grain size.  At high temperatures (and large water contents), fine-grained quartz aggregates exhibit a power law with lower n = 1.7, H = 170 kJ/mol, an inverse dependence on H2O fugacity, and an inverse dependence on grain size.  The flow laws in each deformation regime are fully reversible.  However, samples that are deformed at conditions that cross deformation regime boundaries show path dependence associated with changes in grain size.
