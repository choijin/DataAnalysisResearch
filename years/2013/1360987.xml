<AbstractNarration>This project aims to create new pathways for non-traditional engineering students by examining the role of prior work experiences, identity, and expertise.  By applying the theoretical framework of multiple identities, this work collects and analyzes qualitative and quantitative data from traditional and non-traditional engineering undergraduate students at three diverse institutes of higher education: a large public university (U. C. Berkeley), a small private university (University of New Haven), and a community college (Ca√±ada College).  The primary research question being addressed is: How does prior engineering-related work experience impact engineering student identity and approach to engineering study? This is investigated through a systematic mixed-methods approach combining semi-structured interviews, think-aloud protocols, surveys, and the collection of persistence data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study provides critical insights to enable engineering educators to be more effective in their educational efforts, and makes substantial contributions to our understanding of engineering identities and understanding of students' abilities and thinking processes.  By filling gaps in current understanding of the identities, level of expertise, and experiences of these students, the study aims to improve persistence outcomes for engineering students and increase the number of qualified engineering graduates. The results help build and diversify STEM education by reaching out to and increasing the retention of older students which include females and underrepresented minorities. The partnership between the small private university, the large state institution, and the community college maximize opportunities for widespread integration and dissemination of findings, and strengthen pathways for non-traditional students. This work supports efforts to expose all engineering students to obtain work experience/internships and help encourage the current workforce to pursue a degree. The PIs plan to offer several regional workshops and webinars to broadly disseminate the findings and make the data collected easily available to academic advisors, especially at community colleges or those working with transfer students; veterans' affairs groups, college admissions, enrollment management, and recruiting officers; engineering faculty and administration; and engineering student leaders.</AbstractNarration>
