<AbstractNarration>PI: Thomas P. Brutnell (Donald Danforth Plant Science Center)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoPI: Erik W. Vollbrecht (Iowa State University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Collaborator: Jonathan P. Duvick (Iowa State University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maize is the most economically important food, feed and biofuel crop grown in the US.  Its predominance as a staple grain for the US and abroad is built on an extremely broad germplasm base and upon highly successful breeding efforts. However, as world population and energy costs increase at an alarming rate, we are faced with the need for a second green revolution. This will include developing second generation crops and developing new germplasm with enhanced resistance to drought, salt tolerance and improved nitrogen use efficiency. At the core of these efforts is a need to link genotype to phenotype.  That is, how does genotypic variation contribute to phenotypic variation?  Mutational analysis has been the cornerstone of genetics and has been an essential tool to link genotypic variation to phenotypic variation. Thus, the goal of this project is to develop an extremely powerful reverse genetics resource to define gene function in maize. A sequence-indexed collection of over 1,500 Ds insertion lines will serve as a foundation for this project.  The tendency of Ds to insert to closely linked sites will be exploited to generate loss-of-function gene insertions, map the boundaries of genes, including promoter and enhancer elements, and define the gene space in QTL intervals. A community-driven, tiered "Ds knockout" service will be developed to extend the utility of Ds insertional mutagenesis to serve scientists with varying resources. Candidate genes will be solicited from the community with the expectation that multiple alleles of each targeted gene will be recovered from local Ds insertions.  A web-based public interface will also be developed to provide detailed information on the Ds insertions available in the collection as well as new tools for designing reverse genetic screens that incorporate the insertion site preferences of Ds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A central aim of this project is to bring the excitement of ongoing plant science research into high school classrooms through innovative curricula. For each of the three years of the grant, a Curriculum Development Workshop (CDW) will be held at the Boyce Thompson Institute. The goal of the CDW is to develop inquiry-based plant science activities for high school, community college and small college biology courses.  Teachers will receive funding for necessary lab and teaching materials and will work with a postdoctoral associate and an outreach coordinator to implement these modules during the academic year. Workshops will also be held to train graduate students, postdocs and PI in the genetic and molecular techniques required to best exploit the Ds lines developed during this project.  Data generated through this project, project updates and links to genetic materials will be posted at http://www.plantgdb.org/prj/AcDsTagging/ and http://www.maizegdb.org/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The W22 inbred line of maize has a long history in the field of genetics.  This line was developed at the Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station and has served as a cornerstone for maize genetics research since the mid 1950's.  Through NSF funding we have been able to sequence and assemble the W22 genome as part of a large multi-institutional and public-private partnership.  The W22 inbred has been used by several groups as a genetics resource to mobilize a number of active endogenous transposable elements including the first transposons discovered by Barbara McClintock,  Activator and Dissociation.  With the high quality W22 assembly it is now possible to precisely position these transposons to the maize genome.  A specific goal of this project was to map Ds insertions throughout the genome. As Ds tends to jump into genes that are closely linked in the genome, we can use the positional information of the Ds elements to design polymerase chain reaction-based strategies to knock out genes of interest.  For instance, we have found that if the Ds element is located within 300 kilobases from a target gene, then screens of a population of 3000 to 6000 seedlings will enable us to identify multiple independent transposon insertions in the gene of interest.  By "knocking out" the gene with a Ds insertion, we can study the function of that gene through classical genetic analysis.    These transposons are now being utilized by the plant research community to identify genes and pathways that play improtant roles in the growth, development and diseasese/pest resistance of maize.  We have also used this program to help introduce high school, undergraduate and graduate students to maize genetics.  Students have participated in both field and laboratory studies and helped to mobilize the transposons, fine map them to the genome and use them in genetic screens.  Indeed, this project would not have been possible withouth the dozens of high school and undergraduate assistants who participated in this project.
