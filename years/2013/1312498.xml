<AbstractNarration>This work will conduct theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to study the inner solar system orbital dynamics that were affected by giant planet migration during the early solar system. The PI and her team will investigate the non-uniform distribution of the angular orbital elements of Near-Earth-Objects (NEOs), calculate the secular dynamics of the inner solar system with different orbital architectures, carry out numerical simulations of the stability of such architectures under the effects of giant planet migration, and calculate the loss rates from the pre-LHB asteroid reservoirs and estimates of the flux of large impacts on the planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include applications to extrasolar planetary systems, debris disks and the Earth's climate history. This works has implications for the formation and development of the early solar system, is relevant to understanding the population of NEOs, some of which may be hazardous to Earth, and to modeling the planetary systems around other stars.  The work will be involved in a Ph.D. dissertation and the PI will produce a slide presentation on this work for public audiences, made available for free.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this project was to elucidate the structure of the young solar system in its early history, shortly after the planets formed. We were motivated by the recent recognition that the outer giant planets underwent significant and dramatic orbital migration within a few hundred million years after formation, and that such dynamical evolution would probably have had major effects on the terrestrial planets, including our home planet Earth, during a time when Earth was just becoming habitable. We had a two-pronged approach to this investigation: we looked for tracers of early solar system history in the distribution of small bodies (asteroids and Kuiper belt objects) and their collisions with planets (impact crater records), and we looked for structures in exo-planetary systems and in debris disks of nearby young stars as analogs of the young solar system. We discovered new details about the nature and origins of the historical as well as contemporary meteoroidal bombardment of the terrestrial planets and of the sources of their impactors. We developed an improved method for calculating the collision rates of minor planets on major planets, improving upon half-century-old formulas that have been in common use. In the orbital distribution of asteroids we discovered a double-peaked distribution of their eccentricity vector components; this is likely an imprint of the early orbital migration of Jupiter and Saturn. In the Kuiper belt orbital data, we made the discovery that its mid-plane deviates significantly from theoretical expectations. Explanations for this surprising result includes the intriguing possibility that a Mars-to-Earth mass planet may have been ejected in the solar system's early history to two-to-three times Neptune's distance and remains to be discovered. In exo-planetary data, we discovered that the orbital periods and the orbital separations of adjacent planets are approximately log-normal. We made use of this result to make a theoretical prediction for the planet mass distribution function of planets in our Galaxy. In a theoretical study to understand dust-free lanes observed in many protoplanetary systems, we discovered that the timescale for a planet to clear its orbital path depends strongly on planet mass, and it has an inflection near planet masses of about 0.01% of the stellar mass; lower mass planets clear their zone predominantly by accreting particles whereas higher mass planets clear their zone predominantly by scattering particles to distant or escape orbits. We applied these theoretical results to interpret new infrared observations of a nearby protoplanetary system, HD 95086, finding that this system is likely quite similar in architecture to the nearby, iconic system of HR 8799 whose system of giant planets has been directly imaged, but both systems are rather different than our own more mature planetary system.
