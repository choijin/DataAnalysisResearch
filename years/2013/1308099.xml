<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;A team of scientists and students at Iowa State University will study the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of deeply undercooled liquids and metastable crystalline phases using a newly constructed Electrostatic Levitation (ISU-ESL) facility.  Measurements of the thermophysical properties (density, surface tension, viscosity and calorimetry) as well as magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistance (using a novel tunnel diode resonator technique) can be done at temperatures up to 2500 K.  These property measurements will be correlated with x-ray and neutron scattering measurements of microscopic structural properties performed at the Advanced Photon Source and Spallation Neutron Source using ESL chambers specifically designed for scattering measurements. The coordinated use of these facilities will provide new information on liquid-liquid phase transitions, phase-transformation kinetics during solidification and their effect on materials processing, evolving order in systems undergoing structural and magnetic transitions, the detection and characterization of metastable phases and the influence of magnetic fields on the solidification process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Liquid and glasses are around us everyday, yet in many ways they are only poorly understood.  Neither their atomic structures, the phase changes that occur within them, nor their electrical and magnetic properties are well known.  For example, in 1721 Fahrenheit discovered a tendency for water cooled to below its freezing temperature (a supercooled liquid) to resist the formation of the crystalline phase, ice.  Supercooling is now known to be possible in all liquids.  Why it happens, however, and what changes occur in the supercooled state of the liquid before it crystallizes, are questions of current interest.  As some liquids solidify, they can form metastable phases that exist only at high temperature.  The properties of these metastable phases remain relatively unexplored, and they can strongly influence the specific path to the final product.  A team of scientists and students will use a novel facility recently commissioned at Iowa State University that enables measurements of thermophysical properties, such as the density, surface tension, viscosity, as well as electrical and magnetic properties, of liquids above and below their melting temperatures and high temperature metastable solid phases.  To avoid contamination during the measurements, the liquids are levitated in an electric field (electrostatic levitation, ESL) and heated in vacuum.  Taken together with a sister ESL facilities at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory), designed for x-ray studies of liquids, and neutron scattering investigations at the Spallation Neutron Source (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), they will be able to correlate measurements of atomic structure and physical properties, which will add tremendously to our understanding of complex systems at high temperatures.</AbstractNarration>

One particularly interesting project was the investigation of metastable phase formation and stability in the Fe-B system. The Fe-B binary alloy is an important system for investigations of glass-forming alloys, as well as their mechanical and magnetic properties. In addition to being a good binary glass forming system, Fe-B also forms the basis of a large body of multi-component glass forming systems, ranging from ternary alloys such as Fe-B-Si to five- and six-component bulk glass forming alloys such as Fe43Cr16Mo16(C, B, P)25 with critical cooling rates on the order of 100 K/sec. These materials exhibit ex- cellent glass forming ability and important engineering properties such as hardness, corrosion resistance, and soft ferromagnetism.  When Fe-B and related alloys are quenched into a glassy state and undergo crystallization during subsequent annealing processes, it has been found that a wide variety of metastable intermetallic compounds can form that may play an important role in the production of industrially relevant materials such as permanent magnets. The three most commonly observed metastable phases are body-centered tetragonal (bct) Fe3B, orthorhombic (o) Fe3B, and face-centered cubic (fcc) Fe23B6.  The latter compound is particularly interesting since several previous studies indicated that even though it is a metastable phase, it can persist down to ambient temperature rather than transform into the equilibrium mixture of Fe2B and bcc-Fe.  Our goal in this project was to figure out why.  Our time-resolved high-energy x-ray diffraction on electrostatically levitated samples of Fe83B17 at the Advanced Photon Source coupled together with density and magnetic measurements performed using the ISU-ESL demonstrated that the Fe23B6 metastable phase and fcc &gamma;-Fe grow coherently from the undercooled Fe83B17 liquid and effectively suppress the formation of the equilibrium Fe2B and bcc &alpha;-Fe phases, explaining this long-standing question.
