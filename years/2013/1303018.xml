<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2013 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Thomas Trogdon is "New Techniques in the Theory of Nonlinear Special Functions." The host institution for the fellowship is New York University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Percy Deift.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Special functions are arguably the building blocks of applied and computational mathematics.  And the theory of nonlinear special functions is a newer extension of classical special function theory.  The goal of this project was to apply and extend (nonlinear) special function theory.  The research supported by this grant used special function theory to discover deep connections between the solution of physically relevant partial differential equations and the work of Josiah Gibbs at the end of the 19th century.   A separate line of research, within this fellowship, looked to understand the average-case behavior of numerical algorithms.  An example question here would be, "How long, on average, does it take to run a Google(tm) search?."  For algorithms that are much simpler than a Google(tm) search, we have been able to answer this question in a broad and robust yet precise way.  Special function theory is a required tool for us to be precise. The robustness (which we call universality) demonstrates the insensitivity of the algorithm to sensible changes in the data on which it operates.  It led us to ask whether such universality arises in complex physical and biological systems such as the brain.  Preliminary results are positive.  This project involved two students (one graduate, one undergraduate), assisting in the progress toward their respective degrees.
