<AbstractNarration>This research program involves development of theory lying on the interface of Ramsey Theory, Set Theory, and Tukey Order.  Ramsey theory is the study of finding canonical structures within a given class of structures.  Topological Ramsey spaces are topological spaces in which every subset X which has the property of Baire is Ramsey: every non-empty open set in the space contains a non-empty open subset which is either contained in or disjoint from X.  Such spaces unify a large body of results in Ramsey theory, including the theorems of Carlson-Simpson, Galvin-Prikry, Gowers, Graham-Rothschild, Milliken, and others.  Recent progress in the theory of topological Ramsey spaces due to Dobrinen and Todorcevic has proved useful in solving problems in Set Theory regarding the precise analysis of the difference between the Tukey and Rudin-Keisler reducibility notions.  Tukey reducibility, a weakening of Rudin-Keisler reducibility, is of high interest for its ability to classify ordered structures which defy classification by other means.  This research program seeks to develop a general framework for canonical equivalence relations on topological Ramsey spaces and provide a unifying theory for ultrafilters satisfying some weak partition property.  These new Ramsey theorems will be applied to classify the Tukey types of ultrafilters with partition properties.  Methods developed are intended to solve some long-standing problems in Ramsey theory.  Further, this research program aims to establish the full Tukey structure of ultrafilters and find the model-theoretic implications which Tukey ordering has for ultrapowers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A main driving force in mathematics is finding simplicity within seeming chaos.  Ramsey theory is the study of finding simple, canonical structures from within a maelstrom.  Tukey order is a useful means of classifying strengths of objects, thereby simplifying a morass of objects by grouping together all objects with the same strength.  Ultrafilters are of interest in many areas of mathematics, as they are used for constructing mathematical structures and models of mathematical theories.  In particular, ultrafilters are fundamental to mathematics, and Tukey order gives a good notion of the strength of an ultrafilter.  This project aims to develop methods which will solve long-standing open problems in Ramsey theory while significantly improving our knowledge of Tukey Order and Set Theory.  Being interdisciplinary and focused on fundamental problems, this project is expected to have high impact on several fields of mathematical.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The project, "Ramsey Theory, Set Theory, and Tukey Order," focused on extending the theory of these three areas of mathematics, developing more understanding of the interplay between them, and applying known and new theorems to solve problems in each of these areas as well as their overlapping boundaries.  Ramsey Theory is the study of looking for order in large substructures, given a seemingly chaotic system.  Set Theory is a foundation for mathematics, which is in particular the best system in which to study infinite structures.  Tukey Order is a partial order, which provides a means for comparing strengths of two given structures.  This project was interdisciplinary in nature, drawing from and enlargening the overlaps of these three areas of mathematics.    During this grant cycle, Dobrinen and several co-authors on various papers discovered more about the structure of the Stone-Czech compactification of the natural numbers, a structure extending the natural numbers important in much of mathematics, with respect to two natural orderings, namely the Tukey and Rudin-Keisler reducibilities.  One ordering is a weaker ordering than the other, and it is of strong interest to find specifically what their structures are and their relationship to each other.  In several papers, we developed a general framework so that a large collection of known examples of ultrafilters are found to be specific instances of this framework.  Furthermore this template created new Tukey and Rudin-Keisler structures.  We also developed new topological Ramsey spaces which led to fine-tuning of the lower structure of the Tukey and Rudin-Keisler orders on the Stone-Czech compactification of the natural numbers.  In particular, we found the natural generalizations of the Ellentuck space, the first and most basic topological Ramsey space, to higher dimensions.  These high and infinite dimensional Ellentuck spaces led to better understanding of some known partial orderings in set theory and their associated ultrafilters.  Furthermore, we used these high dimensional Ellentuck spaces to construct new examples in Banach space theory, another branch of mathematics.    The study included developing new Ramsey theory in order to streamline some parts of an important area of set theory called creature forcing.  This work involved finding the structure responsible for behavior of certain spaces by constructing dense subspaces which have strongly Ramsey-like behavior.  This work led to a consolidation of a large collection of previous results on ultrafilters as well as new Ramsey theorems.    The second line of inquiry involved relational structures such as graphs, studying their Ramsey theory properties.  In one project, we proved that the random graph on countably many vertices has the rainbow Ramsey property, even though it does not have the Ramsey property.  In another project we extended the Halpern-Lauchli Theorem to more than one tree at some large uncountable cardinals.  Additionally we worked on other problems in this area which were completed after this grant cycle ended.    Research done during this grant cycle led to nine published or accepted papers and another two submitted papers.  About half of these were single-authored papers.  The other half  were joint papers most of which involved mathematicians from historically under-represented groups, the majority of them being PhD students or young researchers.  This mentoring in research has the broader impacts of supporting young talented researchers in their budding careers, and providing academic support and professional guidance to help them develop successful careers in mathematics.  This will help the mathematical workforce better reflecting the innate talent pool in all its diversity.       Broader impacts also included organizing, with Jose G. Mijares, the Conference on Infinitary Ramsey Theory at the University of Denver in 2014. This conference brought together 40 participants from over 10 countries with a good spread of leaders in the field to up-and-coming graduate students.  Futhermore, Dobrinen continues mentoring women graduate and undergraduate students though serving as a department co-sponsor for the AWM chapter and leading topical mentoring teas several times each year.     Work from this project  was disseminated in 11 invited talks, 8 of which were international, in 7 invited Colloquia, and in 5 contributed talks.
