<AbstractNarration>The core objective of the Sustainable Adaptive Gradients in the coastal Environment (SAGE) Research Coordination Network (RCN) is to develop a transdisciplinary network of researchers and policymakers focusing on the Caribbean and U.S. Northeast that will put forward a shared framework for better informing resilient coastal infrastructure decisions based on physical, natural, and societal conditions. The network of US, Caribbean and European engineers, geoscientists, ecologists, social scientists, planners and policymakers is designed to build connections among diverse disciplines and improve the flow of information among leading researchers worldwide who are working on these topics. The RCN's products will be annual, intensive three- to four-day workshops, webinars, a training module synthesizing our findings, a survey of educational pathways in resilient infrastructure, journal publications and white-papers for policymakers translating our research findings into accessible language. All of these activities are intended to promote a diverse and comprehensive research network that fosters the future development of transformative, policy-relevant research initiatives. A new resilient infrastructure framework serves as the basis for this RCN, and includes understanding communities as existing and evolving within adaptive gradients, addressing spill-over and equity effects of infrastructure decisions, using evidence regarding the impacts of fast-onset disasters (e.g., hurricanes, tsunamis) to improve practices and policies for chronic, slow-onset phenomena (e.g. sea level rise), and tying the application of our theory to increasingly available indicators of climate change and local conditions. Caribbean region researchers and policy-makers are key partners in this effort as they bring extensive practical and research experience in managing disaster risk and recent highly innovative regional approaches to adapting to climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent storm events in the U.S. Northeast demonstrate that there is a pressing need for coordinated research into the resilience of coastal infrastructures to current hazards and the evolving effects of climate change. Infrastructure here includes physical structures, ecological services, and the social practices that influence the impact of hazards such as hurricanes and coastal flooding. Caribbean communities have long experience with planning for and responding to coastal hazards, while the Northeast has sophisticated infrastructural and research capacity on this topic. This project will create a network of US, Caribbean and European engineers, geoscientists, ecologists, social scientists, planners and policymakers to develop and promote a robust interdisciplinary analytic framework for the wide range of possible infrastructure responses to coastal hazards, including social, ecological, and engineering/technical factors.  This will allow policy-makers to have clearer selection criteria for location-appropriate and climate-adapted sustainable coastal infrastructure policy. Coordination of research between the two regions opens possibilities for improving the long-term sustainability of coastal communities in both locations by improving decision-making regarding effective and sustainable new infrastructure. The project will generate greater participation among US minority students and researchers in, and improve student and professional access to, training in coastal resilient infrastructure design, planning and policy-making.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Storm events in the last decade have been increasingly severe, with significant loss of life and property.  Even with increasing storm intensity, the losses that a storm creates can be reduced if infrastructure and other factors are improved to match the increasing intensity of coastal hurricanes and floods. Helpfully, there has recently been significant innovation in resilient infrastructure designs and coastal regulation.  These new approaches to infrastructure can achieve a wider range of benefits including current improved ecological services and human well-being as well as long-term hazard protection, among other goals.  The best of designs often coordinates traditional grey infrastructure, green ecosystem-based approaches, and changes to the regulations that guide development on the coast as well as the social practices of the populations involved.  There are several challenges to wider adoption of these complex packages of greener, more resilient approaches. One challenge is that it requires careful coordination across disciplines, with social scientists working with ecological and physical scientists, along with the engineers who design the infrastructure and planners and policy-makers who set the regulations for investments.  Also, traditional approaches to evaluation do not capture all the potential benefits of these new designs.  Taken together, these conditions and opportunities increase the complexity of decision-making around resilient infrastructure.    To address these issues, the Sustainable Adaptive Gradients in the coastal Environment (SAGE) Research Coordination Network (RCN) developed a transdisciplinary network of researchers and policymakers integrating the Caribbean and U.S. Northeast. This created the opportunity for cross-geographic learning, as researchers from the Caribbean that have long histories of managing coastal risk worked with researchers from the U.S. Northeast to develop innovations on this topic. Over the course of the five years, the RCN members developed shared language and understanding that enabled us to create a new framework for better informing resilient coastal infrastructure decisions based on multiple goals, and with a particular focus on ensuring equitable outcomes from investments. The group undertook a Delphi technique round of surveys plus in-person meetings and site visits to identify the key factors on which more resilient infrastructure should, in our opinion, be evaluated, including:   exposure reduction (whether the structure or practice will prevent harm from storms);  cost efficiency (whether it does so with least cost);  ecological enhancement (does it improve current and future ecology of the area);  adaptation over time (will it still achieve its goals if conditions change, especially under climate change);  greenhouse gas reductions (does the structure use much energy to be built and then run);  equitable outcomes (does the intervention help those who have less resources to recover from a disaster);  and participatory process (was the overall design undertaken with active engagement of the publics who are most affected by it).     We term these factors the Adaptive Gradient Framework.  The group worked together to identify a relatively fast and inexpensive way to use the framework to evaluate project designs early in the development cycle, when it is not as difficult to change approaches. To test the Framework and its implementation approach, the full group applied it in one workshop and then two small groups applied it in Maryland and in Puerto Rico, and found that using the framework did enable an improved approach to decision-making for resilient infrastructure.   Specific products of the RCN include peer-reviewed publications, a technical report and a brief practitioners’ guide which explains how communities can use the Framework approach to better evaluate their own infrastructure investments, three case study reports and multiple conference presentations in the US and internationally.  The framework is currently being tested in project decisions for one state’s division of natural resources, and network members continue to work with government agencies and non-profits for dissemination.  Educational outcomes include an innovative and replicable one-week interdisciplinary graduate-level short course in coastal infrastructure which brought together 26 students from 16 institutions studying 15 different majors to collaboratively design coastal interventions, as well as webinars and a Reader on climate change and green infrastructure from a major publishing house.  The project built a diverse international research network whose members gained a much deeper multi-disciplinary understanding of greener, more just infrastructure.  This network will continue to foster the future development of students and transformative, policy-relevant research initiatives.
