<AbstractNarration>The waxing and waning of eruptive activity at giant volcanic systems like the Toba Caldera Complex of Sumatra, Indonesia or at Yellowstone Caldera, USA, raise fundamental questions about the tempo and physical evolution of these systems, and about the phenomena that could trigger the next eruption. This project targets the highly explosive 75 ka Youngest Toba Tuff (YTT) - at &gt;2800 km3 of magma, the largest eruption experienced by the human race - and the subsequent, more quiescent eruptions that could signal renewal of the sub-volcanic system, or its death throes. Crystals contained within volcanic rocks like the YTT are effective recorders of the origin, assembly, and thermal history of the magmatic systems responsible for them. For the YTT, the crystal record is extraordinarily complicated, and existing results are fragmental and sometimes contradictory. Estimates for the interval of near-eruption crystallization, for example, range from a few hundred years to several tens of thousands of years, with drastically different implications for the magnitude and duration of volcanic unrest. This study aims to reconcile the various disparities in crystal-scale records using samples and analyses strategically selected to complement, extend, and more carefully examine previous work. Investigations will focus on long term changes in crystal growth environments, mineral affinities between the YTT and post-YTT eruptions, and the residence time of crystals at liquid-dominated rather than solid-dominated conditions including the duration of system (re)activation from the conditions and duration of near-eruption mineral growth. This study will test the hypothesis that different portions of the YTT and post-YTT eruptions selectively sample distinct portions of the magmatic system in space and time, including a liquid-dominated cap reservoir, remobilized crystal-rich domains (mush), and the background of magmatic inputs into the system, and examine whether a resident silicic reservoir is developing or dying beneath the Toba Caldera Complex. The PI and Dr. Craig Chesner (EIU), the leading expert on the Toba Caldera Complex system, will collaborate on this project, train graduate students at NAU in conjunction with a new Ph.D. program emphasis in Earth and Planetary Systems, and mentor undergraduates at NAU and EIU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Toba Caldera Complex is a natural laboratory in which to investigate how highly explosive silicic systems are generated; numerous investigations have also speculated about its impact on major climatic and anthropologic events. The chemical dynamics of magma assembly, the origin of compositional zonation in large volume eruptions, and the timescales of mineral growth, storage, and mush reactivation in high- and low-volume eruptions emitted from the same magmatic system are the main foci of this study. Systematic characterization of representative samples (via serial sectioning of pumices, petrographic studies, and SEM and CL imaging) and strategic in situ chemical and isotopic mineral analyses (via electron and ion microprobe analyses of selected trace elements and 238U-232Th-230Th-207Pb- 206Pb) in the minerals quartz, allanite, and zircon are being undertaken, with complementary analyses of other minerals. A comprehensive approach is needed to distinguish cognate minerals from minerals accidentally incorporated during or before eruption, and to examine the fidelity - to each other and to magmatic conditions - of increasingly-used temperature and chemical proxies. Delimiting the duration of magma remobilization and the frequency of post-caldera magmatism will also contribute to understanding magmatic signals in the lead-up to eruptions, and the potential for future volcanic hazards associated with the Toba Caldera Complex.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project investigated the dynamics and timescales associated with assembling and storing the magma responsible for the enormous (&gt;2800 km<sup>3</sup>) Youngest Toba Tuff (YTT) in Indonesia. The YTT erupted explosively 74 thousand years (kyr) ago after an ~400 kyr interval of volcanic repose, and produced a compositionally heterogeneous ("zoned") eruption, as recorded by the diversity of individual pumice compositions. Micro-scale imaging and in-situ analyses were used to characterize the chemical compositions of minerals zircon, allanite, and quartz. This framework was coupled with temporal constraints applied to the same mineral suite using U-Th dating and the duration of diffusional relaxation, and a model linking the crystallization of these diverse minerals was developed.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We found that a significant fraction of the zircon cores may have already been present in the magma reservoir responsible for a major eruption prior to the YTT. Zircon growth continued during the ~400 kyr volcanic repose interval, in some cases recorded by semi-continuous age spectra over &gt;50% of final zircon growth. Nucleation and growth were likely under diverse magmatic conditions. In contrast, YTT allanite grains crystallized over the latter half of the repose interval, often from melts similar to the ones in which they erupted. These results, along with apparent crystallization temperatures of ~700-780 deg.C, show that the sub-caldera magma system contained compositionally discrete melt-rich domains at least intermittently for &gt;100 kyr. Final zircon and allanite growth is evident as thin (micrometer) rim plateaux, but only ~half of the surfaces have ages permissive of eruption-aged growth.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Cathodoluminescence imaging of quartz revealed complex zoning that have broad affinities to host melt compositions. Quartz CL zoning patterns are indistinguishable between the YTT and subsequent lava dome eruptions, further supporting a residual YTT magma origin for the latter. The chemical zoning within quartz was calibrated to titanium contents, enabling quantification of the possible duration of Ti diffusion within quartz. Zoning also guided compositional analysis of melts trapped within quartz. Trace element characteristics of the quartz-hosted melt inclusions define three discrete populations, each representing a fraction of overall YTT variations. These populations, considered in the context of affinities to other chemical and mineral features, show that pumices represent spatially discrete chemical domains within the magma system, and that melt-domain assembly and chemical zoning in the YTT preceded quartz growth. The magnitude of melt Ti variation can be reconciled with reasonable amounts of crystallization and/or resorption of the YTT phase assemblage. The correlation between Ti contents in quartz and the chemistry of melt inclusions indicates that the compositional zoning in quartz may be controlled by host melt compositions rather than, for example, by changes in temperature and/or pressure of crystallization, as often assumed. Timescales of quartz storage determined using diffusion chronometry progressively increase coreward and indicate that growth of quartz crystals throughout the YTT mostly occurred within a couple kyr of eruption. The persistence of a melt-dominated and zoned magma system is inferred to be at least this long.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Differences in the chemical and temporal records retained by zircon, allanite, and quartz are interpreted to reflect cycles of crystal isolation, remobilization, and resorption associated with fresh influxes of magma. These resulted in dissolution of major phases and some allanite, but with only minor effects on larger zircon crystals. Such differences in the stability conditions of these minerals are especially favored at the cool and wet nearly-temperature invariant conditions that characterize at least half of the YTT. We infer that the YTT magmatic system was composed of at least two relatively homogeneous, non-communicating rhyolitic magmas to within ~40 kyr of eruption. Repeated episodes of magma recharge may have occurred over &gt;400 kyr and contributed to the development of these reservoirs. Compositionally different magmas subsequently coalesced and mingled, accompanied by intrusion and crystallization of rhyodacitic magmas. Growth of distinct quartz rims likely post-dates this remobilization from a mushy quiescent state but appears to pre-date YTT eruption by at least tens to hundreds of years.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project provided advanced research training and professional development resulting in successful completion of an MS thesis (female student) and a PhD dissertation (male student). The results of this project have been shared with the scientific community in two publications and in 10 conference presentations, with an additional two publications and two presentations nearing completion. Our results provide a modern framework for assessing volcanic hazards in light of evidence for magmatic layers beneath the Toba Caldera Complex and continued volcanic activity after the YTT eruption.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/13/2019<br>      Modified by: Mary&nbsp;R&nbsp;Reid</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1322077/1322077_10260573_1573676365828_Fig_Toba_Location--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1322077/1322077_10260573_1573676365828_Fig_Toba_Location--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Toba Location Map"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1322077/1322077_10260573_1573676365828_Fig_Toba_Location--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Toba Location Map"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Digital relief image of the Toba Caldera Complex showing caldera margin, outline of locations of major eruptions (colored dashed lines), and some of the pumice locations for this study (colored stars).
