<AbstractNarration>1360398&lt;br/&gt;Borrok&lt;br/&gt;1360282&lt;br/&gt;Zhand&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WSC-Category 1 Collaborative: A surface water management framework to counterbalance groundwater withdrawals in wetter regions of the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The over-use of groundwater is becoming a critical problem in regions historically characterized by abundant rainfall and surface water, including much of the U.S. Northern Gulf and Southern Atlantic Coastal regions. This project proposes to develop a theoretical framework and a new modeling/decision support tool aimed at better managing surface water so that it can be used to close groundwater supply gaps. The proposed management framework focuses on understanding human-water-land use interactions, with an emphasis on agriculture. The research team will explore the potentially transformative concept of integrating the social and biophysical dimensions of water systems into a unified framework for improved management of surface water resources. This includes consideration of the balance between water demand for humans and ecosystems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team will develop an innovative geospatial decision support/modeling tool that can identify and evaluate opportunities to capture and use surface water to replace groundwater in these wetter regions of the US. The theoretical framework and associated geospatial decision support tool will be unique for wetter regions of the U.S. where groundwater and surface water have traditionally been managed separately and surface water management has focused largely on flood control. The tool will directly benefit farmers, land managers, regulatory agencies, and state and local government officials. The research will be integrated with education through a trans-disciplinary senior/MS-level course at UL Lafayette. Public outreach, focusing on water conservation efforts, will be part of this course. We will additionally leverage and expand existing NSF and NOAA watershed-based education/outreach projects that target graduate students and high school teachers, respectively. This project also serves as a catalyst for developing a new collaborative team of researchers interested in water sustainability.</AbstractNarration>
