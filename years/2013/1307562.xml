<AbstractNarration>Siena College will participate through the NSF RUI program in research at the Energy Frontier with the CMS Experiment located at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland.  The participation will be facilitated through collaboration with the nearby CMS experimental group at Cornell University.  The Siena team of PI Matt Bellis and undergraduate students will join efforts within CMS to search for rare and forbidden decays (including baryon number violating decays) of the top-quark, a particle which is produced prolifically at the LHC.   The collaboration with the Cornell group means that Siena can access expertise and CMS specific information regarding data access, analysis procedures, and publication procedures.  Analyses will be performed by the students at Siena.  Broader impacts of the program include participation by the PI in the effort within CMS on open-access to data and outreach by the PI and his students to underrepresented and underserved students in physics in local community high schools in the greater Albany NY region.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award was the first of its kind to support a smaller, undergraduate institution's collaboration with a R1 university on one of the largest experiments at the Large Hadron Collider, in Geneva, Switzerland, CMS, the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment. In 2013, Siena College began working with Cornell University on this exciting research, in accordance with the guidelines of the CMS's constitution.&nbsp;</p> <p>With this support, 17 Siena undergrads and two local high school students, were able to contribute to the scientific and outreach goals of the CMS collaboration. The Siena group contributed to a Cornell-led analysis of the production of very high-energy top quarks, the most massive known elementary particle, to see if they conform to standard model expectations. A deviation from these expectations could have been related to something as basic as fine-tuning our simulations or as groundbreaking as implications that we live in a higher-dimensional universe. While the analysis showed that the top quarks are produced in line with what we expect, the experience was invaluable for our students to see how cutting-edge science works up close.&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition, Siena initiated a number of novel outreach efforts which have been disseminated rather widely. In the first, we modified instructions we found online to build cloud chambers, devices that let you "see" radiation, so that they could be built in a few days with equipment that cost less that $200. Normally these cloud chambers use dry ice, which limits their use somewhat, but the design we modified relies on Peltier thermocoolers, which can be purchased online and allow the user to simply flip a switch. The project was almost entirely student driven, and we ran 2 summer workshops for high school teachers to get this technology into the classroom. In addition, students traveled to Fermilab, the science laboratory outside of Chicago, to teach their outreach group how to build them and they are in use out there.&nbsp;</p> <p>Another outreach effort is the Particle Physics Playground (http://particle-physics-playground.github.io/), a website that hosts simplifed data from CMS and other experiements for use in educational activities. The website is built around basic python, a programming language that is widely used in introductory courses both at the college and high school level, and Jupyter Notebooks, an NSF-funded project that makes it easier for scientists to share their code and analysis approach. We made the decision to decouple this code from the CERN-specific tools that particle physicists use so that it is more accessible to interested students. This website and the exercises were mosly built by Siena students and have been used in educational efforts not just around Siena, but in high schools in North Carolina and even Finland.&nbsp;</p> <p>Because of this grant, Siena College was able to initiate updates to searches for new physics that had been previously unattended. Siena is now leading the effort to search for forbidden decays of the top quark, any observation of which would rewrite what we know about particle physics. Siena has also presented preliminary work on new file formats which make it easier for scientists to work with large datasets, not just in particle physics, but in other fields as well. These projects would not be possible without the support of this grant, particularly in how students have been able to contribute significantly to these efforts.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/05/2018<br>      Modified by: Matthew&nbsp;Bellis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1307562/1307562_10252441_1517844078950_cloud_chamber--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1307562/1307562_10252441_1517844078950_cloud_chamber--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Turnkey cloud chamber designed by Siena College students."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1307562/1307562_10252441_1517844078950_cloud_chamber--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Turnkey cloud chamber designed by Siena College students."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This cloud chamber was designed by students at Siena College and uses Peltier coolers instead of the usual dry ice to cool a petri dish.
