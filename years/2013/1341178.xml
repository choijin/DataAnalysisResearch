<AbstractNarration>The nitrogen cycle in the ocean is extremely complex and it continues to yield surprises. Knowledge gained in this project will directly contribute to resolving an unsettled and important question regarding the sources of nitrogen in the oceans because imbalances in nitrogen budgets have raised questions on how well we have quantified all nitrogen inputs and removal. While nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria have long been recognized as important contributors to nitrogen fixation in the oceans heterotrophic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (HNFB) are a poorly characterized, but potentially important, component of the marine nitrogen-fixing community. Using advanced methodologies, this project will develop the means to obtain a new understanding of novel, active, HNFB in the ocean. The identification of these organisms and the assessment of their phylogenetic diversity and biogeochemical significance will provide important insights about their role in the marine nitrogen cycle. The project will develop a novel stable isotope probing (SIP) methodology coupled with high-throughput sequencing. SIP exploits the uptake of isotopically enriched substrates into nucleic acids (e.g., DNA) while high-throughput sequencing should allow the identification of nitrogen-fixing bacteria generally, and HNFB specifically, so that the principal investigator can directly link the biogeochemistry of nitrogen with the phylogeny of those nitrogen-fixers. The objective of this project is to provide a proof of concept effort and identify important HNFB lineages using this novel approach and begin to develop quantitative estimates for the contribution of HNFB populations to marine nitrogen-fixation and the nitrogen cycle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will foster the development of a graduate student who will work on all aspects of the project for his PhD and the work will be presented at science conferences and in public outreach venues. Undergraduates will also work on the project under the guidance of the graduate student and principal investigator. The participants will also engage with the USC Young Researchers Program (YRP), which recruits high school students from diverse and underprivileged local schools for summer research experiences. Students will be guided in the laboratory-based aspects of this project, and present their work at an YRP symposium. The principal investigator will also continue to participate in science curriculum development workshops of the Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence-West program.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The ocean is an active reservoir for much of the world&rsquo;s carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), a potent greenhouse gas linked to climate change. When phytoplankton, the base of the majority of the Ocean&rsquo;s food webs, have sufficient nutrients, they can use energy generated from photosynthesis to turn CO<sub>2</sub> into more phytoplankton that can be grazed by zooplankton or sink into the deep ocean, sequestering this C. However, much of this production is limited by the availability of nitrogen (N) and different N sources will affect the fate of this newly formed biomass. Certain sources of inorganic N, e.g. ammonium and urea, arise from the breakdown of previously formed organic matter (termed recycled N) and do not allow for net C accumulation and sequestration. CO<sub>2</sub> taken up this way will ultimately be released back into these surface waters and into the atmosphere where it came from. Other sources of N, e.g. nitrate and N<sub>2</sub> fixation (termed new production), add new nitrogen to these waters allowing net accumulation of C to be stored in biomass that will eventually sink out and be sequester in the deep ocean. This can allow even more CO<sub>2</sub> to diffuse into these waters causing them to become a sink for CO<sub>2</sub>. The breakdown of organic matters is often associated with heterotrophic processes undertaken by various microorganisms including diverse bacteria, archaea and protists. Organic matter itself can be deficient in N content. Hence, many marine heterotrophs assimilate inorganic N and can compete with marine phytoplankton for these limited resources. Understanding the communities involved in the response to fluxes of different N sources into marine ecosystems will allow us to better predict how they will respond in this changing climate.</p> <p>&nbsp;Our project was aimed at optimizing a stable isotope probing (SIP) method for studying nitrogen assimilation with a particular goal of identifying heterotrophic N fixers. In nature, only 0.37% of naturally occurring N atoms are <sup>15</sup>N, the remainder, 99.6% are the lighter natural isotope, <sup>14</sup>N. SIP attempts to identify the organisms directly involved in the uptake and assimilation of specific N substrates by assessing changes in DNA density based on the incorporation of an enriched (99% <sup>15</sup>N) heavy substrate. Traditional SIP methodologies separate the labelled from unlabeled DNA by long (+60h) ultra-centrifugation runs in a CsCl gradient after exposure of the sample to the enriched substrate.

Incubations were used to first determine the limit of detection of the method and the minimum incubation length required to obtain a labeled signal. If incubations are too long, cross-feeding, i.e. a primary utilizer excretes a transformed version of the original substrate that is secondarily taken up and assimilated into biomass, can occur causing the misidentification of primary utilizers. We were able to couple amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene commonly used for taxonomic identification with more traditional SIP methodology. This increased the resolution, from 30% to 10% DNA enrichment required, while allowing the assessment of individual organisms. Our initial effort in natural waters indicated activity in populations of heterotrophic diazotrophs was below the detection limit of the method. Hence, we shifted our focus to investigate nitrate and ammonium assimilation in these waters and found that organisms previous shown to be lacking the genes required to incorporate this N sources were showing evidence of assimilation.
