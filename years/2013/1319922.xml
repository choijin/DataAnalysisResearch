<AbstractNarration>This project will develop a large-area dense-array tactile display device suitable for displaying a full-page of braille characters and tactile diagrams.  This device will co-locate tactile input and output and will make interaction with text and graphic content on mobile devices as direct and meaningful for visually impaired users as touchscreen interaction is for sighted users.  Current braille display technology can only render a single line of content at a time.  This project will address this problem by developing new display technology based on microfluidic actuators and microfluidic logic circuits.  This technology holds tremendous promise for creating refreshable tactile features on a flat screen, and for new multipurpose displays because the microfluidic substrate can be designed as a transparent overlay to a visual display.  There are just a few technological barriers remaining until microfluidics is practical for creating programmable haptic features.  One of these barriers is the "piping problem", packing a dense array of bubble actuators without an independent channel dedicated to each actuator.  A second problem involves matching the microfluidic actuators to the properties and sensitivity of the fingertip skin through an appropriately engineered surface.  The research team has piloted solutions to both of these problems and will construct analytical models that will enable these solutions to be scaled, both up and down, for rendering a variety of features from individually perceivable braille dots to perceptually continuous lines, curves and tactile forms.  The design of the display technology will be guided and informed by a series of user evaluations that will advance the science of surface haptics while at the same time comparing this microfluidic approach to alternative assistive technologies currently under development in academia and industry.  The collaborative team is uniquely qualified to develop microfluidics technology specifically for a braille display.  Mark Burns will further develop microfluidic logic circuits and shift registers to individually address braille pin actuators.  Brent Gillespie will optimize the mechanics of the actuators and braille dots and adapt them to the mechanics of the skin and actively guided touch.  Sile O'Modhrain will develop the science of surface haptics to guide the match between microfluidic technology and application in human-computer interaction through braille.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The project will develop a full-page electronic braille device that will increase braille literacy among blind persons worldwide.  At the same time, the project will solve the most pressing problems blocking the application of microfluidics in shape display and surface haptics on touchscreens.  The availability of a large-area tactile display would open up the possibility for a wide range of scientific exploration and would also have a huge commercial impact because it would have a profound impact on what is fundamentally possible with touchscreen devices.  The project will recruit and engage blind persons, under-represented minorities, women, and undergraduate researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we have developed new technology that will enable the creation of a full-page high-density tactile display for blind computer users.  Our approach uses microfluidic techniques to raise and lower pins on the display?s surface, and also to control which pins will be raised.  Our technology is based on a highly scalable and manufacturable monolithic device made solely of soft silicone that comprises a dense array of tactile features along with the actuators and pneumatic circuitry needed to address and control each tactile feature. To create an array of thousands of braille dots at 2.5mm spacing with a minimum of electronic and electromechanical components, we use an equally dense array of microfluidic logic circuits.  These circuits perform the addressing and memory functions that enable serialized transmission of the information to be displayed.     Our technology avoids many of the bottlenecks that have stalled prior attempts such as the need to manufacture and assemble displays from many moving parts and the challenges around tightly packing elements to control individual dots.  Our display is comprised of bonded layers of soft silicone, has few moving parts and can be manufactured in a single step.  The project has led to the creation of a start-up company with the goal of manufacturing devices and getting them into the hands of blind students and professionals who need access to spatial ways of understanding and representing information.  As we move increasingly toward an economy that assumes information literacy, our new display technology will play an important role in enabling blind people to find careers in this rapidly expanding area of employment.  Broader impacts of our work include the potential for enhanced access to computer media for blind readers, especially for STEM areas including math and science.  Crucially, a full-page array will support the concurrent display of scientific notation in braille alongside associated tactile graphics.
