<AbstractNarration>As firms' supply chains have become highly complex and geographically fragmented it has encouraged the offshoring of manufacturing activities previously carried out within the United States.  What are the implications of the recent surge in offshoring for the rate to innovation?  There are several reasons to expect that offshoring might affect it negatively. If formal Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) efforts and informal knowledge generated through the use of technology are complements in innovation, the geographic separation of R&amp;D and production will slow down innovation. Moreover, if knowledge spills over between physically proximate plants, one firm's production location and R&amp;D decisions will affect the rate of innovation of other firms.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;To assess the magnitude of these effects, this project uses microdata from the last 15 years collected in the Census of Manufactures and the Annual Survey of Manufacturing to examine firm responses to the reduction in costs of offshoring caused by China?s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).  First, the impact of U.S. offshoring on firms' returns on R&amp;D is quantified by contrasting the innovation trajectories of purely domestic U.S. firms with those that decided to offshore after China's entry into the World Trade Organization.  Second, the effect of offshoring on the social return to innovation in the United States is analyzed.  Geography constrains the movement of labor, goods, and knowledge, a fact that often leads to the clustering of production at particular locations. As a consequence, if one firm suddenly withdraws production from U.S. factories it could affect other U.S. firms; as these firms respond the effects may be magnified to economy-wide proportions.  By going beyond the narrow private effects of offshoring, this work gets at the "offshoring multiplier", which captures the total impact on U.S. productivity and innovation caused by offshoring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;This research puts hard numbers to the claim that offshoring has weakened U.S. innovation by measuring directly the impact of offshoring on the private return to R&amp;D.  The results are essential for the formation of manufacturing and trade policies.  In particular, if the impact of offshoring on the social returns to R&amp;D is large, as many have claimed, it suggests the need to coordinate the incentives for R&amp;D with incentives for local over foreign production in order to maximize the feedback effects from knowledge spillovers.  The project will also contribute to scientific workforce development through the training of graduate research assistants who will gain first hand knowledge of underutilized data sources and techniques and will help to support newly established Census Research Data Centers in State College, PA, and Boulder, CO.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Little is known on what the rise of multinational firms means for US innovation and welfare. Much of existing innovation analysis still focuses on national firms, which create their know-how and produce their output domestically, not multinationals which choose between domestic and foreign locations for knowledge creation and good production. U.S. firms have increasingly spread their labor force around the globe, employing now roughly one in three of their workers in overseas locations. Many of these overseas workers are located in China, which has been a major part of this globalization. At the same time, the shift of production abroad has meant a greater specialization on know-how creation in the U.S., and the ratio of headquarter-to-production activity has increased. Does specialization on technology creation spur innovation or does the greater geographic distance between know-how creation and production reduce the effectiveness of R&amp;D as feedback from production to innovation vanishes?     A first result of this research that is instructive for understanding the relationship between offshoring and US innovation is the innovation impact of the shift of manufacturing production from the United States? Northeast, near the centers of know-how creation, to the geographically more distant U.S. South during the 1970s to 1990s. In both instances, goods began to be produced further from where ideas where created. Although the average distance between headquarter and production plants has increased over the period 1992-2012, firms that exhibit sustained innovative success typically have at least some production facility located close to their headquarters.  As firms have increasingly withdrawn from U.S. manufacturing in the 1990s, our research shows that these firms first closed those U.S. plants most distant from their innovation centers (and headquarters).  The main motive for this is that firms seek to keep their most knowledge sensitive activities close to their centers of innovation. Ongoing research is quantifying the relative importance of the benefit of receiving feedback in the R&amp;D lab from the production floor versus the benefit to firms from producing in distant, but low-factor cost locations.  An important contribution to research infrastructure is to provide a detailed account of the geography of innovation by pinpointing the location of innovation inputs, mostly R&amp;D, as well as the innovation outputs, measured by patent activity, across different firms and their plants in the United States over the last 30 years. The high definition perspective made possible by 30 years of U.S. domestic economic experience with the growing physical separation of innovation and production will aid are understanding of the effective of globalization on U.S. technological leadership.
