<AbstractNarration>Jobs for the Future (JFF) partners with Owensboro Community and Technical College (OCTC) and the WGBH Educational Foundation to develop and field test a work-based learning (WBL) approach for manufacturing technician education for incumbent production workers lacking an Associate degree.  New WBL courses, adapted from existing OCTC courses and National Institute of Manufacturing Standards credential standards, are piloted within the manufacturing technology department at OCTC. In the pilots themselves, cohorts of incumbent workers earn six to twelve academic credits towards an advanced manufacturing Associate degree, and improve their skills and knowledge in advanced manufacturing technology.  A suite of professional development tools and multimedia resources are developed for faculty and employers at other colleges and posted to the PBS LearningMedia digital platform to support wider adoption of a WBL design in manufacturing technician education.  The Educational Development Center?s Center for Children &amp; Technology conducts both the formative and summative evaluation of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on the success of the Jobs to Career program in nursing implemented by Jobs for the Future at 17 community colleges.  WBL is aligned to competencies in OCTC courses; faculty are supported in designing the curriculum for WBL; the capacity of employers to integrate WBL into the workplace is strengthened; outcomes for 45 incumbent workers are improved. The project products and outcomes are disseminated through a professionally produced multi-media toolkit.  The evaluation determines the impact of WBL on participants and compares them to students on campus-based courses. It also determines the effectiveness of the toolkit when used by other instructors.        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ATE program has funded the development of various forms of Problem-Based Learning that bring the workplace to the classroom.  This project tests the effectiveness of bringing the classroom to the workplace.</AbstractNarration>

WBCs bring college to the production line by using the job as a learning lab. Key features of WBC are that they integrate the classroom and workplace by formalizing instruction that happens during work; reflect the unique production needs of a company because teaching happens on the job; and fulfill program requirements for a community college certificate or degree.</p> <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intellectual Merit:</span></em> JFF defined, refined, and researched the WBC model as a new way of delivering work-based learning as part of a rigorous manufacturing education.

The 104 incumbent workers enrolled in WBCs academically outperformed their traditional peers, with an average GPA of 3.90 as compared to 3.52. Incumbent workers in the project earned an average of 11 academic credits toward an associate&rsquo;s degree. Almost three-quarters of WBC students who completed a post-course survey said WBCs increased their interest in their job, two-thirds indicated that the courses prepared them for a new job, and 43 percent said the courses helped increase their wages.</p> <p>This approach strengthens connections between learning and work for educators, employers, and students. Participating employers have found work-based courses to be a flexible, cost-effective model for building the skills of their workers. The benefits to the college and employer are evident in a new partnership between OCTC and Waupaca: the manufacturer simultaneously enrolled 52 workers in a WBC and committed to raises or promotions based on assessments upon course completion. OCTC plans to recommend a similar WBC approach to all new employer partners. Finally, a human resources representative of one participating company observed that the program not only helped the current group of WBC students, but also may inspire other employees to see themselves moving up in the company. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a morale booster to see that we&rsquo;re investing in our people,&rdquo; she said.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/04/2017<br>      Modified by: Deborah&nbsp;Kobes</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304249/1304249_10253701_1483558208695_WBCInAction--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304249/1304249_10253701_1483558208695_WBCInAction--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Work-Based Courses in Action"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304249/1304249_10253701_1483558208695_WBCInAction--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Work-Based Courses in Action"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A supervisor at OMICO Plastics teaches a WBC student on the job.</div> <div class="imageCredit">WGBH</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Deborah&nbsp;Kobes</div> <div class="imageTitle">Work-Based Courses in Action</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304249/1304249_10253701_1483558156758_TeamTeaching--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304249/1304249_10253701_1483558156758_TeamTeaching--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Team Teaching Work-Based Courses"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304249/1304249_10253701_1483558156758_TeamTeaching--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Team Teaching Work-Based Courses"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">OCTC faculty and a Waupaca supervisor discuss strategies for teaching in the workplace.</div> <div class="imageCredit">WGBH</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Deborah&nbsp;Kobes</div> <div class="imageTitle">Team Teaching Work-Based Courses</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304249/1304249_10253701_1483558083529_IndustryMeeting--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304249/1304249_10253701_1483558083529_IndustryMeeting--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Industry Meeting"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304249/1304249_10253701_1483558083529_IndustryMeeting--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Industry Meeting"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">OCTC and Waupaca staff meet to explore the development of work-based courses.</div> <div class="imageCredit">WGBH</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Deborah&nbsp;Kobes</div> <div class="imageTitle">Industry Meeting</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
