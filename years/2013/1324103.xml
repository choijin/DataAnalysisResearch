<AbstractNarration>This project supports the establishment of a Census Research Data Center (RDC) at the University Park campus of Pennsylvania State University.  An RDC is a secure Census Bureau facility staffed by a Census Bureau employee that provides researchers who have approved research projects with access to confidential data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).  There currently are 15 RDCs in major cities and research hubs in the country, and the Census is planning for future growth of the network.  An RDC at Penn State will serve as a crucial resource to support research among faculty members and graduate students in the areas of economics, demography, statistics, sociology, geography, and the health sciences.  Access to restricted-use data has become a necessary input into social science research.  In addition, the Census Bureau is continually making new data sources available at the RDCs, which will make these centers even more valuable and necessary as a research tool in the future.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;An RDC at Penn State will contribute to the mission of the Census Bureau and existing RDC network through research programs in areas such as data confidentiality, imputation methods, and analytical tools for social science data.  The development of new data sets through the merging of existing administrative sources or the integration of data from foreign countries that will then become available through the RDC network provide advantages to researchers throughout the network.  The integration of graduate education and training at Penn State with the data resources in an RDC will help to produce future social science and health researchers.  Finally, by integrating Penn State into the RDC network, it will greatly facilitate collaboration between researchers at Penn State and other universities and research institutions that currently have an RDC or will in the future.  This ability to increase network ties with other researchers is one of the main long-term benefits of participating in the RDC network.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This grant was awarded to fund the startup costs of the Federal Statistical Research Data Center (FSRDC) at the Pennsylvania State University.  The FSRDC was constructed in the fall of 2013 and spring of 2014 and was approved for operation by the Census Bureau on April 4, 2014.  Since the opening of the Penn State FSRDC, there have been 15 approved research projects undertaken by Penn State researchers and one additional project is currently under review.  A total of 37 Penn State researchers have been approved for Special Sworn Status by the Census Bureau and are allowed to conduct research in the FSRDC.  In addition, the center has hosted two researchers with affiliations in other FSRDCs.   The titles of the 16 approved and submitted research projects and the field of the primary PSU researchers are:  External Capital Issuance and Firm Production, Yelena Larkin, York University Firm Level Adjustment of U.S. Food Firms to Globalization, Pinar Celikkol Geylani, Duquesne University International Buyer-Seller Matches, James R. Tybout, PSU Economics Disparities in Health and Mortality by Nativity and Immigrant Status (NCHS), Jennifer L. Van Hook, PSU Sociology Offshoring and Innovation, Steven Yeaple, PSU Economics Hispanic Health Care Access and Utilization in Different Geographic Locations, Shannon M. Monnat, PSU Rural Sociology Penn State University Indicator Review, Nathan Goldshlag, Census Bureau Neighborhood context, weight, and weight-related behaviors among Mexican American Children, Jennifer L. Van Hook, PSU Sociology Coverage Expansion, Provider Payment, and Patient Experience of Access to Care in Medicaid, Jeah Jung, PSU Health Policy Admin Ethnicity and Interview Language in the NCVS: An Analysis of Response Patterns, Data Quality, and Experiences with Crime, Eric P. Baumer, PSU Sociology Assessing Relationships between Food Insecurity, SNAP Participation, and Children?s Health Outcomes among Hispanic Households, Shannon M.

Bleser, PSU Health Policy Admin An Empirical Study of Franchising, Peter Newberry, PSU Economics Improving the Connection between the Spatial and Survey Sciences, Chris Fowler, PSU Geography National Longitudinal Surveys Match to the National Death Index, Melissa Hardy, PSU Sociology   The use of the center has grown steadily since its opening and it has a broad base of researcher support.  Researchers from five departments, economics, sociology, geography, health policy administrations, and rural sociology, in four different colleges within the university have initiated research projects in the center.  Several projects also involve primary investigators at other universities and the Census Bureau with participation by PSU faculty and grad students. The center is now well established as a valuable resource for empirical research at Penn State.   The Penn State FSRDC has extended its operation to the Philadelphia area during the past year.  In June 2016, we received approval from the Census Bureau to open a branch of our FSRDC at the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank.  In addition, Penn State has entered into a consortium agreement with the University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, and the Philadelphia Federal Reserve to jointly fund and operate the PSU center and the Philadelphia branch for the next five years.  The Federal Reserve Bank has agreed to fund all the construction costs for the new branch.  This agreement will extend the benefits of access to the confidential data available in the FSRDC network to a large number of researchers in the Philadelphia area.  It also provides a more stable long-term funding source for both centers.  Overall, the NSF funding provided by this grant was valuable in establishing this FSRDC which is now a valuable research tool at Penn State.
