<AbstractNarration>Understanding the evolutionary relationships among organisms within the Tree of Life is essential for learning how life has evolved on Earth. By unraveling these interrelationships, the historical causes and consequences of biological phenomena ranging from disease to diet can be understood. Decades of research has shed light on many regions of the Tree, but still, many relationships are poorly understood.  Recent technological advancements now allow biological researchers to collect DNA sequence data from the genomes of organisms on an unprecedented scale, and these massive data have the potential to untangle these difficult branching patterns in the Tree of Life. However, much remains to be learned about how genomes evolve across the many branching events of the Tree. This project will use these large DNA sequence data sets to study the branching patterns of evolutionary relationships in Strepsirrhine primates, a group that contains the highly endangered lemurs of Madagascar, and salamandrid salamanders, a diverse group of amphibians most commonly known as the newts. These two very different organismal groups will be used to answer questions about how different types of genes evolve at the molecular level as the lineages that contain them diversify and split over time.  This will help evolutionary biologists answer the important question of which data from across the genome is best sampled to properly infer the organismal placement in the Tree of Life. This project will involve participants across multiple levels of education, including undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers, as well as established faculty. This research will inform conservation planning of these two iconic organisms.  Additionally the research will link with public outreach activities at the Duke Lemur Center and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Science.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; This research project will use next generation DNA sequence technology to sequence large portions of strepsirrhine primates and salamandrid salamanders genomes.  These data will include hundreds of loci under positive selection as well as hundreds of loci from neutrally evolving parts of the genome. Analyses of these data will explore the ways in which massive data sets can be used in phylogeny reconstruction. The phylogenetic reconstruction will be focused within groups which have exhibited patterns of recent and rapid species radiations and contain branches that have challenged phylogenetic reconstruction. The researchers will assess the performance of genes under positive selection in reconstructing difficult clades. While the use of genes under selection is something typically avoided in molecular phylogenetics, properties of these positive-selection loci suggest that they may be an ideal source of phylogenetic information for the most challenging of branches. The loci under positive-selection will be annotated by gene properties thereby providing a tremendous wealth of gene ontology information. The researchers will assess the performance of functional classes of genes in phylogeny reconstruction to gauge whether particular functional classes of genes are better at recovering phylogeny. Overall, the results of this project will provide empirically-derived solutions to the phylogenetics community for how a genomic data can be used to solve challenging phylogenetic questions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Phylogenies are one the greatest tools available to scientists for understanding the history, diversity, and biological meaning of life on earth.  Indeed, it was Charles Darwin who first realized that the relationships among living organisms are best summarized as a branching diagram that we refer to as the Tree of Life.  These diagrams, that we call phylogenies, can inform biological questions that span disciplines from disease transmission to conservation biology.  Thus, their power to inform scientific questions is beyond doubt.  What is still open for debate, however, is the question of how best to generate phylogenies that are an accurate depiction of organismal relationships.  For the past two decades, the field of phylogenetics has largely relied on genetic data for generating phylogenies, and thanks to the information contained within our genomes, the forward strides in our understanding of the history of life on earth has been remarkable.  Thus, one would assume that the vast amount of data generated by the genomics revolution would rapidly lead to a complete understanding of the Tree of Life.  Such is not the case, however, given that it is more challenging than ever to choose genetic markers that are congruent with organismal history versus those that more closely track organismal function.  Our study tackled this question head on by generating genome scale data from a broad representation of primates within a single evolutionary radiation, referred to as a clade.  This clade, classified as the Lemuriformes, is comprised of primates unique to the island of Madagascar where they have been evolving in isolation for tens of millions of years.  This group is highly appropriate for testing the power of individualized genetic datasets, partitioned into classes that represent functional versus non-functional DNA, given that as primates, they are close relatives of our own species.  Accordingly, comparisons to the human genome are straightforward for identifying functional genes versus intergenic regions in lemuriform genomes.  Our project has sampled across the broad phylogenetic diversity of lemurs with one of the key products being the generation of whole genomes that have been assembled to near-chromosome levels (something that was unthinkable, even several years ago).  We have deployed these data for phylogenetic analysis on deep time scales (i.e., events that occurred 50 - 60 million years ago) and on much more recent time scales (i.e., events of the past 100,000 years).  The key findings are that genetic regions that are entirely without known function do not perform well at these deepest time scales, but are remarkably informative for more recent events.  With regard to the latter, we have discovered that phylogenetic patterns within lemurs indicate that Madagascar's forests have been fragmented for tens of thousands of years, long before the arrival of humans.  These same analyses reveal that in some lemurs, genetic changes can accumulate far more rapidly than morphological changes, indicating that the relationship between genetic change and morphological change is not linear.  Taken as a whole, our project has refined our understanding of how to choose the best genetic characters for accurate phylogenetic analysis, while also revealing the impacts that natural environmental change has had on the historical relationships among lemurs.  These new perspectives will help us better understand the impacts of both natural and human-induced climate change on the health and future prospects for Earth's biodiversity.
