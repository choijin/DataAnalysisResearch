<AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this program is to develop a novel family of diode lasers based on single-crystal semiconductor nanomembranes, featuring several potentially transformative attributes.   Specifically, these devices, because of their extreme structural flexibility, could be employed in environments that are inaccessible to traditional rigid semiconductors.  Their emission properties can be controlled with externally applied mechanical stress, e.g., leading to unprecedented wavelength tunability.  Furthermore, the nanomembrane geometry may even allow for laser oscillation in materials that are normally inadequate to this purpose.  In particular, this program is focused on the demonstration of nanomembrane lasers based on germanium, where tensile strain can produce a direct fundamental bandgap, thereby enabling optical gain.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit is provided by several potentially disruptive applications of the proposed devices.  Nanomembrane lasers in general can create novel functionalities in mechanically flexible optoelectronic systems, such as sensor foils, smart clothing, and artificial skin.  Furthermore, the proposed Ge lasers could be directly fabricated on silicon-based microelectronic chips as a means to enable the integration of electronics and photonics at an unprecedented scale.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impacts are provided by related educational and curriculum development activities.  The research involvement of undergraduates and high-school interns will be emphasized, leveraging existing programs with a strong focus on underrepresented minorities.  The more innovative themes of this research will also be incorporated in courses taught by the PIs.  Furthermore, the aforementioned applications may ultimately produce important benefits to society, e.g., by creating radically new sensing capabilities.</AbstractNarration>

Because of their ultrasmall thicknesses, these NMs can sustain complex modes of mechanical deformation, and therefore be employed in environments that are not suitable to traditional rigid semiconductor devices.&nbsp; Furthermore, their optical properties can be controlled through the external application of mechanical stress, leading for example to extreme tunability of the emission wavelength and increased radiative efficiency.&nbsp; In particular, we have focused on germanium NMs, where mechanically-induced biaxial tensile strain can be used to fundamentally alter the basic electronic properties (i.e., to convert the Ge energy bandgap from indirect to direct), so as to enable efficient light emission and even the introduction of optical gain.&nbsp; Since Ge is one of the leading materials of microelectronics, these results provide a promising new approach for the development of semiconductor light sources that can be integrated monolithically within complex electronic systems.&nbsp;

To introduce strain in a controlled fashion, the NMs are bonded onto a polymer substrate and mounted in a mechanical pressure cell (Fig. 1).&nbsp; With this setup, we have observed highly strain-enhanced and red-shifted photoluminescence, as well as the formation of direct-bandgap Ge and evidence of population inversion.&nbsp; In addition, we have developed photonic-crystal cavities consisting of periodic arrays of dielectric pillars (Fig. 2), which can be integrated with the NMs without compromising their mechanical flexibility.&nbsp; To minimize absorption and scattering losses, these pillar arrays have been fabricated with high-quality crystalline Si, and then transferred over the Ge NMs using a novel membrane assembly technique, leading to the observation of well-defined photonic-crystal modes in the NM photoluminescence spectra.&nbsp; Detailed numerical simulations indicate that the resulting devices can provide lasing if scattering losses in the NMs (arising from crystalline defects in their native materials) can be minimized.&nbsp;
