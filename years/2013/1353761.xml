<AbstractNarration>The plant group Lamiales is globally important, representing &gt;8% of all known flowering plants. The group includes numerous species of economic importance such as the mints, olives, sesame, jasmine, and many horticulturally important plants. In this project, Dr. Olmstead will synthesize 25 years of research in his lab on the evolution and systematics of this large and globally diverse flowering plant group. He will also integrate the extensive literature on these plants from research into their morphology, anatomy, cytology, chemistry, taxonomy, paleontology, and ecology.  The project will produce a phylogenetic tree that will use data from publicly available databases (GenBank) and employ new computational techniques to accommodate the analysis of evolutionary relationships in the very large datasets of the ~22,000 Lamiales species. Dr. Olmstead will also produce a book on the present state of knowledge on this group.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rapid pace of discovery over the past two decades, particularly in the Lamiales, has meant that common botanical reference works are out of date. This has made it difficult for researchers, educators, agricultural scientists, and others to find accurate information on a range of topics for the diversity of plants in this group. The large-scale evolutionary tree produced by this research will permit a more thorough understanding of the diversification of a globally important plant group, and compiling the literature on Lamiales will permit researchers, growers and educators both an overview of the diversity and biology of this group and entr√©e into the literature for those who want a deeper understanding.</AbstractNarration>

In my lab and in collaboration with others, I have worked in a systematic fashion to better understand the evolutionary relationships among members of Lamiales. This body of work (ca. 100 peer-reviewed papers on Lamiales) has dramatically altered our understanding of the evolutionary and geographic history of Lamiales and has led to a reclassification of the families that comprise the group.  With this award, I have completed synthetic studies of several large families of Lamiales, undertaken a study to assign dates to the origins of all of the families of Lamiales, and have made significant progress towards compiling the extensive literature about Lamiales for a book that will eventually be published.   During the award period, I organized a symposium at the International Botanical Congress in Shenzen, China, in 2017, that brought together scholars from around the world to present their work on Lamiales.  Three of my former doctoral students were included among the invited speakers for this symposium, providing an important early-career global stage on which to present their research.  Two Ph.D. students assisted with the compilation and analysis of data as part of their academic training are now postdoctoral fellows and have launched their own academic careers.   Collaborations with scientists in Argentina, Brazil, and China have been a part of this project and have enhanced the careers of young scientists in each of those countries.
