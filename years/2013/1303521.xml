<AbstractNarration>SES-1303521&lt;br/&gt;PI: Katja Guenther&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Kerry Mulligan&lt;br/&gt;University of California - Riverside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation research will utilize content analysis of the media and court room depictions of a national sample of criminal cases involving misconduct between teachers and their students to analyze how the gender and race of the perpetrators shape the responses of individuals in the media and criminal justice system. Drawing on sociological insights about social construction, this research focuses on how the race and gender of the perpetrator relate to the way in which events are presented, perhaps differently, in media coverage and criminal justice responses to these cases. The research employs a mixed-methods approach, including both quantitative and qualitative techniques, to analyze data from newspaper articles and court transcripts. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will improve understanding of the apparent resilience of ideologies by articulating how ideas about gender are integrated into social institutions through the actions and beliefs of individuals. Specifically, the research will establish the extent to which these cases serve as opportunities for individuals to expand and transform dominant ideas about gender or adhere to normal expectations. Second, by focusing on incidents in which constructions of the case vary, this research will demonstrate how dominant ideas about gender are strategically employed by varying actors to serve their interests. By examining legal and media settings, the research will reveal how strategies for constructing the events vary by institutional setting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This research has the potential to contribute to broader society in a number of ways.  Recent research on the frequency of responses to and consequences of teacher misconduct suggest broad interest and concern over these types of incidents. This project will contribute new information about a large sample of these types of cases and will add to this scholarly dialogue in a way that can assist policy makers and educational administrators in developing more targeted prevention, disclosure, and response procedures in U.S. schools. The research will also provide an empirically based critique of the tendency to ignore or minimize the victim status of male victims of female teacher misconduct. This has the potential to draw greater attention and support to this under-served population.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project examined how dominant beliefs about gender and race affected criminal justice and news media responses to criminal cases of educator sexual misconduct. This included the creation of a dataset of over 300 criminal cases of educator sexual misconduct that were reported in the news media. The dataset includes information of the characteristics of the offender and victim, the criminal charges, and the legal outcomes of the case. It has been made available to other researchers interested in studying this population through publication with a well-known database archiving site. Statistical analysis of the sentencing outcomes of the sample of cases provided support for the &ldquo;selective chivalry thesis,&rdquo; a well-known and contested concept in criminology. Specifically, I found that female defendants as a whole experience less severe sentencing than male defendants in similar criminal cases, but that this lenient treatment was not extended to female defendants who were viewed as gender deviants based on their sexual engagement with multiple minors. An analysis of the amount and content of news media coverage of these cases, I found that there was a markedly greater amount of coverage of cases involving white female defendants than male defendants and female defendants of other races. This high level of media coverage was especially noteworthy because members of the media often expressed moral outrage at the female offenders while simultaneously trivializing the teenage male victim&rsquo;s experiences of sexual victimhood. This finding adds to a growing body of literature which suggests that male victims of sexual abuse experience greater difficulty in identifying themselves as sexual victims because of the lack of existing cultural and ideological resources available for responding to male sexual victimhood. Finally, I found that the female teenage victims of these sex crimes faced hostility and suspicion in the criminal justice system that mirrored the treatment of adult female victims of rape that has been described by other scholars. In particular I found that female victims were expected to demonstrate sexual naivet&eacute; and adherence to white middle-class norms of adolescent femininity in order to be assessed as &ldquo;worthy&rdquo; of legal protection and media sympathy. &nbsp;The findings of this project will be distributed through publication of three peer-reviewed research articles, presentation at professional conferences, and policy briefs to relevant criminal justice offices.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/14/2014<br>      Modified by: Kerry&nbsp;R&nbsp;Mulligan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
