<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for attendees and invited speakers for the twelfth annual symposium of the NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowships (AAPF) program, to be held in the National Harbor, Maryland, on January 4-5, 2014. The purpose of the AAPF program is to integrate research and educational activities at the postdoctoral level to better prepare fellows for a scientific career. The annual symposium provides a venue for fellows to discuss their research and teaching or outreach projects while increasing their exposure within the astronomy and astrophysics community. The symposium represents a key component of the AAPF program and acts as a mechanism to facilitate knowledge transfer from experiences that the fellows have obtained in the course of their activities to a broad audience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with previous symposia in this series, the AAPF symposium for 2014 will promote interactions among astronomers with very different interests and backgrounds. By creating a forum in which discussions can occur across the standard boundaries defined by sub-discipline, there is great opportunity for new insights and the ability to develop new interdisciplinary collaborations. The symposium will also provide a venue for discussing other issues that are important to early career astronomers. In addition, the symposium will (1) provide a forum for discussing the combination of research and teaching, (2) facilitate collaborations between AAPF fellows on both research and education, and (3) provide exposure for the fellows and the fellowship program within the astronomical community</AbstractNarration>

The 12th Annual  NSF AAPF Symposium, which was supported by this NSF award, provided a venue  for current fellows to discuss their research and teaching or outreach projects while  increasing their exposure within the astronomy and astrophysics community. The 2014 NSF AAPF Symposium was held at the Gaylord National Resort &amp; Convention  Center in Washington, D.C., January 4-5, 2014, preceding the winter meeting of the  American Astronomical Society (AAS). The Symposium brought together fellows, their  faculty mentors, members of the NSF staff, prospective fellowship applicants, and other  interested members of the astronomy and astrophysics community. As in previous years, this yearÃ†s NSF AAPF Symposium provided (1) a venue for  fellows to discuss their research and education projects, (2) exposure for the fellows and  the fellowship program within the broader astronomy community, and (3) a venue for  discussing issues that are important to early-career astronomers. The NSF AAPF Symposium differs from most small meetings attended by astronomers  in that it provides a unique forum for the discussion of the integration of research  and teaching. The NSF AAPF fellowship program leads the field in simultaneously  addressing the importance of both research and teaching in the careers of astronomers.  Through invited keynote speeches and expert discussion panels, the Symposium fosters  an active discussion of ways to improve the teaching of astronomy while also conducting  top rate scientific research. This helps to further develop the educational expertise of  the AAP Fellows, who will likely become future leaders in the community capable of  advancing and implementing the best techniques in education and outreach. As in previous years, the 2014 NSF AAPF Symposium consisted of the following  components: &bull; Multiple expert panels on special topics of interest to the fellows.  &bull; A keynote science talk by a well-known member of the field who has managed to  effectively integrate research and teaching during his/her career.  &bull; An invited talk by a science education specialist, discussing cutting-edge methods  in science education and outreach.  &bull; Talks by current fellows on their research and education or public outreach  projects. The 2013 Symposium included the following three expert panel discussions: 1. How to be a successful mentor: 2. Big topics in astronomy: pressing scientific problems for the next 5-10 years:  3.

The education and public outreach  keynote talk, "The Future of the Planetarium," was presented byMark SubbaRao (The  Adler Planetarium, Chicago). In addition, 21 current NSF AAPF fellows presented their  latest work in research and education, and status reports from the NSF were provided by  the AAPF Program Director Dr. Ed Ajhar. The symposiumÃ†s intellectual merit included promoting discussions among astronomers  with very different interests and backgrounds.
