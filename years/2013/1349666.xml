<AbstractNarration>Numerical software is increasingly playing a critical role in society, and thus numerical errors in software can have disastrous consequences. However, it is very difficult to test numerical software, and numerical errors are hard to detect because they may not necessarily result in system crashes. There is a strong need for effective and practical techniques or tools to detect and prevent such errors and improve robustness of numerical software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores novel and practical techniques for testing and analyzing numerical software to detect numerical errors in order to improve its robustness. In particular, this project carries out a set of preliminary research tasks to demonstrate the feasibility of the techniques, including developing an initial public repository of numeric constraints and exploring techniques to guide, optimize, and use parallel path exploration in symbolic execution. The research in this project enhances the infrastructure for teaching and research by providing open source tools and data sets for use by students and practitioners, and for enhancement by other researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For the duration of this NSF project, we, the principal investigators and graduate students, have investigated practical techniques to test and analyze numerical software, which our society increasingly depends upon. Anti-lock breaks and medical devices such as haptic control systems for remote surgery are two such examples. The conducted research and educational activities have advanced the state-of-the-art in improving the reliability of these important software systems, provided techniques and foundations for developing future technologies, and trained next generation researchers and engineers. More specifically,   - We have developed an effective search-based technique for isolating program inputs that lead to significant inaccuracies in numerical implementations.  - We have developed the first technique to successfully automate the computation of backward error, a fundamental and powerful concept for understanding numerical (in)stability.  - We have introduced a new general approach for solving floating-point constraints that significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions, and extended our capability in analyzing and verifying numerically intensive software.  - We have disseminated our research results through publications in top outlets such as highly-competitive conferences and premium journals, tool distributions and research exchanges.  - We have successfully trained the next generation computer scientists through postdoctoral scholar and graduate student advising, and engineers through undergraduate and graduate level education.
