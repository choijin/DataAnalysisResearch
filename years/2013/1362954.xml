<AbstractNarration>Problems arising in control theory, in the physical sciences, and in other areas of mathematics have led naturally to the consideration of linear maps between infinite-dimensional spaces, as well as to other objects constructed from collections of such maps. This project is intended to add to our understanding of these concepts, with applications to the areas mentioned before as  possibly distant goals. The work on this project involves mathematics from apparently disparate mathematical disciplines, such as combinatorics and probability. More specifically, it engages various newer probabilistic concepts that are appropriate for a noncommutative setting. The principal investigator will involve both graduate and undergraduate students in this research. Indeed, some of the combinatorial problems can be formulated in a sufficiently elementary manner as to be accessible without too much technical background. (Previous work with undergraduate students did result in published material.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concrete problems in this proposal fall into several categories. The first one concerns the Littlewood-Richardson rule from combinatorics and representation theory. It is hoped that appropriate formulations of this rule will be found that apply to the study of sums and products of compact operators and elements of finite von Neumann algebras. The second category is connected with the free probability theory introduced by Voiculescu. Here the problems revolve around the addition problem for collections of free random variables and its applications to random matrices (e.g., the study of outlying eigenvalues resulting from perturbations). The third category consists of several somewhat loosely connected problems from single operator theory or the closely related non-selfadjoint algebras they generate. The problems range from structure theory for commuting isometries to questions about hyper-reflexivity, invariant subspaces, and numerical ranges. (As far as applications are concerned, the second category of problems has connections to communications theory, while single operator theory is a valuable tool in control theory. These applications are not the focus of the proposed research, but earlier work of the principal investigator has had impact in applied areas.)</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit: The results of this project are advances in the study of free probability, combinatorics, and classical operator theory.  In free probability, the relations with eigenvales of random matrices were explored using analytic subordination techniques.  The results obtained supersede all the previous work done for sums (or more general polynomials) in independent random matrices, one of which is unitarily invariant.  In combinatorics, certain objects named honeycombs were classified and this work is expected to be relevant in such disparate areas as sums of Hermitean matrices and the structure of invariant subspaces.  In classical operator theory, Sarason's theory of skew Toeplitz operators was extended to so-called symmetric operators relative to "almost" isometric operators.  Some of these results will have applications in other areas of mathematics and science.  For instance, symmetric operators are useful in control theory and eigenvalues of random matrices appear naturally in many areas, including astrophysics and wireless communications.     Broader impacts: Work on these projects contributed to the ducation of several Ph. D. students (Ed Timko, Cong Zhou, Yi Shi, Dong Han, Brady Thompson, and Koushik Ghosh).  Of these two are female (Zhong and Shi) and two graduated (Timko and Shi).  Funds from this grant were used to facilitate travel of these students to international meetings and workshops.  Some support was also provided for three postdoctoral associates (Natasa Blitvic, Weihua Liu, and Ching-Wei Ho).  Blitvic went on to a tenure track position in the UK, Liu obtained a position at the University of Arizona, and Ko is continuing.
