<AbstractNarration>SES-1330559 &lt;br/&gt;Steven Pfaff&lt;br/&gt;Ross Matsueda&lt;br/&gt;University of Washington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Social scientists have long sought to explain why participation in collective action (CA) is so variable. Why, even when the members of a population have widespread, severe grievances and a latent demand for a solution, is concerted action aimed at redress an unusual event?  Questions like this have inspired a number of productive and revealing research programs. In situations involving public goods, many research perspectives expect a free-rider problem to exist, whereby actors have a general preference to achieve the common good but clear incentives to not contribute to its provision. Because, under some conditions, individuals can be coerced or compensated to follow-through on their expected contributions, CA action can occur. Nonetheless, the implications for widespread, sustained and effective public-spirited action are pessimistic. But how warranted are these claims? If everyone is not only prone to free-riding but aware that others are too, how does mobilization ever occur?  What are the micro- and macro-level factors that help overcome collective inaction? Why do aggrieved people respond to mobilization in great numbers in some instances but most often do not?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators test a new synthetic structural-cognitive theory of CA by conducting a cross-national factorial survey (FS) on individual propensity to protest. This is approached by constructing a experiment which uses vignettes to study the propensity of students to engage in a walk-out against the imposition of tuition increases. The researchers have developed a web-based FS program using open-source LimeSurvey software and will conduct factorial surveys on the propensity to protest among students at the University of Washington in Seattle and at the University of Leipzig in Germany. The goals of the project are to (1) explore how individuals understand and respond to incentives; (2) estimate CA thresholds and examine non-linear ways in which they may operate in a population; and (3) disentangle invariant causal mechanisms producing collective action from socio-cultural differences in institutional and national context that may interact with these causal mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This model of CA is applicable to a wide range of behaviors, including voluntarism, social movements, boycotts, demonstrations, and other forms of action.  It will be able to shed light on which social structures facilitate mobilization and why some policy proposals are apt to provoke opposition.  This knowledge can lead to greater attention to public responses in political life and to improved policy initiatives and administrative strategies. Methodologically, the investigators employ methods in rigorous ways that will influence future research on political action and other forms of collective behavior. The project will develop and make publically available an inexpensive, user-friendly, web-based FS program from open-source LimeSurvey software that can be widely adopted by social scientists. In addition to publishing study results, the project will result in novel, publically available data. The Co-PIs will incorporate research findings into both undergraduate and graduate teaching, and continue to make data available to other faculty and graduate student instructors teaching courses in theory, political sociology, movements and related courses. The Co-PIs are also participants in interdisciplinary centers (CSSS and CSDE) relevant to the project.</AbstractNarration>

Our empirical analysis of student protest yields several insights. First, the magnitude of a grievance (i.e., tuition increase) strongly affects both the perceived likelihood of success and an individual?s propensity to protest. This finding contradicts some resource mobilization theorists who discount the importance of grievances&mdash;since they are ubiquitous in modern society&mdash;and emphasize the role of resources and opportunities in models of collective action.  As is consistent with Olson?s famous theory of selective incentives, we find that selective punishments and rewards predict propensity to protest.  However, social incentives, such as reputation among significant others, generates little returns to protest in our study.  Collective action frames (the ways in which strategic actors portray the issues at stake), including efficacy and injustice, make little difference in decisions to protest in our study.  People's decisions to participate in protest are interdependent. The number of students participating in a protest increases the likelihood of success at a diminishing rate, which points to a decelerating production functions.  People keenly assess how likely protest would be when they decide to participate.  The likelihood of success mediates much of the effect of social context on propensity to protest.  Our finding that grievances spur protest is consistent with sociological rational choice views of collective action: the greater the threatened tuition increase, the greater the returns to a protest aimed at thwarting the tuition increase. This result is also consistent with research suggesting that incidental, or suddenly-imposed grievances, may be more effective in motivating protest than long-standing structural grievances, such as economic inequality .  Incidental grievances&mdash;like an unexpected tuition hike&mdash;might spark protest by creating common interests across an otherwise diverse population, but also by generating expectations that others will not stand for them. Public-spirited collective action can be motivated by pecuniary rewards, a finding which may be at odds with studies warning that pecuniary appeals undercut cooperation. In some populations, particularly heterogeneous ones lacking dense social ties, monetary payments to induce cooperation may be an effective strategy in overcoming the start-up problem in critical mass theory.  Monetary payment may be a viable alternative when resource-rich organizations already exist and social ties are relatively sparse.  Finally, our analysis of production functions responds to Oliver and Marwell?s (2001) call for models of collective action that recognize the range of incentives, explicitly state what is being held constant and what is being varied, and use empirical data rather than relying solely on compture simulations.
