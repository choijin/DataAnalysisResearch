<AbstractNarration>This action funds Sven Nelson of Washington State University to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at the RIKEN Plant Science Center in Yokohama, Japan.  The project title is "Investigating the Roles of Two Plant Hormones, Gibberellin and Abscisic Acid, in Arabidopsis Seed Dormancy." The host scientist is Dr. Mitsunori Seo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The balance between seed dormancy and germination is governed by two plant hormones, abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA).  Dormancy is a period during which seeds will not germinate, even under favorable conditions.  Dormancy is released by dry storage called after-ripening.  During dry after-ripening levels of ABA fall.  GA levels rise when after-ripened seeds imbibe water, but it is unclear whether GA levels rise during after-ripening of dry seeds.  One reason for this is that the low hormone levels in dry seeds are difficult to measure.  Use of new highly sensitive techniques employed at the RIKEN institute enables us to investigate the roles of ABA and GA in seed dormancy release and germination. This research will benefit society because knowledge of the hormonal control of seed dormancy will allow better control of germination in cereal crops to prevent problems such as preharvest sprouting and poor seedling emergence.  Knowledge of seed germination will also allow the development of crops with good germination and seedling emergence, a major determinant of yield.  It will advance discovery in the area of seed biology while advancing learning through teaching the Fellow new technologies for hormone analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the results of this research will be broadly disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal together with Dr. Seo, and through oral presentations to other scientists.  In addition, a presentation about this research topic will be made to the Washington State University Future Cougars of Color to encourage high school students from underrepresented groups to pursue education or a career in science.</AbstractNarration>
