<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a low cost, multifunctional energy harvesting and storage device. The single device can harvest both light and RF (radio frequency) into electricity and store the energy in the same device with 3-D architecture.  Due to the single substrate and simplified, low cost processes, the cost of ownership will be reduced largely. The implementation of a low cost process of inkjet printers will further reduce the cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes applications in wireless sensor network, RFIDs, industrial process monitoring, supply chain management, security, medical monitoring, remote and hazardous environment monitoring, and wearable electronics. The success of this project will enable the above applications to gain greater market acceptance, reduce energy demand from non-renewable sources, and hence help establishing the leadership of the U.S. in the area.</AbstractNarration>
