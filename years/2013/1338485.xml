<AbstractNarration>Social networks--that is, collections of individuals linked by inter-relationships--are by now well-known important factors in understanding social and behavioral phenomena. Missing from prior considerations is the fact that these relationships represent sequences of dynamic short-term interactions, where each interaction reflects the concerns of a particular environment. Present survey-based research methods are not able to capture accurate, detailed data on interactions within social networks over long timescales, and yet, such data would likely lead to significant new insights into the contextualized behavior of individuals, the way in which communities emerge, and the flow of information/transformation within human societies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together a multi-disciplinary team from sociology, anthropology, criminology, psychology, public health, and education, to identify critical research problems whose resolution would be advanced by the availability of dynamic interaction data. The research requirements of these diverse disciplines will be synthesized by computer scientists, leading to the design of a new cellphone-based system which will be capable of revealing the form and evolution of dynamic interaction networks in a privacy-preserving manner. To evaluate the design, a small-scale prototype will be developed, and applied in a case study exploring the impact of dynamic student interactions on individual academic performance.  Potential future iterations of this tool will ensure the confirmed willing participation of study participants by the inclusion of a component requirement to 'opt in' in order to take part in the automated data-collection process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By leveraging recent advances in proximity-based network technology and data science to yield the design of a general-purpose cellphone-based system that can provide much-needed access to dynamic interaction network data, this project furthers a deeper understanding of human societies by enhancing long-term research capabilities across a range of social, behavioral and economic sciences. The case study will validate the system design, while also providing new insights on patterns of interaction in social networks, and their potential impact on student achievement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was an interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers in a wide range of social, behavioral and economic sciences, together with a  computer scientist and a mathematician.  Our objective was to design the technologies necessary to be able to provide the next-generation of social science surveying for research.  In the past, surveys have been carried out by having the participants fill out questionnaires at various points in time during the study.  Because questionnaires are often lengthy and time-consuming, it meant that researchers wanting to study how/why people change over time, couldn't give their questionnaires out too frequently to participants, which, in turn, meant that the participants had to try and recall longer and longer stretches of time when giving their answers.  In bringing together a wide variety of disciplines, from public health, sociology, anthropology, criminology, psychology, and education--the project team decided that order to understand how social contact with others influences our various attitudes, behaviors, and feelings, researchers needed a system that could detect whenever one participant made social contact with another participant (e.g. face to face conversation, text messaging, a phone call, social media messaging, etc)--and to then dynamically ask the subject 1-2 appropriate short question(s) to get better understand of that particular interaction and its possible effects.  This project produced a complete design of such a context-aware artificially-intelligent surveying system based on off-the-shelf cellphone technology.  Specifically, through discussions across a wide range of social and behavioral science disciplines, the project produced the design of a cellphone app, and its backing cloud-based technology, using which dynamic surveys can be carried out easily, and through which we will gain deep and detailed data about human interactions and its side effects: the social epidemiology of behaviors, attitudes and feelings.  The team paid special attention to making sure that the design ensures a system that will be readily useful (once built), to researchers across many different social science fields.  The design also ensures that study participants' anonymity, privacy, and ability to "opt out" will be preserved and ensured at all times.  Based on the design, a proof of concept prototype app/server was developed and this prototype was tested in a successful pilot study.
