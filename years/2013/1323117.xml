<AbstractNarration>Indianapolis / City as Living Laboratory (I/CaLL) is a city-wide civic collaboration engaging in cross-sector research that builds on prior research in informal science learning in public settings.  It extends research in place-based and service learning traditions, and uses the city itself as an informal science learning (ISL) environment for Science and Engineering for Environmental Sustainability learning outcomes. This project is creating place-based science learning experiences as part of public spaces in Indianapolis and establishes the next generation of urban science museums that increase opportunities for learning.  The project will develop a self-sustaining program for art/science collaborations as they inaugurate city-sanctioned changeable installations at I/CaLL sites.  Data from the project will be used to inform ISL professionals at museums throughout the community and around the country. Thousands of volunteers and their families will help create I/CaLL spaces, engage with communities, and serve as research participants connecting with science learning through site development.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The unprecedented scale of this project provides a full measure of informal science service learning at a city scale, offering data that can change how science learning is measured, how people from all walks of life develop science literacy as part of their social public experience, and embodying the concept of the city as a living science learning lab. Broader impacts include the development of the city as an informal science learning environment that will become a new standard for thinking about what cities as cultural units can become as we build a resilient Science and Engineering culture for Environmental Sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project, Indianapolis/City as Learning Laboratory (I/CaLL), also known locally as StreamLines, was based on the major premise that while many urban areas are home to structured opportunities for informal science learning in museums, zoos, or science centers, less attention has been paid to opportunities for informal science learning in neighborhoods, outdoor public spaces, and designed landscapes. To address this, we sought to create a place-based science learning experiences in Indianapolis which would link the lived experience of a neighborhood?s urban ecosystem with active and directed artistic interpretations of science. The project consisted of programmatic components that involved (1) artistic interventions (sculptures, musical compositions, poems and poetry-writing workshops, and dance performances) reflecting connections to local waterways, (2) museum interpretation related to local waterways through both exhibition elements and programming at the Children?s Museum of Indianapolis, (3) collaboration and discussion between artists and scientists, both informally and through structured roundtable experiences hosted by the daVinci Pursuit, and (4) community organizing efforts, spearheaded and supported by Butler University, that sought to engage residents of six Indianapolis neighborhoods in the work of the project and in local waterway conservation efforts.  We found that dance, in particular, was an effective medium to communicate  the importance of waterways in Indianapolis, with most observers feeling they had a better understanding of some sciences concepts after having watched the dance performance. The dancers who participated in the performances likewise reported having a greater understanding of and connection to waterways after their rehearsals and performances. People who interacted with the physical installations reported a greater understanding of science concepts associated with waterways, as well as an increased confidence in their ability to explain the concepts. They also agreed that art was a good manner of communicating science concepts. There were challenges, however, in driving people to interact with the installations and developing a connection between the communities and the artwork.  StreamLines was a unique attempt to bring together two disciplines ? characterized by different discourses, methods of working, and ways of making meaning about the world ? to see what could  be learned from an initiative to spark curiosity, dialog, and new understandings about local waterway systems across the city of Indianapolis. The StreamLines experiments affirmed that art?science collaboration can create instruments for multi-sensory experiential learning that support abductive reasoning, community engagement, and discourse around valuing environmental systems. This process-oriented learning modality is fluid and open-ended but appears to be a legitimate path toward meaningful and long-term public science literacy and engagement.
