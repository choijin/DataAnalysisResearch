<AbstractNarration>The Austin Peay State University (APSU) Natural History Collections (NHC) include over 100,000 specimens of plants and animals from the Mid-south region of the U.S. These collections are vital to faculty and student research, serving as the foundation for over 200 publications, theses, and dissertations. The NHC are used in public outreach and as instructional materials supporting APSU biology courses. APSU students traditionally underrepresented in science including, military (28%), women (&gt;50%), low-income, first-time college, and minority students, receive training through courses utilizing the NHC and through collections-based research. Due to recent, drastic growth in the NHC and the discontinued use of toxic fumigants, collections are threatened by damage from overcrowding, fire, and insects. This award will secure the collections through acquisition of storage systems that increases space and prevents specimen damage.  Additionally, funds will be used to improve electronic storage of specimen data and to increase accessibility through a consolidated and improved NHC website that provides online access to specimen records, images, and other associated natural history information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Austin Peay State University (APSU) Natural History Collections (NHC) include the Mid-south's largest herpetological collection, a rapidly growing fish collection, and the second largest regional herbarium. APSU NHC's mission is to serve as the primary specimen repository for the Mid-south, to lead efforts to describe regional biodiversity, and to train new generations of students through excellence in mentorship, research, and public outreach. While the NHC have contributed significantly to education and research locally, use by the broader scientific community has been limited. Due to recent drastic growth, the NHC are threatened by physical damage from insufficient storage, active insect infestations, and potential future fire, water, and earthquake damage. Project goals are to (1) secure existing collections through installation of compactor shelving systems and implementation of non-toxic pest management, (2) increase utility through development of a single Specify database, and (3) increase accessibility via development and enhancement of online interfaces and collaboration with iDigBio and other data-sharing portals. These actions will promote the NHC's mission and convert currently under-utilized but regionally significant collections into broadly accessible resources that will support education and research related to of one of the most biodiverse areas of the US. More information about the APSU herbarium is available at www.apsu.edu/herbarium/databases; similar outlets will be developed for the vertebrate collections as part of the activities supported by this award.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Austin Peay State University Natural History Collections (NHC), including the APSC Herbarium (established 1942) and David Snyder Museum of Zoology (APSU; established 1963) are comprised of over 170,000 research-quality herbarium and vertebrate specimens. APSU NHC include the largest collection of amphibians and reptiles, second largest herbarium, and fastest growing fish collection in Tennessee, the most biodiverse state in the United States.&nbsp;</p> <p>The mission of the APSU NHC is to serve as the primary specimen repository for the mid-South region, lead efforts to describe diversity, ecology, and systematics of organisms from this region, and train new generations of skilled scientists through excellence in mentorship, research, and public outreach. While the NHC has contributed to education and research locally, use by the broader scientific community and public has been limited by restricted access to specimens and low online visibility. Additionally, recent growth from increased research activities of faculty and students contributed to overcrowding of specimens, damage from insufficient pest control in the herbarium, and limits to its continued use as a regional specimen repository.</p> <p>Major goals of this project were to: (1) secure collections from threats stemming from pests and overcrowding, and (2) increase collections accessibility and utility in research, education, and outreach beyond APSU. To accomplish these goals, non-toxic pest control procedures were implemented and high-density storage units were installed. These actions eliminated specimen damage from improper storage and pests while concomitantly providing adequate room for growth and continued repository services. To increase the accessibility and use of collections, existing databases were converted to a web-accessible platform (ARCTOS) and made available through newly developed APSU NHC websites and data-sharing portals (including VertNet, SERNAC and iDigBio). These actions have resulted in increased use of the APSU NHC over the past two years (average of 15.5&nbsp; visits and loan requests per year vs. 2.5 per year previously).&nbsp;</p> <p>Research by principle investigators and other Biology faculty has contributed to a unique biology curriculum that offers many high-quality, organism-focused courses that help distinguish APSU as a place where students receive a strong foundational understanding of organismal biology (impacting about 800 students/year). Through collection improvements facilitated by NSF funds, training and educational opportunities in specimen-based research were expanded for APSU students, a large percentage of whom are from traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM fields, including military, low-income, and first-generation college students. For example, two APSU Biology courses (BIOL 3331 - Evolution and BIOL 1121 - Principles of Biology II) now use the new online collections data and web resources in lab activities that teach students how to study population variation and about principles of systematics; activities also emphasize the importance of specimen libraries to science and our understanding of the natural world.</p> <p>PIs led efforts to engage and train students in collection curation methods and specimen-based research. Eleven students and one emeritus faculty were supported by NSF funds. Each assisted with imaging and database entry of specimens, updating amphibian and reptile atlases, reorganizing collections to maximize space, and georeferencing specimen localities. Many other students and community volunteers also assisted in project activities. Each supported student was engaged in specimen-based research that provided opportunities to share their results with the broader scientific community through presentations at scientific meetings (30+), publications (11), websites and social media (5), and completion of theses (8; two in progress) and reports. All undergraduates supported by the award (all female; two from traditionally under-represented groups in STEM) have continued their academic careers in organismal science as graduate students, each earning an M.S. degree in Biology; two are now biology doctoral degree candidates. Two supported graduate students are now in Ph.D. programs in ecology, and another is serving as the collection manager for the APSC Herbarium.</p> <p>PIs continued the APSU NHC&rsquo;s commitment to education through outreach by hosting tours of the collections for local schools, summer camps, and individuals. Extending to the larger region, they also participated in regional nature programs, such as the Land Between the Lakes &ldquo;Cool and Crawly Critter Day&rdquo; (~800 public participants each year). At these events, PIs used specimens and live animals to introduce concepts of biodiversity and the role natural history collections play in documenting changes in biodiversity. Grant participants also collaborated with Project WET (Water Education for Teachers), serving as station leaders in &ldquo;field days&rdquo; for local K-6 classrooms where students and teachers engaged in hands-on learning opportunities. Participants collected and identified aquatic animals and learned how clean water is critical to regional biota. Teachers gained tools to develop a curriculum that links organismal diversity and water quality to human health issues. Participating schools serve minority and low-income students from rural and urban areas of middle Tennessee. For many students, such hands-on experiences establish life-long positive attitudes towards the values of protecting biodiversity and engaging in scientific inquiry.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/27/2018<br>      Modified by: Rebecca&nbsp;Johansen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1349391/1349391_10308981_1534888816876_CourtneyBrittanySFC--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1349391/1349391_10308981_1534888816876_CourtneyBrittanySFC--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Students presenting collections-based research at a scientific conference"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1349391/1349391_10308981_1534888816876_CourtneyBrittanySFC--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Students presenting collections-based research at a scientific conference"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">APSU undergraduate students, C.
