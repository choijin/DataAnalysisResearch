<AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;To support participation of students and young professionals in science and engineering at the 2013 OSA Advanced Solid-State Lasers (ASSL) meeting which will be held in Paris, France, October 27-November 1, 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;Topical meetings of the Optical Society of America provide the occasion, the environment, and the reinforcement necessary to nurture evolving science and technologies. The proposed effort is to support the Materials Division of the ASSL meeting through funding of students and young professionals in science and engineering. The meeting encompasses advances in materials science, condensed matter physics, and chemistry relevant to the development, characterization and new optical applications. Presentations will address bulk crystals, glasses and ceramics, micro-structured materials such as optical fibers, planar waveguides, and periodically patterned non-linear crystals. The interdisciplinary nature of the meeting will provide cross fertilization of concepts and techniques between these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;The ASSL meeting aims to bring together international researchers from academia, government and industry to present and assess the current state-of-the-art of solid state lasers. The meeting will help to advance the field through sharing of results, methods, inspiring of new ideas, and initiation of new collaborations. Participation of students and young professionals in science and engineering will be fostered based on NSF funds to partially cover travel expenses. A technical digest will be available in both printed and CD-ROM format and will contain general program information, abstracts of the paper summaries, and the 3-page summaries of all papers presented during the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
