<AbstractNarration>The Noyce Teacher Scholar Program at Bridgewater State College (BSC) in Massachusetts includes as partners Massasoit Community College (MCC), and four districts: Brockton Public Schools, Randolph Public Schools, Fall River Public Schools, and Freetown and Lakeville Public Schools. The Science Teachers Scholars program is providing 2-year scholarships to 40 pre-service undergraduates during their junior and senior years, as well as summer internships to 24 freshmen or sophomores. At least 6 of the Scholars have transferred to BSU after two years at MCC, and 6 of the Interns are current MCC students. The project is focusing on STEM majors in biology, chemistry, physics and geology, with a special emphasis on chemistry and physics. Twenty-eight of the STEM majors are preparing to become secondary education teachers and twelve are preparing to become elementary education teachers. Because MCC serves a very diverse population, the project is enabling students pursuing a STEM degree and with a variety of backgrounds and experiences opportunities to become highly-qualified STEM teachers at the K-12 level.  Master teacher-mentors from each of the partner school districts work with the Science Teacher Scholars throughout their education and beginning year of teaching and provide mentoring in relation to teaching science in high-needs schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is utilizing the Center for the Advancement of STEM Education at BSU where interns work with existing biotechnology, chemistry, environmental, or astronomy projects to engage STEM majors in delivering inquiry pedagogy. STEM majors help design and run after-school science enrichment programs as another recruiting experience. Scholars pursuing an elementary education career are enrolled in a traditional STEM major and in the early childhood or elementary education major leading to an initial license. Students intending a middle or high school teaching career are enrolled in a traditional STEM major and the secondary education minor, again leading to an initial license. New 1-credit Science Education Workshops are being developed to address topics that are not currently covered in the Scholars science or pedagogical courses but that the teacher-mentors deem important for future science teachers to know, particular those useful in high-needs schools. During their first years of teaching, Science Teacher Scholars participate fully in the New Teacher Partnership, a pair of programs offered at BSC to new teachers throughout the local area.  The first is the New Teacher Academy, a two-day event each August, and the second is the New Teacher Seminar Series, a monthly program during the Academic Year that focuses on teaching in general as well as teaching science. Research involves a study of the effectiveness of recruitment efforts along with the effectiveness, confidence, and retention of the Science Teacher Scholars compared to non-scholarship recipients.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Southeast Massachusetts Science Teacher Scholars Program is a collaborative effort between Bridgewater State University (BSU), Massasoit Community College (MCC), and partnering high-needs school districts including: Brockton Public Schools; Fall River Public Schools; Randolph Public Schools; and Freetown-Lakeville Regional School District.   The main goal of the Southeast Massachusetts Science Teacher Scholars Program was to recruit and develop talented undergraduate science majors to become elementary and secondary science teachers in high-needs school districts.  Specifically, the program proposed awarding scholarships to students majoring in biology, chemistry, physics, and geology who had not previously considered teaching as a career path.  These scholarships would be used to support the final one or two years of study for each student as they enrolled in elementary or secondary education licensure programs in order to graduate with a license to teach in addition to their science degree.   In addition, the program proposed to fund summer internship opportunities for science majors completing their first or second year at BSU and MCC.  The goal of the summer internship experience was to ignite an interest in science majors to become science teachers as well as continue this path and apply for the Science Teacher Scholar Program scholarships.   Over the life of the grant, 34 Science Teacher Scholar scholarships were awarded to students interested in combining their passion for science with a career in education. Nineteen of these scholars were elementary education majors.  Ten of these elementary education majors were also Earth Sciences/Geology majors and the remaining eight also majored in Biology.  The other fifteen Science Teacher Scholars were secondary education majors. Seven of these secondary education majors were also Biology majors, five majored in Physics, two majored in Chemistry, and one majored in Geology.  By the close of the seven-year grant period, 25 scholars had graduated with both their science and education degrees.  Of these 25, twenty-one (84%) have obtained permanent full-time science related teaching placements in high needs districts (13 elementary, 8 secondary); one is teaching full-time in a non-high-needs district (secondary), two are applying for teaching positions at the moment, and one is still in the licensure phase. The remaining nine scholars will be graduating with their science and education degrees in the 2020/2021 school year.  The project also had great success in recruiting students for summer internships which combined science and education.  These internships allowed undergraduate science majors to work with children, gain experience in science education program planning and teaching, and spark interest in teaching.  Over the life of the project, 46 summer internship positions were successfully completed.  Almost half, 47% (16), of the Science Teacher Scholars participated in a summer internship opportunity.  The program implementation was also very successful and included convening a Project Management Team (utilizing BSU and MCC faculty) to assist with implementation and recruitment efforts; disseminating program information to science majors and faculty via flyers, handouts, and a new website; and recruiting six K-12 master teacher-mentors from partner school districts to assist with recruitment, mentoring scholars, and professional development activities.  The Science Teacher Scholars themselves have also been very successful conducting research, presenting at regional and national conferences, and being accepted at competitive fellowship programs.
