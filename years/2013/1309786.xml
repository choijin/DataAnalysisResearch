<AbstractNarration>Although it is well established that species diversity affects the function of ecological systems, more research is needed to understand the mechanisms responsible for these effects and thus how to conserve ecological function through the management of biodiversity.  This project will use laboratory experiments to investigate how the diversities of carnivores and herbivores interact to determine amount of herbivory, and how mutualisms between carnivores and herbivores can modify both predation and herbivory.  Researchers will manipulate diversities of insects that eat coffee plants in southern Mexico and diversities of insects that eat them, including diversity of insect-eating ants and presence of a coffee-eating bug that ants tend for its sugary secretion.  The project will test the hypotheses that diverse assemblages of herbivores are better controlled by more diverse assemblages of predators whereas only a low diversity of predators is needed to control a low diversity of herbivores, and that mutualisms between carnivores and herbivores can reduce the function of carnivore diversity as a control on herbivory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have important broader impacts on agriculture and strengthen international collaboration and the scientific workforce.  Because coffee is a major crop and the project uses combinations of herbivores and predators actually found in coffee plantations, results will have immediate applications to crop production.  The work builds upon a well-developed collaboration between U.S. and Mexican researchers and coffee growers.  Research will help train a Ph.D. student, undergraduates, and local research assistants.  Public dissemination of findings is planned through a display at the University of Michigan?s Botanical Gardens and talks at coffee plantations.</AbstractNarration>
