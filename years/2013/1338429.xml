<AbstractNarration>The International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating&lt;br/&gt;Systems (ASPLOS) is a premier multi-disciplinary conference for research that spans the boundaries&lt;br/&gt;of hardware, computer architecture, compilers, languages, operating systems, networking, and&lt;br/&gt;applications. ASPLOS provides a high quality forum for scientists and engineers to present&lt;br/&gt;their latest research findings in these rapidly changing fields. It has captured some of the&lt;br/&gt;major computer systems innovations of the past two decades (e.g., RISC and VLIW processors,&lt;br/&gt;small and large-scale multiprocessors, clusters and networks-of-workstations, optimizing compilers,&lt;br/&gt;RAID, and network-storage system designs). This proposal aims to support this highly regarded&lt;br/&gt;conference by obtaining travel funds to help students defray the costs of attending the conference&lt;br/&gt;in March 2013 in Houston, Texas USA. Priority will be given to those students who will present their &lt;br/&gt;research at ASPLOS or its joint workshops, and to women and other under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will have two primary direct benefits in terms of broader impact. First, the&lt;br/&gt;ASPLOS conference will be strengthened as a result of the greater attendance that this travel&lt;br/&gt;support will enable. Second, those students receiving travel support will personally benefit&lt;br/&gt;from the opportunity to engage in the all-important technical, professional, and social exchanges&lt;br/&gt;that ASPLOS fosters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also expect this proposal to have two additional indirect impacts. First, we plan to widely&lt;br/&gt;advertise the available support in order to attract women and under-represented minority groups&lt;br/&gt;in attendance. Second, by providing this support expressly to students, we expect to increase&lt;br/&gt;student participation in the conference. We anticipate that the research results presented&lt;br/&gt;at the conference -- as well as the emphasis on interaction between researchers in academia&lt;br/&gt;and industry -- will be carried back by attendees to their home institutions, resulting in&lt;br/&gt;heightened awareness and interests in multidisciplinary research in computer architectures,&lt;br/&gt;programming languages, and operating systems.</AbstractNarration>
