<AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1306117               PI:  Gerdon, Aren  ORG: Emmanuel College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  RUI: Selection and assessment of biomimetic templates for mineralization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:  The purpose of this proposal is to support and mentor undergraduate students pursuing research in mineralization and biomimetics.  Biomineralization of calcium phosphate and other solid materials in vivo exists at the interfaces between inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, and materials science. This interface is central in research areas ranging from diatomaceous silica production in our oceans to materials production for advanced technologies.  Practical relevance is also found in the prevalence of degenerative bone disease and dental caries, which suggest a need for the development of new restorative medical procedures.  While knowledge of the bone formation and regeneration process is incomplete, research has identified hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2; HAP) as a material with potential in healthcare applications due to its close resemblance to the mineral phase of bone and teeth.  This research aims (1) to elucidate the kinetics of HAP formation by developing integrative analysis methods that provide real-time quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) mass analysis, optical microscopy, and controlled microfluidic solution dynamics, and (2) to improve the availability of biomimetic templates by combinatorial identification of unique and conformational DNA aptamers that can enhance nucleation, growth, and crystallinity of mineralization.  In working toward these goals, this project may yield:  (1) the identification of a high affinity HAP-binding DNA aptamer, (2) a new template for HAP biomineralization, and (3) new analysis tools for biochemistry and bioengineering applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical:  The purpose of this proposal is to support and mentor undergraduate students pursuing research in mineralization and biomimetics. All research proposed here will be completed by undergraduate science students at a liberal arts institution with a record of training women scientists.  A primary focus will be on mentoring and training undergraduate students as they enter into research at the freshman or sophomore level and on ensuring that these students contribute to and integrate with the larger scientific community.  Students involved in research will be trained in numerous instrumental methods (QCM, optical and electron microscopy, FT-IR, and others), biochemical methods (PCR, electrophoresis, and others), and general research methods.  This will broaden their opportunities to enter into the industrial workforce or graduate studies.  The proposal will have a significant positive impact on sustainable research and the infrastructure of the science and education departments at Emmanuel College due to the cross-disciplinary nature of the project and by encouraging collaboration between the principle investigator and other faculty as well as between research students across the campus.  Findings from this research will be made available on campus and off campus through local and national conference presentations and peer-reviewed publication.  This work will impact high school students that come to the campus for Biomedical Research Symposium workshops related to this research and run by undergraduate researchers.  One promising high school student will also be recruited to join the research group and work side-by-side with the undergraduates.  Work in the summer will carry forward to impact first-year science students as they engage in a research experience lab in their general chemistry course, led by undergraduate researchers, with the goal of using research and discovery to engage and attract first year students to STEM education.  Collectively, these studies have transformative potential for undergraduate students and will develop our understanding and control of the mineralization process.</AbstractNarration>
