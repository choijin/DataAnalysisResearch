<AbstractNarration>This project will develop new computer-based methods to model and predict electricity distribution systems,&lt;br/&gt;so as to do a better job of handling uncertainty, multiple time intervals, and the possibility of greater &lt;br/&gt;penetration of plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and electric cars. PHEV are not expect to cause major problems for the &lt;br/&gt;major transmission grids, but they add major uncertainties and need for more flexibility at the level of &lt;br/&gt;distribution companies. To address that challenge, the PI will combine new work at the distribution level &lt;br/&gt;together with new mathematical methods for coping with uncertainty and random disturbances. She will also &lt;br/&gt;expand her ongoing efforts on behalf of West Virginia's "Vision 2020" strategic plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objective here is to identify stochastic models and develop controls for improving short &lt;br/&gt;term and long term performance of smart distribution systems. One often hears system stress, congestion &lt;br/&gt;and curtailment with volatility in renewable generation and demand. Transitioning to a sustainable energy &lt;br/&gt;future often results in complex and fast aggregated generator and load dynamics, which may lead to &lt;br/&gt;severe impact on distribution systems. This transition has forced power system researchers to pay serious &lt;br/&gt;attention to their time varying characteristics in a stochastic sense. This research has been facilitated by &lt;br/&gt;the advances in stochastic control theory and recent boost in data mining applications. The goal of the &lt;br/&gt;project is to develop a unified framework of stochastic and data driven approaches by which these &lt;br/&gt;variabilities can be identified, not by traditional approaches of modeling and control but by generating &lt;br/&gt;scenarios available from historical data and optimal predictive control design. The main question is &lt;br/&gt;whether massive amount of time series data can be handled by the data driven approaches to capture &lt;br/&gt;volatility and variability of generation and demand. The PI will use knowledge and concepts from &lt;br/&gt;stochastic theory, control theory, data mining, computational intelligence for a non-conservative approach &lt;br/&gt;for smart distribution system optimization and control.</AbstractNarration>
