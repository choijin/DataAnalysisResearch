<AbstractNarration>With the support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Bowling of University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point and Professor Bosch of Missouri State University conduct collaborative research to study the spatial and electronic requirements for intramolecular halogen bonding in solution and the solid state, respectively.  Specially, the research team investigates the ability of pyridine-halogen attractions to serve as surrogates for alkynes in dehydroannulene-type materials and the feasibility of extending this strategy to more complex macromolecular species.  This research aims to develop strategies for incorporating halogen bonding as a tool for conformation control in conjugated molecules.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conjugated organic molecules are important constituents of functional materials in many useful applications.  This research contributes both to increasing our fundamental knowledge and the development of alternative synthetic routes to complex structures with potential applications as functional materials.  In addition, this project provides research opportunities to undergraduate students, preparing them for industrial positions and graduate studies.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Understanding the attractive forces between molecules is&nbsp;a critical step toward the development of next generation electronic materials and the creation of potent drug candidates for fighting current and future diseases. Though many of these attractive forces have been known for decades, direct study of molecular-level interactions is still a significant challenge. Halogen bonding, for instance, is a molecular level attraction that is proving to be a powerful tool in the design of functional materials and strong drug-protein interactions. With this award (1306284), the Principal Investigators and their students have developed a tool for studying halogen bonding and similar molecular attractions directly. One&nbsp;outcome of this research is the demonstrated ability to use specific molecular attractions to predictably arrange&nbsp;electronically useful&nbsp;organic materials&nbsp;into solid materials. The power to organize molecular components of this type is a first step in optimizing device performance in next generation electronics.</p> <p>A second outcome of this research is the study of the strength of different types of halogen bonds under different conditions, including temperature and solvent. This information will be instructive to future researchers who are trying to design novel compounds that have strong attractions to protein active sites. Strong bonding between drug candidates and proteins&nbsp;will likely&nbsp;lead to enhanced therapeutic performance.</p> <p>A third outcome of this project is the education and training of 28 students (mostly undergraduate) from two campuses. These students have received hands-on training in the synthesis and proper handling of novel organic compounds. They have analyzed these new compounds using modern scientific instrumentation, including: an X-ray diffractometer, NMR spectrometers, a UV-vis spectrometer, and a fluorimeter. From this, students have gained insight into how the chemical structures of the molecules they have created relate to molecular tendencies to associate with other molecules or other portions of the same molecule. Students observed these tendencies by monitoring changes in electronic properties, spectroscopic signals or crystal growth preferences. Students have communicated these results to the greater scientific community through&nbsp;six peer-reviewed publications and several scientific presentations. These skills have provided the students a foundation for advancing their scientific careers in chemical industry, graduate school&nbsp;and medicine.</p> <p>This project has also provided a platform for the Primary Investigator to promote science in the community. Examples of this outreach include leading a chromatography exercise for the UWSP "Women in Science Day" and chemical demonstrations for a local 2nd grade class.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/19/2016<br>      Modified by: Nathan&nbsp;Bowling</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1306284/1306284_10246951_1474302993367_FluorescentSamples--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1306284/1306284_10246951_1474302993367_FluorescentSamples--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fluorescent properties of novel molecules"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1306284/1306284_10246951_1474302993367_FluorescentSamples--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fluorescent properties of novel molecules"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The image shows the fluorescent properties of some of the novel organic molecules created in our laboratory.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nathan Bowling</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nathan&nbsp;Bowling</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fluorescent properties of novel molecules</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1306284/1306284_10246951_1474311899667_ACS2015--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1306284/1306284_10246951_1474311899667_ACS2015--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student presenters at Spring ACS 2015"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1306284/1306284_10246951_1474311899667_ACS2015--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student presenters at Spring ACS 2015"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Four students present their research at the spring National American Chemical Society meeting in 2015.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nathan Bowling</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nathan&nbsp;Bowling</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student presenters at Spring ACS 2015</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1306284/1306284_10246951_1474312062061_ACS2016--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1306284/1306284_10246951_1474312062061_ACS2016--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student presenters at Spring ACS 2016"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1306284/1306284_10246951_1474312062061_ACS2016--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student presenters at Spring ACS 2016"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Four students present their research at the spring National American Chemical Society meeting in 2016</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nathan Bowling</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nathan&nbsp;Bowling</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student presenters at Spring ACS 2016</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1306284/1306284_10246951_1474312572186_Demonstrationsfor2ndgradeb--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1306284/1306284_10246951_1474312572186_Demonstrationsfor2ndgradeb--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Demonstrations for 2nd grade class"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1306284/1306284_10246951_1474312572186_Demonstrationsfor2ndgradeb--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Demonstrations for 2nd grade class"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The PI demonstrates properties of matter to a local 2nd grade class.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nathan Bowling</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nathan&nbsp;Bowling</div> <div class="imageTitle">Demonstrations for 2nd grade class</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
