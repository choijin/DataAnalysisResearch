<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the formulation of a data model, and trajectory planning platform and methodology to execute a fully digital 3D, 5-axis machining capability. Research will be performed on methods for utilizing multiple Graphical Processor Units (GPUs), which are readily available, parallel digital processing hardware, in these calculations. The methodology will be implemented in the context of an existing advanced computational framework that has tools for voxelization, variable resolution digital modeling, and parallel computing, integrating the fields of manufacturing and computer science. Experiments involving 5-axis machining will be executed to validate the methodology. Components will be machined and inspected on a coordinate measurement machine to verify that the target geometry has been achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this work will bring classical subtractive manufacturing back into the arsenal of rapid prototyping, providing users of typical CNC machine tools with the ability to rapidly determine if a part can be produced on a specific machine and machine the part. Having such a design and analysis tool will help to reduce the cost, improve the quality and allow rapid deployment of new innovations in components that require machining. This work will contribute to variable resolution digital representations to be employed in next generation digital manufacturing systems. It will also combine state-of-the-art concepts in computing and manufacturing to realize a completely new a cyber-physical approach to manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Historically, the digitization of data has generated significant revolutions in both technology and business propositions. In the 1980&rsquo;s digitizing one dimensional (1D) sound signals enabled the transition from analog recordings (LPs) to CDs. Data compression, data processing and connectivity created a wide variety of markets including the digital music market, and democratized that market. Within a few years after the 1D data digital revolution, lower cost memory, increased processing power and higher capacity and wireless connectivity led the 2D data digital revolution (<em>e.g.</em>, pictures and videos). This research takes the natural next step in this data revolution to 3D data. The basis for this work is the use of voxels, which can be considered small 3D blocks that are used to build a 3D representation of a product, much in the same manner that pixels are 2D squares that can be combined into images.</p> <p>This research formulated a data model, and trajectory planning platform and methodology to execute a fully digital 3D, 5-axis machining capability. The work was performed on Graphical Processor Units (GPUs) platforms that are readily available, parallel digital high performance computing (HPC) hardware designed and produced in the United States. Fundamentally, the intellectual merit of this work is the formulation of the path planning process for complex machine tools into a format that allows digital technology (GPUs) to be leveraged in a parallel fashion. Just as the GPUs drive video screens for high resolution graphics (computer aided design and games), our work utilizes the GPU and voxels models to drive advanced machine tools enabling the production of complex parts such as turbine blades employing a simple and intuitive gaming type interface. This approach enables novice machinists to easily program some of the most complex machine tools presently available on the market, helping to transform makers into manufactures (m2m).</p> <p>The results of this work have been demonstrated on a variety of more classical machine tools (<em>e.g.</em>, lathes and mills). These systems are typically thought of as &ldquo;old school&rdquo; machines when compared to additive manufacturing systems (<em>e.g.</em>, 3D printers). In fact such classical systems are employed to produce the bulk of the metal components used in a most products. These machines produce parts by cutting them out of metal; thus, they represent a <em>subtractive</em> process, as opposed to an <em>additive</em> process where the material is added to the part. This research leverages new voxel based models and HPC to bring subtractive manufacturing closer to the concept of the print button. The print button, in additive manufacturing, is the button that one pushes to print a part. Of course, such a button is a bit of a myth as significant process planning and post processing are necessary even for additive manufacturing. None-the-less, this research has moved us closer to the print button for making components on complex machine tools via subtractive manufacturing. As an example of this, students in a large undergraduate class at Georgia Tech utilized SculptPrint, a voxel based design and manufacturing program, to design components for production on our machine tools. The students used SculptPrint, running on Georgia Tech&rsquo;s cloud servers, augmented with GPU systems from our partner NVidia, receiving near real-time feedback on their designs regarding the producibility of their parts. This allowed them to modify their designs ensuring that the machine tools available to them in our shops could easily and effectively make these parts. To further demonstrate the cloud nature of this work, it was implemented on Amazon Web Services cloud computing platform at low cost.</p> <p>This work enabled parts such as the candle holder and ball joint to be easily designed and fabricated using subtractive manufacturing, even by novice makers, transforming them to manufactures (m2m). These parts are shown in the images accompanying this report, and are highly complex parts that appear to be made with additive manufacturing, but are actually made with subtractive. Furthermore, such parts can be made of any material that is machinable (<em>e.g</em>., steel, titanium, aluminum, etc.) and in typically less time than additive manufacturing. As a demonstration for the class, digital yo-yos were designed and mass produced by the class ME 2110, Creative Decisions and Design, a second year mechanical engineering class at Georgia Tech. Over 80 students participated in the production of the completely digital yo-yo, demonstrating the technology at scale, and fully engaging the students in classical manufacturing processes.</p> <p>More recently, additive systems using voxel model representations have been introduced into the market place. The parallel platform employing HPC for subtractive manufacturing is directly applicable to such additive systems. Such an application will enable a much broader impact of this work as it is applied to hybrid additive / subtractive systems, implemented on low cost and readily available cloud platforms enabling a wide variety of users to access and utilize the capabilities developed in this work.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/23/2017<br>      Modified by: Thomas&nbsp;R&nbsp;Kurfess</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1329742/1329742_10268236_1511392289268_Yoyo_01--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1329742/1329742_10268236_1511392289268_Yoyo_01--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student Leadership Team"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1329742/1329742_10268236_1511392289268_Yoyo_01--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student Leadership Team"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student Leadership Team for Voxel Based Yo-yo Mass Production</div> <div class="imageCredit">Georgia Tech</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Thomas&nbsp;R&nbsp;Kurfess</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student Leadership Team</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1329742/1329742_10268236_1511392372607_Yoyo_02--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1329742/1329742_10268236_1511392372607_Yoyo_02--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Volunteer Undergraduate Student"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1329742/1329742_10268236_1511392372607_Yoyo_02--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Volunteer Undergraduate Student"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Volunteer Undergraduate Student Running Production of Digitally Designed Yo-yo</div> <div class="imageCredit">Georgia Tech</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Thomas&nbsp;R&nbsp;Kurfess</div> <div class="imageTitle">Volunteer Undergraduate Student</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1329742/1329742_10268236_1511392606975_Yoyo_03--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1329742/1329742_10268236_1511392606975_Yoyo_03--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Digital Yo-yos In Process"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1329742/1329742_10268236_1511392606975_Yoyo_03--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Digital Yo-yos In Process"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Yo-yo halves after machining, but before assembly.
