<AbstractNarration>Overview:&lt;br/&gt;This is a conference proposal to support a unique scientific meeting that focuses on the increased use of computational and quantitative to analyze the dynamics of plant cells. The conference combines keynote speakers, oral and poster presentations, and workshops from the keynote speakers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit and objectives of the meeting are to provide an open, inclusive, and interactive forum that provides an effective learning environment for all participants, especially undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. NSF funds are requested to increase the breadth of participation to include many young researchers that have an interest in plant cell biology, students from different backgrounds such as engineering, math, and computer science will be actively recruited. The meeting will include oral presentations, posters, workshop, and time for informal discussions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives are detailed below.&lt;br/&gt;1) To provide a unique forum for scientific exchange for the plant cell biology community in which we provide an open and inclusive forum for oral presentations that allow all labs to share research results. Lead PIs will provide brief 5 minute overviews of each research area to define key knowns as well as important knowledge gaps. Student and post-doc presentations will be geared toward teaching all participants basic methodology as well as data interpretation.&lt;br/&gt;Ample time will be devoted for discussion.&lt;br/&gt;2) To provide an opportunity for a diverse group of participants to present and discuss their results in evening poster sessions. &lt;br/&gt;3) To conduct hands on workshop on fundamentals of growth kinematics (Dr. Wendy Silk,Davis)and multivariate analysis of live cell imaging data (Dr. Luis Vidali,UMass, Worchester). &lt;br/&gt;4) To provide all participants with useful research tools and ideas that will allow them to more broadly integrate math and simulations into their research activities.</AbstractNarration>
