<AbstractNarration>The award supports an American research team from North Dakota State University and senior American scholars to participate in the international conference "XIII Nordic Theoretical Archaeology Group" (Nordic-TAG) to be held in Reykjavik, Iceland on April 21-25, 2013.  Participation in the conference aims to (1) increase international dialogue and collaboration with regards to the archaeological resources of the Arctic region; (2) hold a symposium on the heritage of science and technology in the Arctic; (3) provide learning and professionalization opportunities for members of the PI's North Dakota State University (NDSU) research team; and (4) bring leading American scholars Lynn Meskell and Charles Orser as honored speakers for the conference.   Participation in this year's conference is timely because it represents the first time Nordic-TAG will be held outside Scandinavia, to better incorporate the Nordic communities of the North Atlantic and its neighbors, including the United States.  American scholars who are leaders in the field of archaeology will lend strong US representation. Further, the symposium supported in part by this award, "The Heritage of Science and Technology in the Arctic," directly addresses the history of scientific exploration and international cooperation in the Arctic that continues to this day across many scientific disciplines, including archaeology.</AbstractNarration>
