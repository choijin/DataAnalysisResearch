<AbstractNarration>The Constructive Functions 2014 Conference and School will be a five day event dedicated to constructive function theory and related fields; it will occur May 26-30, 2014, at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.  The conference will focus on orthogonal polynomials, potential theory, discrete and continuous energy problems, special functions, Pad√© approximation, polynomial inequalities, and various problems related to optimization and efficiency.  The plenary speakers will deliver research level talks on topics such as the connection between orthogonal polynomials, operator theory, and random matrices; polynomial approximation and applications to numerical analysis and quadrature; and Riemann Hilbert problems.  Parallel sessions of non-plenary speakers will include many more topics.  Furthermore, the event will include four lectures (the school) aimed at young researchers and designed to provide an introduction to important research topics in constructive function theory.  Topics to be covered are Riemann Hilbert problems for orthogonal and multiple orthogonal polynomials, discrete minimum energy problems, orthogonal polynomials on finite gap sets, and numerical computing with functions and approximation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference and school presents an exceptional opportunity for many researchers in constructive function theory. While a special emphasis will be placed on young researchers during the school portion of this event, the new research presented at the conference will help progress the discipline and foster communication and collaboration between researchers from around the world. An active field of research for more than a hundred years, constructive function theory has found new applications in many areas of science including the modeling of physical processes with random matrices, the modeling of geological phenomena using potential theory, and machine assisted numerical analysis.  The applicability of results in this field is intimately linked to the wide variety of subjects that it includes.  This conference and school aims to be an inclusive event that brings together researchers from all aspects of constructive function theory to share the results of their past research and explore the possibilities for future discovery.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The Constructive Functions 2014 Conference and School brought together mathematicians from 30 countries and included students, beginning researchers, and leaders in the field of constructive function theory.  The five-day event included over one hundred contributed talks, eleven plenary addresses, and four school lectures that provided an advanced introduction to areas of current research in this applicable field.  The applications of constructive function theory to applied science are well-known and include coding theory, geometric tomography, remote sensing, and mathematical physics.  Many of the talks given at the conference spoke directly to these applications and defined the state of the art in the field.   The scholarship and research developments presented at the conference have helped define directions for current and future research.  Indeed, many of the new results presented will be included in either a conference proceedings volume in Contemporary Mathematics or a special dedicated volume of Computational Methods and Function Theory, both of which are in preparation.  Furthermore, the slides from most plenary talks are freely available on the conference website.   A special effort was successfully made to include students and members of underrepresented groups in the conference and school.  The attendees included fourteen students and nineteen women as well as several faculty and undergraduates from Fisk University.
