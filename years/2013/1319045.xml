<AbstractNarration>As the frequency and complexity of cyber attacks increase, approaches to create secure computing environments must look beyond technical barriers that protect from the outside to building a collaborative culture of cyber health from the inside. Use of online incentives have been shown to be an effective tool for enhancing an individual's engagement with a task. This project explores the use of online incentives and social networking to improve an organization's cyber health by coalescing the micro cyber behaviors of individuals within the organization to create a more secure computing environment. Schools represent an ideal setting in which to test such a new model for cybersecurity. Teachers, faculty and parents are motivated to keep students safe and secure. Further, most students today are very technologically savvy, which introduces technology as an ideal means by which to teach students about cyber risks and how to avoid those risks--and to reinforce good cyber behaviors while reducing bad behaviors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project approaches the school as a system in which cybersecurity is improved and maintained through the use of digitally-mediated interventions that combine online psychological incentives for student engagement and social networking to reinforce social and authority figure influences. In short, the project broadly aims to "build cybersecurity in" by engaging multiple stakeholders to help build a more robust public cyber health system. The effectiveness of incentives in building collective cybersecurity awareness and reinforcing positive cyber behaviors is being explored through intervention experiments that are implemented in three student populations: 1) elementary school students who are being exposed to supervised use of digital devices, both in a school environment and at home, for the first time; 2) middle school students who are "experimental" users of digital devices and have limited awareness of cybersecurity concepts; and 3) college students who have been shown to demonstrate risky cyber behaviors that often put them and other university stakeholders at risk.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent success in school-based public health interventions to modify personal health behavior informs the project's approach to building public cyber health. In particular, the well-known Health Belief Model provides a lens for exploring how individuals balance belief in their susceptibility to a cyber threat against their belief in the effectiveness of the proposed mitigating behavior when deciding whether to adopt that behavior. However, there are important differences between public health and cybersecurity. Online incentives, used in public health in particular, have been shown to be most effective in modifying behaviors that individuals already know they should perform and that they already know how to perform. This research will explore whether interventions delivered through digital devices can be successful in both changing an individual's current risky behavior and introducing new safe behaviors, at various ages. To assess the impact of the interventions, throughout the study data will be collected on individuals' cybersecurity knowledge, perceptions and behaviors using surveys and by monitoring intervention experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the novel public cyber health interventions developed in this project will provide benefits that cascade over the long-term to businesses that hire participating students, additional organizations that adopt the intervention techniques, and the broader cyber community. In the near term, this project will directly benefit student participants, as well as teachers and parents, by improving their cybersecurity knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors, thus reducing their risks. Thereafter, the techniques developed will be made widely available for use by other schools and organizations, and as individuals become more secure, the project's impacts have the potential to be further amplified by participants' security behaviors outside of the organizational environment. Further, specific at-risk groups are being targeted in the study?two of the student populations participating provide unique challenges to our research as well as unique rewards if our research is successful. The elementary school population will be drawn from a charter school composed exclusively of minority youth in North Carolina that face significant social, economic, and educational challenges. The middle school partner, located in a rural, economically-challenged eastern North Carolina, is struggling to provide the technical skills that its students need to succeed in the wider global economy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As the pace of cyberattacks increases, approaches to creating secure computing environments must look beyond technical barriers that protect "from outside" to building a collaborative culture of cyber health "from within." This project explores a new behavioral approach&mdash;to improve an organization?s cyber health by coalescing the micro cyber behaviors of individuals within the larger organization through online video games.  Schools represent an ideal setting in which to test such a new model for cybersecurity. Students at all age levels are exploring the boundaries of good behavior in cyberspace.   Steeped in digital technology and social media, older students treat their multi-tasking hand-held gadgets like a body part.  And younger students are being exposed to the use of digital devices for the first time. They are enthusiastic users of digital technologies, and awareness of and conformance with safe cyber behaviors may be outweighed by enthusiasm for the new freedom of socialization made possible by these devices. The challenge is to turn students? embrace of new technology and risky behavior into opportunities that build awareness of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and then to modify behavior so as to reduce those vulnerabilities.   To explore online student behavior UNC?s Center for Digital Enterprise &amp; Innovation built two online experimental platforms&mdash;StarMiner&trade; and Sad Cyber Sam&trade;.  StarMiner&trade; is an online video game that challenges 5th and 6th graders to build and develop their home planet, as well as develop safe trading relations with the other planets in a galactic neighborhood.  StarMiner&trade; bears little resemblance to familiar "educational" games such as computer-based mini-games that offer highly structured learning experiences. Rather, the game is a synthetic blend of simulation, real-time strategy, and tower defense.  Sad Cyber Sam&trade; is an experimental platform for educating undergraduates about their institution?s cyberpolicies and the potential risk of non-conforming behaviors.  This mobile app comprises three video games that can be downloaded to a smart phone (Android and Apple) or iPad.  Each games focuses on a different behavior&mdash;building strong passwords, downloading anti-virus software, and recognizing dangerous emails such as phishing emails and malicious links.   These experimental game platforms enabled us to assess whether "serious" games like StarMiner&trade; and Sad Cyber Sam&trade; can be effective in both building awareness of online risks and changing online behaviors that heighten those risks&mdash;by both reinforcing positive behaviors and modifying negative behaviors.   The research challenge with respect to "immersive" games like StarMiner&trade;  is to demonstrate that behavioral lessons learned within the game can be effective in changing behavior outside the game.  Similarly, for mobile games like Sad Cyber Sam&trade; the challenge is to understand how to embed learning into a game that is appreciated more for fast-paced entertainment than learning.   Our hypothesis is that players of different ages will be more or less aware of different types of risks as a function of their experience with computers and online "cyber smarts."  Armed with an understanding of how students react in different risky situations, institutions can strategically craft strategies for protecting their information systems.  Reactive behaviors describe how students "react" to emails from known and unknown persons or to other digital communications (c.f. Facebook, Twitter, etc.) that may be "phishing" for personal information or contain suspicious links that take the students to websites that could launch harmful code.   Protective behaviors "protect" student devices from outside harm and include behaviors such as using strong passwords to prevent unauthorized access, installing critical patches for operating systems, and updating antivirus software.  Projective behaviors, such as posting on Facebook, are those behaviors where the student "projects" potentially dangerous or embarrassing information about him/herself or others online such as sharing personal or financial information&mdash;or embarrassing personal images.  After engaging in online gameplay, especially immersive game play, students significantly improved their awareness of both online risks and how to respond when confronted with real-life risky situations.   In fact, students demonstrated they were capable of extrapolating lessons learned in an online intergalactic simulation environment to real-life situations on the Internet&mdash;and this was confirmed in post-game interviews with the students.  Students also performed better with respect to certain behaviors. Students demonstrated increased awareness and understanding of "best" behaviors when confronted with phishing emails or emails with malicious links (reactive behaviors), as well as "best" behaviors for protecting devices through passwords and anti-virus software (defensive behaviors).  Only projective (i.e. social media) behaviors showed no increase in performance after playing the game.  However, students pre-game awareness of the dangers of social media were significantly higher to begin with&mdash;suggesting that the heightened media focus on these dangers has already had an influence on this generation of students.   At the same time, our experiments suggest that educational institutions could be a lot more to educate their students are proper email behaviors and how to best protect their devices&mdash;and the institution?s computer networks&mdash;from harm.
