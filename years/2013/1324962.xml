<AbstractNarration>This Pathways project from the Ocean Discovery Institute (ODI) seeks to develop and pilot a program model designed to fill an identified gap in citizen science research and practice literature: how to effectively engage and better understand how to foster participation among people from under-represented groups in citizen science research. The ODI model is designed around six principles: (1) leaders who are reflective of the community, (2) science that is locally relevant, (3) guided, as opposed to self-guided, experiences, (4) direct interactions with scientists, (5) progressively increasing responsibilities for participants who express interest, and (6) removing barriers to participation, such as transportation, language, family involvement and access to technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses environmentally degraded, crime-ridden local canyons, a locally relevant STEM-related issue, and leverages the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project's (SCCWRP) regional citizen science effort focused on identifying the sources and pathways of trash through regional watersheds. The scientific research components of the project focus on four canyons in the area, employing sampling methods developed by SCCWRP. Youth who are part of other ODI programs and who have demonstrated leadership and interest in science, work with the project team to scaffold family and youth participation in project activities taking place during afterschool and weekend time. Based on continued participation in the project, community participants can become more involved in the project, starting as "new scientists" and moving through "returning scientists" to "expert scientists" roles. The project evaluation seeks to identify the role and importance of the components of the proposed model with respect to participation, retention, and learning by participants from groups under-represented in STEM. The dissemination products of this Pathways project include a white paper describing the model and lessons learned as well as presentations to community groups and education and citizen science practitioners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on insights from the iterative approach to the model during this Pathways study, a subsequent full-scale development project would seek to engage citizen science projects around the nation in adapting the model to increase participation of individuals from groups underrepresented in STEM, including building out ODI's citizen science programming.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Pathways Project: Developing a Citizen Science Program Model to Engage Underrepresented Minority Groups  The goals of this project were to test a new model for citizen science focused on engaging underrepresented minorities (URMs) in science in their local communities.  Individuals of all ages and backgrounds in one urban, high-poverty, ethnically diverse community in Southern California were recruited to participate in a community-based citizen science study based on the new model. The topic of the citizen science study was to identify how much and what types of trash were found in the local watershed (canyons) within the community and to understand how the trash traveled through the watershed (canyons), a topic of interest within the community.  This citizen science study engaged 215 unique individuals. Of these, 198 met the minimum age requirements and agreed to participate in an exploratory research study to test the effects of the citizen science model on individuals? participation and retention in the citizen science study and their learning of STEM principles through the citizen science study.   Based on data from the exploratory study, the model was successful at increasing participation in citizen science by URMs from the target community. Approximately 70% of participants in the exploratory study were from the target community, and the races and ethnicities of participants across the study were similar to those in the target community as a whole. The model was also successful at engaging females and young people. Two-thirds of participants in the exploratory study were female; nearly half were under the age of eighteen.  The model was somewhat successful at creating retention in the citizen science study. Approximately one-fifth of the participants returned for two or more sessions, with the majority of these individuals from the target community.  On average, participants did not demonstrate increased understanding that water flows to the mouth of a watershed after participating in the citizen science study. Additionally, the majority of those interviewed reported learning about trash in the canyon and/or human impacts on animals or the environment but not scientific processes or methods. The topics for which there were the largest increases in reported interest after participation in the citizen science study related to the focus of the citizen science experience, but through a conservation or stewardship lens rather than a science lens. Analysis of interview and field data suggested several possible explanations for these findings including participants? ideas about science and interactions during the fieldwork.     Intellectual Merit  This project added to the understanding of how to engage and retain URMs in citizen science projects.  It confirmed that a model that includes 1) hands-on, authentic science, 2) work alongside a scientist, 3) opportunities for repeated and ongoing participation, 4) science that is relevant to the participants? daily lives, 5) leaders who are reflective of the community, 6) experiences that are guided as opposed to self-guided, and 7) a program design that removes unique barriers faced by URMs such as transportation can be successful in engaging URMs in locally-based citizen science activities.  The project provided additional evidence that having project leaders who are reflective of the community may influence who participates, provided evidence for the importance of marketing culturally-unfamiliar activities through informal channels rather than through organized groups and institutions, and revealed the importance of understanding where a full community stands in relation to engagement with science before attempting to increase understanding of scientific concepts.        Broader Impacts  This project engaged multiple individuals in scientific activity and training and made contributions to the scientific community, informal/citizen science community, education community, and the public sector at the local, regional, and national level.  Locally, the project successfully engaged 215 individuals of varied races, ethnicities, ages, and genders, including a high proportion of URMs, in community-based citizen science. In addition, four high school URM students from the target community received mentoring and served as project leaders for the citizen science study, one high school student and one undergraduate student served as research fellows on the project, three undergraduate students served as research interns on the project, one post-college individual served as a research assistant on the project, and one post-college Americorps fellow received mentoring and took a leadership role on the project.  In addition to academic publication, findings from the exploratory study on engaging URMs in citizen science were disseminated locally through presentations to study participants and community groups, regionally through presentations at meetings of science educators, and nationally through presentations at conferences of the citizen science and environmental education communities.  Scientific findings from the citizen science study were disseminated locally through presentations to study participants and community groups, including presentations to City officials, and regionally/statewide through presentations at conferences and meetings of members of the ecology and conservation communities. Scientific data collected through the project were shared with the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP).
