<AbstractNarration>The researcher seeks to develop a network of annually resolved, multi-century tree-ring records in tropical southern Africa in order to examine regional hydroclimatic variability. The research aims to explore whether a network of new tree-ring records from southern Africa can provide unique paleo-proxy data to help address a variety of questions about hydroclimatic variability, its causes, and impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary broader impacts involve collecting data from a poorly sampled region with potentially important insights into climate, supporting a U.S. graduate student, and helping build strong scientific ties with African scientists and students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research goal of this project was to collect new tree-ring records from southern Africa with the goal of providing information about climate (especially drought) before the period of instrumental observations. This new information should help address a variety of questions about climatic variability and its causes and impacts, in the region.  In addition to providing research and training experience for undergraduate and graduate students, the support provided to this project contributed to the professional research development of an early career scientist, and helped strengthen collaborative relationships between the principle investigator and researchers at several academic, and governmental institutions in southern Africa.  Results of this project include the development of several new tree-ring chronologies in southern Africa, including chronologies from several tropical tree species not previously used in tree-ring research as well as reconstructions of regional climate and forest productivity.  In addition to the important new research results, the scientific training of four undergraduate and four graduate students was supported by this project. Each of these students have continued their research careers in tree-ring research or allied areas.  Publications and presentations that resulted from this project include:  Remane, I. and M.D. Therrell. 2014. Growth Dynamics of Millettia stuhlmannii in Mozambique. (in prep.).   McLeran, K., M.
