<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will leverage the advances we&lt;br/&gt;made in fabricating flexible polymer surfaces that shed water at low tilt angles while remaining&lt;br/&gt;superhydrophobic after abrasion. In Phase I we developed a model which correlated surface&lt;br/&gt;morphology with mechanical robustness. In Phase II we will apply this model to the&lt;br/&gt;development of a processes compatible with high speed, large-scale fabrication techniques.&lt;br/&gt;The roofing industry seeks material that is self-cleaning, anti-fouling and is highly resistant to&lt;br/&gt;weather events over time. A durable, superhydrophobic polymeric roof membrane will meet&lt;br/&gt;this market need. Commercial success depends on (1) qualifying production speeds up to 100&lt;br/&gt;feet/min, (2) proving compliance to current product requirements and (3) showing value-add.&lt;br/&gt;Phase II studies will elucidate the mechanisms that contribute to the stability of the surfaces&lt;br/&gt;when exposed to UV light, allowing us to improve weatherability. Having demonstrated the&lt;br/&gt;self-cleaning properties of our polymer surfaces in Phase I, we will focus on anti-fouling&lt;br/&gt;properties in Phase II (i.e. low bacterial adhesion and reduced algae growth.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project will be twofold. Foremost, a direct impact will&lt;br/&gt;be revenue and job growth in the US manufacturing sector. Secondarily, the technology will&lt;br/&gt;support federal policy goals on energy and the environment. Approximately $40 billion is spent&lt;br/&gt;annually in the US to air condition buildings. DOE funded studies show that in warm climates,&lt;br/&gt;substituting a cool roof for a conventional roof can reduce carbon emissions which drive&lt;br/&gt;climate change. Cool roofs also relieve strain on the electrical grid by reducing peak power&lt;br/&gt;demand. Widespread use of cool roofs can improve air quality, hence human health, by&lt;br/&gt;slowing the formation of smog. Superhydrophobic polymer membranes fabricated using&lt;br/&gt;technology developed in this proposal will help keep roofs clean and better able to reflect heat.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, coating of outdoor infrastructure equipment, such as wind turbine blades and offshore&lt;br/&gt;energy exploration platforms, will enable the safe operation of such facilities during icing&lt;br/&gt;conditions due to the ability of the superhydrophobic surface to prevent ice accretion. Field&lt;br/&gt;tests are underway. Food handling equipment will benefit from reduced adhesion of bacteria &lt;br/&gt;to surfaces, thus improving food safety.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ ARL Designs LLC (ARLD) successfully achieved its main goal of demonstrating the economical production of robust superhydrophobic polymer coatings in large volumes and at low costs.   The control of the roughness of a surface was shown to strongly affect the interactions between water and the solid.  Based on the research conducted during this project, a multi-level hierarchical roughness was designed that minimized liquid-solid interactions, such that water forms nearly spherical droplets on the surface that easily roll-off at low tilt angles.  Such mobile droplets are highly effective at carrying away dirt particles, thus leaving the surface clean.  In addition, the hierarchical roughness was designed with length scales up to 100?s of microns, thereby creating a surface that is also highly resistant to abrasion.  Processes were developed to form this hierarchical roughness into a variety of thermoplastic polymers using commercially available equipment that is widely used in the polymer processing industry.   Moreover, the processes that were developed during this project eliminated the use of solvents, thereby further reducing costs as well as minimizing the environmental impact of the manufacturing process. Research and development efforts conducted during this project ultimately led to the production of continuous rolls of polymer substrates with superhydrophobic surfaces.      ARLD initially targeted the high reflectivity roofing membrane market for commercial buildings.  Approximately $40 billion is spent annually in the US to air condition buildings. DOE funded studies show that in warm climates, substituting a highly reflective roof (also called a "cool roof") for a conventional roof can lower energy usage and so reduce carbon emissions which drive climate change. Cool roofs also relieve strain on the electrical grid by reducing peak power demand. Widespread use of cool roofs can improve air quality, hence human health, by slowing the formation of smog. Superhydrophobic polymer membranes fabricated using technology developed in this proposal are anti-soiling and so are designed to keep roofs clean and reflective, making them ideally suitable for cool roofing.  Other applications for this technology include superhydrophobic dielectric insulators as well as anti-icing coatings for electrical distribution and transmission cables.     During the course of the project, ARLD identified a new technology that could produce robust superhydrophobic coatings that are also optically transparent.  Once again, the research conducted demonstrated that producing a hierarchical roughness results in the creation of a surface that is non-wetting, i.e. a superhydrophobic surface on which droplets of water easily roll off the surface.  By reducing the length-scale of the roughness from hundreds of microns to tens of nanometers, the optical properties of the surface were dramatically changed from one that effectively scatters visible light (thereby making the surface appear white) to one that is completely transparent to visible light.  Moreover, the hierarchical roughness creates a graded index of refraction; the index of the material gradually increases from the value of air to the value of the bulk polymer as the surface features merge from nano-fibrils (&lt;150 nm in length) into a continuous polymer coating.  Because of this gradual change in optical properties, more light is transmitted through the coated substrate and less light is reflected away.     ARLD recognized that a transparent superhydrophobic coating, using a low surface energy polymer, could provide the anti-reflective, anti-soiling and anti-icing properties that are needed to increase the electrical output of solar photo-voltaic (PV) panels.  To reduce losses, anti-reflection (AR) coatings are now used on the exterior glass surfaces. However, soiling remains a challenge, especially as large PV arrays are deployed in climates where dust or snow reduces output and/or requires money to be spent on cleaning. In the US, the cost of soiling is estimated at $0.01/kWhr; with PV revenues at $0.10/kWhr, soiling reduces revenues by ~10%.  ARLD conducted research into materials and processes for forming nano-scale superhydrophobic polymers and developed a new coating called KleanBoost&trade;.  This coating reduces reflections from the outer glass surface by 75% at all incident angles and wavelengths.  Moreover, ARLD demonstrated that the coating resists the accumulation of dirt; any remaining dirt can be completely removed with a minimal amount of water.  Field tests and laboratory evaluations are underway at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and commercially PV module manufacturers.
