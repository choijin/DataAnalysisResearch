<AbstractNarration>Abstract:  The PI will use "big data" to measure important economic variables in a unique way.  The project uses a data set drawn from government administrative records; the data include over 30 years of annual earnings for a sample of millions of American men.  With these data, the PI will be able to measure the year-to-year risk of changes in annual earned income.  In particular, he will be able to determine whether or not common assumptions used in other economic models (for example, that the risk of an income shock is normally distributed) are correct.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is potentially transformative research; the PI is making innovative use of existing data and his results could overturn the conventional understanding of how business cycles, industry-specific factors, occupation, and skill set determine the risk of large year-to-year changes in income.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will be broadly useful as well for economic policy.  To understand how recessions affect American families, we need to understand how recessions affect earnings.  Our current evidence here is based on small samples of the US population, and the data from these samples are not rich enough to answer the full range of questions.</AbstractNarration>

To address these questions, we used administrative and survey-based panel data sets from the United States, Germany, and Sweden -- three countries that differ greatly in their social and labor market institutions. We found that income risk varies significantly from expansions to recessions (which is different from incomes falling <em>on average</em> in recessions). In particular, larger negative shocks are more likely and larger positive shocks less likely in recessions, whereas middling shocks do not change much. We also found that households do not significantly mitigate income risk experienced by each spouse and the effectiveness of government programs range widely. In particular, many government policies reduce income risk on average but do not do so differentially in expansions versus recessions. As a result, the risk measured by disposable income (after taxes and transfers) rises significantly in recessions.<br /><br />The third subproject showed that wealth taxes (where taxes are levied on the stock of capital) have major benefits relative to capital income taxes (where the income flow from capital is taxed). The main difference between the two is that a wealth tax creates a "use-it-or-lose-it" effect: Wealthy individuals who are not good investors see their wealth gradually decline due to taxes while at the same time those (both wealthy and not) who are good investors pay lower taxes on their investment and see their wealth grow. As a result, wealth is allocated more efficiently across the economy, leading to a rise in production and welfare. This is in contrast to capital income taxes that falls on the most productive investors and spares the least productive ones, creating a larger distortion. We find that switching from the current US system of capital income taxation to our proposed wealth tax system can improve welfare by 7-10% of consumption at every date and state for the average consumer in the economy.
