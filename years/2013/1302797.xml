<AbstractNarration>Forest systems contain approximately half of the carbon held on the planet. Much of this forest carbon is locked up in woody stems either in living plants or as dead wood fallen on the ground. The rate that carbon is released from wood back into the atmosphere has large implications for global climate change. Climate also influences both decomposition rates of wood and forest tree mortality. Variation in how wood is chemically and physically constructed by trees regulates each of these relationships. This project is part of a long-term career goal to determine the influence of plant anatomy, chemistry, and functional traits, e.g., density of wood, height of trees, on rates of wood decomposition.  This project focuses on temperate forests of the Ozark Highlands, MO, USA, one of the largest forested ecosystems between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The project is developed around three interrelated themes.  Variation in tree traits will be related to variation in decomposition rates, this variation will be linked to changes in the fungal community (the predominant cause of wood decomposition and thus carbon release from wood), and variation in decomposition rates will be scaled up to variation in carbon release across the landscape. The three themes will be linked together to explore possible management implications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Missouri - St. Louis, which has a predominantly metropolitan student body, lacks any field courses in its undergraduate biology curriculum.  As part of this project researchers will develop an undergraduate research course, focusing on the diversity of ecological interactions among plants, fungi, insects and other taxa, and human impacts on these taxa.  This course will have field and laboratory components and will bring students into contact with local naturalists and the biodiversity of the region.</AbstractNarration>

Climate also influences both decomposition rates of wood and forest tree mortality. The wood traits (how plants are chemically and physically constructed) regulate each of these relationships. In this project, we examined the influence of plant anatomy (microscopic construction), chemistry, and functional traits (macroscopic construction, e.g., density of wood, height of plants) on rates of wood decomposition. It took place in temperate forests of the Ozark Highlands, MO, USA, one of the largest forested ecosystems between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The project was developed around three interrelated themes. Variation in plant traits will be related to variation in decomposition rates (1), this variation can be linked to changes in the fungal community (the predominant cause of wood decomposition and thus carbon release from wood) (2), and variation in decomposition rates can be scaled up to variation in carbon release across the landscape (3). For Intellectual Merit, under theme (1), we found that wood species and wood traits were better predictors of wood decay than were local environment or position effects. Wood chemistry, especially carbon and lignin content, as well as in some cases wood density were the strongest predictors of decay although the strength of wood traits in predicting decay appeared to decrease through time. Under theme (2), we found that wood species and wood traits especially chemistry were again better predictors of fungal and bacterial communities although fungi were more strongly predicted by wood traits than bacteria. The importance of wood traits again appears to decline through time in predicting microbial communities. Additionally, biotic interactions between bacteria and fungi were less important than the wood traits for both communities. Under theme (3), for naturally recruited snags in Eastern USA and deadwood and snags in MO, the wood trait durability is an especially strong predictor of treefall. Greenhouse gas concentrations including CO2 and CH4&nbsp; accumulated in deadwood, especially when it was buried and at early stages of decay although it also accumulated in suspended deadwood. To date, we have published 10 manuscripts and 1 database from the grant. For Broader Impacts, University of Missouri - St. Louis and George Washington University have predominantly metropolitan student bodies. Students have lacked field course in biology. I developed an undergraduate research course, focusing on diversity of interactions between plants, fungi, insects and other taxa, and human impacts on these taxa.

In addition, this grant trained in the lab 2 postdoctoral scholars, 2 graduate students, 3 technicians (recent graduates), 12 undergraduates, a recent undergraduate volunteer, and a high school student. We have made our data publicly available and have worked with USDA Forest Service employees in communicating our research findings.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/10/2018<br>      Modified by: Amy&nbsp;E&nbsp;Zanne</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1302797/1302797_10072853_1523394874695_2014-06-0208.43.57--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1302797/1302797_10072853_1523394874695_2014-06-0208.43.57--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Rot plot: Year 5"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1302797/1302797_10072853_1523394874695_2014-06-0208.43.57--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Rot plot: Year 5"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Wood pieces in this plot has been rotting for 3 and 5 years.
