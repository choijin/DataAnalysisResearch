<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Computing Research Infrastructure (CRI) grant has developed and now supports an enduring capability at the University of South Alabama (USA), within its School of Computing, to further research, education, training, and recruiting for information assurance (IA) and cybersecurity. It provides infrastructure to support advanced research in program protection and exploitation and provides the necessary tools to support new opportunities for education including an undergraduate Cyber Assurance curriculum and hands-on learning support for K-12 STEM outreach. This new capability directly supports the goals of the Center for Forensics, Information Technology, Security (CFITS), which fosters IA research with faculty and students, develops industry partnerships, and supports K-12 outreach through a Mobile, AL regional partner school program. Through the CRI, four lab facilities in the state-of-the-art Shelby Hall building on the USA campus have been outfitted with over 40 research-class workstations, equipment for live malware experiments, specialized hardware for reprogrammable hardware synthesis, instrumentation for cybersecurity data collection, software for a wide range of program analysis and security evaluation, and a fully developed testbed for training in cyber defense competitions and capture the flag events.</p> <p>In terms of curriculum, the infrastructure has provided support for over 140 students in ten offerings of seven courses with cybersecurity and computer science focus.&nbsp; It has enabled 30 student course projects in secure software engineering, new special topics courses that teach students how to protect software from malicious attack, and provides support for directed studies and senior project teams focusing on software and hardware assurance. In terms of training, the infrastructure has provided equipment and resources to directly support a new DayZero Cyber Competition Club student group on the campus which has participated in 6 competitions including the Southeast Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (SECCDC), the CSAW Capture the Flag event, and the NSA Codebreaker challenge. The club trains over 15 members in software security, ethical hacking, and network defense on a regular basis and has conducted outreach events during the Cyber Security Awareness Month. The CRI resources have also supported over 1000 K-12 students who participated in the CFITS partner school program with visits to the USA campus to participate in hands-on-learning activities.</p> <p>Research in the School of Computing has increased considerably in both amount and quality as a result of new CRI capabilities. As a Research at Undergraduate Institution (RUI), USA fosters and encourages involvement of undergraduate students as a primary focus: the CRI supported 20 undergraduate research projects in total and of those, 8 students went on to pursue an advanced degree in the School of Computing. In addition, the CRI directly funded one Master's student graduate assistant and the lab facilities and instrumentation provided computing resources for 15 other Master's and Doctoral students. The infrastructure has directly contributed to completion of 5 Master's theses and currently supports ongoing progress of 1 Undergraduate honor's thesis, 11 Master's theses, and 4 Doctoral dissertations. Student topics have included formal methods for internet-based voting protocol verification, SCADA security, moving target defense, healthcare information and medical device vulnerability assessment, steganography, ZigBee network security, FPGA program partitioning for security, anomaly detection for zero-day rootkit detection, active cyber defense, automotive security of cyber physical systems, program protection using homomorphic encryption, evaluation of commercial product obfuscation strength, attacks on virtualized software protection, additive layer manufacturing, secure software enginee...]]></DRECONTENT>
