<AbstractNarration>This research assesses poaching risks associated with endangered wildlife, examines stakeholder perceptions of risk, and measures situational factors associated with poaching-related crimes. Wildlife poaching is a global risk that threatens biological, ecological, economic, sociocultural and security systems. The situation of African rhinoceroses and the communities and countries that manage them provide an appropriate context to study the poaching of endangered wildllife. The rhinoceroses and the places that manage them are facing increases in the risks from the recent upsurge in poaching. In Namibia the rural economy is heavily tied to wildlife resources through hunting for subsistence and trophy purposes, as well as ecotourism. Rhinoceros poaching translates into significant stolen benefits and decreased security for rural communities. This research merges theory from risk and decision sciences, criminology, and natural resource management to generate novel understandings about managing this global environmental risk. The objectives of this research are to: (1) develop, test and validate an integrated model of wildlife-related risk perception, and (2) evaluate the situational crime prevention approach as a tool to manage wildlife poaching risks. The researcher collects from individual surveys, existing enforcement data, focus groups within management units (e.g., community-based management areas, private reserves, national parks), and with wildlife stakeholders (e.g., ecotourism operators, professional hunters) and enforcement professionals (e.g., police officers, traditional authorities).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Results have broad theoretical, methodological, and practical implications for understanding and managing environmental crimes and risks. Implications extend beyond the case of wildlife poaching to other global environmental risks such as illegal fishing or logging. First, the study provides an empirical test of methods and theories in risk and decision sciences, natural resource management, and criminology outside the typical western, developed-country context. Second, the knowledge that emerges from this research will provide pragmatic, theory-based analysis of situational factors affecting environmental crimes. Understanding these factors is key for tailoring a suit of risk management responses that most effectively reduce the conditions that facilitate poaching activities. Lastly, this research generates new methodological and theoretical tools that can be used by researchers and practitioners to study poaching of other species in different contexts.</AbstractNarration>

This research contributed new insight to help fill the gap using the case of wildlife poaching Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (BBSNP) in the southern province of Lampung, Sumatra Indonesia. We tested the application of theories and methods from mainstream criminology and risk and decision sciences in BBSNP, part of a 2.5 million hectare United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization Tropical Rainforest Heritage Site, to determine their potential to prevent poaching of 3 high profile endangered species including Sumatran elephant, Sumatran rhino and the Sumatran tiger. In May 2015, a three-day focus group was conducted where 27 participants from 10 community, governmental and non-governmental organizations completed a series of crime prevention activities aimed at reduce poaching activities in the park. The novel set of risk-based activities included species vulnerability assessments, concept mapping of poacher typologies, describing tools in the 6 categories of crime prevention, and risk mapping the crime prevention strategies in the park. These activities aimed to increase the capacity of diverse stakeholders to think about, anticipate and respond to poaching activities in the park. Results will help conservationists on the ground move toward poaching prevention, rather than merely detection, in the park. For example, participants described 56 different strategies to reduce poaching and more than half where hypothesized to reduce poaching opportunities for all protected species. Such a large list of potential preventative actions, some undoubtedly more feasible and effective than others, allows conservationists to consider a combination of approaches for protecting different species in different social and environmental contexts. Focus group participants mapped poaching risks, interactions between people and wildlife, and strategies of crime prevention for Sumatran rhinoceroses in the entire park, and for Sumatran elephants and Sumatran tigers in the Intensive Protection Zone (IPZ) of the park. Through these mapping activities participants were able to identify priority areas in the park where new strategies are needed to prevent poaching activities. The large maps created were left with organizations on the ground for future planning and training purposes. The training materials associated with the poaching prevention activities were translated into Indonesian and left with participants and organizations in hard and digital form and in conjunction with the focus group experience give participants the capacity to replicate activities as local situations necessitate. Concomitant to the focus groups, 400 interviews were conducted in 10 villages around the IPZ. Interviews focused on understanding local residents&rsquo; perception of crime seriousness, poaching risks, species conservation, and the likelihood and appropriateness of individuals intervening to prevent poaching. Interview analysis is ongoing, results are expected to increase understanding of how serious local residents think poaching risks are in the park, what factors (e.g., wildlife value orientations) affect their perceptions of poaching risks, and their willingness to act as a wildlife guardian.
