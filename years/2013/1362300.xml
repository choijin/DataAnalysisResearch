<AbstractNarration>This project will support 25 students to attend the IEEE International Parallel &amp; Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS'14) conference in Phoenix. This is a premier international conference in parallel and distributed computing. This will help students develop their technical strength and engage more closely in the parallel and distributed computing community.  The workshop will increase the likelihood of these students staying in the research community, and will thus lead to a more talented and more productive research workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IPDPS 2014 student program will provide a comprehensive venue to better prepare students for research and career paths in parallel and distributed computing. Participating students will have the opportunity to both present their research and interact with senior academic and industry people in an informal setting. In addition, mentoring sessions will be organized to help students improve communication skills, obtain valuable information for career planning, get familiar current research topics, and make valuable contacts, as well as participating in the IPDPS main conference and associated workshops.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The IPDPS Conference provided student travel grants to encourage participation by students where they can explore opportunities for technical growth and broader engagement with the community at large.  "IPDPS is an international forum for engineers and scientists from around the world to present their latest research findings in all aspects of parallel computation. In addition to technical sessions of submitted paper presentations, the meeting offers workshops, tutorials, and commercial presentations &amp; exhibits.

Now, more than ever, we prize this annual meeting as a testament to the strength of international cooperation in seeking to apply computer science technology to the betterment of our global village."  Awards were in the form of reimbursement post conference participation. The PIs decided to support all student applicants (albeit at a lower level) who applied by the deadline resulting in 52 students supported through NSF funds.
