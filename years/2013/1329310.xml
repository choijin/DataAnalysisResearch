<AbstractNarration>Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STS study in technology and policy will examine conditions that favor enhanced or reduced bipartisanship on bills concerning energy diversification and improvements in efficiency. The project will make use of newly available state government databases on bills and laws to track votes of individual legislators to perform quantitative analysis, which will be complemented by ethnographic interviews with the staff of state legislators who are highly involved in energy legislation. The project will contribute to technology studies and the technology policy side of interdisciplinary STS inquiry, specifically the body of research on transitions of large technological systems that focuses on sustainability transitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project breaks new methodological ground by using newly available state government databases; previous research has used only the vote of the whole legislature. At a theoretical level, the project will integrate research on transitions, which tends to have a strong management and policy orientation, with work in political sociology. That is to say, it will bring a political sociological approach to the study of the transitions of large technological systems, and likewise it will bring technology studies theory into the political sociology of science. Thus, the project will make substantial and rather broad theoretical and methodological contributions to the literature on energy transitions and the science and technology studies of large technological systems. It will also contribute knowledge to a practical and important policy problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the broader goals of the project is to affect policy by informing state legislators, and possibly Congress, about the types of energy laws that are most and least likely to achieve bipartisan support. The results of this project should be valuable to legislators across partisan divisions and with widely divergent views about optimal energy futures, and the material will also be publicly available for use in energy and technology policy courses. The project will have two publication components. A web site will be created that provides the first detailed analysis of votes on energy legislation by political party affiliation in state legislatures. A policy brief will be made publicly available; it will include summary statistics of votes by law name, description and type of legislation, and party affiliation, as well as an analysis of law types that tend to produce higher levels of bipartisanship based on the quantitative and qualitative analysis. State legislative offices will be contacted by email when the brief is available, and there will be a press release as well.</AbstractNarration>

For the graduate student training, a summer seminar was held at Vanderbilt University for students selected from a pool of applicants at the PhD level who were at the pre-dissertation stage and who did not have full access to these areas of expertise in their universities.

Rather than study a general category such as energy policy or even a subcategory such as renewable-energy and energy-efficiency (REEE) policy, we bring draw on the rich body of work in STS on the social meanings of technology design by breaking down the field of REEE into many constituent technologies and policies. We then develop a methodology for linking these detailed policy types (e.g., a tax credit for rooftop solar) to specific frames attached to an associated bill (e.g., reduce taxes) that in turn have ideological valences (small government). Using this method, we can examine clearly the political valences of technologies and associated policy formulations, and we can explain relative rates of success and failure. For example, we can explain why a solar energy carve-out of a renewable portfolio standard is controversial, but a law to reduce government regulations (&ldquo;red tape&rdquo;) for businesses and homes that want to have rooftop solar is more likely to succeed.

First, we show how it is important to pay attention to different REEE technologies, such as solar versus other renewable energies, or technologies that affect power plants versus buildings. Second, we show that the technology itself is not enough; the legislation must also be configured in ways that reduces political conflict. For example, whereas building efficiency standards for private-sector buildings may be seen as unwanted government intrusion into markets, when configured as support for business development (such as in property-assessed clean energy policies), it is possible to achieve greater support for the same types of energy-efficiency technology, including crucial support from the private sector. Thus, it is important to pay attention not only to the technology but also to the ideological valences connected with the policy formulation that supports it. Furthermore, we use quantitative analysis to show that the following characteristics of a bill will tend to increase support: reduce government regulations for REEE projects, reduce taxes by providing tax credits for REEE projects, reduce government spending by providing guidelines for energy efficiency for government buildings, and provide consumer and business choices (such as by enabling REEE improvements to buildings). Conversely, bills configured as government mandates or that increase the size of government, such as by creating government commissions, will tend to lose broad support. Third, we identify process strategies that have been associated with higher levels of bipartisan support, such as having a pre-legislative stakeholder process, finding support from business communities that benefit from the REEE policies, and shifting some issues from the legislative process to the public utilities commission. Although these three sets of strategies will not solve the problem of gridlock and partisan conflict on this issue, they provide indications of important factors that have practical policy implications, and they provide practical guidelines to legislators and advocates who wish to build bipartisan consensus.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/13/2016<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;Hess</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
