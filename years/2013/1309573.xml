<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to establish the fundamental underpinnings&lt;br/&gt;of low probability of detection (LPD) communication systems operating over&lt;br/&gt;classical or quantum mechanical channels.  This provides a transformative&lt;br/&gt;impact in two ways:  (1) establishing a new approach that transforms the&lt;br/&gt;largely dormant (and socially compelling) area of LPD communications;&lt;br/&gt;(2) introducing and developing the foundations of the LPD optical channel,&lt;br/&gt;which requires quantum mechanical considerations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is based on a fundamental approach to the LPD&lt;br/&gt;communications problem that employs a broad array of tools to establish&lt;br/&gt;a new branch in the large field of wireless communications security.&lt;br/&gt;This project will also demonstrate the intellectual richness of the&lt;br/&gt;security problem that arises when quantum mechanical considerations&lt;br/&gt;are considered in optical communications.  Tools from classical&lt;br/&gt;communications and networks, in particular information theory, mix&lt;br/&gt;with tools from quantum information systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are focused on impacting society and education.&lt;br/&gt;The hiding of the existence of transmissions while still communicating&lt;br/&gt;reliably has clear application in both military and civilian societal&lt;br/&gt;contexts.  The results of this project will allow communicating parties&lt;br/&gt;and those whom attempt to detect them to understand the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;limits on such communication and techniques to achieve those limits.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the project includes an integrated program of educational&lt;br/&gt;engagement that utilizes the extensive resources of both UMass-Amherst&lt;br/&gt;and BBN, with the latter contributing both theoretical expertise&lt;br/&gt;and experimental facilities for quantum information processing&lt;br/&gt;that will provide a unique opportunity for UMass students.</AbstractNarration>
