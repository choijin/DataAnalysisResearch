<AbstractNarration>The project entails the deployment of a two-dimensional (2D) array of GPS scintillation receivers in Calgary Alberta. The deployment of a large number of GPS scintillation receivers over a 2 km region will allow for the investigation of the temporal evolution of the 2D spatial distribution of observed amplitude and phase scintillations.  The 2D time-evolving observations of GPS scintillations will be combined with comprehensive theoretical-numerical 3D forward propagation of electro-magnetic waves through random media, and inverse diffraction tomography techniques to provide quantitative linkage between the observations and analysis of the ground array, and the underlying physics and structuring of the ionospheric irregularities causing the scintillation observations.  Furthermore, data assimilative techniques will be used to estimate large scale gradients in electron density, winds and fields, and compared with the scintillation results and auroral imaging to investigate to what degree knowledge of the large scale background ionosphere improves our understanding of smaller scale structuring.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The objective of this project was to study and better understand "turbulent" structures in the ionosphere.   The ionosphere is the region of Earth's space, where satellites orbit and the space shuttle flies.  We call it the "ionosphere" because the Sun's energy knocks electrons off of atoms, making the region charged.  The ionosphere can be understood as being similar to the atmosphere and air at the surface of the earth, only with electrical currents moving through it.    The turbulent structures we study are similar to what hurricanes and typhoons would be at the surface of the Earth.  The method we use is to study these is called "GPS scintillations". GPS is the very same signals you use in your phone to know where you are. Scintillatiions are similar to what you see when you see a star "twinkle", only here it is the ionosphere that is twinkling.    We study these turbulent structures to better understand our overall Earth environment, but also because these twinkling scintillations can negatively effect GPS positioning and related GPS applications.  For this study we used the Scintillation Auroral GPS Array (SAGA) consisting of 7 GPS receivers in a two-dimensiona array on the ground near Fairbanks Alaska.  We chose Fairbanks, because it is in the Auroral region (where the Auroral Borealis is) and there are a lot of scintillations present.  Figure 1 shows the layout of the GPS receiver array. The array extends over about 1.6 miles. So we are looking for turbulent structures that are about 1-2 miles across.    Our first result was to determine how fast the turbulent structures move (similar to know how a hurricane moves) and to compare it with other methods (something we always have to do in Science - to be sure we are right). The top plot Figure 2 shows plots of the speed (vertical axis) of several different structures observed over a 30 minute period on December 8, 2013 (horizontal axis).  The bottom plot shows the direction these structures moved.  180 corresponds to West while 90 corresponds to North.  So, these structures were mostly moving Northwest, with a speed of about 3000 mph. So, in fact, the turbulent structures in the ionosphere are quite different from our lower atmosphere. They are large (miles across) and move very very fast.  The comparison with the Radar is actually very good, considering the Radar was not looking in the same direction as our array was.   So, now that we know something about how these objects move, our next goal was to learn something about the details of the structures themselves.  Figure 3 shows detailed measurements of the observed scintillations from one of our GPS receivers. The GPS receiver was measuring a specific GPS satellite (called PRN 23).  The time period is the same as shown if Figure 2.  The top plot measure the intensity of the scintillations, while the bottom plot measures the distortion.  it is clear that the scintillations began suddently at about 2600 seconds after 3 Universal time (Greenwich Mean Time) and lasted for about 40 minutes.  There are several distinct periods where the intensity and distortion gets larger, then a bit smaller.  These represent the observations of the turbulent structures themselves, after the radio signals have passed through them.     We would like to be able to make detailed maps of what the structures look like. However, that is very difficult because they are so turbulent and so fast moving. So, instead we try to characterize what the overall shape of the structures is from the observations.  In fact we try to represent the overall shape as an ellipse, and then determine the orientation (direction of the ellipse) and what the long and short axis of the ellipse are. Figure 4 shows one attempt at such a representation for a short 30 second sample of this 40 minute period.  The shown elliptical structure is a ground projection fo what the turbulent structure would look like at ionospheric heights.    In summary, this is just an example of...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
