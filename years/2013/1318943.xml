<AbstractNarration>Modern multicores are designed around complex memory hierarchies that&lt;br/&gt;achieve high performance with a high cost in design complexity and&lt;br/&gt;efficiency. The reason is that delaying the memory access just a few&lt;br/&gt;cycles has an unacceptable performance impact. This proposal decouples&lt;br/&gt;the memory operations in non-critical and critical. The critical&lt;br/&gt;component is allowed to be incorrect which results in a system with&lt;br/&gt;power savings, simplifications in the memory hierarchy, and even the&lt;br/&gt;removal of complex memory coherence.  The proposed sequential&lt;br/&gt;consistency model allows simple programming models without performance&lt;br/&gt;or power consumption impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses the challenge of excessive complexity in modern&lt;br/&gt;multicore memory hierarchy. This complexity results in a power waste and&lt;br/&gt;difficult programming models.  For modern systems, the memory hierarchy&lt;br/&gt;represents over half of the power. The proposed decoupled execution&lt;br/&gt;allows an energy efficient implementation by moving the complex&lt;br/&gt;operations out of the critical path. Furthermore, the proposed memory&lt;br/&gt;hierarchy allows for simpler parallel applications because it avoids&lt;br/&gt;complex consistency models commonly used. This proposal solution allows&lt;br/&gt;for an efficient implementation of the simplest consistency model&lt;br/&gt;available.  Overall, the PI hopes to make fundamental advances toward&lt;br/&gt;energy efficient and simpler to use memory hierarchies.</AbstractNarration>
