<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Jo Nelson has completed research for her MSPRF NSF grant on ``Moduli Problems in Contact Topology."  She spent 2013-2014 and 2016-2017 at Barnard College, Columbia University working with her mentor Dusa McDuff.  She spent 2014-2015 at the Institute for Advanced Study working with her mentor Helmut Hofer.  This grant also allowed her to take part in the Spring 2014 program at the Simons Center for Physics and Geometry at Stony Brook on Moduli Spaces of Pseudo-holomorphic curves and their applications to Symplectic Topology.  In the winter of 2014, Jo Nelson began a collaboration with Michael Hutchings of UC Berkeley to resolve transversality problems in defining the contact invariant, cylindrical contact homology,  for dynamically convex contact forms in 3 dimensions.  Their first paper, ``Cylindrical contact homology for dynamically convex contact forms in three dimensions," was published in the Journal of Symplectic Geometry 14, No, 4, 983&ndash;1012, 2016  Jo Nelson and Michael Hutchings are in the process of completed three more papers which constructs nonequivariant contact homology and two formulations of equivariant contact homology.  This work also establishes the invariance of contact homology.  In addition to providing rigorous constructions of these contact invariants, our work has  interesting applications to dynamical questions. They expect at two preprints to be available in Fall 2017.  In addition, Jo Nelson has completed a preprint on ``Automatic transversality for contact homology II: invariance and computations," available at arXiv:1708.07220.  She also published the survey article "From Dynamics to Contact and Symplectic Topology and Back" in the The Institute for Advanced Study Newsletter, Summer 2016 as well as her paper, "Automatic transversality for contact homology I: regularity," in  Abh. Math. Semin. Univ. Hambg. 85 (2015), no. 2, 125-179.  Every summer since 2014, Jo Nelson ran successful Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs at Columbia University in contact and symplectic geometry. Several of these summer projects were extended into the following academic year and have resulted in two high quality preprints.  The first with L. Abbrescia, I. Huq-Kuruvilla, &amp; N. Sultani on "Reeb Dynamics of the Link of the An Singularity" was published in Involve Vol. 10 (2017), No. 3, 417&ndash;442.  The second, with Katherine Christianson, ``Symplectic embeddings of 4-dimensional polydisks into balls," has been submitted and is available at arXiv:1610.00566.  Two of her former REU mentees have been awarded NSF graduate fellowships and are six are presently math PhD candidates at UC Berkeley, Boston University, the University of Michigan, Michigan State, and Northwestern.  Jo Nelson has also been involved with the greater symplectic and contact topology community and organized numerous seminars, workshops, conferences, and summer schools.  Seminars that she has organized included a IAS-Princeton symplectic seminar (2014-2016),  a weekly learning seminar joint with the IAS at Columbia University (2013-2015), and a joint Columbia University and IAS symplectic seminar (2014-2016).   With Joel Fish, Michael Hutchings, and Katrin Wehrheim, she ran an AIM workshop on Transversality in Contact Homology, which took place in December 2014 with 30 fully funded participants from the US, Europe, Asia, and South America.   The workshop made great progress identifying the current state of the field and clarifyingthe gaps in current arguments concerning the definition of contact homology, resulting in several formal and informal publications.  Jo Nelson was the chair of the organizing committee for the Institut des Hautes \'Etudes Scientifiques' 2015 Summer School, Moduli Problems in Symplectic Geometry.  This Summer School provided an entry point for approximately 100 students and researchers to polyfold and geometric techniques in symplectic and contact geometry and was very well received by its participants.   During her fellowship, Jo Nelson gave over 55 talks on her research at institutions in North America and Europe.
