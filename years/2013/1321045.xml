<AbstractNarration>Washington State University will design and study the educational affordances of a social programming environment (SPE), a technology-rich learning environment centered around a social networking-style activity stream of learners' problem-solving activities and progress. Through an iterative, participatory design process involving students and instructors at Washington State University, Pacific University, and Mesa Community College, this project will develop (a) an SPE to support learners as they work outside-of-class on the kinds of individual programming assignments that are the centerpiece of early computing courses; and (b) sets of practical guidelines and best practices to help instructors implement social programming assignments in their courses. This work will contribute new, theoretically-grounded accounts of how learning and participation proceed in social problem-solving environments, as well as empirical findings related to their impact on student learning outcomes, problem-solving processes, attitudes, and retention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building upon previous work adapting the studio-based learning model for computing education, the project staff aim to address low retention in computing degree programs by facilitating effective online learning communities for introductory computing courses. This project will result in two new open source technologies?a ?social plug-in? for a computer programming environment, and a learning management system tailored for ?social programming??that can be readily used in both K-12 and undergraduate computing education. While this project focuses on computing education, the novel social problem-solving technologies and the empirical findings of the research studies will be applicable to many STEM disciplines in which learners benefit by working individually on problems within a social environment.</AbstractNarration>

Focusing on undergraduate computing education, the project designed a social plug-in that integrated an activity stream into a computer programming environment, and empirically investigated the educational impact the integrated activity stream had on students? learning processes, attitudes, and outcomes. Key products and outcomes of this project include:  A model for designing social networking-style activity stream that can be integrated into a STEM problem-solving environment to promote greater social interaction and awareness. Empirical evidence that students who use such an integrated activity stream are twice as socially active as students who use an activity stream not integrated into a problem-solving environment. Empirical evidence that students? active participation in an activity stream positively correlates with their performance in computer programming assignments and exams. A detailed empirical account of the specific ways in which students? interactions in the activity stream contribute to positive progress in computer programming tasks. A predictive model of student achievement that combines students? programming and social behaviors to attain greater predictive power than can be obtained from considering programming behaviors alone. A model for designing scaffolding into a STEM problem-solving environment that nudges students to participate, in ways positively correlated with learning outcomes, in a social networking-style activity stream embedded into the problem-solving environment.
