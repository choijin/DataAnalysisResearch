<AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award seeks to create a manufacturing technology for high-speed evaporative self-assembly (ESA) of nanostructures, and to extend the reach of the PI's nanomanufacturing education activities to community colleges and high schools.  For example, nanoparticle assemblies can be used in photonics, biological/chemical sensors, solar cells and batteries, self-cleaning surfaces, data storage, catalysts, and other applications.  However, despite recent advances, the practicality and scalability of ESA is hindered by the limited size of crystalline domains (1-100 µm), and rates (typically &lt;0.1 mm/s) that are orders of magnitude slower than required for commercial manufacturing.  The research program seeks to overcome these barriers by creating continuous ESA processes that address two critical limits: high-speed fabrication of high-quality large-area monolayers of particles; and deterministic assembly of discrete particle cluster arrays.  A novel apparatus for continuous-feed ESA will lead to the identification of process conditions for monolayer assembly at cm/s or greater feed rates.  Together with comprehensive in situ and ex situ characterization, we will elucidate the mechanisms of particle transport and packing for particles across the 0.05-5 µm size range.  Finally, we will explore the optical properties of assembled materials, for applications as next-generation sensors that enable sensitive detection via Fano resonances, and engineered coatings for energy-efficient glass (in collaboration with industry).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These research outcomes would have transformative impact on the translation of lab-scale ESA methods to commercial scales and applications, including those mentioned above.  In parallel, the PI's education and outreach program will include three main initiatives: (1) A partnership with the Nanotechnology in Materials Science Program at Oakland Community College (OCC), wherein the PI will share materials and consult with OCC faculty to develop a course on nanomanufacturing processes for their program, and create a lab on self-assembly via a senior design project at Michigan; (2) Extension of the PI's new course on the Ph.D. Research Process into a required element of the first-year graduate curriculum in Mechanical Engineering, which also meets the NSF requirements for training in responsible and ethical conduct of research; and (3) Growth of collaborations with artists and architects, wherein the PI aims to promote general public awareness of nanoscale science and technology using artistic images, including through the PI's Nanobliss gallery (http://www.nanobliss.com).  The OCC lab will be featured in high school summer programs that are proven to increase interest in science and engineering across a diverse student population.  Through synergistic integration of research and education, an overarching aim of this program is to increase the number of four-year university graduates with expertise in nanomanufacturing-related topics, and to contribute to a rejuvenated manufacturing workforce and knowledge base in Michigan.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Colloids are small particles between 1 nanometer and 1 micrometer in size, typically suspended in a liquid or gas. For example, coffee is a colloidal system that consists of miniscule coffee grounds suspended in water. The particles in common colloids are typically random in shape and size. However, if the colloidal particles are uniformly sized, and the liquid in which they are suspended is removed, the particles can come together in an ordered arrangement, resulting in a colloidal crystal. Colloidal crystals exhibit unique optical, chemical, and electrical properties, and these properties can be tuned by the composition, size, and arrangement of the constituent colloidal particles. Therefore, colloidal particles are particularly promising for applications such as optical filters, chemical sensors, and electronic devices.</p> <p>The process of forming an ordered arrangement of particles, also called self-assembly, can be performed in two-dimensions (2D) or three-dimensions (3D). In this project, we studied systems, methods and devices for both 2D and 3D self-assembly.&nbsp;</p> <p>In our study of 2D self-assembly, we utilized the blade casting technique, also known as convective assembly. In blade casting, a moving blade spreads a suspension of colloidal particles across a substrate, resulting in a convective flux that organizes particles into a 2D crystal which consists of a single layer of particles in close-pack arrangement. We showed that precision control of process parameters such as temperature, blade speed, blade orientation, and substrate wettability results in high quality 2D crystals suitable for applications such as biosensors, optically-active surfaces, and nanocomposites.</p> <p>For our study of 3D self-assembly, we designed and built a precision system that dispenses a colloid suspension from a fine needle into a temperature-controlled environment. The colloidal suspension from the needle contacts a substrate, forming a liquid bridge. Evaporation of water from the liquid bridge results in a convective flux which directs the colloidal particles to accumulate in the liquid bridge. Intermolecular and surfaces forces direct the particles to self-assemble into a colloidal crystal. By moving the substrate away from the needle, and coordinating the motion of the substrate with the rate of crystal growth, a freestanding colloidal crystal can be grown in freeform to centimeter-scale dimensions. The crystalline arrangement of the particles results in iridescence, and we demonstrate that the iridescent color of the colloidal crystal can be easily tuned by particle size. We also observed and investigated the formation of cracks in these colloidal crystals and showed that cracking is dependent on particle size and crystal dimensions, therefore providing guidelines on how to create crack free colloidal crystals that may be used for photonics, electronics, and sensors.&nbsp;</p> <p>This project has resulted in broader technological impacts. For example, from our study of 2D self-assembly, we applied insights on maximizing monolayer assembly to a technique for the fabrication of nanoporous silicon, which is used in photovoltaics, nanofiltration, thermoelectrics, and catalysis. A particularly promising method for fabricating nanoporous silicon requires a monolayer of gold nanoparticles to be deposited onto a silicon substrate. Under oxidizing conditions, the gold acts as a catalyst which etches holes in the silicon, resulting in nanoporous silicon. Blade-casting has enabled a large area monolayer of gold nanoparticles to be deposited, so that larger areas of nanoporous silicon can be manufactured. In another related study, we replaced the blade in the convective assembly process with a roller so as to study the shear-induced assembly of P3HT, a semiconducting polymer commonly used in organic electronics. Rotating the roller with a slight wobble while moving the substrate underneath allows an array of uniformly spaced parallel semiconducting lines to be printed over large areas. This capability of producing a large array of semiconducting lines at high speed can advance the manufacture of organic transistors and transparent conductors used in many technologies.</p> <p>Finally, our study of 3D assembly has resulted in the development of novel mechanisms for precision dispense of liquid. This know-how has been translated into the invention of a universal handheld micropipette. The handheld micropipette is the most ubiquitous instrument for precision handling of microliter liquid volumes, which is an essential capability in all wet laboratories. We invented single handheld pipette adjustable from 0.1-1000?l. Our innovation was to place an elastic diaphragm in front of the piston to deamplify the volume displacement experienced by the pipetted liquid. We designed and built an adaptor for a commercial pipette that houses a selection of rubber sheets to function as the diaphragms, and confirmed the accuracy and precision of drawn volumes are within international standards across a 10,000-fold volume range.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/30/2019<br>      Modified by: Anastasios John&nbsp;Hart</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1346638/1346638_10141498_1553999999569_Slide2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1346638/1346638_10141498_1553999999569_Slide2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Direct-write colloidal assembly of macroscale freestanding colloidal crystal structures."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1346638/1346638_10141498_1553999999569_Slide2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Direct-write colloidal assembly of macroscale freestanding colloidal crystal structures."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">a) Direct-write colloidal assembly method. b) SEM image of a freestanding structure comprising particles of radius 500 nm. c) Freestanding cylindrical colloidal crystals with structural colors. d) Helical freestanding structure made by direct-write assembly.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Tan, A.
