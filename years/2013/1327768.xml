<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on understanding the long term effects on children who grow up under conditions of economic distress.  We will focus initially on establishing the long term health and labor market impacts of growing up during an economic downturn, and will then focus on understanding potential mechanisms that may operate through physical and mental health. The project emphasizes co-operative interdisciplinary exploration of the pathways by which economic resources affect child development, and will harness multiple datasets (such as the American Community Survey, the Medical Expenditure Survey, The Family Transitions Project and the California Families Project) multiple research methods, (such as linear probability analyses, "fixed effects" analyses, latent variable structural equation modeling) and multiple disciplinary perspectives represented by economics, psychology and sociology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given that the United States is in the process of slowly recovering from the largest recession since the Great Depression, this project will have broad impact through its clear policy relevance.  While the impact of business cycles on adult outcomes is being thoroughly documented, we currently know very little about how they affect the well-being of children.  It is natural to assume that the impacts of economic booms and busts must also spill over onto the next generation's long-term success, yet this is largely uncharted research territory. The project's intellectual impact lies in the development of a more holistic approach to understanding the connection between economic resources and child development.  The disciplines of economics, psychology and sociology are currently attempting to understand this relationship from completely different angles and in nearly total isolation.  The lack of interdisciplinary interaction has created disciplinary voids that produce incomplete understanding of the range of impacts children experience.  The project will form a foundation for a network of researchers who are not simply informed about related inquiries that are taking place in other disciplines but who are able to fully incorporate that understanding into more comprehensive research approaches that ultimately yield deeper knowledge about the interrelated impacts of economic downturns.  This network will include both faculty and graduate students, who will be trained through both direct immersion in the research projects, and intensive interdisciplinary mentoring and coursework.  Finally, the project will enhance the infrastructure of research, as it will involve putting together a new historical employment series, which will be made publicly available to all interested researchers through the principal investigator's website. This project is supported through the NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (IBSS) competition.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  The purpose of this research initiative was to bring together graduate students and expert faculty from economics, psychology, human development and sociology, to produce a comprehensive research program focused on understanding the full range of impacts and mechanisms experienced by children whose families are hit by negative economic events.  In addition to producing thematically related research across the disciplinary spectrum, we accomplished this goal by investing in numerous translational activities including the establishment of monthly informal research seminars/discussion where graduate students and faculty delved into their related, funded research, and organization of interdisciplinary workshops and conferences that brought in experts from across the nation.  We also developed a graduate training program that (in addition to the above activities) involved one-on-one mentoring, student participation in an interdisciplinary course on poverty and public policy that was developed and run by the PI, faculty and graduate student participation in an annual interdisciplinary graduate student retreat, and weekly informal brown bag meetings where students received feedback on their research from faculty and students who offered a variety of disciplinary perspectives.   Several of these activities have been so successful that they are continuing to be supported by the university now that NSF funding is completed.     Intellectual merit: At the core of this project was the development of a more holistic approach to understanding the connection between economic resources and child development.  The disciplines of economics, psychology, sociology and human development have been attempting to understand this relationship from completely different angles and in nearly total isolation, and the lack of interdisciplinary interaction has created barriers to fully understanding of the range of impacts children experience.  This project created the foundation for a network of researchers who are not simply informed about related inquires/thinking taking place in other disciplines, but who are now able to fully incorporate that understanding into more comprehensive research approaches that ultimately yield deeper knowledge about the interrelated impacts of growing up in economic distress.  In turn, this collaboration produced numerous published research articles and working papers across all of the represented disciplines that shed new light on the mechanisms that underlie intergenerational mobility. The studies included a range of both short term and long term analyses, and focused on documenting and/or disentangling interrelated economic processes, biological outcomes and parenting behaviors.  As an example: several of our published studies harnessed large scale research designs common in economics to document causal relationships between job losses/labor market opportunities and parent or child health.  These findings then motivated studies rooted in methods and insights from the psychological sciences, documenting links between economic stress, allostatic load, brain functioning and depression in disadvantaged youths&mdash;all of which are associated with the chances of reaching economic success in adulthood.  In addition, team members documented that parents can be powerful stress buffers to children. Our collective engagement also yielded new lines of collaborative research among multiple network members, specifically innovative research linking economic hardship with biological markers across the length of childhood and across generations.  These cutting-edge collaborations emanate directly from the foundation that was laid by the investment in interdisciplinary scholarship supported by this grant.     Broader Impacts: The funded research has direct policy relevance, as it is only by understanding the mechanisms underlying the intergenerational transmission of economic hardship that we can hope to design policies that efficiently combat the cycle of poverty.  We took our research findings directly into the policy world by organizing policy-oriented workshops for state and national policy makers and service providers, organizing sessions at national policy oriented conferences, testifying before Senate committees, writing policy briefs and working with legislative staff.  Multi-disciplinary graduate student training was also a core component of the team?s mission.  More than 30 graduate students participated extensively in our training activities and several have now graduated and are spreading the benefits of this knowledge in other academic or policy environments.  The project also enhanced research infrastructure by creating new publicly available data.          Last Modified: 11/27/2018       Submitted by: Marianne Page]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
