<AbstractNarration>The goal of this REU Site program is to offer a unique training opportunity for undergraduates to conduct research in the multidisciplinary area of New-generation Power-efficient Computer Systems Design. In the design of high-performance massive multicore chips, power and heat, along with performance, are now considered as dominant constraints. The increasing power consumption is of growing concern due to several reasons, e.g., cost, performance, reliability, scalability, and environmental impact. More specifically, timely advances in exascale computing cannot be achieved without a holistic approach to reducing energy. The proposed REU program facilitates research and training in the complementary, multi-layered disciplines ranging from application layer to middleware to low level circuit design. Due to partnering with other REU programs on campus, the participating students will have opportunities to interact with a broad range of REU students from around the country, with many faculty members, and with graduate students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;One of the intellectual merits of this program is that it will enable high quality interdisciplinary research that links ideas from compilers and OS, Network-on-Chip (NoC), computer architecture, parallel and distributed computing, complex networks, optimization techniques, digital communications, and circuit design to address power and thermal efficiency in multicore-based computer systems. Another intellectual merit is that the program creates opportunities for undergraduates to study challenges in designing new generation of power efficient multicore architectures. As a unique feature, the participating students are exposed to research and development activities in the sustainable computing area through planned visits to partner industries and a national lab. The broader impact of this REU program includes (1) making contributions to producing a workforce that is trained in the multidisciplinary topic of sustainable computer system design; (2) advancing discovery in energy savings in computers for economical and ecological reasons; and (3) promoting teaching and learning in sustainable computing. This interdisciplinary effort is valuable for undergraduate students as they are exposed to research ideas that will have a significant impact on environmental sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcome of our research has been analytical and experimental methodologies and toolsets for the design and evaluation of new generation computer systems, addressing power efficiency and thermal management while provisioning for the necessary performance trade-offs. Sustainable computing is a new, vast field in which researchers and engineers invent means to better manage energy/heat along with performance and reliability in new generation computers. In this REU program, our focus has been to impart necessary training to the participating students so that they are capable of addressing the power-thermal-performance trade-offs in new-generation multicore computer systems.   Specific intellectual merit of this project includes, but not limited to:  (1) Design and implementation of linear and mixed integer programming optimization techniques to investigate energy-performance trade-off issues in modern multicore systems.  The REU students used a full system simulator, GEM5, to experiment with optimization techniques for different machine configurations, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling techniques, and benchmarks with varying characteristics.  (2) Network-on-Chip (NoC) has emerged as the preferred communication backbone for massive many-core chips. The achievable performance and energy consumption of the many-core chip depend on the NoC routers. In this project, the students designed an efficient NoC router architecture to achieve high performance and energy efficiency.  The router architect is generic and does not depend on any specific interconnection configuration.  (3) Design and implementation of a fully integrated power management system, including an inductor-based buck converter and a switched capacitor voltage regulator, which is implemented in 180nm CMOS.  (4) REU students used a commercial finite-difference-time-domain electromagnetic simulation package to investigate on-chip electromagnetic propagation effects related to transmission of very short pulses, used in time-reversal multiple access communications, at mm-wave frequencies.  (5) REU student used the Cadence Virtuoso circuit simulation program to investigate design of an analog Fourier series filter bank to be used for synthesis and storage of mm-wave on-chip impulse responses.  Specific broader impact of this project includes, but not limited to:  (1) For the overall 3 year project, we recruited 29 REU students; 20 from institutions other than WSU and 9 from WSU, where 14 of the participants were from minority and underrepresented groups.  (2) The REU students took part in a university-wide as well as national REU events (such as REU Symposium by Council on Undergraduate Research) to showcase their work. They also co-authored research papers with their mentors and some presented their work at technical conferences.  (3) Our REU program attempts to change the behavior and decision making process for undergraduate students who may otherwise not be interested in research and graduate studies.   (4) Because of the nature of our research, any energy efficiency/sustainable computing techniques resulting from our work will ultimately lead to a greener and more sustainable computer industry and society as a whole.
