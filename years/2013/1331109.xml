<AbstractNarration>The overarching goal of this program is to provide Applied Mathematical Sciences majors at University of California, Merced (UC Merced) an enhanced academic experience that provides training in the computational tools needed for modeling and simulation of complex systems and for analysis of large data sets. The Data Enabled Science and Computational Analysis Research, Training, and Education for Students (DESCARTES) Program has three specific aims:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. To provide exceptional undergraduate students unique research opportunities and state-of-the-art education and training in computational and data enabled science and to disseminate results from their efforts within the university and to the community at-large;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. To develop the Computational and Data Enabled Science emphasis track within the Applied Mathematical Sciences major to provide students a hands-on learning experience on the latest tools and methods in computational and data enabled science;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. To provide high school math teachers from the region the opportunity to learn the tools and methods of computational and data enabled science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UC Merced community is committed to serving the population of the San Joaquin Valley -- the fastest growing yet economically underserved region of California. Indeed, many of our students are members of underrepresented populations and most are first-generation college-goers. These students, as well as regional high school teachers, will realize significant benefits from the DESCARTES Scholars program. Both will gain access to emerging areas of research in computational and data-enabled science and the training necessary to address the complex problems confronting society today. Regional businesses and industry will benefit by forging connections to a well-trained pool of prospective employees. At the same time, the University community will take an important step towards its mission of service to the region.</AbstractNarration>
