<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to lay the foundations for algorithmic research on self-organizing particle systems. Particle systems are physical systems of simple computational particles that can bond to other particles and that can use these bonds in order to communicate with neighboring particles and to move from one spot to another (non-occupied) spot. These particle systems are supposed to be able to self-organize in order to adapt to a desired shape without any central control. Self-organizing particle systems have many interesting applications like coating objects for monitoring and repair purposes and the formation of nano-scale devices for surgery and molecular-scale electronic structures. While there has been quite a lot of systems work in this area, especially in the context of modular self-reconfigurable robotic systems, only very little theoretical work has been done in this area so far. This project will prepare the ground for rigorous algorithmic research on self-organizing particle systems by proposing some basic models and solving some basic algorithmic problems in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives of this one-year project are (i) to develop appropriate models for particle systems; (ii) to develop self-organizing algorithms for smart paint problems; and (iii) to better educate the Computer Science (CS) Theory/Algorithms community on self-organizing particle systems. The proposed NSF sponsored workshop will foster collaboration of research in this interdisciplinary area.</AbstractNarration>

In order to capture the essential nature of such systems, a transformative, novel thinking approach is needed, in some ways mimicking those that already exist in nature. Also, there needs to be a better understanding by the broader theoretical community on how research in self-organizing particle systems is conducted, in particular leveraging on research from different communities, in order to achieve a broader advance on theoretical research in this area: The workshop on self-organizing particle systems component of this project achieved exactly that.  More specifically, the main objectives achieved by this project were (i) to develop appropriate models for particle systems; (ii) to develop self-organizing algorithms for smart paint problems; and (iii) to better educate the Computer Science (CS) Theory/Algorithms community on self-organizing particle systems.   This project had an impact in several respects, such as: (i) bridging the large gap between theory and practice in the area of self-organizing particle systems, with impact on many application areas such as microfabrication and cellular engineering; (ii) better educating CS Theory/Algorithms researchers in the field of self-organizing particle systems through the proposed NSF sponsored workshop, which will result in a faster advance of theoretical research in this field; (iii) international collaboration, since we will further foster the successful collaboration with Prof. Scheideler and the U. of Paderborn, Germany; (iv) multidisciplinary activities, since the topics in this proposal will foster collaboration with researchers in transdisciplinary areas such as nano-scale microfabrication, cellular engineering, nano-scale medical applications, biochemistry, etc.; (v) advancing education at Arizona State University (ASU); and (vi) enhancing diversity at ASU and at the CS Theory/Algorithms at large.
