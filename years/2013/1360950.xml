<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Combustion Institute is the primary national and international organization for industry and academic researchers in the field of combustion.  The members are generally aerospace or mechanical engineers and, consequently, the field is very male-dominated.  The 34th International Symposium on Combustion held in Warsaw Poland in 2012 had almmost 1300 participants with only approximately 179 (14%) women.  The Combustion Institute is committed to encouraging diversity in its membership and has supported the organization of Women in Combustion.  With this goal in mind, the Combustion Institute partnered with NSF to fund a COACh workshop, an NSF-funded program to develop leadership training for women in science.  This workshop was held in San Francisco on 2 August 2014, the day before the International Symposium on Combustion to faciliate the participation in the workshop by women attending the symposium. The workshop was attended by 11 women graduate students, from both the U.S. and international institutions. The sessions were lead by professional COACH facilitators and additional advice was provided by two senior female faculty members. Professional development sessions focused on negotiation, communication and job skills.  Evaluations at the end of the workshop indicated that the participants found the workshop useful in helping to develop these skills.
