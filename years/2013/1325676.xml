<AbstractNarration>Discharge of wastewater, sewerage and runoff from coastal cities remains the dominant sources of coastal zone pollution. The impervious nature of modern cities is only exacerbating this problem by increasing runoff from city surfaces, triggering combined sewer overflow events in cities with single-pipe wastewater conveyance systems and intensifying urban flooding. Many coastal cities, including US cities like Seattle, New York and San Francisco, are turning to urban green infrastructure (GI) to mitigate the city's role in coastal zone pollution. Urban GI, such as green roofs, green streets, advanced street-tree pits, rainwater gardens and bio-swales, introduce vegetation and perviousness back into city landscapes, thereby reducing the volume and pollutant loading of urban runoff. Urban GI, however, also has co-benefits that are equally important to coastal city sustainability. For example, increasing vegetation and perviousness within city boundaries can help cool urban environments, trap harmful air-borne particulates, increase biodiversity and promote public health and well-being. Despite the significance of these co-benefits, most current urban GI programs still focus on achieving volume reduction of storm water through passive detention and retention of rainfall or runoff. Holistic approaches to GI design that consider multiple sustainability goals are rare, and real time monitoring and active control systems that help ensure individual or networked GI meet performance goals over desired time-scales are lacking. Furthermore, how city inhabitants view, interact with, and value GI is little studied or accounted for in current urban GI programs. This project will develop and test a new framework for the next generation of urban GI that exploits the multi-functionality of GI for coastal city sustainability, builds a platform for real-time monitoring and control of urban GI networks, and takes account of the role of humans in GI stewardship and long-term functionality. The project will use the Bronx River Sewershed in New York City, where a $20 million investment in GI is planed over the next 5-years, as its living test bed. GI has its roots in several disciplines, and the project brings together expertise from these disciplines, including civil and environmental engineering, environmental science, and plant science/ horticulture. In addition, the project integrates expertise from other disciplines needed to elevate GI performance to the next level, including urban planning and design, climate science, data science, environmental microbiology, environmental law and policy, inter-agency coordination, community outreach and citizen science.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific outcomes of the project will include: (i) new, scientific data on the holistic, environmental performance of different GI interventions in an urban, coastal environment; (ii) new models for the system level performance of networks of GI interventions; (iii) methodologies for projecting GI performance under a changing climate; (iv) a platform for remote monitoring and control of GI; (v) proposals for law and policy changes to enable US coastal cities to introduce GI at scales necessary to meet sustainability goals, and  (vi) new understanding of human-GI interactions and their role in the long-term performance and maintenance of urban GI. Engagement with schools in the Bronx River Sewershed and engagement of citizens in the GI performance monitoring are both important components of the project work. The interdisciplinary project team integrates academic expertise with expertise in industry, government and non-profit organizations.</AbstractNarration>

New York City has built thousands of green infrastructure installations across the city to collect or manage rainwater or ?stormwater? that falls on the city?s roof, streets and sidewalks. Using green infrastructure to collect stormwater before it enters the city?s sewer system helps improve the health of local coastal waterways, and thus the overall health and livability of the city. Because many other U.S coastal cities are also using green infrastructure to improve city health and livability, the outcomes of this project have national applicability.</p> <p>The interdisciplinary project team included representatives from academia, industry, government and community organizations. The academic expertise represented in the project included engineering, biology, geo-chemistry, landscape architecture, urban design, policy, law and anthropology. Multiple green infrastructure types were investigated over the 6-year project period including green roofs, green streets, rain-gardens or right-of-way bioswales, vine canopies and urban street trees. Both passive systems, which collect and manage rainwater without any active control, and active systems, which collect and manage rainwater using internet-of-things technology, where included in the research, which involved field-measurements, monitoring and modeling efforts. Aspects of green infrastructure performance that were investigated included green infrastructure capacity to retain stormwater, reduce local air temperatures, sequester carbon dioxide, increase biodiversity and retain nutrients. A very important component of the project was to also understand the social benefits of green infrastructure and how public interactions with, and acceptability of, green infrastructure programs might influence green infrastructure performance itself.</p> <p>The project found that the average annual rainfall retention of many green infrastructure types is 40%, with retention for individual rain events varying with storm size and season. Green infrastructure I systems that involve active control were found to be more effective for stormwater retention than passive systems, although a disadvantage of active systems can be their greater initial cost and maintenance requirements. Most green infrastructure types were found to be net exporters of nutrients, which led to recommendations for better selection and management of green infrastructure soil types. The ability of several green infrastructure types to reduce near surface air-temperatures was found to be very local, which has implications for the scale of green infrastructure implementation needed to reduce an Urban Heat Island. The ability of green infrastructure types to sequester carbon dioxide was found to be variable, with green roofs sequestering several orders of magnitude less carbon per year per square meter than, for example, an urban street tree. The microbiology of green infrastructure soil types is still under-investigation, but initial results point to a biodiversity that is significantly different to that of natural soils. A national survey of effective strategies for public-private partnerships that support city green infrastructure programs was conducted. This survey highlighted the importance of boundary organizations that link private land owners with city greening goals and incentives, in the effective greening of private land. Finally, project outcomes point to the fact that citizens value green infrastructure more for the social and cultural services that green infrastructure can provide than the ecological services, which has implications for green infrastructure design and implementation strategies, as well as the potential for citizen engagement in green infrastructure stewardship and maintenance efforts.</p> <p>The project engaged citizen scientists, high school, undergraduate and graduate students, as well the general public, in sample collection, monitoring and green infrastructure planning and design activities. The use of social media, including twitter, also helped to map linkages between green spaces and the well-being of different urban populations.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2019<br>      Modified by: Patricia&nbsp;J&nbsp;Culligan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1325676/1325676_10275233_1575056741993_IMG_5219--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1325676/1325676_10275233_1575056741993_IMG_5219--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sampling on a Native Green Roof"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1325676/1325676_10275233_1575056741993_IMG_5219--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sampling on a Native Green Roof"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Sampling on a native green roof located in the Bronx, New York City to determine plant biomass</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr. Robert Elliott</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Patricia&nbsp;J&nbsp;Culligan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Sampling on a Native Green Roof</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1325676/1325676_10275233_1575056927010_watersampler--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1325676/1325676_10275233_1575056927010_watersampler--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Water Sampling in a Green Street"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1325676/1325676_10275233_1575056927010_watersampler--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Water Sampling in a Green Street"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Installing water samplers to measure water quality and nutrient cycling in a green street located in the Bronx, New York City</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr. Nandan Shetty</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Patricia&nbsp;J&nbsp;Culligan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Water Sampling in a Green Street</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1325676/1325676_10275233_1575057159937_DSC00673--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1325676/1325676_10275233_1575057159937_DSC00673--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Instruments on a Green Roof"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1325676/1325676_10275233_1575057159937_DSC00673--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Instruments on a Green Roof"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Instruments to measure green roof performance installed on a green roof located in Manhattan, New York City</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr.Robert Elliott</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Patricia&nbsp;J&nbsp;Culligan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Instruments on a Green Roof</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
