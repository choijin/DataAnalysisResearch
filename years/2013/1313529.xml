<AbstractNarration>To enhance the quality of STEM programs at TCUP institutions, QEM will design and conduct two workshops for TCUP project staff, in Years One and Two respectively: Strategic Planning Within/Sustaining Enhancements Beyond TCUP-supported Projects and Financial Management Within TCUP Projects. To increase the participation/quality of preparation of Native individuals in STEM careers, QEM will design and conduct two professional development workshops to support STEM faculty at TCUP institutions: The Fundamentals of Education Research and Assessment and Evaluation of TCUP-supported STEM Instructional Strategies (in Years One and Two respectively).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QEM will continue a Faculty Fellowship initiative that supports the six-month placement each year at NSF of a STEM faculty member from a TCUP-supported institution to provide the Fellow with exposure to, and immersion in, the Foundation?s programs, policies, and procedures. This initiative provides NSF program directors and staff the opportunity to interact directly with and gain insight from a TCUP faculty member. QEM will to continue offering, in each of the three years, ten-week summer internships at QEM for five STEM students from TCUP institutions. The TCUP Internship program is focused on activities and experiences that encourage the participating students to persist in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. In implementing this project, QEM will utilize/build on experience gained, through prior TCUP support, in working with faculty, staff, administrators, and students at TCUs. The project?s faculty-focused workshops will advance participants? knowledge and understanding of STEM education research methodologies as well as of assessment and evaluation of the effectiveness of STEM pedagogical strategies, while workshops for TCUP project staff will strengthen their strategic planning and management skills to benefit both current and future STEM initiatives. The Faculty Fellowships and Student Internships will continue to offer the reciprocal benefits of new experiences and shared/diverse perspectives for the Fellows, interns, and NSF Program Directors and staff. The project will be enriched by the advice and counsel of an External Advisory Committee composed of Tribal College leaders and others with first-hand knowledge and experience working with Tribal Colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The Project?s initiatives will impact the way that STEM is taught at TCUP institutions; enable faculty to gauge the effectiveness of their approaches to STEM teaching; increase familiarity with other NSF funding opportunities as well as with the Foundation?s proposal review process; increase the project staff?s understanding of strategic planning and sustainability strategies as well as of effective financial management and increase student understanding of/interest in pursuing STEM careers. Workshop information, registration and presentations; information on the faculty fellowship/internship opportunities; and other project-related information will be available at QEM?s website to ensure broader dissemination of this information beyond email communication with STEM faculty and project staff.</AbstractNarration>
