<AbstractNarration>Heterotrophic microbial communities are key players in the marine carbon cycle, transforming and respiring organic carbon, regenerating nutrients, and acting as the final filter in sediments through which organic matter passes before long-term burial. Microbially-driven carbon cycling in the ocean profoundly affects the global carbon cycle, but key factors determining rates and locations of organic matter remineralization are unclear. In this study, researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will investigate the ability of pelagic microbial communities to initiate the remineralization of polysaccharides and proteins, which together constitute a major pool of organic matter in the ocean. Results from this study will be predictive on a large scale regarding the nature of the microbial response to organic matter input, and will provide a mechanistic framework for interpreting organic matter reactivity in the ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This study will provide scientific training for undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups. The project will also involve German colleagues, thus strengthening international scientific collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
