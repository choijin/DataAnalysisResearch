<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research program is to develop and utilize experimental capabilities for studying the plastic properties of rocks at conditions of the deep Earth.  Over geologic time we see that continents have been ripped apart with plate boundaries punctuated by earthquakes and volcanoes.  However, over the vast regions of the Earth, these processes proceed smoothly and slowly.  While earthquakes express the dynamic character of Earth deformation, the slow movement of the continents provides the driving force.  The enabling process for this large-scale motion is the plastic deformation of rocks throughout the Earth's mantle.  The foundation of plate tectonics rests on the contention that rocks deform slowly but surely at the high pressure and temperature of the deep Earth.  This research program is to continue to build experimental capabilities to quantify the plastic character of rocks as a function of depth in the Earth.  This program works at the juncture of high-pressure apparatus development and national synchrotron facilities that can provide intense x-ray probes.  This union promises experimental capabilities that increase the depth range of the Earth that we can access, with high precision measurement, by a factor of 100 from previous studies.  The data that will come from this program will enable testing and modifying of models of Earth evolution. These deformation facilities enable new directions in Earth material research at mantle pressure and temperature including elastic wave attenuation at seismic frequencies, reaction kinetics, thermal diffusivity, and relationship of lattice preferred orientation to deformation geometry, which links seismic anisotropy to flow history. They also provide a potential facility and technical knowhow for studying material strength and plasticity at extreme conditions such as those generated in the next generation power plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stress, strain, pressure, and temperature are the primary variables that need to be measured during a deformation experiment. With the aid of the national synchrotrons (the Advanced Photon Source and the National Synchrotron Light Source), the investigators have developed the tools to make these measurements. They have also built the first generation of high-pressure apparatus for introducing 'large - volume high pressure' technology into deformation machines. They are now able to make accurate rheology experiments at pressures 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than could be achieved 10 years ago. The next phase is to take full advantage of the current hydrostatic high-pressure equipment, including advanced technologies for making polycrystalline diamonds, to reach lower mantle conditions.  The goals of this program are to 1) increase the pressure range for deformation experiments to 30 - 40 GPa, well into the lower mantle, 2) improve measurement resolution of stress and strain with a combination of hardware and software developments, 3) enable simultaneous measurements of a sample properties such as preferred orientation of grains and acoustic velocity, 4) explore advanced techniques such as those developed by the synchrotron community but may be useful to earth science goals.  These are often high risk, but high return tools such as white beam Laue diffraction that could yield very detailed information about the individual grains within a polycrystal.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcome  Rheology of mantle minerals plays a crucial role in essentially all dynamic processes in the Earth throughout its 4.5 billion-year history. This project aims at developing infrastructure for measuring rheological properties at elevated pressure and temperature (HPT) that will be available to the scientific community, integrating experimental results with modeling to better understand the underlying physics of plastic flow in a complex multi-mineral system, and collecting rheological data for major mantle minerals under HPT in order to constraints the rheological behavior of rocks in the Earth?s mantle.  Through this three-year project we have achieved the following:     Infrastructure  We have developed high-speed (1 second) ultrasonic acoustic velocity measurements at APS synchrotron 6BMB at HPT.  We have developed software for automated inversion of the data and automation of the data collection process.  This system is now available to the scientific community through proposals to APS for beamtime.  We have finished the installation of a new high-pressure rheological system at the NSLS II synchrotron on beamline XPD (DT25).  This system is capable of 30 GPa with a superimposed differential stress.  It is the first of its kind and available to the scientific community through proposals to the NSLS II beamtime.  This will allow quantitative rheological measurements to pressures of the lower mantle.  We have extended the pressure (and temperature) conditions for quantitative deformation experiments to P~27 GPa, T~2100 K for a strain rate of ~10^-5 s^-1 using the rotating Drickamer apparatus (RDA).  This technique has been applied to lower mantle and transition zone minerals.     Physics of Plasticity  We have determined deformation mechanisms of the materials studied as a function of pressure, temperature, grain size, water content, and strain rate.    We have established rheological laws describing flows of these mineral/rock systems under HPHT.  These flow laws, together with information on deformation mechanisms, will help extrapolate laboratory results to geological conditions.  We have incorporated a theory of radial x-ray diffraction to identify the mechanisms of plastic deformation (either diffusion or dislocation creep) under the deep Earth conditions.  We have has focused on improving strategies for interpreting diffraction data collected during in-situ deformation experiments.  The group has conducted experiments on synthetic forsterite, San Carlos olivine and a Mg alloy.  The forsterite experiments allowed us to compare the strength of the sample material as measured in the Griggs apparatus with measurements made in the D-DIA apparatus.  The experiments showed that the alumina piston gives the best estimate of the load supported by the sample in D-DIA experiments and also demonstrates that deviations between the stress reported by the sample and the alumina piston only arise when plastic deformation initiates in the sample.  The combined Griggs and D-DIA data sets shows that V*, which measures the pressure dependence of creep, is itself a function of pressure.  Further experimentation on San Carlos olivine aggregates demonstrated that that grain boundary sliding is a good candidate for explaining deviations from elastic behavior at strains &lt;2% and that including a description of this behavior in Elastic Plastic Self-Consistent models allows the models to return realistic CRSS values for other plastic deformation mechanisms.  The apparent contradiction between the two results (the discrepancy between different measures of the overall load once plastic deformation initiates and the faithful return of CRSS values) can be reconciled by recalling that CRSS are measured at the instance at which plastic deformation initiates.  Experiments on Mg alloy have greatly extended the high pressure range at which mechanical tests on this alloy have been conducted.      Data  We have expanded the rheological database covering a large number of minerals. Several multiphase assemblages have also been studied which represent more closely the complex rock assemblies in the mantle.  We have studied ultrasonic acoustic velocities in partially molten mantle rocks with the conclusion that both the shear modulus and the bulk modulus are affected by melting.     Broader Impact  This program leaves a broad range of facilities and supporting tools that are available to the scientific community.  Many of these are set up at beamlines at the APS and the NSLS II synchrotrons and are accessible through a proposal system.  In addition, the insights into the nature of stress measurement, the plastic process, and the plastic properties of minerals at HPT reflecting deep mantle conditions provide a broad basis for understanding the deep Earth.
