<AbstractNarration>#1351474&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Amy L. Oldenburg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to construct a novel integrated system that incorporates optical coherence tomography (OCT), a method for visualizing cross-sections of cells in thick tissues, with in-line digital holography to rapidly image in-plane motions near the tissue surface. The OCT component will monitor light scattering fluctuations from diffusing gold nanorods which act as probes of the nanotopological environment. The holography component will capture induced surface elastic waves, which will be reconstructed into high resolution tissue elastograms. Integration of these imaging systems enables coregistration of driven and diffusive motions at multiple length scales in order to relate subcellular architecture with bulk viscoelastic properties. The proposed integrated system will be employed to study an early-stage breast cancer tissue culture model in which normal and pre-malignant mammary epithelial cells (MECs) are co-cultured with stromal fibroblasts.  Measuring the microscale extracellular matrix stiffness in conjunction with nanorheological measurements in and around MECs and stromal cells will provide new insight into the biophysical processes that lead to breast cancer.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intellectual Merit:</p> <p>This award has led to the development of rapid and non-invasive optical imaging technologies for studying mammary cells within tissue cultures to simulate the human breast. These technologies have allowed us to study how breast cancer cells and associated stromal cells within the adjacent tissues remodel their surrounding scaffolding structure, the extracellular matrix (ECM). Changes in the ECM stiffness or porosity are associated with the ability for tumors to grow and for cancer cells to migrate.</p> <p>During this award, we advanced a technology that allows us to measure the ECM porosity within thick, ?3d? tissue cultures without the need to cut the tissues. The technology is based upon applying gold nanorods that work their way by diffusion into tissues, and diffusion-sensitive optical coherence tomography (DS-OCT) to sense their motions (Fig. 1). We have found that the diffusion rate of the nanorods is directly proportional to the pore areas within the matrix, and that a calibration curve can be made that is independent of the composition of the ECM, which is important for studies in complex tissues where ECM composition changes. In this way, motions of nanorods directly quantify ECM pore area, allowing us to generate true ?images? of nanoporosity. Interestingly, this uses optical techniques that would traditionally be unable to resolve features on the nanoscale, so in a sense, DS-OCT constitutes a type of super-resolution imaging.</p> <p>Another technology that was advanced as part of this award is OCT motility analysis (OCT-MA). OCT-MA infers the health of cells in 3d cultures by merit of their motion, i.e., intracellular components that move around due to molecular motor activity inside the cells. Importantly, the OCT-MA data can be acquired at the same time as DS-OCT to provide a complete picture of tumor cell health and ECM porosity surrounding the tumor. During this award, we used this combined tool to measure ECM porosity immediately adjacent to the edges of growing tumor spheroids, and found that the pore sizes were larger around spheroids in which cells exhibited higher motility (Fig. 2). The combination DS-OCT / OCT-MA imaging platform constitutes a novel technology which will lead to a better understanding of tumor growth and cancer cell migration.</p> <p>Broader impacts:</p> <p>Because the imaging platform is uniquely suited for imaging 3d tissue cultures, which replicates some of the complexities of real breast tissues, we expect that it will be a broadly useful tool for performing controlled research studies of breast cancer where mouse models would normally be used, thus minimizing the use of animals. Also, the 3d tissue culture platform is amenable to studies of cancer development from exposure to environmental toxicants, or tumor cell death from anti-cancer drugs, where the combined imaging platform can be used to rapidly screen potential toxicants or drugs.</p> <p>This award also fully funded the Carolina ADMIRES program (Assisting in Development and Mentoring an Innovative Research Experience in Science), which enrolled a cohort of approximately 15 students per academic year in 8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> grade, &gt;90% of whom were women and under-represented minorities in science. The program involved a meaningful, sustained experience over the academic year, meeting approximately once per month.
