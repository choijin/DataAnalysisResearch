<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this collaborative award is to delineate the benefits and limitations of value-driven decision authority delegation in large systems engineering projects as compared to the more traditional approach of delegating authority through a requirements flow-down process. A new and practical value-driven decision delegation approach will be defined based on the mathematical foundations of probability theory, decision theory, and game theory. Using rigorous mathematical analysis, the investigation will characterize this new approach and compare it to a requirements-driven approach. New methods will be derived (1) by which subsystem engineers can communicate their beliefs about technical capabilities to systems engineers and (2) by which systems engineers can incentivize subsystem engineers to seek designs that maximize system-level expected utility. The investigation will start by examining the case of a single subsystem and will culminate with the analysis of decision delegation in the general case of concurrent subsystem design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will have a significant impact on the development of large-scale complex engineered systems of interest to private industry, the government, and the public at large. An improved understanding of decision delegation will enable engineers to structure engineering projects in a more efficient and effective matter, resulting in better systems, at lower cost, and within less time. Furthermore, fundamental insights discovered in this research will provide direction to future computational and empirical studies. Finally, the discoveries made in this research will be incorporated into new systems engineering curricula, which will lead to a better-prepared next generation of systems engineers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated value-driven design strategies in the context of design delegation.  In this process, subteams collaborate to design components of a complex engineered system.  A system designer integrates the subsystems designed by each team, and evaluates the value of the design in terms of a predefined "value function".  The goal of this research is to study the incentives that must be provided by the system designer to each subteam, and to investigate optimal methods of communication between subteams and between each team and the system designer.  Distributed optimization algorithms were developed that implemented optimal design strategies in this delegated context.     The major outcomes of the project are described as follows.  First, we developed a mathematical approach that captures decision delegation to subteams in a value-driven design context.  This mathematical approach takes the form of a distributed, decentralized optimization problem.  We established basic convergence criteria for this type of optimization problem.  In addition, the basic quantities which must be communicated by the system designer to the subteams (current design as well as Jacobian and Hessian of the value function) have been identified through mathematical analysis.  Studies were performed analyzing the tradeoff between subsystem coupling, convergence to an optimal design, and communication requirements.  In particular, it has been shown that coupling between the subsystems induces specific additional requirements on communication, and a smaller step size must be used.  These communication requirements and step sizes have been quantified.    We have also extended this distributed optimization approach to problems involving uncertainty.  These new algorithms apply a stochastic programming method to the distributed optimization problem.  Specifically, a sample averaging scheme is applied in order to deal with uncertainty amongst each subteam.  A method has further been developed to estimate the required sample size for each subteam as a function of the variance-cost ratio for the specific problem under consideration.  This method considers whether it is better to increase the number of samples each subteam uses and iterate less on the overall design, or keep the number of samples low for each team and iterate on the design more.  The guidance provided by this analysis tool has great practical implications for future use of these algorithms.   In the context of delegated design under uncertainty, an upper bound on the achievable optimal value has been identified as a function of the coupling between subteams and a measure of the additive separability of the value function.  This bound allows one to determine how close the designer will get to the optimal design with a certain partitioning of the subteams.  Numerical results have been obtained showing that both the deterministic and the uncertain value-driven design problems can be solved in a delegated context using the trust region algorithm derived during this project.
