<AbstractNarration>The phylogenomics of diet breadth in heliothine moths&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evolution of diet breadth amongst herbivorous insects has long served as a testing ground for hypotheses about the role of ecological adaptation in biological diversification and speciation, but the scope of such research has been limited by the tools available. The advent of next generation sequencing technologies has made it possible to conduct a detailed examination of diet breadth evolution in a well-researched group of moths (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae: Heliothinae). The family Noctuidae is one of the largest in the order Lepidoptera, and research on the noctuid subfamily Heliothinae, which includes some of the world's most injurious crop pests, spans a wide range of evolutionary questions. This research project will use comparative genomics to examine the genetic basis of host plant range in at least seven heliothine species (ranging from extreme generalists feeding on many plant orders to extreme specialists feeding on a few plant species in a single genus) to identify the genes/gene categories involved in diet breadth evolution. By placing these results in a phylogenetic context, this research will help clarify the role of diet breadth evolution in the extraordinary phylogenetic radiation of the Lepidoptera.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide the Fellow with expertise in the emerging field of phylogenomics, and with fundamental training in bioinformatics, genomics, and transcriptomics. These skills will allow the Fellow to pursue future research on the genetic basis of ecologically important traits in a variety of organisms. The approaches developed during the course of this research will contribute to the analysis of genomic data from non-model organisms, and will potentially provide new techniques for integrating analyses at different levels (e.g., populations, species, and higher taxa). This project includes participation by middle school, high school, and college students from underrepresented groups, who will be mentored in the theory and practice of scientific research.</AbstractNarration>

Each plant has a different chemical defense profile, and my goal was to identify the specific genes whose expression allow H. virescens to cope with varied plant defenses. The results of this study could lead to safer pest control strategies. To understand how rapidly host plant range can evolve, I made progress toward a molecular phylogeny of rare Heliothine moths using "ancient" DNA. Using material I collected during my Fulbright Scholar visit to Brazil, I am generating the first molecular phylogeny for a species complex that is of great economic importance in North and South America. Because some members of the species group are very difficult to collect, I have developed specialized protocols for the extraction and sequencing of DNA from single legs of specimens up to 150 years old.    Collaborations:  With Jeff Rosenfeld (Rutgers University): Comparative genomics of mosquito genomes to look for enriched functional categories involved in the transmission of Zika virus (Culicid mosquitos) and falciparum malaria (Anopheline mosquitos). With Wiebke Feindt (visiting scholar from Germany): assembly and comparison of transcriptomes from several species of Megaloprepus (giant damselflies).  With Paul Goldstein (USDA/Smithsonian): assembly and comparison of transcriptomes from North American Noctuoids to determine phylogenetic relationships and the evolution of host plant associations.
