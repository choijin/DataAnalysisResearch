<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to understand how preconditioning of the magnetotail during periods of northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) or high solar wind velocity affects the inner magnetosphere.  During northward IMF a cold dense plasma sheet forms which when the IMF subsequently turns southward flows into the inner magnetosphere. It appears as super-dense plasma at synchronous orbit and then becomes accelerated and contributes to the ring current. While it is generally accepted that this process occurs the parameters that control it, how the energization takes place and the effects are not well understood. This study will use the OpenGGCM global MHD simulation coupled with two ring current models (the Rice Convection Model (RCM) and the Comprehensive Ring Current Model (CRCM)).  Model results will be analyzed to understand the process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Disturbances in the solar wind, most notably coronal mass ejections from the Sun, impact the plasma environment within the Earth?s magnetosphere, the region where Earth?s geomagnetic field dominates. This so-called "space weather" transfers energy and plasma into the magnetosphere, which ultimately affects the near-Earth plasma environment, or "inner magnetosphere." Plasma is injected into this region from the nightside magnetosphere, or magnetotail, through a combination of steady and transient injections. There is significant debate about the relative importance of these processes, and the character of the injections themselves. In this study, we use simulations of the global magnetosphere to investigate transient injections to determine their relative importance in transporting plasma into the inner magnetosphere as well as the effect that different types of solar wind disturbances have. We find that transient injections are responsible for the vast majority of the plasma injected into the inner magnetosphere and that the velocity of these injections is dependent on the strength of the geomagnetic storm response and the type of solar wind disturbance.  As in previous studies, we also find that these plasma injections have a signature in the auroral ionosphere, namely so-called Poleward Boundary Intensifications (PGIs) and Auroral Streamers.   These play an important role in magnetospheric substorms.  There is a long-standing debate as to how long it takes for an explosive process, such as magnetic reconnection, to propagate to the ionosphere.  Traditional view holds that waves traveling along the "Tamao Path" transmit that information, and that it takes of the order of 2-5 minutes for the waves to travel that distance.  We found that there is another path along lobe field lines that allows for much faster propagation, on the order of 60 seconds.  This finding has important implications for the relative timing of observations and the ongoing search for the substorm trigger.
