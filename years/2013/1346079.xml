<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is focused on development of a novel manufacturing method for producing compartmentalized vacuum composites that exhibit superior thermal and structural efficiency. The proposed efforts will enable mass production of these materials and assembly into appropriate sizes and shapes, while maintaining vacuum inside the panels. The limited insulation capability and mechanical performance of foam-based insulation currently used for temperature-sensitive shipments require thicker walls and a large amount of cooling agent to maintain payload temperature. This reduces the payload volume and limits re-usability. There is an opportunity to develop highly insulating, structurally efficient materials that can significantly increase insulation capacity and longevity of cold chain shipping containers. Compartmentalized vacuum composite prototypes will be manufactured and tested for mechanical and thermal insulation properties using accredited testing methods. Key manufacturing and quality parameters will be confirmed for lab-scale and industrial-scale production. Successful completion of this work will result in a novel manufacturing method which will enable highly efficient (five to ten times improvement in insulation) cold chain shipping solutions. The proposed materials will provide sustainable economic and environmental benefits and are poised to replace polystyrene and vacuum insulation panels currently used in cold chain shipping. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project could eventually extend to cold chain shipping, storage, building insulation, automobiles, aerospace and other advanced markets. The first application is in the cold chain shipping industry for highly sensitive materials. Based on the proposed technology, a new generation of lightweight, evenly-insulated, durable, and long-lasting containers will be realized. Temperature-sensitive products such as life-saving vaccines and blood can be shipped using these containers. These containers will offer longer shipping duration, high impact resistance, and re-usability. Customers in the cold chain shipping market include blood banks, the Red Cross, pharmacies, clinical trial shippers, diagnostic centers, and life science material providers. The annual United States market potential in life sciences packaging is estimated at $291 million. Successful completion of the proposed objectives will result in a versatile insulating structural material that will also find application in infrastructure, automobiles, aircraft, marine, computing, commercial electronics and other household applications.</AbstractNarration>
