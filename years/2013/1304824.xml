<AbstractNarration>This award will support investigators from a consortium of 50 herbaria at universities, botanical gardens, and natural history museums across the U.S. to digitize their collections of macroalgae.  When they have finished, high resolution images and information about when and where each specimen was collected will be openly accessible for more than a million specimens through the consortium's web portal and the iDigBio web resource.  Macroalgae are the foundation of marine, estuarine and freshwater benthic ecosystems providing food, substrata and protection for a myriad of other aquatic organisms. Many macroalgal species are sensitive to environmental change.  The data provided through the portal will allow researchers and the public at large determine how macroalgal biodiversity and our aquatic ecosystems have changed over the past 150 years as a result of climate change, bioinvasions, and a wide range of human activity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of macroalgal species, including kelp, nori, and others are grown extensively via aquaculture or harvested from the wild for human food and for extraction of colloids used in cosmetics, food products, and pharmaceuticals. The consortium's web portal will provide opportunities for the public to learn about the economic and ecological importance of macroalgae.  Tools will be provided for citizen scientists to contribute to the project by helping transcribe some of the ancillary details from specimen labels into the database.  Interactive exhibits and educational modules will be developed by the education departments of the museums in the consortium where hundreds of thousands of visitors will experience them each year.  The project will also provide integrative training in collections and informatics research for undergraduate and graduate students through participation in the digitization effort and through internships at one of the museums.  This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The funding from this award enabled the University of Washington Herbarium at the Burke Museum to database, image, georeference (assign latitude and longitude values for the purpose of mapping) and present online its entire macroalgae collection of over 17,000 specimens.  The collective term for this process is digitization.  The majority of the specimens digitized were marine algae from coastal western North American. A very small percentage was from other marine habitats in eastern North America and Australasia.  Through subawards of this grant we facilitated the digitization of marine algae collections at Oregon State University, University of Alaska-Fairbanks, University of Alaska-Juneau, and Friday Harbor Labs of the University of Washington.  Staff also corrected geospatial values for all marine algae of Washington and Oregon that appeared errantly plotted when viewed through the Consortium of Pacific Northwest Herbaria online database (http://www.pnwherbaria.org/data/search.php).  Staff also databased and georeferenced macroalgae specimens from the University of California-Santa Barbara.  All data captured from this project are freely available online through the project website Macroalgal Herbarium Consortium Portal (http://macroalgae.org/portal/index.php). Digitized specimen data from the University of Washington, University of Alaska branches, and Oregon State University are also available online at the Consortium of Pacific Northwest Herbaria online database (http://www.pnwherbaria.org/data/search.php).  Completion of this work creates free, worldwide access for both researchers and the general public to macroalgae collections across the U.S.  Many of these collections are supported by public funds, which is one reason why public access to the collections is important.  Digital collections provide a foundation for macroalgae research in areas that include taxonomy, ecology, invasive species biology, and climate change impacts on marine communities.  Undergraduate students at University of Washington, University of Alaska branches, and Oregon State University participated in this project.  These students gained experience with relational database software, digital photography, georeferencing software, information management, and overall project management.  These are skills and experiences that are applicable to both their academic studies and professional careers.        Last Modified: 10/10/2017       Submitted by: David E Giblin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
