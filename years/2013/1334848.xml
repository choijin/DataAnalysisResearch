<AbstractNarration>The PIs request funding to build and test robust eddy correlation instruments for unidirectional and oscillating flow environments based on sturdy fiber- and planar-optical sensors and novel signal-processing electronics. The new hardware will be supported by software development to correct potential flux underestimations caused by inadequate oxygen sensor response time and spatial offsets between oxygen and flow sensors. The fragility of the thin glass microelectrode used in aquatic eddy correlation instruments severely limits the use of this powerful technique for flux measurements in benthic environments. This problem represents the major bottleneck preventing the widespread use of this approach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs have very strong records both in spreading the use of EC technology through the community and in graduate and undergraduate education. They outline clearly the ways in which they will continue their ongoing endeavors in both areas. In addition, the application of this technology to the geochemistry and ecology of shallow-water regions has broad implications for carbon cycling and ocean acidification studies, both of which have important societal ramifications. Better quantify oxygen fluxes in the aquatic environment is important for society. It can e.g. help predict when and if the health of an aquatic system is being weakened, and when e.g. hypoxia or anoxia is approaching. Anoxia leads to death of all higher life</AbstractNarration>
