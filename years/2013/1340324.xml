<AbstractNarration>Participation in undergraduate research has often been presented as a mechanism to improve student retention in a discipline and as a means to inspire more students to pursue graduate studies.  Past studies have concentrated on studying the effects of undergraduate research experiences (UREs) on high-achieving students ? but these students are already likely to graduate and are more likely to pursue graduate studies.  Because non-elite students are often at risk for leaving engineering programs and are less likely to pursue graduate studies than high-achieving students, the proposed project begins a study of the benefits of participation in UREs for ?average? engineering students with respect to their educational and professional development.  The primary focus of this research initiation project is developing definitions of success for different types of students, with categories determined through classification of the academic and personal background of the students. Following the determination of the definitions, a pilot study involving a representative fraction of undergraduate students who participate in engineering research activities at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) is to be conducted to confirm the appropriateness of the definitions of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this work is that it expands the study of the benefits of UREs to average engineering students ? a population of students that it is important to nurture through to graduation in order to increase the number of engineers produced in the United States.  By determining appropriate definitions of success of URE participation for a wide range of students and then testing the definitions in a pilot study, this project begins to determine if increasing URE participation to a larger percentage of engineering students is useful and appropriate.  Furthermore, this project begins to identify the elements of a URE that are most beneficial for different groups of students.  The broader impact of this work is the potential to significantly influence the future directions of research experiences of undergraduate engineering students.  By determining different expectations for various types of students and research programs, this project provides engineering educators with realistic expectations of undergraduate research on the education and preparation of future engineers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There is considerable interest in increasing the number of undergraduate engineering students who participate in research experiences before graduation.  While some studies have considered the impacts of these undergraduate research experiences (UREs) on students, most of these studies have concentrated on high-achieving students; such students have typically been the students who have pursued UREs.  However, if an increase in the number of students pursuing UREs is to be realized, then we will need to encourage more "average" engineering students to engage in UREs.  In this project, we sought to develop a definition of what a successful URE would be for "average" engineering students, who are primarily focused on graduating and getting a job as an engineer in industry.  To do this, we surveyed and interviewed students who have participated in UREs, faculty members who have mentored URE students, and industrial representatives.  The student and faculty surveys focused on what benefits the students received in the UREs, and the industrial surveys targeted learning what employers want in new graduates and what they see as lacking in new graduates.  From these, we developed the following definition of a successful URE for "average" engineering student.  The goals for a successful URE for average engineering students are   1)  The URE should develop applied engineering, problem solving, and critical thinking skills of the students to help prepare them for a career as an engineer, likely in industry.   2)  The URE should improve the communication skills of the student.   3)  The URE should increase the confidence of the student in their abilities, their independence and self-sufficiency, and help clarify their career goals.   4)  The URE should help the student learn to work as part of a team.   5)  The URE should provide the students with an understanding of how to conduct a research project.  In addition to this definition, some potential opportunities for using UREs to better a student's education were identified.  For example, from the faculty input, it was realized that students can be educated in a practical sense on safety protocols that should be used in labortory settings.  While students receive such training in lab classes, having to adhere to safety protocols on a daily basis while working on a project will help engrain that knowledge in the students.  It was also identified that UREs can act as a vehicle to directly connect students to the wider engineering profession.  UREs offer the potential to have students present the results of their work at conferences, meetings with sponsoring organizations, reports to such organizations, or even through journal publications.  This then connects the students to a wider community which can provide feedback on their work and lead to improved performance by the students.  The work also identified areas that further study are needed.  For example, the definition includes both the developing of the independence of the students and the teamwork skils of the students.  But it was not clear from this study as to what practices can lead to the development of both of those skills.  More exploration of this topic is needed before a list of best practices can be developed.  Another area that needs further study is how the student-mentor relationship impacts the student development.  Some students expressed that a great deal of interaction is needed, while others indicated that they prefer smaller levels of interaction.  Further study is needed as to how to determine the optimal level of mentor-student interaction.  The intellectual merit of this work is that with this definition of a successful URE for engineering students, we now have a solid foundation from which to develop UREs that meet the needs of a broad-range of engineering students.  This definition can now be used as a foundation to assess the success of UREs with regards to the professional development of the students as engineers.  The broader impact of this work relates to how the preparation of engineers in the United States could be changed through improved UREs for students.  By using the definition of a successful URE, faculty can develop UREs that focus in on the development of professional skills needed by students to be successful practicing engineers in industry.  If more widespread adoption of using better-designed UREs in engineering education occurs, the UREs could then lead to students being prepared to be better engineers upon entering the workforce; in turn, this can lead to societal advancement as the products and services produced by those engineers become available.
