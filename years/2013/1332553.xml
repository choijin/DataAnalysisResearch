<AbstractNarration>The project at Central State University will infuse shale gas extraction principles into an integrated geosciences curriculum; engage faculty in providing innovative research experiences for undergraduates in the application of environmental engineering principles on shale gas production; and develop a certification program in shale gas technology. The project's focus on teaching and training students in shale gas technology is consistent with the needs of the state of Ohio and its shale gas economy. In collaboration with partner universities, Central State University will expand instruction and research in different facets of shale development such as site development, preparation for drilling, drilling, fracturing, well completion and fracturing fluids management. The certificate program will require an internship in the industry in addition to courses in cognate areas. The project will enhance institutional research capacity in the areas of geophysics, hydraulic fracturing fluids treatment and management, and air quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will impact the participation of underrepresented groups in the geosciences field and the shale gas industry. The project has an important emphasis on environmental impact in its educational and research program plan specifically integrating green engineering principles, optimization of water resources allocation, and other environmental solutions and conservation. Research experiences for undergraduate students will involve their participation in finding solutions to some of the major environmental challenges associated with fracturing for shale oil, in particular, the techniques for addressing treatment and cleaning of caustic flow water backflow. The curricular and research enhancements of the geoscience program will position Central State University as a regional leader at the forefront of geoscience research and instruction.</AbstractNarration>

The goal of this project is to infuse shale based oil and natural gas technologies into uniquely integrated geosciences curricula within the department of Water Resources Management at Central State University. &nbsp;The curricula comprises of B.S. programs in Water Resources Management, Environmental Engineering, Geology, and Geography. &nbsp;The shale gas extraction requires pumping large amounts of water (about 3 to 9 million gallons per each well drilled) under high pressure containing sand, surfactants, chemical additives, acids and other special chemicals to release the natural gas trapped in the shale by a process known as &ldquo;hydraulic fracturing&rsquo;. The wastewater that &ldquo;flows back&rdquo; up the well and the product shale gas contain dissolved solids, oils, trace metals, volatile and semi volatile organic compounds. The grand challenge is separation of shale gas from the &ldquo;flow back&rdquo; wastewater and its disposal or reuse in an environmental friendly manner. Other challenges include allocation of available water resources for shale gas production without impacting other users and the impact of the activity on the original forested and agricultural lands.The first objective of the project was to develop a certification program in &ldquo;Water management in Oil and Gas Industry&rdquo; by enhancing existing courses in our integrated geosciences curriculum within the department. The certification program was developed with three core courses including GEL 3305 Geophysics, GEL 4450 Special problems in Geology &ndash; Drilling, Fracturing, and Development, and GEO 3370 Introduction to GIS and five elective courses from ENE 3315 Fundamentals of Air Quality Engineering, ENE 4415 Water Supply, ENE 4430 Wastewater Treatment Systems, GEO 4470 Advanced GIS and WRM 3308 Water and Environmental law. The first outcome is the curricula in Introduction to GIS and Advanced GIS courses were enhanced by including the land use and land cover changes in one of the actively producing oil and gas regions in the Appalachian region. Data on the oil and gas producing watershed from satellite imagery, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), aerial photos, oil/gas field and wells data, and hydrological data was used and signal processing using the ENVI remote sensing software. The second outcome was enhancement of Fundamentals of Air Quality Engineering course with a two week period of classes on greenhouse gas emissions and on traffic related air pollution and its modeling, and an hour lecture on water issues of hydraulic fracturing.

The first outcome was mapping of the oil/ gas field for Muskingum watershed in the Appalachian region using Landsat satellite imagery, Digital Elevation Model, aerial photos, oil/gas field and wells data, and hydrological data. The second outcome was evaluation of the land use/land cover change due to gas and oil development using Landsat satellite image and aerial photos. The third outcome was development of an index to assess the impact of hydraulic fracturing on water resources. This index quantified impacts on the water quantity, water quality, the environment, water cost and the legislations. Six counties in the eastern Ohio were used for model validation and assessment.
