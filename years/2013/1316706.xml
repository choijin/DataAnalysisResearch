<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Peter W. Graham at Stanford University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Standard Model of Particle Physics has been tremendously successful, yet leaves many questions unanswered.  Data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has begun to reveal the physics of the TeV scale but there is much still to be discovered, including the nature of dark matter and the resolution of the hierarchy problem.  Professor Graham will calculate the consequences of recent LHC results for well-motivated theories of physics beyond the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry.  It is anticipated that this project will lead to the discovery of new types of experimental signals that can be probed at the LHC, including different types of displaced vertices and fractionally charged particles.  Additionally, Professor Graham will design a new type of dark-matter detector.  While a large number of experiments are searching for Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter, it is very difficult to search for the equally well-motivated axion dark matter, and indeed most of the allowed parameter space for axion dark matter remains unreachable by current experiments.  Professor Graham will propose new signals of axions and axion-like particles, including a time-oscillating nuclear electric dipole moment (EDM), and will design a detector based on nuclear magnetic resonance technology to search for this oscillating EDM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will also have significant broader impacts.  Professor Graham will be actively involved in science education, including designing curricula and courses for undergraduate and graduate students.  He will also have significant involvement with K-12 physics education.  Professor Graham has developed strong connections with several local public elementary schools and will work actively on promoting awareness and understanding of modern topics in physics research.  This includes directly educating the students and teachers, running labs in the classroom, and giving tours of modern physics laboratories.  Professor Graham will also work actively with graduate students and postdocs on research, training them to become theoretical particle physicists.  He will also continue to make connections with other subfields of physics, including astrophysics, atomic physics, and condensed-matter physics, bringing closer collaboration amongst these different fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The nature of dark matter is one of the most important mysteries in modern physics.  Dark matter makes up the vast majority of matter in our universe, and yet we do not know what it is.  We also know that it is not contained in the fundamental laws of nature that are currently known (the so-called "Standard Model" of particle physics).  The search for dark matter is thus not only the search for the majority of matter in our universe, it is also the search for new fundamental laws of nature.  The search for dark matter is a major focus of modern physics.  This project involved the invention, design, and proposal of several new types of experimental techniques to search for dark matter.  In particular this project focused on dark matter candidates which are not being well searched for in current experiments, for example axions and hidden photons.  Several new experiments have arisen from this including for example the Cosmic Axion Spin Precession Experiment (CASPEr) which is now funded and under construction.  In addition, it was shown that the framework of the axion has a unique ability to address the hierarchy problem of the Standard Model, a problem that has been the central focus of research in particle theory for the past 30 years. The hierarchy problem arises from an elementary observation: the gravitational force is orders of magnitude weaker than the other fundamental forces of nature. This is due to the fact that the mass of the Higgs boson is many orders of magnitude smaller than the fundamental scale of quantum gravity. All previous solutions to this problem, such as supersymmetry, require the existence of new particles that have not been observed at the Large Hadron Collider. These solutions were based on the implicit assumption that the mass of the Higgs was a fundamental constant of nature. In contrast, the new mechanism of dynamical relaxation does not require new physics at the Large Hadron Collider.
