<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Jeffrey Pyun and Richard Glass of the University of Arizona and Michael Mackay of the University of Delaware will explore polymer chemistry to utilize elemental sulfur as a monomer feedstock to prepare majority sulfur copolymers.  Elemental sulfur exhibits a number of useful electrochemical and optical properties.  However, due to its low solubility and compatibility with the majority of organic compounds, the preparation of sulfur-based polymers, with a majority content of sulfur has not been extensively explored.  A bulk polymerization method, inverse vulcanization, that uses molten liquid sulfur as the reaction medium and as a comonomer for the synthesis of sulfur-rich copolymers will be studied.  New styrenic comonomers with varying reactive functionality will be prepared and their copolymerization with sulfur will be examined.  Chemical, mechanical and electrochemical characterization of these sulfur based polymers will be performed, and the polymers will be evaluated as electrode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries.  The broader impacts of the proposal involve the potential uses of the polymers in lithium-sulfur battery technologies, and the creation of new research classes and lectures at the Tucson High Magnet School.  International activities will link the University of Arizona with Seoul National University and students at both institutions will work together to improve technical communication and writing skills.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research aims to utilize waste sulfur in the preparation a new class of plastics.  Elemental sulfur is a waste product from petroleum refining and natural gas production, and in this research project new chemical processes will be explored that combine organic plastics with sulfur in ways that will create useful new materials.  This research could lead to new technologies that may impact battery industries and well as commercial uses of plastic materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major activities engaged with this from 2017-2018 as a NCE has focused on development of new polymerization methods using elemental sulfur to prepare polymeric materials and mentoring of graduate students (Yueyan Zhang, Metin Katayilan).  Yueyan Zhang is finishing her research for her dissertation, which is the primary reason for the NCE to finalize this research.  The final targets of her research was on the organocatalysis and low temperature polymerization of sulfur and polysulfides to prepare new functional sulfur based materials, which was done solely at the University of Arizona.  Discovery of new small molecule, organocatalysts to accelerates the rates of  copolymerization of elemental sulfur and with a wider range of functional monomers.  To date our polymerizations with elemental sulfur, a process termed inverse vulcanization, is limited to elevated temperatures (T  ~ 160-180 &deg;C), since liquid sulfur is used as the comonomer and reaction medium.
