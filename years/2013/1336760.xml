<AbstractNarration>PI: Manuel, Lance / Basu, Sukanta&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1336760 / 1336304&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Texas at Austin / North Carolina State University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Collaborative Research: A retrospective assessment and future projection of thunderstorm impacts on the field performance of wind turbines&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In wind resource-rich regions such as the U.S. Great Plains, wind energy development in recent years has increased at a brisk rate in recent years. Climatologically, this region is also where severe weather events such as thunderstorms are common; failures of wind turbines in recent events suggest a need for retrospective analysis and re-evaluation of design for associated transient inflow conditions. To meet the nation?s goals of 20% wind energy by 2030 more wind turbines will likely be sited in the Great Plains where failures in extreme weather events are expected; suggested climate change influences on the changing frequency and severity of such events exacerbates concerns about today?s turbine designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to develop advanced mesoscale and large-eddy-simulation (LES) procedures for the generation of thunderstorm-related inflow wind fields, informed and validated by diverse data streams, so as to make possible safe design and assessment of future wind turbines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is structured in four phases. In Phase 1, PIs will consider about 20 case studies representing severe weather events recorded in West Texas over the period, 2005-2012. A wide array of data sets for these events is available for validation of the 4-D mesoscale-LES inflow fields that will be developed. These flow fields will be employed in aeroelastic simulation of loads on single utility-scale wind turbine units as well as arrays. In Phase 2, PIs will assess the validity of ?engineering? simulation models based on older field campaigns (e.g., NIMROD and JAWS) against physics-based and data-driven mesoscale-LES models. The focus in Phase 3 of this project is on the development of low-dimensional representations of the inflow wind fields to be used to predict turbine loads accurately and efficiently. This will take coordination between the two collaborating researcher teams with complementary non-overlapping expertise. Consideration of turbine extreme and fatigue limit states over the long term will guide the low- dimensional model development. Finally, in Phase 4, PIs tackle the future projection component of this study. Armed with the inflow modeling from the previous phases, PIs address life-cycle performance of turbine units and arrays. Over a service life of 20 years, a turbine may be expected to experience several extreme weather events. For candidate Great Plains sites, PIs will examine anticipated load profiles on turbine components over the long term, taking into consideration changing climate effects (such as in changes in the frequency and severity of thunderstorms), informed by climate model data and with considerations for uncertainty. PIs expect, thus, to provide a picture of expected performance (and uncertainty on the same) of turbine units as they are considered in the context of failure against ultimate and fatigue limit states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students involved in the research effort will develop skills in statistical modeling, boundary layer meteorology, turbulence simulation, aeroelastic and structural analysis, and reliability-based design procedures for wind turbines against extreme and fatigue limit states. While these skills are not part of a typical curriculum, there is a dire need for trained engineers who can assist with analyses of the kind that will be developed in this project. Indeed, today, for advanced analysis, consulting assistance is routinely sought from Western Europe. The PIs will provide education and training/internship opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students of engineering and atmospheric sciences to serve this economically vibrant industry. Minority undergraduate students will be engaged as research assistants through the Texas Research EXperience (TREX) program. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory will provide summer internship opportunities for students, and collaboration opportunities in research between their engineers and the PIs and their students. K-12 student and teacher involvement in planned STEM learning is planned with the Science House program at North Carolina State University.</AbstractNarration>

Due to the fairly small spatio-temporal scale of some downbursts and the low elevations at which the maximum wind speeds occur, observations of the full wind field during a downburst event are difficult to obtain. Thus, computational modeling has gained in importance for understanding the physical processes and wind field characteristics of downbursts. While most downburst simulations have generally only assumed a neutral atmospheric boundary layer, it is of interest to also consider the influence of convective and stable boundary layers during downburst.&nbsp; As well, only a few studies have included ambient turbulence in the simulated wind fields.&nbsp; In this project, these limitations have been addressed. Using a pseudo-spectral large-eddy simulation code called (called MATLES), idealized downburst wind fields have been generated at high resolution for various hours during the evening transition period when downbursts most often occur (see Figure 1).&nbsp; By considering different atmospheric stability regimes, it is found that although maximum winds can be at similar levels regardless of stability, the turbulence in the convective boundary layer generally decreases the downdraft wind speed and shortens the life of the strong outflow wind field evolution.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The project team also worked on the development of new methodologies for the realistic simulations of thunderstorms and associated wind fields.&nbsp; In this regard, a diverse suite of LES codes (CM1, WRF-LES, and MATLES) were employed (with some modifications) in conjunction with a state-of-the art mesoscale model (WRF).&nbsp; A new deep convection initiation approach, involving only a few tuning parameters, was proposed and compared against the more widely used &ldquo;warm bubble&rdquo; technique (see Figure 2).&nbsp; Realistic thunderstorm simulations were performed and sensitivities to various parameterizations (e.g., microphysics) were investigated.&nbsp; As an illustration, a recent thunderstorm event that caused extensive damage to a wind farm over the U.S. Great Plains (the Buffalo Ridge wind farm) was studied in great detail and results were reported in a journal article (see Figure 3).&nbsp; The team also simulated several historical downburst events, including the often-cited Andrews Air Force Base event of 1983.&nbsp; Throughout the project, both field observational and laboratory datasets were systematically utilized (e.g., via scaling analyses) for model validation. One of the unique aspects of this project was that a wide range of statistical tools (including wavelets and proper orthogonal decomposition) was utilized to better understand inherent characteristics of winds and turbulence during thunderstorm downbursts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Following the generation of these downburst wind fields, next, flow fields at wind turbine scale were extracted from the lower portions of the computational domain&rsquo;s large-scale downburst winds.&nbsp; Several non-overlapping turbine-scale slices around the line of the simulated downburst&rsquo;s trajectory were considered (see Figure 4).&nbsp; For each of these slices, downburst winds were studied for turbine-scale wind field statistics; as well, loads on a utility-scale 5-MW wind turbine were generated using aeroelastic response simulations with the LES-based inflow fields on the slices (see Figure 5).

Realistic thunderstorm simulations were performed and sensitivities to various parameterizations (e.g., microphysics) were investigated.  As an illustration, a recent thunderstorm event that caused extensive damage to a wind farm over the U.S. Great Plains (the Buffalo Ridge wind farm) was studied in great detail and results were reported in a journal article (see Figure 3).

Wind turbine extreme and fatigue load statistics were studied for these various cases using time-domain simulations of turbine loads.  Simulated loads and derived extremes were compared against conventional approaches and significant differences were noted.  It is envisaged that these new results will provide valuable guidance in improved and safer design of modern wind turbines.
