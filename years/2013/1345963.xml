<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to increase the effectiveness of oxidative enzymes of high potential in chemical synthesis and chemical remediation applications.  Enzyme-based systems, the greenest and most energy efficient processes known to-date, are replacing chemical-based systems due to their superior potential for energy savings and environmental benefits. While at the forefront of the green chemistry revolution, however, enzyme-based systems are difficult to come by. Their adoption has not been as fast, as widespread, or as beneficial as it otherwise could be because oxidative enzymes are not cost effective enough to replace chemicals. This project is developing an integrated technology for oxidative enzymes for industrial use. The project objectives consist of (1) manufacturing continuous flow reactors dedicated to processing ZYMtronix?s catalysts, (2) developing a synthesis process for key pharmaceutical precursors used in cancer treatment, and (3) demonstrating the remediation application for industrial contaminants. The anticipated technical results will benchmark reactor characteristics and the catalytic metrics of the aforementioned processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader commercial potential of this project is to facilitate the adoption of oxidative enzymes in synthesis and remediation applications because they can replace precious metal catalysts, toxic solvents, and energy intensive processes.  Additional benefits translate to safer processes and products for manufacturers, consumers and the environment. ZYMtronix patent-pending technology is estimated to be substantially more efficient and cost effective to operate when compared with chemical systems, increasing enzyme activity, decreasing enzyme inhibition, and expanding the enzyme´s range of operable conditions. Combined with proprietary reactors being developed, the catalysts can be recycled for continuous use. ZYMtronix´s technology serves the fine chemicals, pharmaceutical, as well as the water remediation, markets applicable to oxidative enzyme processes.</AbstractNarration>
