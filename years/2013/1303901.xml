<AbstractNarration>This work explores the hypothesis that parasitic chytrids (fungi) may change the seasonal cycle of ice algal abundances and diversity by targeting specific ice algal taxa, mainly certain diatom species. In addressing this hypothesis, this grant aims at providing information on the spatial and temporal patterns of abundance, and diversity of marine fungi in arctic sea ice in comparison to water column information and relate this information to various environmental data which will include salinity, temperature, and as well as ice thickness and snow cover. Field work will be conducted between 2014 and 2015 on the fast ice in Barrow and in spring of 2015 on RV Sikulaq in the Bering sea. The combined data set will allow for a refined interpretation of the relevance of the parasitic fungi for the food web structure in arctic seas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study is the first to explore these ecological processes in polar sea ice and can potentially lead to a paradigm change on carbon processing similar to one seen recently in freshwater science. Detailed studies on marine chytrids are rare in any ice covered marine region and these observations might stimulate new research in both Arctic and Antarctic regions. Biological community composition information will contribute to diversity research on fungi in general and the understanding of global patterns in microbial biodiversity linked. The research will have broader impacts in its engagement in teaching activities through training of two participating UAF students and through high school seminars as well as meeting with teachers in Barrow, and their potential participation in expeditions. A broad public audience including minorities will be kept informed through media coverage and project-specific web pages documenting the field and lab work.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this project was to characterize he diversity, seasonality and function of parasitic fungi in Arctic sea ice. Fungi comprise a group of microorganisms that are well known from terrestrial environments but poorly understood in the marine environment, especially remote, extreme environments like the Arctic. As the Arctic's sea ice cover continues its precipitious decline, our understanding of the algal-based ecosystem within sea ice becomes ever more important as we prepare for a future with little or no summer sea ice. Predicting future changes in marine food web processes, including parasitism, is impossible without a clear understanding of the mechanisms at play today. Using field work, culturing, and advanced DNA sequencing technologies, we identified new parasitic fungi from the Arctic [Hassett et al. 2015, Ducluzeau et al. 2018], we described the distribution of these microorganisms across the entire western Arctic [Hassett et al. 2017, Hassett and Gradinger 2017, R?m? et al. 2017], and we provided experimental support for their importance in modulating the bloom of ice algae that supports a marine food web leading all the ways to humans [Hassett and Gradinger 2016].</p> <p><br />In our efforts to identify fungal marine parasites, we focused first on culturing novel microorganisms. This successfully led to the cultivation of two new species of marine saprotrophic (plant- or algae-eating) microbes, isolated from the Bering Sea. While not technically fungi, these microorganisms are, like fungi, deeply branching protists within the tree of life, and provide new insights into the role of single celled parasites in the marine environment. Named Sphaeroforma sirkka and Sphaeroforma napiecek, the discovery of these species increases the geographical range, cellular variation and life history complexity of the Mesomycetozoea [Hassett et al. 2015]. Using long-read nanopore sequencing technology, we obtained the first complete genome sequence for Sphaeroforma sirkka [Ducluzea et al. 2018], which was 111 million basepairs long. This genome will be useful for understanding the evolution of metazoa, including humans by providing a deeply branching example from the eukaryotic tree of life [Ducluzea et al. 2018].</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our next focus was on describing the overall diversity and distribution of these microorganisms. Using targeted field campaigns in Alaska and collaborative sampling in Canada, Greenland, and Svalbard, we investigated the spatial distribution of fungi in the western Arctic and sub-Arctic. Using high throughput methods to sequence 18S rRNA, cloned and sequenced 28S rRNA, and microscopically counted parasite-infected diatoms, we found that a single clade of fungi, the Chytridiomycota, predominated in fungal communities under ice with low snowpack [Hassett et al. 2017, Rama et al. 2017]. Microscopic examination of seawater and sea ice samples revealed chytrids parasitizing diatoms collected across the Arctic, notably infecting 25% of a single diatom species in the Bering Sea [Hassett et al. 2017].</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Further experimentation showed that Chytridiomycota dominated fungal communities in sea ice and that parasitism by these organisms was linked to light intensities and algal stress, factors that may be increasing in a warmer future Arctic [Hassett and Gradinger 2017]. Over the seasonal cycle of sea ice growth and melt, these parasites appeared to be infective only in April, during the bloom of ice algae. Experimental manipulations during this time period clearly demonstrated that environmental factors, like snow depth (as a proxy for light transmittance), affected the susceptibility of the algae to parasitism, and thus the effectiveness of the chytrids at limiting the size of the ice algal bloom [Hassett and Gradinger 2016, Hassett and Gradinger 2017].</p> <p>References<br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>BT Hassett, JA L?pez, R Gradinger (2015) Two new species of marine saprotrophic sphaeroformids in the Mesomycetozoea isolated from the sub-Arctic Bering Sea.
