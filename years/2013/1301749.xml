<AbstractNarration>2013 SUNY LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate at the University at Albany:  Project Summary   &lt;br/&gt;The  State  University  of  New  York  Louis  Stokes  Alliance  for  Minority  Participation  (SUNY  LSAMP)  is  ready  to  immediately  put  into  place  its  eighth  cohort  of  Bridge  to  the  Doctorate  (BD)  students  at the University at Albany. This  new  cohort  will  build  on  our  six previous  efforts   that  have  not  only  significantly  added to  the UREP  STEM  graduate  enrollment  and  masters  and  doctoral  degrees  but  have  also  led  to  important  changes  in  the  culture  and  practice  of  STEM  education  in  ways  that  not  only  help  UREP  students  but  all  graduate  STEM  students.   &lt;br/&gt;C1. Project Goals and Objectives&lt;br/&gt;The goals and objectives of the SUNY LSAMP 2013 Bridge to the Doctorate Program at Albany are:&lt;br/&gt;To recruit 12 LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate students by:&lt;br/&gt;-  Using recruitment pathways that we have developed that target the state and national LSAMP pool and recruit students from a variety of LSAMP institutions and STEM majors.&lt;br/&gt;-  Having a selection process that works with STEM departments and SUNY AGEP to choose talented LSAMP students who will succeed with program support&lt;br/&gt;To design and implement a program that helps students successfully complete two years of STEM graduate study by:&lt;br/&gt;-  Providing a comprehensive set of services that monitor student progress, builds a strong BD community, builds BD students? academic and professional skills and uses UREP STEM graduate students as mentors and instructors wherever possible&lt;br/&gt;- Collaborating with other NSF and state and federal programs to make the best use of program resources by integrating BD students into the existing network of activities and programs&lt;br/&gt;-  Assessing the success of program services through external evaluation and developing new or modified activities or interventions based on the results of this evaluation  &lt;br/&gt;To make sure that BD students enter and successfully complete doctoral study and then move into academia and the high technology workplace by:&lt;br/&gt;-  Helping students to successfully gain admission into doctoral programs&lt;br/&gt;-  Preparing BD students to apply for NSF and other graduate fellowships &lt;br/&gt;-  Working with STEM departments, The  Office of Graduate Studies and the Carson Carr Fellowship program to develop plans to provide a formal pathway to PhD programs that include financial support for BD students after the two years of BD NSF support ends&lt;br/&gt;- Working with STEM departments to provide academic support where needed to help students through doctoral study &lt;br/&gt;- Maintaining an effective system for tracking students after they leave the BD program through their educational career and professional work experience&lt;br/&gt;To promote systemic change in graduate STEM policy and practices in ways that will increase the success of individual students on the doctoral pathway and the effectiveness of UREP STEM graduate education by: &lt;br/&gt;-   Using resources from multiple sources to examine broad issues related to UREP STEM graduate education using the BD, AGEP and UREP STEM graduate population&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL  MERIT  The  project  will  add  to  current  efforts  by  SUNY  LSAMP  to  build  research  capacity  in  STEM  education  in  the  area  of  graduate  education.  The  lessons  learned  from  the  study  of  the  Bridge  to  the  Doctorate  Program  will  be  put  into  the  context  of  broader  issues  of  systemic  change  and  disseminated  to  a  broad  national  audience    &lt;br/&gt;BROADER  IMPACT  Using  the  lessons  learned  from  this  project,  we  expect  to  continue  to  develop  and  refine  strategies  that  will  increase  the  recruitment  and  retention  of  UREP  STEM  graduate students.  This  will increase  the  number  of  UREP  STEM  students  who  successfully  complete  doctoral  degrees  in  STEM  disciplines  and  make  changes  in  STEM  departmental  culture  and  practice.</AbstractNarration>

This was achieved by using diverse recruitment and outreach efforts: hosted two national webinars, maintained active and sustained outreach to Directors within the national LSAMP listserv, enlisted support of Albany?s LSAMP staff, hosted campus visits for LSAMP institutions, made an on-site visit to the CUNY LSAMP consortium and met with LSAMP students.      2)  To design and implement a program that helps students successfully complete two years of STEM graduate study Outcome: Seven BD students are in diverse STEM doctoral programs at UAlbany: Engineering and Applied Science; Atmospheric Science; Biology; Behavioral Neuroscience and Biomedical Science; Environmental Health.  Two  BD  students earned their  master?s degree in 2016 and are now pursuing additional graduate credentials at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute  (admitted with full funding, Ph.D.) and Union/Clarkson University(Mathematics Teacher Education).  Two students will complete their master?s degree at UAlbany in the fall, 2016, and one student is in the workforce. Enrichment activities were developed to create a sense of community among BD fellows.  These activities include a three day orientation for new BD scholars, welcome receptions, a host of diverse workshops in both the fall and spring semesters, holiday potluck suppers with BD manager, luncheon and breakfast meetings, one-on-one meetings with the BD manager, and referral to other pertinent resources when required:   Career services, Academy of Sciences membership, UAlbany Counseling Center, etc.    3) To make sure that BD students enter and successfully complete doctoral study and then move into academia and the high technology workplace.   Outcome:  Eight of the twelve BD students are currently in doctoral programs (7 students at UAlbany and 1 student at RPI)    4) To promote systemic change in graduate STEM policy and practices in ways that will increase the success of individual students on the doctoral pathway and the effectiveness of UREP STEM graduate education.  Outcome:   UAlbany?s Bridge to the Doctorate program extends well beyond the confines of the local, Albany community.  Our students have been competitively selected for reputable summer research opportunities at NIA, Northwestern University, and University at Alabama, City University of New York, and Medgar Evers College.  More importantly, as testament to their academic excellence, two UAlbany Bridge to Doctorate students were recently conferred two highly sought and prestigious awards:  the 2016 NSF GRFP (Atmospheric Science major) and 2016 NIH Administrative Supplement (Biomedical Science major).    Of significant note, the BD recipient of the 2016 NSF GRFP was the only UAlbany doctoral student selected for this award in 2016.   Additionally, another BD doctoral student was featured in UAlbany?s News for outstanding scholarship in RNA research. Intellectual Merit  The University at Albany?s SUNY LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Program developed a program model that was successful in recruitment, retention, and graduation of talented  underrepresented minority (UREP) science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) graduate students.   BD has gained a positive reputation among STEM departments.  They seek its support, and view the program as a viable entity to ensure diversity among STEM students.  The Bridge to the Doctorate demonstrates the proper blend of support and services that has positively influenced persistence among students from diverse cultural backgrounds, and contributes to their academic success in STEM master?s and doctoral programs.   Broader Impact UAlbany?s Bridge to the Doctorate program has deployed numerous protocols to create of a community of scientists that will positively influence the future.   Our BD fellows have experienced rich learning environments to develop and refine their research abilities and will be better prepared to make an impact in the STEM professions as either active researchers or professors.   They are the next generation of scientists that will be at the vanguard of discovery in a wide range to STEM disciplines.
