<AbstractNarration>This project funds approximately 10-12 US-based graduate students to attend the Tenth Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI?13) to be held April 3-5, 2013 in Lombard, IL. Participation in NSDI and similar conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience and will provides students with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers in the &amp;#64257;eld, and exposes students to leading edge work in the &amp;#64257;eld. The conference focuses on the design principles of large-scale networks&lt;br/&gt;and distributed systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     This award was used to provide student travel support to allow students to attend the tenth Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI) in 2013.   The NSDI conference was created by and is sponsored by USENIX, SIGCOMM, and SIGOPS, the premier professional associations for researchers in networking and systems. NSDI focuses on the design principles and challenges in the construction of large-scale networks and distributed systems. Particular areas of interest include cloud services, wireless, internet routing, peer-to-peer systems, sensor nets, scalable web services, data center networking, distributed malware, and distributed network measurement. The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers from across the networking and systems community, including computer networking, distributed systems, and operating systems to foster cross-disciplinary approaches and to address shared research challenges.   NSDI 2013 was held in Lombard, IL April 2-5, 2013. There were 258 total attendees at NSDI Ã¦13. Of these, 211 were from the US. Non-US attendees came from: Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, Norway, Romania, Singapore, South Korea,Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.   The award enabled the participation of students who otherwise would not have been able to attend NSDI. Travel support was provided for thirteen students to attend NSDI.
