<AbstractNarration>Many birds and mammals are omnivorous, eating a wide variety of foods depending on changing availability or nutritional requirements, and the production of digestive enzymes may increase with availability of substrate in the diet. This mode of regulation maximizes the digestibility of substrates when they are at high dietary levels and minimizes the cost of synthesizing excess enzyme when the substrate is at low levels.  Building on past NSF-supported research, the PI will test hypotheses about the molecular regulatory basis of intestinal enzymatic flexibility. Research on digestive enzyme regulation in birds will either strengthen what may be an emerging generality (if in agreement with rodent studies) or transform current thinking about regulation of digestive enzymes.  The enhanced understanding will also improve predictions about birds' abilities to respond to changes in diet that occur due to habitat alterations or climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project I focuses on house sparrow (Passer domesticus) juveniles, which do exhibit intestinal carboydrase flexibility, and adults, which do not. The goal is to identify key molecular players and their rates of change in dietary modulation of intestinal carbohydrases and aminopeptidase-N in the juveniles, and test whether the carbohydrase expression regulatory machinery is silenced in the adults switched between diets.  Project II focuses on comparison of wild omnivorous representatives from passerine, nonpasserine, and rodent clades.  The goal is to test for differences in underlying gene expression regulatory mechanisms and their rates of change.  Using tissues harvested from animals fed contrasting diets, the PI will test for molecular mechanisms underlying enzymatic patterns of response and the time-course for regulatory responses. The research supports international collaboration and also training at postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduates and high school levels.  Data from these studies will be shared at national and international scientific conferences and through peer-reviewed publications.</AbstractNarration>

In other words, we would predict more protein- or peptide-digesting enzymes on higher protein diet, and more starch- and sugar-digesting enzymes on higher carbohydrate diet.  This maximizes the digestibility of substrates when they are at high dietary levels and minimizes the cost of synthesizing excess enzyme when the substrate is at low levels. We advanced knowledge about underlying mechanisms of digestive enzyme flexibility, using intestinal enzymes as the study system.          Project I focused on house sparrow (Passer domesticus) juveniles, which are a good model of flexibility because in nature the nestlings undergo a natural switch from high protein insects to starch-containing seed diet during development.  We switched nestlings between high protein diet (63% protein/5% starch) and high starch diet (30% protein/38% starch).  In intestinal tissues, both starch-digesting intestinal &#9082;-glucosidase activity (AG; maltase and sucrase) and protein-digesting peptidase (APN; aminopeptidase-N) activity were induced by their respective substrates within 24 h of a diet shift (Image1).  For AG, transcriptomic and proteomic evidence indicated that induction of mRNA expression began &gt;18 h after diet switch, and transcription and incorporation of new protein and activity in the apical brush border membrane occurred in &lt;6 h after that.  For APN, evidence indicated that induction of transcription began as fast or faster than for AG. Downward modulation of activity appeared to begin within 18 h of a large reduction in their respective inducing agent. Overall, changes in intestinal hydrolase activity are so fast (&lt;1 d) that nestlings could potentially track daily changes in resource availability with fine-tuned changes in digestive performance.          Project II compared our results for other animals that are omnivorous vs.those that are specialists (do not switch diets). Omnivorous northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) and omnivorous white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) increased intestinal AG activity when raised on high starch diet and increased intestinal APN activity on high protein diet.  We will soon report changes in their respective mRNA. In contrast, birds that specialize on seeds, such as house sparrow adults and zebra finch juveniles and adults, did not reduce AG activity, or AG mRNA, when switched from high starch to lower starch diet - they were inflexible (Image 2).  They appear to lack the transcriptional flexibility that juvenile house sparrows possess. We will soon report, based on RNAseq data, whether they may lack components of transcription activation signals associated with increased dietary starch that are present in nestling house sparrows.         We highlight four broader impacts. (I)The comparisons of phenotypic flexibility are foundation studies in emerging research frontiers in development, which was a special research focus of NSF (solicitation NSF 13-506).  (II) Birds were studied because they are an economically important but relatively understudied group.  Even digestive flexibility of chickens had not been studied to this detail. Indeed, in the course of our project we made an unplanned startling discovery about intestinal AG enzymes in birds and in vertebrates generally.  Relying on up-to-date genomic and proteomic data, we found that the identity of AGs is different from that presumed from 50-year old dogma.  We found that all vertebrates tested so far share an ancestral alpha-glucosidase (AAG), and that chickens and the mammals have an additional derived alpha-glucosidase that the passerines tested lack.  (III) Our findings on digestive flexibility can improve predictions of avian ecologists about birds' abilities to respond to changes in diet that occur due to habitat alterations or climate change. (IV) The research enhances U.S. scientific infrastructure by development of tools to study regulation of digestion by vertebrates at a molecular level.

Ultimately, our findings will support future research in production agriculture and aquaculture on domesticated starch consumers like birds (chickens, quail, ducks) selected for rapid growth and egg production, as well as mammals (e.g., pigs) and even domesticated fish (e.g., catfish, tilapia).  In the United States, 2 graduate students, 1 postdoctoral scholar, 4 undergraduates and 1 high school student, some from underrepresented groups, were trained in integrative biology, emphasizing concepts and methods spanning from the whole-animal to the molecular. The postdoctoral scholar and graduate students were mentored in directing research, which includes designing, analyzing and writing up experiments, administrative duties such as managing animal care and use protocols, directing personnel (e.g., undergraduate assistants), and they were encouraged and mentored in writing complementary research proposals.  International collaborations in Argentina were also supported, including training of a postdoctoral scholar and 2 graduate students.
