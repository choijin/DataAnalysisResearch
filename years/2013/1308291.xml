<AbstractNarration>The main thrust of the proposed research is to introduce and develop new analytic techniques in group theory and the study of group actions. Major projects include: (a) studying quasi-isometries using a new notion of coarse differentiation (introduced in recent joint work with Eskin and Whyte); (b) developing techniques for studying rigidity of dynamical systems based on analytic techniques from pde, particularly the theory of wavefront sets; (c) classifying hyperbolic groups which act smoothly on their boundaries using ideas from both dynamics and geometric group theory; (d) developing new cohomological methods in the study of rigidity of group actions. All research lies in the broad interdisciplinary area of rigidity in dynamics, geometry and topology. Many proposed projects involve applying analytic ideas and techniques to problems traditionally studied by dynamical, geometric or topological methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the study of mathematical objects, a key role is often played by the symmetries of the object - particularly when the object has many symmetries. The PI investigates ways of characterizing, describing and studying spaces with many symmetries in various dynamical, geometric and topological settings. These questions are interdisciplinary in nature and often require learning, adapting and applying ideas and techniques from many areas of mathematics. The PI's work has connections with diverse areas of mathematics: from differential equations (the use of waverfront sets to study fine analytic properties of solutions to equations) to theoretical computer science (expander graphs, Kazhdan's property (T) and coarse embedding problems).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ I work in an area at the intersection of many subfields of mathematics.  Roughly speaking, I study objects that are so symmetric that they are relatively easy to recognize from very little information about them.  The field is known as rigidity theory and has connections to many other areas of mathematics, from logic to number theory to operator algebras.  It also has significant connections to computer science.   The work completed in this grant includes a major breakthrough on Zimmer's conjecture with Brown and Hurtado. In addition to proving a 34 year old conjecture, this breakthrough combined ideas from many subfields of mathematics in novel and interesting ways, which opens the path for much further research on a variety of related questions.  Roughly speaking the conjecture was that certain patterns of symmetry could not be realized in low dimensional spaces in any way.  Other results obtained include an examination of fundamental properties of symmetries of  two dimensional spaces with Larsen, Stover and Spatzier.  We raise an important question about these objects and make some partial progress on it.  In work with Whyte and Nguyen, we studied when certain patterns of symmetries could be embedded in one another without too much distortion.  The results are novel and surprising.  This type of embedding problem is often related to computer science and the theory of algorithms, though we do not yet know of any direct applications of our work.
