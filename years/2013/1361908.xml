<AbstractNarration>The planned I/UCRC for Windstorm Hazard Mitigation intends to undertake functions at the interface between basic and applied research and between private and public interests. Working with its members, the Center will focus on seeking solutions to real world problems encountered by industry members and improve their performance and competitiveness; enhancing government agencies and NGOs capabilities to prepare for and respond to future windstorms; transferring findings from federally sponsored research to products and intellectual properties that benefit researchers, university, and industry; and facilitating collaboration between Center members by developing long-term strategies for enhancing community resiliency to wind and other hazards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned center aims to protect homeowners, businesses, and communities through collaborative research in windstorm mitigation and the implementation of innovations will enhance the Nation's resiliency to future disasters. Integrated in the project are several initiatives aimed at increasing diversity and collectively they contribute to the development of a more diverse workforce and business environment. Meanwhile, the planning activities provide a unique opportunity for students to interact with the industry, improve their communication skills, and enhance their employment potentials. The project helps develop students with strong problem solving, marketable capabilities. The project also helps train Center faculty on how to work with the industry.</AbstractNarration>
