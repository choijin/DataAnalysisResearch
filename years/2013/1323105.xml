<AbstractNarration>PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS: &lt;br/&gt;Wright State University (Lead)&lt;br/&gt;Miami University Oxford Campus&lt;br/&gt;Central State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION &lt;br/&gt;This effort is building on a previous NSF supported CCLI project "Evolvable wireless laboratory design and implementation for enhancing undergraduate wireless engineering education", in which the team developed and demonstrated lower cost, software defined radio (SDR) based laboratories for three undergraduate courses. The collaborating team is now extending and expanding the software defined radio based laboratories throughout the communication and networking curriculum at multiple institutions. The project is developing a suite of experiments and laboratories for insertion in a sequence of courses (ranging from freshmen year introductory course - to senior year elective courses and capstone design projects) that vertically integrates the SDR-based experiment approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three largest sub-disciplines within electrical and computer engineering (ECE) are computers, communications and power. Wireless technology requires all three to be addressed in a related engineering degree program. The recent availability of inexpensive software radio platforms makes it possible to create a hands-on educational experience for all ECE undergrads. The team is producing a scalable and transferable model for redesigning undergraduate electrical engineering and computer science courses to include lab-based learning opportunities for students in more classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is evaluating and comparing the teaching effectiveness of the SDR approach to that of traditional hardware equipment approach. The SDR approach and laboratory suite are being implemented and institutionalized at the three participating institutions - Wright State University, Miami University (a mostly undergraduate serving institution), and Central State University (an HBCU) - to study the potential for enhancing student learning and adaptation by other institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER SIGNIFICANCE &lt;br/&gt;The project is positively impacting STEM education in the state of Ohio. It is also helping recruit high school students into STEM fields and benefiting a diverse population of students. The participation of Central State University (a HBCU) is helping to recruit and train minority students and serving as an example for other minority institutions in the nation. The cutting-edge technology on which the proposed course lab development is relatively inexpensive; while the software used is GNU software radio, which is free and has a large supporting community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project materials and the results of evaluation &amp; assessment are being broadly disseminated and made freely available via a course website, publications, and potential books. Results from the effort are informing the development of a national model for wireless communication &amp; networking courses. The project is helping to develop and produce a workforce with the skills necessary to meet the societal demand of the new wave of wireless IT.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The rapid progress in the software defined radio (SDR) has significantly simplified the development of communication systems and other RF systems such as radar and GPS.  Due to its user friendliness, the SDR is an excellent tool for engineering students to verify theoretical concepts covered in lectures and to observe applications of engineering theory.  In this collaborative NSF project, several SDR based courses covering different areas are developed.  The major responsibility of Miami University is to develop a SDR based laboratory course for digital signal processing (DSP) education.   Although the SDR has been used in undergraduate electrical engineering courses, most of SDR based courses are developed to teach communication systems.  In this project, our major focus is to use SDR to enhance students? understanding of basic DSP concepts covered in a prerequisite course of DSP such as Signals and Systems.  The targeted students of this course is junior level undergraduate students who finish a prerequisite course of DSP but are not necessary enrolled in a DSP course yet.  Therefore, most of SDR projects covered in this course are about simple signal processing tasks and traditional analog communication systems such as amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM).  The more advanced digital communication systems are not introduced until the end of this course.  Through conducting these experiments, students can develop a better understanding about basic DSP concepts and will be more likely to succeed in a subsequent DSP course or communication system course.  Seven lab exercises were developed in this project and evaluated by undergraduate students.  One undergraduate student participating in this project also used SDR in his senior capstone design project.  Results collected in this NSF curriculum development project demonstrate the usefulness of a SDR in an undergraduate engineering curriculum and can have a high impact on engineering education.  The research results obtained in this project has been published at ASEE conferences for the dissemination of our findings.   One by-product of this NSF curriculum development project is that the graduate student working on this project developed a SDR based automatic modulation classifier which has broad applications.  This side project further demonstrates the versatility of SDR and the benefits of incorporating SDR into an engineering curriculum.
