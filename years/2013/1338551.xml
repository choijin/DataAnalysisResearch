<AbstractNarration>Electric machines consume nearly 2/3 of global electrical energy, and produce nearly 100% of electricity. Innovations in this field have a fundamental impact on global economies and energy consumption, and are essential in the transition to sustainability. IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference (IEMDC) is the leading conference in this field and will take place during May 12-15, 2013 at the Westin O'Hare (Rosemont) hotel in the Chicago area. Four IEEE Societies are co-sponsors of this conference: Power Electronics Society (PELS); Power and Energy Society (PES); Industry Application Society (IAS); Industrial Electronics Society (IES). Travel support for electrical engineering students, with first priority given to third year undergraduates is planned.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PROJECT OUTCOMES REPORT FOR AWARD #133851  Student Support for IEMDCÆ2013 Conference Participation   The NSF Grant 1338551 was used to support eleven graduate electrical engineering students (including two females) from six US universities to attend and present their papers at the IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference (IEMDC) that took place during May 12-15, 2013 at the Westin OÆHare (Rosemont) hotel in the Chicago area. Ths conference was sponsored by four IEEE Societies and is held every two years within the USA or Canada.      Intellectual Merit  Electric machines and drives and their design in particular form a multidisciplinary field of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and other fields.  Research topics include electromagnetic modeling, simulation, and analysis, control, signal processing, electrical energy, dynamics of thermal systems, manufacturability, reliability, power electronics, embedded systems, mixed-signal and hybrid systems, mechanical system modeling, transportation, high-performance electromechanical applications, and other areas.   This conference provided an opportunity to bring together a diverse group of researchers, academics, and industry practitioners to enhance dialog and collaboration, identify gaps and opportunities, and articulate challenges for a new generation of engineers in electric machines.      Broader Impact   Electric motors are widely used throughout any modern society. It is estimated that about 2/3 of all global electricity is consumed by electric machines, and as much as 80% of energy in the industrial sector, for example in the US, is delivered to electric machines.
