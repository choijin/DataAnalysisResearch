<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the synergistic combination of low heat rejection (LHR) and low temperature combustion (LTC) to fill the technological gap between existing commercially available internal combustion engines and the clean high-efficiency advanced combustion engine. The translated LHR/LTC technology has the following unique feature: low heat rejection from a low temperature combustion engine that results in more favorable thermodynamics compared to either conventional or ordinary low temperature combustion engines. This provides exemplary efficiency, engine-out exhaust emissions of nitrogen oxides and fixed carbon, and suitable exhaust temperatures for favorable operation of exhaust emission control systems when compared to the leading competing internal combustion engine. The project accomplishes its objectives by performing a proof-of-concept that experimentally and computationally realizes LHR concepts with LTC in a compression ignition engine resulting in a prototype LHR/LTC combustion mode operating in a light-duty automotive diesel engine. The partnership engages General Motors, which engineers and manufacturers the prototype-intended light-duty automotive engine. GM provides guidance in the global automotive market space such as operating constraints, cost limitations, and technology integration with a marketable product in order to translate LHR/LTC combustion along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to be nearly $40million in the next 10 years (based on new diesel vehicle registrations in the United States demonstrating on average $256/year in fuel cost savings at $4.00/gallon fuel cost), which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this automotive market space. The societal impact, long term, will be improved vehicle fuel economy with reduced emission of criteria pollutants (e.g., nitrogen oxides), thereby reducing vehicle carbon footprint. Additionally, this effort will augment the investigators? efforts to increase female and underrepresented students in STEM disciplines and improve undergraduate student course instruction in thermodynamics by leveraging resources used for summer STEM camps and course redesign activities. Finally, scholarly articles and conference presentations will be disseminated to ensure scientific and technological pathway discoveries are made known.</AbstractNarration>

The study centered on the hypothesis that LHR when coupled with LTC renders much higher efficiencies than ordinary implementation of LTC and further enables improved aftertreatment conversion of all regulated emissions.  The objectives of the development were to 1) Perform a proof-of-concept that experimentally and computationally realizes LHR concepts with LTC in a compression ignition engine in an effort to improve engine efficiency and power density, 2) Create a prototype LHR/LTC combustion mode that functionally demonstrates the proof-of-concept in a light-duty automotive diesel engine engineered and manufactured by the industrial sponsor (General Motors), and 3) Generate various "optimal" configurations of advanced combustion engine technology employing LTC with LHR concepts and aftertreatment systems to provide minimum fuel consumption solutions while meeting current federal emission targets.  The specific outcomes of these objectives include:  Developed a working prototype of LTC / LHR combustion mode and experimentally demonstrated in an engine. Constructed and operated a computational model in GTPower to simulate the LTC / LHR engine prototype that was experimentally developed and parameterize various configurations to identify optimal solutions. Designed and studied an expanded test campaign for exploring the expansion of LTC / LHR operation. Supported three undergraduate student researchers (two females and one male) with REU supplemental funding to conduct particulate matter emissions research and aftertreatment technology research. Communicated the merits of the LTC / LHR combustion mode prototype to prospective commercialization partners, specifically Ford Motor Company and General Motors. Supported a PhD student through the completion of her studies, where she now works for Ford Motor Company. Published 4 journal papers, 1 refereed conference paper, and 4 non-referred conference papers.        Last Modified: 11/30/2017       Submitted by: Timothy J Jacobs]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
