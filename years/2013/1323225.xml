<AbstractNarration>The project expands on a TUES 1 supported project, Authentic Research Experiences in Microbiology (AREM), a classroom laboratory approach, which showed that students involved in a research-based microbiology laboratory course (compared to those in a traditional laboratory course) are less likely to fail the course, show increased confidence in interpreting data, a greater appreciation for scientific research, and are more likely to advance to graduate/professional training.  AREM has been institutionalized at Brooklyn College and over 400 students have participated.  With this next phase of AREM, faculty from ten 4-yr colleges and four 2-yr colleges of CUNY have committed to introducing similar projects into their introductory biology laboratory courses.  The original project engaged undergraduates in studying the urban microbial community.  Basic protocols for determining the types of bacteria present in a swab sample from an urban site such as a subway station have been established.  Procedures for analysis, including PCR amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, have been established. Funds support faculty training workshops (including technical support for new faculty and inter-campus communication), protocol development and data display. Bioinformatics training is being facilitated by Brad Goodner through the MGAN program, with potential follow-up using Genome Solver, facilitated by Anne Rosenwald; this strategy leverages existing resources.  A postdoctoral associate with experience in genomics and bioinformatics is working with students and faculty, developing their understandings of the advantages and limitations of the processes used and helping to insure: rigor in gathering and preparing samples and high-quality analysis of the data generated. An assessment plan has been developed by outside evaluators to measure the efficacy of the research experiences as a way to improve critical thinking and problem solving skills is included in the proposal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  While there is wide spread agreement on the importance of engaging undergraduates in research, it is not easy to identify projects that can be utilized with large numbers of students. With TUES-I support, the PI has demonstrated that genomic/metagenomic investigation of the urban microbiome is a research project that can be used successfully. By recruiting his colleagues at other CUNY campuses to join in, the PI is in position to transform the biology major system-wide to one that incorporates research thinking.   Similar course adoptions could follow nation-wide, analogous to the successful dissemination of the HHMI sponsored and supported Hatfull Phage Hunters project and others of this type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The City University of New York System has a high percentage of students from groups currrently underrepresented in the STEM workforce that would benefit from participation in this program. The PIs are actively engaged in dissemination through participation in ASMCUE, CUR, CUREnet, Genome Solver and GCAT-SEEK. A STEM Support Network is also planned to include faculty and students to share research and exchange ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to support Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The study of microbiomes has skyrocketed over the last ten years. This growth has been driven by advances in DNA sequencing technologies, and by a paradigm shift in the field of microbial ecology sparked by culture-independent and metagenomic techniques. We saw in these rapid changes an opportunity to bring the excitement of microbiomes and metagenomics to students by providing training in the scientific process through their engagement in authentic research. Using a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) model, we established the Authentic Research Experience in Microbiology (AREM) microbiome project at The City University of New York (CUNY). In brief, AREM is an innovative CURE that allows students to conduct experiments that reveal the diversity and complexity of their local environmental microbiomes.   The work of AREM over the past five years has been exciting and we have been able to involve over 5,000 undergraduates at 28 institutions across the country. The most significant outcomes from the AREM project are:   Established that microbiome research projects can be scaled-up and effectively integrated into the undergraduate curricula using the CURE model (at both community colleges and four-year colleges). Shown that AREM microbiome research projects are flexible and can be incorporated into a range of courses, including introductory-level courses and advanced-level capstone courses. Shown that AREM modular microbiome research projects can provide similar student learning outcomes to much more intensive dedicated undergraduate research courses, and summer research experiences.  Shown that AREM modular microbiome research projects are popular and practical routes for undergraduate research experiences at institutions where limited time and resources prevent the adoption of other more intensive CUREs.  Shown that high quality microbiome data can be generated and analyzed by students and presented at research conferences. Developed a relationship with the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) to facilitate the dissemination the AREM CURE model and resources (via the ASM Conference on Undergraduate Education).  We have expanded the scope of the original AREM project into an RCN-UBE (Research Experiences in Microbiology Network; REMNet).    Outcomes such as these are critical for the training of the next generation of STEM professionals for a society where a working knowledge of complex scientific and technological issues is important. The increasing use of microbiome CUREs broadens participation compared with traditional mentorship models of research.  Course-based undergraduate research experiences also provide faculty with an opportunity to combine and amplify their research and teaching.   The incorporation of the AREM project into undergraduate biology courses across the country has allowed students to engage in the scientific process. Most often the microbiome project has been used in introductory biology and microbiology labs, but it has also been used in ecology, nursing, bioinformatics and capstone courses. Students work with their instructors to ask questions about the local microbial communities on their campus and develop hypotheses relating to the diversity of these communities and how they might be affected by human activity or environmental changes. The students’ work in data analysis can lead to new hypotheses and experimental approaches for future projects.   The AREM microbiome CURE allows instructors from a range of different courses to involve their students in this research. Moreover, microbiome research projects address core concepts and employ core laboratory techniques that are typically covered in general biology, microbiology, genetics and ecology labs. This allows instructors to match up components of the microbiome CURE with national standards and learning outcomes in their courses.  The ability AREM projects to be adopted at a range of institutions has been facilitated by: 1) the modular design of the microbiome research project which can be incorporated into existing courses, 2) the training resources available through our website, 3) the scalable nature of the microbiome research allows faculty to determine how much time to dedicate to microbiome research, 4) the microbiome samples are collected on or near campus and have local relevance to students, and 5) the modest costs associated with the microbiome project allow faculty to involve students in research and generate data on local microbial communities.
