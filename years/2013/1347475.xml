<AbstractNarration>A regional research conference during May 27-May 31, 2014 will be organized on the campus of University of Texas at Arlington. This five-day conference will feature David Colton of University of Delaware as the distinguished lecturer who will deliver ten lectures on inverse scattering theory for transmission eigenvalues. Prof. Colton will prepare an expository monograph based on his lectures for publication so that the research findings can be made available to the entire scientific community. The goal behind the inverse scattering problem is to extract information about an unknown object by probing it with waves at various energies and to determine its properties from the measurements on the scattered waves. The transmission eigenvalues correspond to those energies at which the scattering from the object is the same as the scattering as if the object is absent from the medium. The topic has important applications in electromagnetics, acoustics, medicine, and other areas. The conference will cover both the topic of determining transmission eigenvalues when the object properties are known as well as the topic of determining those properties when only the transmission eigenvalues are known. In addition to the mathematical theory, some applications will be considered such as medical imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be about 30 participants supported, including both established researchers and interested qualified newcomers, and special efforts will be made to include postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, women, and traditionally underrepresented groups.  The broader impact of the proposed activity is to bring established researchers and newcomers together to an interactive environment, to promote interdisciplinary work and longtime collaborations, to include women and minorities in the research activities, and to stimulate the regional research activity.  This project is jointly supported by the Infrastructure and Applied Mathematics programs within the Division of Mathematical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
