<AbstractNarration>This proposal develops a new approach for solving partial  differential and integral equations based on novel algorithms for  separated representations in functional form. Separated  representations, a natural extension of separation of variables,  is a nonlinear method to approximate multidimensional functions  as sums of separable functions. In this representation functions  in a high-dimensional space are described with a small number of  parameters, making possible to bypass the so-called curse of  dimensionality, that is, to avoid the exponential growth of  computational cost in the underlying dimension of the problem.  The term in functional form refers to the handling of the  components of separated representations in each dimension; they  are obtained via a nonlinear approximation rather than via a  representation through bases. This approach not only provides a  greater efficiency by reducing the number of parameters but also  expands the current paradigm for solving equations. By seeking  solutions via a self-correcting iterative process, a new  efficient algorithm keeps a manageable number of terms in the  representation while maintaining the functional form of the  components and the desired accuracy. The goal of this project is  to design, test and implement such a reduction algorithm and  apply it to solve several multidimensional problems that cannot  be addressed by current methods. Many problems in modern science  require computing multivariate solutions and a major challenge is  to develop representations and algorithms to obtain them while  avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The proposed effort  develops a functional calculus for solving high dimensional  problems via a self-correcting iterative process based on a  combination of three types of novel algorithms: (1) Separated representations in functional form as a tool to circumvent the curse of dimensionality; (2) Highly efficient nonlinear approximations of univariate functions to achieve adaptivity of the components of the separated representations; (3) Randomized projections to reduce the number of terms in the separated representation while maintaining the functional form of the components and the desired accuracy. These adaptive algorithms should yield accurate solutions with  guaranteed error bounds while requiring a computational time that scales linearly in the dimension of the problem. A particular emphasis of this proposal is on a fundamental problem of Quantum Chemistry to accurately compute the electronic structure of molecules.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accurate modeling in modern science and engineering requires  computations with multivariate functions and any progress toward  making such computations feasible will either significantly  accelerate existing numerical methods or lead to the solution of  many problems that are currently out of reach. Scientific areas  to benefit from proposed algorithms are not limited to Quantum  Chemistry and material sciences where the ability to understand  chemical reactions and properties of materials relies heavily on  efficient numerical algorithms, but also include robotics and the  design of multicomponent structures, just to name a few. This  proposal provides numerical tools to address the multivariate  nature of many challenging scientific problems. As a result, topics of the proposal are expected to give raise to  interdisciplinary collaborations as well as  become part of  graduate dissertations.</AbstractNarration>
