<AbstractNarration>PI: Lutkenhaus, Jodie / Verduzco, Rafael&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1336716 / 1336073&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Texas Engineering Experiment Station/&lt;br/&gt;William Marsh Rice University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Collaborative Research: Hybrid Block Copolymer Electrodes for Electrochemical Energy Storage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Storage of energy through electrochemical means (batteries, capacitors) is critical to providing power for advanced transportation and portable electronics. Next-generation energy storage materials must simultaneously satisfy a number of criteria: excellent charge and ion transport, high capacity, and reversible charge transfer. For this reason, electron- and ion-conducting polymers are often explored as additives in cathodes such as V2O5, LiCoO2, LiFePO4, etc. to form hybrid electrodes. Unfortunately, it remains extremely difficult to obtain a hybrid electrode that successfully balances electron and ion transport with charge transfer because of large-scale phase separation and poor structure control among the electrode?s various components. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate a model system of hybrid electrodes for energy storage based on nanostructured blends of poly(3-alkylthiophene)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (P3AT-b-PEO) multifunctional block copolymers and V2O5. P3AT-b-PEO is capable of simultaneous electron and ion transport, and V2O5 is a commonly explored high-capacity cathode material for Li-ion batteries. V2O5 will be synthesized within selected polymer blocks using ?structure directed? synthesis. The PIs hypothesize that through bottom- up assembly methods, the resulting hybrid materials will exhibit favorable properties characteristic of both organic and inorganic components. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will determine the relationship between block copolymer composition and morphology as it is affected by V2O5, side chain functionalization,   and   electrochemical   performance.   The   relationship   between  block   copolymer morphology  and  charge  transfer,  electron  transport,  and  ion  transport  has  never  before  been systematically investigated as a whole, so the proposed research will establish a broad knowledge base to guide the development of multifunctional block copolymers for energy storage. First, the PIs will establish relationships between the morphology of hybrid electrodes containing block copolymer bearing a single type of side chain and V2O5 and electrochemical performance (Objectives 1 and 2). This knowledge will then be applied to a wider family of block copolymers of varying side chain chemistry so as to balance electrochemical properties with processability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will have broader impacts within the scientific community as well as the general public through educational activities and outreach. Within the scientific community, this work will establish a knowledge base for multifunctional block copolymers in electrodes, where several processes (reaction and diffusion) must be balanced. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will pursue educational activities including hosting high school teacher(s) through Enrichment Experiences in Engineering, providing summer research opportunities for talented, underrepresented groups from the Houston Community College system, hosting Nova-sponsored, materials science-themed Science Caf√©s at Houston-area high schools, and organizing Texas Soft Matter Meetings at TAMU and Rice University.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Technological advances have produced tremendous growth in alternative energy utilization along with a steep drop in the cost of energy from both renewable and fossil-fuel based resources. However, the capacity to store this energy for later use remains extremely limited, and as a result it is challenging and costly to supply energy for portable needs and applications. Batteries are electrochemical devices that can store electricity for use at a later time, and they are comprised of several components. First, there is an active electrochemical material that can store and/or generate charge through an electrochemical reaction, a conductive additive for transporting charges, an electrolyte for transporting ions between electrodes, and finally a binder for holding the electrode together and maintaining mechanical rigidity. Much of the research into batteries overlooks the impact of the binder, which comprises typically about 10 % of the entire battery. While this may appear to be a small fraction, the binder plays an incommensurate role in mechanical properties, rigidity, and stability. Prior studies have typically relied on non-active polymeric binders, which contain no electrical or ionic conductivity. In this work, we propose that the development of new polymeric binder materials can enhance battery storage capacities, improve mechanical properties, and lead to more flexible and portable devices for energy storage.&nbsp; Specifically, we focused on the use of electro-active polymers, which have both electrical and ionic conductivities.
