<AbstractNarration>This SBIR project will determine the feasibility of developing innovative highly adaptive e-learning/hybrid modules for teaching technology transfer and commercialization skills to entrepreneurs throughout the country.  These modules will be based upon a hugely successful instructor-led regional program and feedback from collaborating academic, federal, institutional and national distribution partners.  The objective is to increase the participation by entrepreneurs and small tech businesses throughout the country, in the licensing of federal research for the purpose of developing successful, marketable products.  The latest learning science including adaptive learning methodologies, emerging 3-D/gaming educational technologies, and the firm's years of entrepreneurial and technology transfer experience, and nationwide distribution partnerships will be used to embed these customized technology transfer e-learning modules into entrepreneurship courses offered by various entities throughout the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact is significant.  According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Association of Technology Managers, the federal government spends approximately $250B annually on scientific research - yet very little of it which is intended for commercial use - is ever licensed, especially by smaller businesses. There is compelling evidence that most technology entrepreneurs, not already affiliated with a university or laboratory, are unaware of and do not know how to participate in cooperative research and technology licensing opportunities with federally funded research institutions.  Yet, entrepreneurs and small businesses are in constant search of innovation to help them start or grow their businesses, and serve their customers.  Very few resources are available to small businesses and entrepreneurs to bridge this gap.  This indicates there is a critical national need for a cost effective learning system that appeals to the fast-paced profit oriented perspectives of entrepreneurs and small tech firms to teach them how to leverage this vast federal resource.  The challenge is to craft an e-learning system with the most effective blend of interactivity, instructor involvement and learning community support, for this very demanding, diverse audience, especially those in sparsely populated areas. The objective of this initiative is to advance knowledge and understanding among entrepreneurs, entrepreneur support organizations and federal research laboratories regarding the challenges and nuances of the scientific research/licensing/product development continuum and the important interdependent and evolving roles of each entity.  Ultimately, this project will benefit our country's innovation economy and help federal agencies fulfill their societal mission through increased licensing activity by the entrepreneurial community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For SBIR Phase I Grant: Educating Entrepreneurs to Find, Evaluate, License, and Commercialize Federal Research, we set out to prove the feasibility of developing a highly interactive e-learning system to fulfill the huge unmet national need to teach STEM entrepreneurs how to take advantage of innovations from federal laboratories to develop new, marketable products. By teaching these skills to STEM entrepreneurs, our goal also was to help the federal agencies fulfill their mission of benefiting society by transferring federal innovations into the market.   By making this program web-based we will make it more accessible to people living in sparsely populated regions or to people who are unable to attend face-to-face led courses, for any reason.     Our project specifically responded to the NSF grant topic EA4 -- Entrepreneurship Education.    Six Significant Results  1.  We researched and established the features of a unique technology transfer e-learning system.  The Innovation2Market&trade; e-Learning and Product Development Virtual Campus is a Cloud-based environment of individuals, communities of interest from the business world, and resources aggregated to support STEM entrepreneurs as they find, evaluate, and commercialize Federal scientific research. This web space will be a unique environment. Nothing like it exists to support the businesses that transfer and develop marketable products from federal research activities and intellectual property.  Each subscribing member can customize his or her experience of Innovation2Market&trade;, creating a personal learning/research/development environment that serves his or her needs and the demands of the specific commercialization project.  2.  Although outside of the scope of Phase I, we mocked sample pages of the website to depict the features of the Innovation2Market&trade; web space, including a voice-over, whiteboard animation video that provides an overview of the product, as well as demonstrates some of the production values of the final design.   3.  We researched and completed a high-level instructional design of 8 modules of a self-paced, online course that is part of the Innovation2Market&trade; Virtual Campus  The online course goal is to educate STEM entrepreneurs about the opportunities, processes, and challenges of working with Federal labs to commercialize research.  Adaptive and branched learning techniques will be used in a scenario-based learning environment specifically designed to appeal to the needs of STEM entrepreneurs. The course presents a practical business perspective on the R&amp;D functions of the Federal laboratories and the policies, processes and procedures of working with them, with specific focus on the US Department of AgricultureÆs Agriculture Research Service and the Department of EnergyÆs National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Entrepreneurs/students will learn how to find and evaluate IP, how to apply "lean" principles to the commercial evaluation segment of the technology transfer process, and how to negotiate appropriate agreements with the federal agency.    The course also will draw together the existing resources from the various websites of the Federal agencies/labs, as well as the many resources available on the Federal Laboratory Consortium website.  As such, it complements the Federal laboratoriesÆ technology transfer efforts.    4.  We demonstrated the feasibility of producing the online course by designing, developing, storyboarding, and publishing course Module 5: Working with NREL as a demonstration site. The module content and the learning activities reflect the principles of adult learning theory as well as the principles of effective instruction based on learning science.    5.  For our audience of varied STEM entrepreneurs of all ages and education levels we have determined the look and feel of this online environment so it appeals to their needs and sensibilities for learning and doing.   These requirements informed the f...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
