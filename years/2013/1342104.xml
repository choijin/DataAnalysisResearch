<AbstractNarration>The project provides support for Symposium on Discovery Informatics and Cognitive Systems. Discovery informatics aims to develop computational systems that support the scientific enterprise. Cognitive systems aims to develop computational artifacts that exhibit the broad range of intelligent behavior found in humans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium brings together researchers who approach discovery informatics from a variety of perspectives but who share an interest in system-level approaches and the role of high level cognition in science. It focuses on a specific set of challenges at the intersection of cognitive systems and discovery informatics. The participants' interactions should lead to new insights and new collaborations in this emerging area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new field of discovery informatics has the potential to not only accelerate but also advance the frontiers of the scientific enterprise by automating processes that researchers currently carry out manually. This symposim aims to clarify these processes and share insights with the broader community. The symposium fills a critical need in terms of building a vibrant community of interdisciplinary researchers in discovery informatics. It contributes to education and training of graduate students, and broadening participation of underrepresented groups in  STEM areas that are critical to multiple NSF initiatives e.g., Big Data Science and Engineering, Computation and Data Enabled Science and Engineering, among others.</AbstractNarration>

Discovery informatics aims to develop computational systems that support the scientific enterprise. Cognitive systems aims to develop computational artifacts that exhibit the broad range of intelligent behavior found in humans. The meeting explored the intersection of these two emerging disciplines in the context of specific scientific problems, examining the role of representations, reasoning, and problem solving in each case.  Presenters addressed a number of basic issues at these crossroads, including: (a) the types of structured representations that underlie the encoding of scientific phenomena, hypotheses, and models; (b) the roles played by multi-step reasoning in the generation of scientific predictions and explanations, including both deductive and abductive inference; (c) the roles that problem solving and heuristic search play in the construction and revision of scientific hypotheses and models; (d) the major activities that make up the scientific process and how they interact to advance the acquisition of data and the generation of models; (e) lessons that the history of science and cognitive psychology offer about the representations and mechanisms that underlie the scientific enterprise; and (f) computational abstractions that recur across scientific disciplines despite their distinct types of phenomena, their different formalisms, and their varied content.  Participants from backgrounds as diverse as computer science, psychology, information science, and philosophy presented different perspectives on the same underlying problems. The application areas also varied widely, including the fields of cell biology, ecology, endocrinology, geology, and social science. The two-day meeting fostered increased interaction between these researchers and suggested new directions for research that would benefit both discovery informatics and cognitive systems.
