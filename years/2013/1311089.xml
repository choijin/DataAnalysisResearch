<AbstractNarration>High-latitude ecosystems are among the most sensitive to accelerating climate change, with some of the highest rates of temperature increase and altered hydrological patterns. The rich carbon reserves locked in northern soils are increasingly prone to being released into the atmosphere as methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that, as atmospheric concentrations increase, is liable to further increase the speed of warming.  The two major environmental factors that affect the amount of methane being made and released from natural wetland ecosystems are (1) how wet the soil is, and (2) how warm the soil is, but little is known about how these factors interact during seasonal transition periods like late spring, when soils thaw and lose snow cover. This project uses a portable greenhouse gas analyzer to measure methane gas emissions from a northern Finnish mire during the 2013 spring transition period and summer growing season, using snow-melting and soil manipulation experiments to determine the influence of these variables on methane emission rates.&lt;br/&gt;Precisely because they are experiencing climate changes at faster rates than the rest of the planet, methane studies in high-latitude systems are critical to our understanding of future climate dynamics. This research will contribute not only to scientific knowledge of methane cycling in northern wetlands, but also to improving global climate models that inform international climate change policymaking. Moreover, this research recognizes that climate change is not merely a national issue, and facilitates trans-national comparisons with the authors? ongoing study of Alaskan wetlands. The field work will include the participation of a PolarTREC volunteer, an American middle school science teacher, which will provide multiple outreach avenues for informing young Americans about this research. Additional outreach and field-based teaching opportunities will be conducted, both in Finland and America.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to characterize seasonal and spatial patterns of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes from Arctic soils in northern Finland, and to determine the effects of soil chemistry and weather conditions on these fluxes. This work provides a contrast with similar work done in the Alaskan Arctic, so we were able to address the question: Are the factors that affect greenhouse gas production and emissions from wetlands the same in different parts of the Arctic?  We measured soil greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2, CH4, water vapor) in a large wet sedge mire located near Petsikko, Finland.  We measured gas fluxes with a laser-based technology: the Los Gatos Research (LGR) Ultraportable Greenhouse Gas Analyzer.  The LGR unit was used to collect continuous measurements of gas concentrations emitted from the soil.  We took measurements every other day from May to September 2013, allowing for a dataset with high spatial and temporal resolution, and that captured the æshoulder seasonsÆ.  Shoulder seasons are the periods of time surrounding the growing season, or when soils are thawed and plants are active.  The shoulder seasons are the spring thaw when soils are thawing after winter, and the fall æfreeze-upÆ when the soil is freezing as winter conditions begin.   We discovered that greenhouse gas emissions were strongly related to where within the wetland we measured, suggesting that small-scale variability in the wetland soil conditions were important.  We did not see a strong impact of soil or air temperatures on greenhouse gas emission dynamics within individual seasons, but there were differences in flux rates between the growing season and both shoulder seasons.  We measured significant greenhouse gas æburstsÆ during both the spring and fall shoulder seasons, with the fall burst more than 5-fold larger than the spring burst.  In contrast, our previous work in the Alaskan Arctic did not capture significant spring or fall greenhouse gas bursts, and showed a markedly different seasonal flux pattern than we measured in Finland.  These results suggest that spatial location, small-scale conditions, and season all matter for understanding greenhouse gas emission dynamics in Arctic wetlands.  Another aspect of this project was determining the effect of soil chemistry on greenhouse gas emission rates.  To address this question, we altered the soil chemistry by adding treatments of iron and organic acids halfway through the growing season.  We sampled greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations in the soil water every day for eight days following the treatment injections, and compared the greenhouse gas emission rates from before and after the treatment additions.  Methane flux rates were insensitive to soil amendments of both iron and organic acids, while both amendment types significantly altered CO2 fluxes.  Thus, soil chemistry can influence the form of carbon greenhouse gas emissions, but does not result in a suppression of methane production or release within the wetland soils tested.  This is in direct contrast to a similar experiment conducted in Arctic Alaska, where we found a suppression of methane production and emissions following the same treatment soil additions.  Again, we found that geographical location matters for how we might expect soil conditions to affect greenhouse gas emissions.  Given the capability of continuous data collection and real-time visualization in the field using the LGR unit, we were also able to collect a dataset on methane ebullition events.  Methane ebullition (or bubbling) is notoriously difficult to quantify from soil systems due to the highly episodic and spatially varied nature of the events.  Using our dataset, we were able to determine that methane ebullition augmented diffusive emissions by an average of 49% additional CH4 mass emitted from the wetland surface, making bubbles a significant contributor of methane to the atmosphere from this wetland.  We determined that spa...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
