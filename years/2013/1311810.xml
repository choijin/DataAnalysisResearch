<AbstractNarration>This ITEST Strategies project is developing, implementing and studying an intervention for students and teachers in ten middle schools in Wyoming that includes computational thinking and spatial visualization in the contexts of gaming and robotics. It is impacting 42 teachers and their students. The project is delivering the content using culturally responsive pedagogy (CRP). The CRP emphasis is being implemented in the proposed intervention and is strongly reflected in the project personnel, which includes representatives from African American, Mexican, and Native American cultures, as well as in the recruitment plan, which also includes females and disabled persons. The lead institution is the University of Wyoming, with cooperation from the National Center for Atmospheric Research and evaluation by MER Associates. Alexander Repenning of the University of Colorado is providing teacher professional development in computational thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research questions are investigating: 1) the strategies most likely to develop student skills in computational thinking and spatial visualization; 2) the strategies most likely to develop student interest, readiness, and participation in STEM careers; 3) the strategies teachers use to infuse culturally responsive pedagogy and develop student understanding of computational thinking in math and science courses; and 4) how the project leverages the social and cultural capacity of the cultural and STEM communities. The evaluator is primarily responsible for collecting and analyzing the data, with oversight from the Advisory Board. Data sources include document review, surveys, interviews, and student performance data. Analyses are being conducted to exam variances associated with gender, ethnicity, and English proficiency.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The University of Wyoming was awarded an ITEST grant by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2013. The project entitled, Visualization Basics: Using Gaming to Improve Computational Thinking (uGameiCompute), was a three-year study that examined two treatment variables: robotics and game design. Teachers learned to implement LEGO&reg; EV3 robotics, Scalable Game Design (SGD), and Scratch to elementary (grades four to five) and middle school students (grades six to eight). Researchers examined the teaching-learning process as well as the influence of robotics and game design to improve students&rsquo; spatial visualization and computational thinking skills, respectively. The primary purpose of the uGame-iCompute study was to influence teachers&rsquo; culturally responsive teaching beliefs and outcome expectancy, computational thinking attitudes, and engineering beliefs as well as student participants&rsquo; self-efficacy in technology, attitudes toward STEM, and computational thinking skills. The uGame-iCompute project was implemented in 13 rural school districts in Wyoming with 41 teachers and 807 students in the three-year study. Additionally, eight teachers and 108 students in Philadelphia participated in the study in Year 3 during the academic year. Students enrolled in the Pennsylvania schools identified as 91% African American, 3.8% White, 2.1% Latinx, and 3% Other (i.e., 1.3% Asian, 1.3% Two or more races, and &lt;1% Native American), whereas Wyoming students identified as 77.8% White, 15.3% Latinx, 3.6% Asian, 2.2% American Indian, 2.1 African American, and 2.5% Two or more races.</p> <p>Two summer programs, one at Starbase in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and one at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, also took place. Twenty-eight students participated in the Starbase STEM camp, and 35 students participated in the Temple University STEM camp. Students in Cheyenne took field trips to the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum and the NCAR- Wyoming Supercomputing Center. Students in Philadelphia took field trips to the Franklin Institute and the Temple University Virtual Laboratory. These field trips provided opportunites to explore STEM careers.</p> <p>The study examined the single treatment of robotics (fall 2014) and game design (spring 2015) in Year 2 as well as the impact of combined treatments (robotics and game design) in Year 3. Student participants illustrated how culture as well as place can be used with emerging technology to create digital games and to develop computational thinking skills. From unicorns and red poison tree frogs to superheroes, students created agents and designed games using a myriad of characters and images. Students&rsquo; games were functional and CT skills were rated in the moderate range, using a rubric developed by the principal investigator. Year 3 data revealed teacher efficacy as it related to culturally responsive teaching was malleable, and teachers' CT attitudes and engineering beliefs improved significantly. Moreover, student participants&rsquo; self-efficacy in videogaming, computer gaming, and computer use increased significantly among elementary students. Self-efficacy in videogaming also increased significantly among middle school students. However, there were no signficant differences from pre-post on attitudes toward STEM. Elementary students' (n=197) mean pretest scores were 3.66 in science, 3.89 in mathematics, and 4.11 in engineering/technology (5-point Likert scale), indicating greater than average interest in STEM careers. Results were similar for middle school students. Thus, lack of significance may imply a ceiling effect. Overall, evidence suggests the combined robotics and game design learning environment was more robust and provided rural and urban students with multiple opportunities to learn.</p><br> <p>
