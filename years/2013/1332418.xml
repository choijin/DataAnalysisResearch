<AbstractNarration>Diagenetic processes in sedimentary deposits play a central role in the cycling and burial of biogeochemically reactive elements. The activities of marine benthos dramatically impact early diagenesis, altering material transport and reaction distributions in surface sediments and sediment-water exchange on scales of microns to centimeters. In this project, researchers at SUNY Stony Brook will continue to develop and use innovative transparent sensor foils to track in situ redox reactions associated with O2, Mn, N, Fe, S, and C, measure exoenzyme activity, and quantify carbonate dissolution to advance predictive, mechanistic-based understanding of biogenic effects on biogeochemical cycles. Results from this study will advance fundamental understanding of biogeochemical processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project will provide scientific training to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, including those from a diversity of underrepresented groups. Results from this study will be shared with fellow scientists and the general public, increasing knowledge about the seafloor processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The biological, chemical, and physical factors that affect sediments following deposition of material onto the seafloor (termed diagenetic processes) play an essential role in the cycling and burial of reactive elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. The activities of animals which live in the seabed include feeding, burrowing, and irrigation of dwelling structures such as tubes.  These activities, in aggregate termed bioturbation, dramatically impact sediment chemistry, altering the distributions and movements of dissolved and particulate material in sediments, the rates and pathways by which reactive components are biologically and chemically broken down, and the rates at which nutrients and reactive metals are released into water overlying the seafloor.  For this project, we utilized multiple approaches to resolve and quantify the complex compositional and material transport patterns associated with bioturbation and its impacts on elemental cycling.  Novel imaging sensor films (termed planar optodes) that allow real time measurement and direct visualization of sediment pore water chemistry in 2 and 3 dimensions in situ and with minimal disturbance of complex natural distributions were developed to measure dissolved H2S (high, low level) and Mn2+.  These were used together with Br- tracer and imaging sensor films for CO2, pH, and Fe2+ developed by us previously, to constrain the 2 and 3-D distributions, pathways, and dynamics of reactions associated with the decomposition of organic matter both in experimentally manipulated microcosms and in estuarine deposits.  The development of a new tool, termed a planar saturometer, was also initiated that allows direct, 2-D imaging of carbonate dissolution or precipitation in sediments, laying the basis  for future research on sedimentary reactions affected by ocean acidification.  Field measurements in the Peconic Estuary system and in Long Island Sound, New York allowed us to document natural seasonal variations in sedimentary remineralization, specifically N2 fluxes governed by denitrification and nitrogen fixation, and to examine the heterogeneity caused by animal activities as a function of temperature and food supply. Nitrogen gas (N2) production was found to exceed N2 fixation at all seasons and is affected by both intense bioturbation in the upper 15 cm of the seabed by brittle star (Amphioplus) activity as well as crustacean burrows (Squilla) that penetrate 0.5 &ndash; 4 m into the sediment.  A sediment profile imaging camera configured with optical sensors developed in this project, was used for water - sediment quality studies in New York Harbor (sampling was funded by another agency).  Imaging sensor films were also made available for use in salt marsh ecosystem studies of Jamaica Bay, New York.   Quantitative transport &ndash; reaction models were developed to describe population density dependent effects on nutrient fluxes and the net burial of sulfur isotopes.   Biogenic heterogeneity, readily revealed by imaging sensor films, is a critical control on biogeochemical processes such as denitrification and is virtually impossible to accurately measure or quantify by traditional methods.   Because seabed sediments behave as open systems, early diagenetic reactions and associated release of solutes, fluids, and particulate material, impact ocean water composition and ecosystem processes. Human activities are dramatically affecting ecosystems at the Earth surface and driving major global environmental changes. A large number of these anthropogenic activities primarily affect the coastal and continental boundary regions where the bioturbation activities of bottom dwelling animals are most intense. Many major conceptual advances in understanding the biogeochemical reactions and cycling of reactive elements in sedimentary environments have come from the experimental and field studies in conjunction with sensor technology, and theoretical modeling developed by our group.  This research improves our ability to evaluate the impacts and predict future consequences of anthropogenic forcing on complex margin systems and thus global biogeochemical cycles.
