<AbstractNarration>Focusing on the Southern Sierra Nevada, California, we will use distributed snow and streamflow measurements (which date back to the 1920s) to assess what precipitation must have been for each basin on annual and storm-by-storm time-scales.  Using iterative hydrologic simulations across a range of model structures in a Bayesian framework, we will determine which precipitation amounts and gradients (and with what uncertainty) best fit available measurements of streamflow and snow accumulation.  This methodology will provide a ground-based estimate of high-elevation precipitation for times and locations where no high-altitude rain gauges are available and will allow us to assess long-term change.  We will then use these new hydrologic-based precipitation datasets as a benchmark for atmospheric model performance, and will compare these with an ensemble of 14-year regional atmospheric model (WRF) simulations generated using different boundary conditions and microphysics schemes.  This will allow us to assess sources of model uncertainty in annual patterns of orographic precipitation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accurate precipitation inputs, both total amounts and changes with elevation, are critical to model streamflow in mountainous regions. However, in general these regions are grossly under-sampled in terms of precipitation measurements, and those gauges that do exist are notoriously unreliable.  Atmospheric models can predict precipitation rates and distributions.  However, development and improvement of these atmospheric models has been hindered by the lack of direct precipitation measurements that caused hydrologists problems in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our most reliable measurements from these high-altitude areas (distributed streamflow and snow water equivalent) are useful clues for estimating historic spatial and temporal distributions of precipitation.  Our research approach integrates both meteorology and hydrology, using hydrology as a tool to better understand meteorology, and providing a long-term benchmark that can be used to improve our forecasts and advance science in both fields.  This work will improve understanding of mountain precipitation for both individual storms and how those storms aggregate over an entire season.  This knowledge is crucial for forecasting short-term floods, seasonal water resources, and long-term climate sensitivity.  Efforts will focus on the Southern Sierra Nevada, California, where short-term and long-term forecasts have historically had lower accuracy than other regions, but where those same forecasts are critical for the San Joaquin Valley agriculture industry, valued at over $30 billion.  The research results will also contribute to atmospheric model development, such that these models can be used more successfully to predict mountain precipitation worldwide.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Mountain precipitation volumes, phase (e.g., snow versus rain), and timing govern streamflow, and accurate spatial precipitation estimates are critical for flood forecasting, snow mapping, and runoff prediction for water resources.  Unfortunately, mountain precipitation, particularly in regions receiving both liquid and solid precipitation, is notoriously difficult to measure, and interpolating or extrapolating values between sparse measurements leads to further problems (Figure 1).  Even distinguishing the phase of precipitation through time is a challenge for most measurement systems. While surface observational systems have remained static over the past few decades, the computational power for models has dramatically increased.  Models at resolutions of 4 km or finer (e.g., WRF) are now run routinely over mountain regions and resolve not only the topography but most of the physics controlling precipitation rates and phase.  We combined extensive snow and streamflow observations and discovered that gridded precipitation datasets based on observations and statistics are often less accurate than numerical weather model simulations.  For example, these comparisons showed that gridded precipitation datasets can have less water (from precipitation) over some basins than is observed to run off at stream gauges in some years (Figure 2), clearly demonstrating errors in estimating mountain precipitation.  These findings are scientifically transformative because gridded precipitation datasets have historically been used as target truth for weather and climate modelers to strive to match.  In complex terrain, striving to match these datasets would result in decreased model performance.  In hydrology (water resources and flood forecasting), models that are calibrated using poor precipitation data may misrepresent sensitivity to extreme events and changes in climate, leading to poor understanding of risk in mountain watersheds. Our work has demonstrated how explicit representation of errors in hydrologic modeling, including Bayesian Statistics and multiple model frameworks, combined with all available observations, including lidar-based basin-wide measurements of snow depth, point measurements of snow water equivalent, and streamflow observations in multiple basins, provide a better target baseline for mountain precipitation than in situ precipitation observations alone.

For example, we showed that the combination of streamflow and lidar snow datasets can estimate basin-average evapotranspiration (ET, Figure 3), a hydrologic variable that is difficult to observe in mountain watersheds, as it is highly spatially variable and measured at only sparse point locations.  These approaches yielded spatially-consistent estimates of ET across alpine basins at similar elevation zones and across multiple years during the recent California drought (Figure 3).  Evaluating further improvements in modeling orographic precipitation will require building upon this work through carefully designed observation networks and close collaborations between hydrologists and atmospheric scientists.
