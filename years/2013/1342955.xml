<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF Award provided travel support for student participation in the 44th Annual Meeting of the American Physical Society Division of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics (APS-DAMOP) that was held in June 2013 in Quebec City, Canada. Every sixth year, the annual DAMOP meeting takes place in Canada, because it is jointly sponsored by the American Physical Society and its Canadian counterpart, the Canadian Association of Physicists.  The Conference has grown in recent years and now typically attracts about 1,000 participants. Because of its influence on the productivity and up-to-date awareness  of individual investigators, this conference series is of outstanding  importance to the vitality of atomic, molecular, and optical physics in  the United States.  The Award allowed the APS to support the travel costs of 24 students in the amount of $500 per student.  As a result, the Award's support contributed to the the participation of a large and diverse group of researchers, and helped foster the interchange of scientific information among young scientists.DAMOP meetings highlight cutting-edge atomic, molecular, and optical science from the United States and key results from the international community. The proceedings of the meeting are published in the Bulletin of the American Physical Society and are available on the World Wide Web.  The Conference is a very important vehicle for communication among active scientists in the field. It is a working conference, participation in which is highly important for active research scientists involved in the field if they are to remain truly abreast of current research activities and new developments.  Of particular relevance for the current award is the opportunity that DAMOP Conferences offer for students to present their research results and to interact with senior scientists primarily from the United States, but also the broader international community.  Furthermore, the 2013 Conference included a special one-day student symposium that was organized to introduce students to cutting-edge topics in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. This symposium included presentations by three leading scientists: A. Bandrauk (U. Sherbrooke, Qu&eacute;bec), Zh. Chang (U. Central Florida), and B. Witzel (U. Laval, Qu&eacute;bec). The symposium also included a one-hour session on "Career Paths for PhD students", facilitated by the APS Committee on Careers &amp; Professional Development.  As a result, the support of students through this grant has made a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in atomic, molecular, and optical physics acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology.
