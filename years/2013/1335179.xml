<AbstractNarration>This is to organize and provide travel support for a two day workshop near the Washington DC area to explore the utility, challenges and interest level for science investigations enabled by regular in-situ profiling of the upper atmosphere.  Multiple companies are currently in the process of developing commercial reusable suborbital spacecraft.  While these companies originally targeted space tourism as the primary customer base, it is rapidly becoming apparent that this dramatic increase in low cost access to space could also provide revolutionary opportunities for scientific research and STEM education.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is planned for the spring of 2013.  It will be widely publicized within the relevant scientific communities, including via aeronomy community mailing lists.  Featured participants, and student participation will be particularly solicited with a focus on under-represented communities, and a modest participant support budget is requested to defray the costs of these individuals.  Results of the workshop will be summarized in a report and the workshop will also be used as the basis for the formation of an informal working group that will continue to organize the community around this topic.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The region of space between &asymp;80&ndash;100 km is one of EarthÃ†s most intriguing and most physically complex environments. At 100 km, the coldest place "on" Earth, neutral atmosphere transitions from turbulently mixed to diffusely separated, and the plasma regime transitions from collisional to non-collisional physics. Billions of meteors per day are destroyed in this region and curious, high-altitude, noctilucent clouds (NLCs) form. Too high for aircraft and balloons, and yet too low for orbital satellites and most ground-based sensing techniques, our knowledge of this region comes from observations by a relatively small number of sounding rocket missions. Because this region is so difficult to reach that limited research has been done in it, we frequently refer to this region as the "ignorosphere".     Commercial suborbital spacecraft offer the potential to put an end to the ignorosphere by offering unprecedented in situ and remote sensing opportunities with frequent, low-cost access to this region of space. Recently, there has been an unmistakable trend in the space industry toward public/private partnership for access to space.
