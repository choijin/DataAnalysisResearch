<AbstractNarration>The Targeted Infusion Project at Howard University will address the challenge of increasing the number of African-American undergraduates in computer science by establishing a multi-layered program that includes a partnership with Google, Inc. The project includes: a virtual pre-college program for incoming freshmen; a revised and restructured Computer Science course curriculum that includes culturally-relevant content; Googler co-instructors and guest speakers for introductory Computer Science courses; a mentoring program pairing freshmen with Googlers; a Computer Science boot-camp for peer-led tutoring targeting introductory Computer Science courses; faculty professional development; and undergraduate research opportunities in Computer Science. Project activities will provide student participants with a better understanding of Computer Science and the broad opportunities available within the field. Students will establish support systems that include industry mentors, department faculty, and peers to help them not only persist, but succeed in Computer Science. The enhanced curriculum will also help students develop critical thinking skills, including problem solving, algorithm development, and higher-level programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in Computer Science and enhance the educational infrastructure at Howard University. Additionally, the project will directly impact fifteen pre-service teachers and enhance the preparation of future K-12 teachers. The project can serve as a model for Computer Science departments, particularly those at other Historically Black Colleges and Universities that share similar challenges with student enrollment, engagement, and retention. Findings will be broadly disseminated increasing Computer Science literacy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An innovative Academic-Industry partnership was formed between Howard University and Google to improve undergraduate student performance in Computer Science.  Funded by a National Science Foundation HBCU-UP Targeted Infusion Grant, the HBCU-UP team at Howard University believed that student attrition is highest during the first two years of study due to student disillusionment and poor performance, and that proper intervention, recruitment, and an innovative industry-academic partnership with Google could ensure student persistence and excellence.  In order to address this challenge, a multi-layered program centered around a Googler-in-Residence (GIR), a Google software engineer serving as a visiting faculty, was formed with the objectives to:  Improve      student performance in the first three CS courses in the CS program of      study; Improve      students? perceptions of CS; Improve      department-wide support mechanisms for all classifications;    To meet objectives 1 and 2, the department did two things: 1) designed a pre-freshmen virtual summer experience for incoming students, and 2) redesigned the CS 0 course.  The pre-freshmen virtual summer experience PREFICS (Pre-Freshmen In Computer Science) was designed such that all content was taught through videos produced by upperclassmen CS majors.

Therefore, we pivoted to designing a summer residential program and seeking funding to support that initiative. We also redesigned the introductory CS course (i.e. CS 0) to provide students with a "big picture" of CS, the applications and career paths available, and introduced CS fundamentals such as algorithms, problem-solving, and computational thinking prior to learning programming. The course was designed to help combat the disillusionment, as well as provide students a broad context for future higher-level courses. In addition, the GIR taught the introductory CS course and infused the curriculum with real-world context.   To meet objectives 2 and 3, the GIR also provided direct access to Black Googlers to serve as mentors, helped to increase perception of and interest in CS, assisted with holistic development workshops on "interview prep", "stereotype threat", "imposter syndrome", "threats to belonging", and "having a competitive CS mindset". The GIR also facilitated the annual DC Hackathon, and Google Game Nights. Lastly, the GIR assisted with increasing the number of departmental students applying for and entering Google summer internships and full-time positions by providing mock interviews.  Key outcomes:  The      Howard CS program has been observing consistent enrollment growth, upwards      of 23%, in majors and minors since the project started. We have seen yearly      growth in non-major conversions after taking the redesigned CS 0 course      taught by the GIR. Student      persistence from CS 0 to CS I, and CS I to CS II has seen yearly increases      (upwards of 20% change in difference) in percentage of student completions      and students passing with "C" or better, due in part to the GIR, the      holistic development workshops and peer mentoring using CS bootcampers. The      GIR program has expanded to over 12 HBCUs across the country.   Figure 1 presents an increase in persistence among students as shown from course completion rates of grades ?C? or better for CS 0, CS 1, and CS II between 2012-2016. The GIR and CS Bootcamper programs were successful in not only improving the performance of CS underclassmen, but also increasing the interest in computer science for students both within and outside of the department and College as shown from overall CS program enrollment (Figure 2), and CS course enrollment (Figure 3).
