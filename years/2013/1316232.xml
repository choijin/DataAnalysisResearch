<AbstractNarration>Effective and ambitious teaching in science requires that teachers listen and respond to student ideas.  But research shows that doing so in the classroom can be logistically, socially, and intellectually challenging for both expert and novice teachers. Listening to student ideas requires teachers to anticipate and interpret multiple lines of thinking that may be expressed ambiguously and simultaneously. Responding to student thinking, both in-the-moment and in future instruction, presents further challenges because teachers must balance their choices with other instructional priorities. Unfortunately, little work has been done to date in supporting these challenging practices in those who are learning to teach, pre-service teachers (PSTs).  In order to address this gap, researchers in this Exploratory project will introduce a new approach to teacher education: pedagogical argumentation.  Pedagogical argumentation creates a supportive environment in which the PSTs learn and refine these practices of listening and responding by using student ideas as evidence to construct and defend potential pedagogical decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over three years researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison will use an iterative approach to design activities and supports that foster pedagogical argumentation for use in undergraduate teacher education courses.  This project will examine: 1) whether and how PSTs engage in pedagogical argumentation and 2) whether and how this engagement impacts how they listen and respond to student ideas. Working with both elementary and secondary PSTs, researchers will probe and explore their changing listening and responding practices by: collecting records of pedagogical argumentation (both video and written) as it occurs in the science teaching methods courses; conducting interviews about PSTs understanding of student ideas; and documenting PSTs teaching experiences in their school placements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The science teacher education community writ large is in need of systematic approaches to teacher education that better support PSTs in learning ambitious teaching practices such as listening and responding to student ideas. The proposed study addresses this need and, in doing so, will support both immediate PSTs in engaging in this work as well as the broader teacher education community as it struggles with these same challenges. Moreover, the novel practice of pedagogical argumentation advances the fields theoretical understanding of the problem space for supporting these challenges by combining insight from two extensive programs of research in teaching and learning: 1) teacher reasoning about student ideas, and 2) argumentation about science content. As such, the practice of pedagogical argumentation has the potential to transform how teacher educators approach pre-service education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Science educators and researchers increasingly envision participation in science practices as being both how and what students learn in science classrooms. This move requires that teachers make space for, listen to, and work to respond to the student ideas that will be refined through the practices.  Teachers must begin to teach "responsively."  However, having students? ideas &ndash; rather than the teacher?s or curriculum?s ideas &ndash; be central in the classroom is a challenging new way for teachers to teach. As a result, teacher educators have had to tackle the challenge how to support pre-service teachers (PSTs) in learning to do so. Thus, at the broadest level the objective of this grant was to develop strategies for helping PSTs elicit and respond to their students? thinking in ways that support k-12 student participation in scientific practices and broaden K-12 student understanding of who and what counts as science.     We accomplished this work by following 3 cohorts of PSTs learning to teach elementary school and 2 cohorts of PSTs learning to teach in secondary science classes. Through this work, we video-recorded the methods classes, engaged in pre- and post-interviews, and observed the future secondary science teachers in their field placements as they taught in K-12 schools.     The intellectual merit of this project was to bring together two extensive programs of research in teaching and learning: 1) teacher reasoning about student ideas, and 2) teachers supporting student participation in science practices. In bringing these disparate literatures together, combined with the project?s data, this project advanced the field?s understandings of responsive teaching, and how to support it, making the following contributions:  Designing a discussion structure to support PSTs in practicing responsive teaching &ndash; unpacking student ideas and developing responses to those ideas &ndash; in their university coursework in which they learn to be science teachers. Developing theory that guides interpretation of and response to student ideas in ways that support student participation in the scientific practices. Articulating a framework to articulate how one might engage in responsive teaching while still achieving target learning goals. Identifying PST?s existing knowledge and skills that enable their participation in responsive teaching &ndash; which challenges existing views of PSTs has "lacking" the ability to do so.  Creating activity structures that can support PSTs in taking the ideas learned in their university coursework regarding responsive teaching, to the k-12 classrooms in which they teach. Constructing questions and prompts to encourage PSTs to examine the impact of their responsive teaching on students? understanding of who and what counts as science.      The broader impacts of this work include:  Providing teacher educators and researchers with guidance regarding ways to support responsive teaching via journal articles and conference presentations and proposals. Teaching teachers (PSTs in our classes, and attendees of a district professional development program) responsive teaching practices in ways that they can take-up in their own classrooms, thereby impacting the science learning of countless students. Presenting images of PSTs engaged in responsive teaching practice to researchers at conferences to challenge deficit views of novice teachers.
