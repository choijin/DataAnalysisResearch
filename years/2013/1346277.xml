<AbstractNarration>Cyberspace is rapidly evolving with nearly every aspect of society moving toward pervasive computing and networking. These changes bring real and wide-ranging cybersecurity threats and challenges that require new solutions based on sound scientific principles. The scale and complexity of the challenges require that researchers employ experimentation infrastructure to enable discovery, validation, and ongoing analysis. The Road To Tomorrow: Cybersecurity Experimentation of the Future project is exploring current and expected experimentation infrastructure needs in the context of current and future cybersecurity research challenges and producing a roadmap for developing an accessible, broad, and multi-organizational cybersecurity experimentation capability that supports tomorrow's research. The collaborative, community-based effort includes three main thrusts: (1) investigate and assess existing experimentation infrastructure and user community experience; (2) identify future cybersecurity experimentation infrastructure needs; and (3) organize the requirements and needed capabilities into a strategic plan and roadmap for future cybersecurity infrastructure development. The future needs are being identified through a series of community-based study groups to understand hard cybersecurity problems and use cases that can benefit from experiment-driven research, identify the experimentation infrastructure needed to facilitate research, and identify gaps between needed and current capabilities and prioritize capabilities based on domain needs. The strategic plan will help shape the development of sustainable experimentation infrastructure to support evolving cybersecurity research needs. The resulting experimentation capabilities will provide essential means for research communities to develop a fundamental understanding of and to reason about cybersecurity solutions and ultimately provide for secure and trustworthy cyberspace.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cybersecurity research and development is a relatively young field and poses intrinsically hard challenges: it inherently focuses on worst case behaviors and rare events in an adversarial context. Crucial to solid progress is a cybersecurity research infrastructure that provides environments where new approaches can be scientifically tested, stressed, observed, reformulated, and ultimately proven before making their way into operational capabilities.  The ever increasing cyber threat landscape demands advanced research and development, supported by revolutionary approaches to experimentation and testing. While there has been increased focus and investment in improving the current state of the art in cybersecurity experimentation, there is clearly a need for new, transformative infrastructure to support cybersecurity research well into the next decade.  SRI International and the University of Southern CaliforniaÆs Information Sciences Institute jointly led a community effort to study and produce a strategic plan for Cybersecurity Experimentation of the Future (CEF). The project included three main thrusts: (1) investigate and assess existing experimentation infrastructure and user community experience; (2) identify future cybersecurity experimentation infrastructure needs; and (3) organize requirements and needed capabilities into a strategic plan and roadmap for future cybersecurity infrastructure development.  The project had broad participation from cybersecurity communities spanning researchers, research sponsors, and customers. Seven senior leaders from government, industry, and academia served as an Advisory Group, helping to inform and guide the work. Community-based study groups helped in identifying: (1) hard cybersecurity problems and associated use cases that could benefit from experiment-driven research, (2) the experimentation infrastructure needed to facilitate research, and (3) gaps between needed and current capabilities. The core team then prioritized gap capabilities based on domain needs.  While one might expect this type of study to focus heavily on experimentation infrastructure (i.e., tools and testbeds), and while significant attention was paid to such, our fundamental conclusion is that an emphasis on infrastructure alone will fall far short of achieving the transformational shift in the research, community, and experimentation required to address cybersecurity in the rapidly changing cyber environment.  The overarching CEF finding is that in order to achieve the desired objectives, transformational progress is required in three distinct, yet synergistic, areas:  Fundamental and broad intellectual advances in experimental methodologies and techniques, with particular focus on complex systems and human-computer interactions. New approaches to rapid data, knowledge, and information sharing and synthesis, to accelerate multi-discipline and cross-organizational knowledge generation and community building. Advanced, accessible experimentation infrastructure capabilities.    The primary CEF output is the report, "Cybersecurity Experimentation of the Future (CEF): Catalyzing a New Generation of Experimental Cybersecurity Research", published in July 2015. The report is available from http://www.cyberexperimentation.org. The report explains the study and provides a detailed roadmap to research, design, and ultimately build future cybersecurity experimentation infrastructure. The roadmap that presents requirements, objectives, and goals for 30 key capabilities organized into eight core areas over three, five and ten year phases.  The CEF intellectual merit lies in the synthesis of the wide-ranging set of broad community inputs on future hard problems, infrastructure requirements, and capability needs.   This synthesis gave rise to the key findings discussed above and to the identification of a new direction for the field of experimental cybersecurity research and development.
