<AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposal is to investigate the mass transfer mechanism between the accretion disk and the central star in Herbig Ae/Be systems.  Herbig Ae/Be stars are intermediate-mass, pre-main-sequence protostars that show evidence of inflow and outflow motions similar to their lower-mass T Tauri star counterparts.  In the case of T Tauri stars, the inflow from the disk to the star is generally thought to be the result of magnetospheric accretion, while mass is transferred out of the system via magnetically driven outflows.  These mass transfer mechanisms require strong dipolar fields, which are present in T Tauri stars but are generally not found in Herbig Ae/Be stars.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed investigation of magnetically driven inflow and outflow processes in young Herbig AE/Be stars will be accomplished through a coordinated program of interferometric and spectroscopic observations along with advanced numerical modeling.  This research will provide valuable insight regarding accretion and wind-generated mass loss as they relate to the formation of stars.  The proposed project will also contribute to scientific workforce development through the support of a co-PI who is currently a postdoc soon to become a research scientist at the Univ. of Michigan.  The project includes public outreach goals that will be accomplished through the development of new exhibits for the historical Detroit Observatory recently re-opened in Ann Arbor, MI.  These exhibits will foster scientific literacy with an emphasis on the fundamentals of astronomical research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit: Stars in our galaxy tend to form in stellar nurseries, clusters of hundreds or thousands of young stars. These young stars try to grow in mass by pulling in nearby material through gravity, but the process is not so simple because of the conservation of angular momentum. This nearby material forms an orbiting disk of gas and dust where planets can form, but slight friction in the gas causes material to spiral into the star. In young stars the mass of the Sun, we observe magnetic fields &gt;1000x times as strong as our current Sun &ndash; these strong magnetic fields are key to allowing gas to flow from the disk to the star itself. In this new research, we studied stars bigger than the Sun which, interestingly, are seen to have weak or no detectable magnetic fields at all. We wanted to answer the question, posed in the title of our original proposal, if these heavier stars gain mass in the same way as young "Sun"-like stars despite the dramatically different magnetic fields. Collecting an unprecedented diverse set of observations, including visible and infrared spectra and interferometry data, we found that the hot gas very close to these heavier stars does seem to be flowing differently onto these stars than for young Suns, and we see little differences between the heavy stars in our sample, whether they have detected magnetic fields or not. We were able to be specific in our conclusions by using a computer modeling code where we found that very different combinations of star, wind, disk, and disk wind parameters can produce similar results, and so gathering as much simultaneous data to constrain models is critical to understanding these systems.   Broader impacts: Through this opportunity, we engaged the UM Astronomy department with the Detroit Observatory, a historical observatory on the University of Michigan campus. We developed hands-on exhibits and posters for the Observatory, as well as a set of slides for astronomers' reference at open houses to share with the public.
