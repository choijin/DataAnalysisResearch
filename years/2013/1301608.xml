<AbstractNarration>This is a proposal in arithmetic combinatorics, which has become an interdisciplinary field of research with many applications. While certain themes in additive combinatorics are classical in number theory, there is also focus on new structural questions that turned out to be important. For instance, the work of Gowers and, later, Green and Tao on arithmetic progressions have put considerable impetus on Freiman's theorem and it's quantitative versions. Parallel to these results, a general `sum-product' theory in finite fields and residue rings was developed. The roots of this research go back for instance to early work of Erdos-Szemeredi  and the finite field version of the Kakeya problem (solved by Z. Dvir). It turned out that results from sum-product and product theory in various settings are of interest in their own right as they lead to new results in analytic number theory (such as estimates of short character sums), in pseudo-randomness and in group theory (growth, expansion and spectral gaps). The PI intends to explore finite field analogues of the Szemeredi Trotter theorem on incidences for algebraic curves (which are a special case of so-called pseudo-line systems). In the finite field setting, such results are presently only available for straight lines. More general results for pseudo-line systems have been obtained over the reals but none of the known approaches seem adaptable to the finite fields situation, so that new ideas are clearly needed here. Results of this type would have major implications in the areas mentioned above because they allow to obtain nontrivial statements on solutions of systems of equations in situations where classical number theory is not applicable. As a particular case, the PI would like to obtain analogues of the Bombieri-Pila results on lattice points on curves restricted to boxes in the prime field setting. Related to 'growth' phenomena in groups, the work of Breuillard, Green and Tao provides a complete description of 'approximate groups' that in some sense generalize Freiman's theorem and also provide a finitary version of Gromov's theorem. At this stage, the results are only qualitative and obtaining quantitative versions would be most interesting, in particular in view of the consequences to group expansion. The PI will continue to work with her collaborators on Poonen's conjecture on the multiplicative order of F-points on curves. Again this is a problem at the interface of combinatorics, algebra and number theory where progress can be expected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arithmetic combinatorics and `sum-product theory' in various settings have become increasingly significant to various other fields, such as pseudo-randomness in computer science, classical analytic number theory and the theory of expansion in linear groups. The purpose of this proposal is to continue research on the related issues in combinatorial number theory and their applications in particular, to  problems of estimating the number of solutions of algebraic equations when the variables are restricted. This research involves different groups of people and the interaction of various branches of mathematics, occasionally leading to progress on old problems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The general line of research is at the interface of number theory, combinatorics and theoretical computer science. The interaction between these areas has been mutually beneficial in the past. Often new arithmetic questions emerge stimulating further research and occasionally leading to significant progress. The topics described below fall in this category and relate mostly to arithmetic combinatorics in prime fields.   Estimation of double sums with a multiplicative character modulo p over an interval and a subgroup of the multiplicative group of the finite field with p elements. We obtain nontrivial bounds for wider size ranges of the interval and the subgroup. These results have applications to primitive roots modulo p with 3 non-zero binary digits, an issue in theoretical computer science.   A major problem in the theory of finite fields is to produce generators of the multiplicative group of a finite field in polynomial time. Since there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to factor integers, one settles for finding elements of large order. We give lower bounds on the orders of points lying on various plane curves over the finite field when the characteristic is sufficiently large. For example, one of our bounds implies that if the order of x is greater than 3, then either the order of x or the order of x+1 is greater than p^{1/4}. Related results on the orders of points on algebraic curves (obtained in collaboration) turned out to be also crucial to progress on some well known number theoretic issues, such as the strong approximation problem for the Markoff surface and the diophantine study of Markoff numbers.   We establish new estimates on short character sums for arbitrary composite moduli with small prime factors. Our main result improves on the Graham-Ringrose bound for square-free moduli and also on the results of Gallagher and Iwaniec. Applications to zero free regions of Dirichlet L-functions and the Polya and Vinogradov inequalities are given, leading in particular to an improved version of Linnik's famous theorem on the smallest prime in an arithmetic progression when the modulus has small factors.    We introduce several new methods to obtain upper bounds on the number of solutions of congruences of the type f(x) = y mod p, and f(x) = y^2 mod p, f a polynomial,where (x,y) is restricted to an arbitrary square with side length M. We give two applications of these results to counting hyperelliptic curves in isomorphism classes modulo p and to the diameter of partial trajectories of polynomial dynamical systems modulo p. These are again issues relevant to computer science.              Last Modified: 08/06/2016       Submitted by: Mei-Chu Chang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
