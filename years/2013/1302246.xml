<AbstractNarration>The most significant performance and energy bottlenecks in a computer are&lt;br/&gt;often caused by the storage system, because the gap between storage device&lt;br/&gt;and CPU speeds is greater than in any other part of the machine.  Big data&lt;br/&gt;and new storage media only make things worse, because today's systems are&lt;br/&gt;still optimized for legacy workloads and hard disks.  The team at Stony&lt;br/&gt;Brook University, Harvard University, and Harvey Mudd College has shown that&lt;br/&gt;large systems are poorly optimized, resulting in waste that increases&lt;br/&gt;computing costs, slows scientific progress, and jeopardizes the nation's&lt;br/&gt;energy independence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, the team is examining modern workloads running on a variety of&lt;br/&gt;platforms, including individual computers, large compute farms, and a&lt;br/&gt;next-generation infrastructure, such as Stony Brook's Reality Deck, a&lt;br/&gt;massive gigapixel visualization facility.  These workloads produce combined&lt;br/&gt;performance and energy traces that are being released to the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, the team is applying techniques such as statistical feature&lt;br/&gt;extraction, Hidden Markov Modeling, data-mining, and conditional likelihood&lt;br/&gt;maximization to analyze these data sets and traces.  The Reality Deck is&lt;br/&gt;used to visualize the resulting multi-dimensional performance/energy data&lt;br/&gt;sets.  The team's analyses reveal fundamental phenomena and principles that&lt;br/&gt;inform future designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Third, the findings from the first two efforts are being combined to develop&lt;br/&gt;new storage architectures that best balance performance and energy under&lt;br/&gt;different workloads when used with modern devices, such as solid-state&lt;br/&gt;drives (SSDs), phase-change memories, etc.  The designs leverage the team's&lt;br/&gt;work on storage-optimized algorithms, multi-tier storage, and new optimized&lt;br/&gt;data structures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The most significant performance and energy bottlenecks in a computer are often caused by the data storage system, because it is much slower than the main computer memory or processor.  Larger amounts of data (aka big data) and new storage media only make things worse, because today's systems are still optimized for legacy workloads and technologies.  The team at Stony Brook University, Harvard University, and Harvey Mudd College has shown that large systems are poorly optimized, resulting in waste that increases computing costs, slows scientific progress, and jeopardizes the nation's energy independence.  This project examined modern large scale computer systems; collected and released massive data traces; analyzed the data and visualized it on a massive gigapixel visualized facility (Stony Brook's Reality Deck); and then designed more optimal algorithms, computer data structures, and software to improve both performance and energy efficiency of computer systems.  We have released software and massive multi-terabyte data sets for the community to use, and we published many journal articles and conference papers.  Already other researchers have been busy using our releases and several published papers based on those releases.  We graduated several Ph.D. students and dozens of MS students thanks in part to this project.  Our graduated students are gainfully employed in the high-tech industry.  We also engaged several undergraduate students in this project and even one high-school student.  We integrated topics from this project into many of our graduate and undergraduate courses, and helped direct the evolution of our CS programs to include more big data topics.  Through our efforts, hundreds of Stony Brook University students were exposed to topics related to this project.       Last Modified: 12/04/2017       Submitted by: Erez Zadok]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
