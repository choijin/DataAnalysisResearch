<AbstractNarration>This project will examine characteristics of gravity waves above convective storms and their relationships to fine-scale spatial and temporal variations in associated precipitation, with an ultimate goal of improved understanding of the effects of gravity waves generated by convection upon global climate via their influence on the general atmospheric circulation.  In global models, gravity waves drive circulation changes in the stratosphere that can affect climate, particularly on seasonal and regional scales.  A hierarchy of tools will be utilized, including full-physics cloud-resolving weather research models as well as simpler one-dimensional wave propagation models (parameterizations).  Results from the observationally-validated cloud-resolving models will be distilled to simplified relationships and linked to current physical process parameterizations within climate models.  Specific objectives of the effort will include:  Prediction of where convectively-generated waves will propagate, break, and drive changes in the wind; estimation of diurnal and seasonal variations in the spectrum of waves generated by convection over the continental U.S. by utilizing the dense network of precipitation radar observations and validated weather model studies; testing and improving a state-of-the-art parameterization of these waves generated by convection; and evaluations of indicated improvements in climate model runs.  Broader impacts of this effort will include training of a female graduate student for a research career in dynamic meteorology or related atmospheric/climate science, as well as potential benefits to human safety via improved understanding and potential for improved prediction of thunderstorm-generated gravity waves and associated clear-air turbulence as well as broader weather and climate patterns.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed a quantitative relationship between scanning radar precipitation measurements and remote atmospheric gravity waves that travel upward into the stratosphere.  Gravity waves propagate through the atmosphere with buoyancy as their restoring force, and precipitating storms are one of the known sources. Temperature fluctuations associated with these waves are observable at two select times of the day as NASA?s Aqua satellite passes overhead and scans the atmosphere at infrared wavelengths.  We use images of the waves from this satellite to validate our derived relationships, and we obtained quantitative agreement.  The relationship between precipitation and stratospheric waves involves the derivation of the high-frequency (minutes to hours), small-scale (~2-100 kilometers) latent heating that is released to the atmosphere when precipitation forms.  Existing methods for determining this latent heating are lacking at the spatial- and temporal-scales relevant to gravity waves. The knowledge we gained about this latent heating permits hind-casting of the remote effects of gravity waves on the atmospheric flow, both in the stratosphere and near the surface.    We used this new knowledge to test existing global simulation tools that are currently in use to forecast weather and predict changes in climate.  The results showed that gravity waves emanating from storms across the Midwestern United States drive much stronger stratospheric flows than current weather and climate simulations assume, and our results suggest a way to improve future simulations.    Our hind-casts of gravity waves emanating from storms in the Midwestern United States also suggest a potential role for remotely propagating gravity waves in driving rapid changes in the intensity of storms at distances of several hundred kilometers from the original wave source.  We compared our hind-cast waves to those observed by the USArray Transportable Array of surface pressure sensors and again found quantitative agreement.  This permitted a further investigation of the propagation of these waves in the troposphere, and an exploration of their remote "far-field" effects.  Our results have possible future applications in the fields of climate prediction, weather forecasting, aviation turbulence forecasting, and space weather forecasting.  This project supported the education and research of graduate student Claudia Christine Stephan who completed her Ph.D. thesis titled, "Improving the realism of gravity waves generated by convection in numerical models" in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Ph.D. Degree in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado.  She received her degree in the final year of the project.  The PI of this project served as her thesis advisor.  As both advisor and student are females working in the field of atmospheric dynamics, this research thus supported the education and career development of an under-represented group in STEM research.
