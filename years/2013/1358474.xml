<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to Michigan State University (MSU), in East Lansing, MI, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2015-2017. REU interns will engage in faculty mentored research focused on genomics of plants and photosynthetic microbes that will be suitable for students interested in molecular genetics, biochemistry, chemistry and computational biology. Participants will be selected from a pool of junior and senior applicants with an emphasis on individuals from minority serving and primarily undergraduate institutions. This REU provides interns with experiences designed to help prepare them for graduate school. Interns will be immersed within an active research group and will interact with faculty, postdoctoral associates and graduate students to acquire research skills and an in depth understanding of their project. The program will be augmented through weekly presentations describing MSU research programs and faculty career paths, together with seminars addressing scientific ethics, presentation skills, and career and graduate school opportunities. These activities will be structured to increase each intern's ability to think critically and conduct biological research with the goal of maximizing their future impact on STEM disciplines. Program assessment will be accomplished through a combination of custom surveys and the REU common assessment tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three year REU will train 30 students in cutting edge research in plant genomics. The program will seek to attract students from under-represented groups and smaller institutions where research opportunities are often limited. Experiences will focus on the formulation and testing of hypotheses and the scientific method together with graduate school and career opportunities in the biological sciences. Formal and social interactions with faculty members and their research groups are an integral part of the program and collectively these experiences are intended to provide interns with the experience and confidence to pursue graduate school and scientific careers in the biological sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available at http://www.plantgenomics.msu.edu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Cornelius Barry at barrycs@msu.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Robert Last at lastr@msu.edu).</AbstractNarration>

As the human population increases, it is imperative that we increase crop productivity on the same amount of arable lands and develop new crops that can be grown with reduced inputs. An important step to achieve these goals is the training of the next generation of plant scientists. The Plant Genomics @ MSU Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program provides a 10-week research intensive training opportunity to undergraduates entering the sophomore, junior, and senior years. Participants complete a research project under the guidance of an MSU faculty member that encompasses an aspect of plant genomics. In addition, students participate in a range of professional development activities that include insight into life as a graduate student, the graduate school application process, and careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. During the summers of 2015 &ndash; 2017, this award fully or partially supported 41 participants within a total cohort of 54. These participants were selected from a total of 416 applications that were received from students attending 226 institutions. Seventy-three percent of participants were from primarily undergraduate institutions where access to cutting edge research opportunities are often limited. Seventy-seven percent of participants were female and forty-four percent self-identified as members of groups under-represented in biological sciences. As of fall 2017, thirteen former participants have graduated with a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree and eight have started graduate school, including six who are continuing either plant or genomics-focused research.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/05/2017<br>      Modified by: Cornelius&nbsp;S&nbsp;Barry</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
