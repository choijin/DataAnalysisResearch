<AbstractNarration>The capability to preserve, model, and predict information cascades over online social networks has many theoretical and practical implications, e.g., for marketing, recommendation filtering, and studying of societal behavior. Massive empirical data sets on users' online social activities are being collected, but they are often too big to analyze. The goal of this project is to design graph generative models and summarization techniques that can preserve pertinent information about online social interactions that lead to interesting events, e.g., viral diffusion of information or drastic change of user behavior. Towards this end, the project will develop generative models that can capture the dynamic evolution of user activity graphs (UAGs), which represent a sequence of inter-user communications/actions. At the microscopic level, the project will investigate user influence in the recruitment process. In addition, the project will design graph summarization techniques that can achieve good tradeoffs between data compression ratio, computational complexities, and accuracy in answering fundamental queries, such as identifying 'influential' sources of information cascades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: If successful, this project will provide efficient methods for storing/archiving massive graph data to support longitudinal study on the dynamics of online social interactions, which has potential impact on multiple disciplines (e.g., economics, history, political sciences, and social science). This project will help train future researchers and practitioners in online social networking and network science through classroom curriculum development and online teaching. The PIs will continue ongoing diversity recruitment and outreach to K-12 students. Transfer of technology into commercial practice is made feasible through partnership with industry.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The massive ecosystem of content generation, sharing, and consumption over online social platforms has huge implications on how information propagates and influences user behavior. Being able to preserve, model, and predict information cascades over online social networks will have many theoretical and practical implications, e.g., for marketing, recommendation filtering, and studying of societal behavior. By analyzing massive empirical data sets on users' online social activities, our project aims to achieve three objectives: (1) model diffusion process over online social media and develop learning-based models for predicting both macroscopic properties (e.g., forecasting future active user population size), or microscopic user behavior (e.g., predicting the likelihood of a user to adopt an idea/application); (2) capture cascades and co-evolution across networks and relationships between contents, and (3) developed efficient algorithms to compress user activity graphs using a combination of sketching and sampling for answering the most common queries regarding information cascades. user influence in the recruitment process.</p> <p>Our characterization of anonymized user interaction data over OSN-gifting applications revealed that the evolutionary properties of cascades (e.g., initial growth rate) are good predictors of the ultimate cascade sizes. Our predictive model can achieve high precision (70-95%) for classifying application adoption cascades as small, medium, or large using observed activities in the first four weeks. Our micro-level analysis of how user influence one another and the roles played by users provides insights on future user behavior. We found that the average success ratio of inviters is the most important feature for predicting whether an invitee will adopt a new application or not. We also applied deep learning techniques for extracting image features that can be used for predicting popular or viral image cascades.&nbsp; Our results show that image meta and pinner features are the strongest predictor in predicting popular image cascades.
