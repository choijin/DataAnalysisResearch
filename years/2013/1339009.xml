<AbstractNarration>The proposal requests Phase II funding for the University of Missouri-Columbia (MU) to remain an active site in the Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi). The Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) is university-based enterprise providing innovative solutions for logistics and distribution excellence with our member organizations. CELDi was founded in 2002, with MU joining as a research site in 2008 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As logistics and distribution become a dominant sector of the U.S. economy, the MU research site is uniquely positioned to contribute to CELDi's ability to serve as a think tank and as a driver of the research agenda in the field. In doing so, MU's researchers are developing new approaches to key business problems in the logistics and distribution area and applying them to real-world problems that are experienced by the member organizations on a frequent basis. MU has a highly successful track record in research areas which comprise the range of topics addressed by CELDi: Logistics, Supply Chain, and Distribution / Production Systems. In addressing research issues in these areas, members of CELDi and the broader academic community will reap the benefits of intellectual contribution of MU researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MU has achieved broad impact across the spectrum of organizations that have participated. MU is committed to a diverse faculty representation and to the inclusion of a diverse student population, and will more aggressively pursue these diversity efforts over the next five years. MU works with various companies and government agencies so these organizations are able to operate profitably and keep people employed in their region. MU has also had an impact on the lives of working people through its research which results in better and healthier ways for people to work productively. As the MU research site expands over the next five years, it will continue to see broad and meaningful impacts of its research in a wide range of organizations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The I/UCRC CELDi site at the University of Missouri conducted leading edge applied research for industry members.

Each project had specific deliverables that required the development of novel logistics modeling approaches. This has also resulted in our students being hired by member companies, and those that were not are heavily recruited by other companies.  2) MU CELDi has conducted a Center Designated Project (CPD) that was funded using a portion of the membership fee from each member to address a broader research theme and developed a deliverable of interest to a greater number of member companies.  MU created a tool that examines the ?Impact of Energy Cost on Supply Chain Design and Operation.?  3) MU CELDi was involved in one NSF I/UCRC Fundamental Research Project (FRP) that addressed: "A Decision Support System for Biomass Based Energy Logistics Systems". This FRP considered the biomass logistics systems and investigated the development of a multi-stage biomass supply chain and logistics model that addresses uncertainties, such as those in the biomass availability, process performance, and final product demand / price.  The intellectual merit of MU CELDi research is based on the use of mathematical and computer-based tools to conduct applied research that was implemented by members and was generalized for academic publication.  University of Missouri CELDi researchers published 8 manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings, and had 11 conference presentations.  The broader impacts of CELDi are a function of the impact the research is having on member logistics practice (resulting in economic impact) and the preparation of the next generation of engineers for careers in logistics and distribution. CELDi hosted a biannual research meeting in which all members interact with researchers about the work being undertaken in the Center.
