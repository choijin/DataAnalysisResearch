<AbstractNarration>Objective: This project is for acquisition of a scanning microwave microscope (SMM) system that integrates high resolution imaging and microwave network analysis that operates at frequencies up to 6 GHz. It is capable of mapping impedance, capacitance, dielectric permittivity, permeability and doping density of semiconductors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed instrument evaporation system will enable researchers at Oakland University to pursue a number of interdisciplinary research projects covering a wide spectrum of technologically-important applications. The SMM is ideal for use on metals, magnetic materials, ferroelectrics, and biological samples to map a range of electromagnetic parameters that are dependent on interaction with microwaves. The instrument will be shared by the Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering faculties. The systems will enhance research infrastructure and will have immediate impact on the following research programs: (i) Multiferroic Nano-composites, (ii) RF-MEMS, (iii) Hydrogen fuel cells, and (iv) Chemical and Biological sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed acquisition will significantly enhance interdisciplinary research and educational opportunities for students at Oakland University. The shared facility by Sciences and Engineering faculties will provide with a critical imaging tool and foster collaborative research on new materials for useful technologies. The instrumentation will also facilitate research training for postdoctoral associates and graduate students, research experience for undergraduates and high school students and out-reach activities involving K-12 students. The student population at Oakland University is 75% women and minorities. Efforts will be made to identify, encourage and involve students with disability into related research projects.</AbstractNarration>

The SMM is ideal for use on metals, magnetic materials, ferroelectrics, and biological samples to map a range of electromagnetic parameters that are dependent on interaction with microwaves.  Since the system has a broad operating frequency range, one could vary the frequency to control the penetration depth of probing waves so that one could obtain a "below the surface image" of the material.  Thus the instrument is unique and allows probing the interior of the material for analysis of defects or layered structures.  Such information cannot be obtained from other microscopy techniques.  The instrument is shared by the Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering faculties. The systems is an important addition to our research infrastructure and impacted several research programs on smart materials, hydrogen fuel cells, and chemical and biological sensors.      The acquisition had the following significant broader impacts on interdisciplinary collaborative research, research training for personnel at all levels and outreach activities involving high school students. (i) Collaborative research:  The shared facility by Sciences and Engineering faculties provided us with a critical imaging tool and fostered collaborative research on magnetic and chemical sensors and self-assembly of inorganic materials using biological coupling agents.  (ii) Novel materials for useful technologies: The nanocomposites and systems probed by the equipment are potential candidates for memory devices, magnetic field sensors, fuel cells, detection of explosives, mine safety, and biomedical applications. (iii)  Undergraduate Research Training:  The facility was used for research projects involving undergraduates majoring in sciences and engineering and resulted in undergraduate coauthored publications in professional journals.  (iv) Research experience for high school students:  Several high school juniors and seniors were trained in the use of the equipment.  They competed in the Siemens Competition and Intel Science Talent Search and advanced to semifinals/regional finals in the competitions.  (v) Research opportunity for women/minorities/physically challenged:  Our student population is 75% women and minorities and more than 50% of our student participants in this project belonged to this category.
