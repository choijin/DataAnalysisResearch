<AbstractNarration>This grant will provide travel support for a group of approximately 20 students from the United States to attend the 2014 International Symposium on Flexible Automation to be held in Kobe, Japan on July 14-16. The Symposium will consist of three days of technical presentations, panel discussions, and keynote speeches, followed by post-symposium technical tours of major university research laboratories and industry production facilities in Japan. The focus of panel discussions will be on Green Innovation in Flexible Automation. Some of the organized sessions include Sustainable Green Engineering, Design and Control for Electrified Vehicles, Manufacturing Systems, Production Planning and Scheduling, Digital Design and Digital Manufacturing, Machine Tools and Cutting, Precision Machinery System and Micro/Nano Technologies, Machine and Robot Control, Medical/Nursing Applications and Bio-manufacturing, Additive Manufacturing, Simulation and Computer aided engineering, and Agricultural Machine and Plant Factory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will stimulate technical discussions between students from US institutions and world-renowned researchers in the field of flexible automation, allowing the students the opportunity to network with researchers and students from other countries to forge future international collaborations. Other benefits to the U.S. students attending the 2014 International Symposium on Flexible Automation include the knowledge gained from the technical presentations and discussions on the various processes, systems, and underlying principles of flexible automation, as well as the panel sessions focusing on green innovation in flexible automation. The students will gain first-hand knowledge of the current state-of-the-art in the research, development, and implementation of flexible automation technologies in Japan via tours to various university research laboratories and industry production facilities following the Symposium.</AbstractNarration>
