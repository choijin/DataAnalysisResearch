<AbstractNarration>Natural history collections document Earth's biodiversity and are the raw material for studies of how that biodiversity arose and how it is maintained on our planet. Specimens in natural history collections are of practical importance as well, providing data on human disease and informing forensic science. This award funds the rehousing of an unparalleled natural history collection in new specimen cases. Currently the collection, one of the largest documenting the birds of North America, is under threat of degradation due to antiquated cases that no longer protect against pests and adverse environmental factors. Additionally, this award supports the gathering and dissemination of open-access data on the location of bird specimens. Digital images of specimens from under-studied avian groups will be made available through a new web portal that will engage scientists and the public alike. The location of the world's largest collection of Mexican birds, at a small liberal arts college in the United States, provides opportunities to train undergraduates, who are the next generation of museum scientists, in curation techniques as well as in the application of specimen data to address biological questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to secure, georeference, and digitize the world's largest Mexican bird collection (63,000 specimens), located at the Moore Laboratory of Zoology (MLZ) at Occidental College in Los Angeles, California. Not only does the MLZ collection provide a window into Mexico's endemic bird diversity prior to a major period of development and deforestation, but also, for many widespread species that occur in the United States. The specimens housed at MLZ fill a large, critical gap linking bird populations of the entire North American continent. This project is urgent because new specimen cases are needed to replace antiquated cases that no longer prevent insect infestations and would not be able to protect against accidental flooding. In addition to new cases, the proposed activities include a major update to the taxonomy and organization of the collection, to facilitate the collection's research potential. A major goal of this project is to georeference, digitize and image the collection and make these data accessible as online resources to inform research and education. The MLZ's mission is to leverage our unique setting at a small liberal arts college toward: (i) Conducting cutting-edge research using natural history collections; (ii) promoting the use of natural history collections in undergraduate education and research; and (iii) promoting career development for underrepresented groups and women in museum science.

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Moore Laboratory of Zoology at Occidental College holds the world's largest collection of Mexican bird specimens. The 65,000 specimens have contributed to thousands of studies on the ecology, evolution, and conservation of birds across North America and the world and have provided countless opportunities for undergraduate training in modern methods of biodiversity science, like genomic sequencing and Geographic Information Systems. As a result of this award, the bird specimens were rehoused and protected for years to come in new, pest-proof specimen cases. Consulting archival field notes, each bird was assigned a distinct point on Earth where it was originally collected (georeferencing), which facilitates the many research uses that require location data. The taxonomy of the collection was updated on our online database and the collection was physically arranged in modern taxonomic order to improve access by the research community. A team of undergraduates developed and published a workflow and computational pipeline for creating 3D digital models of museum specimens, which will increase their accessibility for both research use and public appreciation. The method was highlighted on NPR's Science Friday. Using this method, 40 of the key holotypes from the Moore Lab were made freely available on the internet. A new website was designed and launched, with appeal to both researchers and the public. The award directly supported training 8 undergraduates in museum science practices and facilitated the training of 50 other students through an improved database and infrastructure. The award catalyzed further fundraising a full remodel of the building, including an attached genomics center, lobby area with exhibits, and dive locker and research space for a marine science program.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/03/2020<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;Mccormack</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1349179/1349179_10313818_1599164963433_Collection_Photos--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1349179/1349179_10313818_1599164963433_Collection_Photos--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Moore Lab Collage"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1349179/1349179_10313818_1599164963433_Collection_Photos--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Moore Lab Collage"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Images of the Moore Lab Bird and Mammal Collection</div> <div class="imageCredit">John McCormack</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">John&nbsp;Mccormack</div> <div class="imageTitle">Moore Lab Collage</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
