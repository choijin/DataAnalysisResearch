<AbstractNarration>The Summer Undergraduate Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (SUMSRI) is a program conducted by the Department of Mathematics at Miami University. Each year, SUMSRI prepares about 15 students, recruited from institutions across the nation, for graduate programs in the mathematical sciences by providing them with intensive exposure to research and graduate-level mathematics. At the core of this experience is a seminar in which students conduct research under the guidance of a faculty member; each year, three different seminars are offered and students are placed in seminars according to their interests. The program is supplemented by short courses in Real Analysis, Algebra, Mathematical Writing, and GRE Preparation and a colloquium series featuring (primarily) female and minority mathematical scientists. In the year following their participation in the program, participants are asked to present their research at regional and national meetings, with financial support from SUMSRI.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;African Americans and Hispanics, who now comprise over 25% of the U.S. population, together received less than 6% of the 500 mathematics PhDs awarded to U.S. citizens in 2009. The percentage of PhDs earned by female U.S. Citizens was slightly over 30% of the total. Because of the shortage of minority and female mathematicians, SUMSRI is especially interested in, but not limited to, underrepresented minorities and women, with the goal of exposing them to research and graduate education in the mathematical sciences.  In the past twelve years, SUMSRI has proven its effectiveness in preparing students for the challenges of graduate education. Of the 205 graduates of the program from 1999-2012, 44.9% are from underrepresented minority groups; among these, 67.4% are either in a graduate program or have completed a graduate degree, while 14.1% are still undergraduates. Women comprise 74.1% of program graduates, of whom 69.7% are either in a graduate program or have completed a graduate degree, while 11.2% are still undergraduates. SUMSRI can now count 26 graduates who have received the Ph.D. degree; of these, 21 are women and 8 are from underrepresented ethnic groups. Twelve of these have found employment in mathematical science departments within academia, 2 in non-mathematical science departments, and 10 in industry / government.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Summer Undergraduate Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (SUMSRI) has been hosted by Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, every summer since 1999.  The objective of the program is to encourage more students to pursue graduate education in the mathematical sciences, particularly female students and students from under-represented minority groups.  To this end, the components of the program are designed with four principal strategies in mind.  First, students are exposed to graduate-level mathematics: this is achieved through short courses in algebra and analysis.  Seond, each student is assigned to one of two research seminars, in which s/he participates actively and collaboratively in the process of doing research in mathematics.  Third, students receive training in preparation for graduate studies through a GRE preparation course and a mathematical writing seminar.  Finally, students attend colloquia and are given the opportunity to interact first-hand with researchers in the mathematical sciences.  Most of the speakers are women, minorities, or program alumni.     There are two phases to the program.  The first phase, lasting three weeks, is fairly structured, and includes all meetings of the algebra and analysis short courses, several meetings of the writing seminar, and twelve hours per week of research seminar meetings in which the students learn background material for their research project.  During the second phase, students work intensively on their research project, and devote considerable time preparing their final research paper and planning their final oral presentation.  The papers are submitted and the presentations are given on the last Thursday of the program.  The GRE preparation course also meets during the second phase of the program.  In the year following the program, SUMSRI provides support for the students to attend at least one meeting of a professional society at which they give a poster presentation of their work.  SUMSRI challenges students by having them work with mathematics at an intellectual level well beyond that encountered in standard undergraduate courses.  The level at which the short courses are taught gives them a foretaste of the rigor and depth encountered in graduate courses, and the research projects (although themselves not at a doctoral level) engages them in the intense, often frustrating, but ultimately rewarding, process of doing research, which forms the core of the Ph.D. experience.  The projects themselves are serious research questions of interest to the mathematical community, although typically overlooked by seasoned mathematicians with ambitious career goals; as such, they are both relevant and accessible to beginning researchers, and have the potential to lead to publishable results.
