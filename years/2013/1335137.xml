<AbstractNarration>The objectives of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award are: (1) to develop and analyze mathematical and computational models of key elements of the blood products collection, production, and inventory system at a large regional level in order to improve the overall system performance and (2) to advance the state of knowledge in the analysis of these models. The methods that will be used and extended include: completely observed and partially observed Markov decision processes (MDPs) and Markov games, chance constrained MDPs, artificial intelligence-based heuristic search algorithms, mathematical programming, exact and approximate dynamic programming, and stochastic programming.  In collaboration with the American Red Cross (ARC), a comprehensive decision support system (DSS) based on proposed models and algorithms will be built. The outcomes of this DSS will be tested for validation in real collection, production, and inventory environments at the ARC production facility, and at hospitals and blood banks in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is intended to directly impact the quality of delivery in 120 regional hospitals and health facilities and hence can potentially affect millions of people in the Southeast United States. If successful, this research will lead to a more cost-effective blood products collection, production, and inventory system with fewer blood product unit stock outs and with a reduced number of blood product units exceeding their lifetime. Furthermore, the models and decision support tools developed as part of these projects may ultimately be adapted by other service regions in the United States.</AbstractNarration>

Each day, more than 36,000 blood donations are needed in the U.S., accounting for a total of 21 million annual blood component transfusions. The perishable nature of blood products lead to many challenges in blood operations. Effective management of the blood production and service operations is critical for high quality healthcare delivery, and blood shortages and stock outs can cause serious societal problems at the national level, including significant morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this project were: (1) to develop and analyze mathematical and computational models of key elements of the blood products collection, production, and inventory system at a large regional level, in order to improve the overall system performance and (2) to advance the state of knowledge in the analysis of these models.</p> <p>In the first part of this project, we considered improving blood collection operations. The length of time between collecting whole blood and processing it into cryoprecipitate (&ldquo;cryo&rdquo;), a critical blood product for controlling massive hemorrhaging, cannot take longer than 8 hours, while the collection to completion constraint for other blood products is 24 hours. To analyze the blood collection problem, &nbsp;we developed mathematical models to (1) determine which collection sites should be designated as cryo collection sites to minimize total collection costs while satisfying the collection to completion constraint and meeting the weekly production target (the non-split case), (2) analyze the impact of changing the current process to allow collection windows to be split into two intervals and then determining which intervals should be designated as cryo collection intervals(the split case).</p> <p>One of the key outcomes of this research is a resulting decision support tool, which is currently being used by the American Red Cross in daily blood collection operations. The implementation of this tool at two large Red Cross regions has led to a 20% increase in the amount of cryoprecipitate (cryo) collections and approximately 40% reduction in the per unit collection cost for cryo.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Because of it is practical impact, our work has been selected as one of the 2017 INFORMS Franz Edelman Competition Finalists (a video of our finalist presentation is available here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfAT0aNw5lY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfAT0aNw5lY</a> ), and also as one of the 2017 M&amp;SOM Practice-Focused Competition Finalists.

The optimal policy for this problem is computationally intractable due to the "curse of dimensionality". One of the major outcomes of this research was development of a perishable-inventory balancing policy and proving that its expected total cost is at most twice that of an optimal policy and showing that the performance bound was tight.
