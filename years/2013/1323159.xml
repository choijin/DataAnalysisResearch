<AbstractNarration>The World Health Organization reports that the overuse of antibiotics (and the corresponding rise of antimicrobial resistance) is one of the greatest contemporary challenges to global health, but anthropological scholarship about the vernacular uses and meanings of antibiotics remains limited. Studies on antibiotics in East Africa in particular tend to assume that overuse is driven by political-economic and legal conditions, and suggest stricter regulations as the best intervention. This study will provide a timely contribution to this critically important issue by detailing why and how antibiotics are used by the public in Tanzania, where powerful antibiotics are readily available over-the-counter. The PIs will conduct ethnographic research on the multiple uses and meanings of antibiotics in an effort to understand and eventually demonstrate the logics of drug use. The objectives of this project are: 1) to learn where and how people acquire their knowledge of antibiotics, and to trace the narratives they tell about the uses and characteristics of them; 2) to understand how different groups of people attribute potency to certain antibiotics, and what they imagine the sources of these potencies to be; 3) to analyze how antibiotic uses and meanings take shape in dialogue with other treatment regimes; and 4) to gain insight into how drug use contributes to particular understandings of health, the body, and society, which in turn influence choices about drug use. The research will be based on interviews, personal histories of disease and treatment, and close observation and engagement with antibiotics users and distributors in the field (pharmacists, doctors, ordinary users). Once disseminated, this study will contribute to a better understanding of antibiotic use in Tanzania, and help policy makers and medical practitioners who want to influence or understand how people use antibiotics.  This project will also support the scientific training of a promising scholar.</AbstractNarration>

Research was conducted in Iringa, a regional capital in the southern highlands of Tanzania in which there are many pharmacies selling antibiotics (over-the-counter) from different parts of the world.  The data collected reveals that antibiotics are commonly involved in processes of appropriation and modification, in which their ingredients, potency, packaging, and/or labelling is altered at various points from manufacture to sale. This is referred to locally as a kind of "play" and it takes many different forms. A pharmaceutical may be simply counterfeit, but it may also have some of the active ingredient, just in reduced amounts (a condition which pharmacists call a ædouble-standardÆ drug). Alternatively, sometimes packages are switched, to sell a cheaper drug as a more expensive one. Forged stickers with new expiration dates are applied to expired medicine, while forged labels are created to alter the country of origin (as people will pay more for medicines from Europe versus medicines manufactured in Africa, India, or China). Sometimes medicines have lost their potency due to storage conditions (ie- vaccines cannot always be kept cold during transit).  A second finding is that a robust set of methods are used by consumers and medical personnel to ætestÆ the composition and efficacy of such drugs. Sellers are often unaware of the effectiveness of their own products, or, when aware, forced to continue selling counterfeits because there are no effective means of seeking reimbursement from their suppliers. As a result, patients have developed complex methods of evaluating the quality of the medicines they use.

Third, in part due to these concerns, patients and healers both approach the use of antibiotics as a process of medically pluralistic trial and error, often buying/prescribing drugs from multiple shops to treat a single illness, to better their odds, and combining antibiotic use with other types of therapies, including herbal remedies, witchcraft, and religious healing.

Fifth, and lastly, data reveals that counterfeit antibiotics are quite common and are referred to locally as "chakachua". æChakachuaÆ can be defined as æthat which has been manipulatedÆ or æthat which has had its reality alteredÆ. The term is a slang used by pharmacists and clients alike to describe the condition of pharmaceutical medicines in Tanzania. It was originally coined during the 2010 elections, in which much of the country argued ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
