<AbstractNarration>Some of the most remarkable behaviors, including speech, musical, and athletic performance, depend on the brain's ability to precisely represent and control the timing and order of elementary movements.  How the brain accomplishes this feat is largely unknown.  This project will identify how the brain encodes the vocal elements and sequences used in learned vocal communication. To accomplish this goal, state of the art high-resolution optical imaging and electrical recording methods will be used to measure neural activity in animals as they engage in vocal learning and communication.  This project will determine how populations of interconnected neurons that are necessary to vocal communication encode vocal elements and sequences.   Accomplishing this goal is essential to understanding the neural basis of communication and also has other important potential benefits, including the ability to diagnose and ultimately repair brain pathologies that impair perception or movement, and to design machines that emulate these processes.  This project will advance our understanding of neural mechanisms that enable the production and perception of complex, sequential behaviors, train professional scientists at the doctoral and postdoctoral levels, and enrich the science curriculum of high school students both locally and nationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is that it will shed light into fundamental cellular processes by which the brain encodes complex learned behaviors. This project's goal is to understand how the brain encodes syllables and syllable sequences in birdsong, a complex learned vocal behavior.  The study will focus on how syllables are represented by spatiotemporal patterns of activity in populations of sensorimotor neurons important to vocal communication.  Resolving this problem is an essential step to understand the neural basis of vocal communication. This project blends leading edge methods, including multiphoton calcium imaging of neuronal population activity and intracellular recordings and genetic manipulations in singing birds, to explore the synaptic, cellular, and circuit mechanisms that encode learned vocalizations.  Until now, it has been impractical to interrogate how the brain encodes sensory and motor representations of such complex behaviors with cellular and synaptic resolution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major findings of this project have been to further elucidate neural circuits that enable the social context-dependent formation of auditory memories, the social context-dependent modulation of vocal motor performance, and temporally precise forms of vocal sequence learning and production.  Many memories that we form depend on social context:  young children imitate the speech and manners of their parents and older siblings, but not the vocalizations and behaviors of their pets, for example.  We found how the brain integrates auditory and social cues to facilitate that na&iuml;ve juvenile songbirds form an auditory memory of a conspecific song, which is then used to support vocal imitation.  Because the dopaminergic midbrain region that is activated by social arousal/context/motivation in the juvenile songbird is highly conserved in mammals and birds, we suspect that we have uncovered a pathway that serves a similar role in other species, including our own.  Many behaviors are also regulated by social context: During conversation with others, we do our best not to interrupt, and we also attempt to more precisely control our behavior when performing, as during a public lecture or a musical or athletic performance.  We have found neural correlates of how social context modulates song production in adult songbirds, including in both HVC and in its downstream basal ganglia target.  We have unveiled some of the causal mechanisms that enable the male songbird to modulate vocal performance to render it more attractive to a nearby female.  Again, the underlying neural pathways are well conserved across most vertebrates, therefore we anticipate that our findings will be relevant to understanding our own brain and behavior.  Communication depends on blending learned and innate vocalizations, as when we animate our speech with genuine emotion, such as joy or sorrow.  We have mapped out a neural circuit that enables the coordination of innate and learned vocalizations in the male songbird’s courtship display, and in fact coordinates this vocal display with other innate behaviors, such as pursuit of and orientation towards the female.  These findings are broadly relevant to understanding neural mechanisms of vertebrate courtship, and how ancestral vertebrate reproductive circuitry incorporated learned behaviors into innate courtship displays.  As learned behaviors are an essential part of human courtship, these findings are likely to be highly relevant to understanding our own biology.  Lastly, we have mapped circuitry that evaluates song performance (through auditory feedback) and uses this information to reinforce the learning of a single syllable within a longer syllable sequence.  This is relevant to how we learn to modify a previously learned behavior, as formalized musically in themes and variations, and also as realized in modifying more basic learned skills, such as when we learn to ride a bicycle without holding onto the handle bars.  This sort of precise adjustment of previously learned behaviors is in fact a fundamental building block of much of how we learn; that is, we build complex behavioral repertoires by accreting and modifying simpler motor programs.  Additionally, research we performed during this project period uncovered brain wide mechanisms that regulate the precise temporal control of vocalizations, a process that is essential to human speech.
