<AbstractNarration>The generation of high vacuum environments is essential in many chemical analysis analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry which constitutes the gold standard in many applications. In spite of great progress achieved in miniaturization techniques for sensor analysis systems over the past three decades, vacuum instruments have largely remain un-scaled due to the lack of miniaturized devices that can pump down to low vacuums. In this work we propose the design construction and testing of microfabricated molecular pumps that can attain micro-volume pressures of a few ÂµTorr.  We believe these devices will permit the realization of precision vacuum analytical micro-instruments for a wide range of applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The identification of chemical species is of vital importance in analytical instrumentation for liquid and gas based samples. In particular, the mass spectrometer is the gold standard instrument used for identifying species with exquisite resolution, but it intrinsically requires micro-Torr vacuums and bulky and expensive high vacuum pumps. Interest in the realization of low-cost portable handheld gas sensing microsystems has motivated research in gas micro-pumping technology for more than two decades, but it has not yet produced a micro-Torr capable micropump for micro-environments. The availability of high-vacuum micropumps is critical for the realization of miniaturized mass spectrometers for gas analyzers. Such analyzers enable high-sensitivity detection of chemical, biological agents and explosives in a micro-miniature integrated form never realized before.  The principal goal of this work is the development of new pumping techniques and devices for the realization of high performance micro-Torr vacuum pumps suitable for analytical micro-instrumentation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The potential societal and economic impacts of this project are very important.&lt;br/&gt;Microfabricated high vacuum pumps are key components enabling the realization of miniature precision gas analysis equipment based on mass spectrometry. The successful implementation of this research can realize mass spectrometers of the size of a postage stamp. Such miniaturized mass spec has diverse applications in life sciences and national security. Presently the US government has a strong interest in detection and conclusive identification of harmful or dangerous gas phase compounds such as explosives, nerve gas, and other agents at very low concentrations in a pervasive manner. This project will specifically locally promote and develop a range of broader impact and outreach educational activities. In particular we will engage high-school student participation and awareness via the University of Utah nano camps, and we will promote the work to the local community including local high-diversity high schools (Salt Lake City East and West High). These camps are aimed to capture the interest of our excellent local high-school students from West and East high school campuses.</AbstractNarration>
