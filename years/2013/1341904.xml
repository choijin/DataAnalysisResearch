<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry supports an international meeting as part of the Chemical Sciences and Society Symposia (CS3). The CS3 convenes eminent high-level researchers from the US, UK, Japan, China and Germany to explore frontier chemistry research on diverse topics. The CS3 meeting in Tokyo, Japan, September 16-19, 2013 will work to chart a vision for "Efficient Utilization of Elements," i.e. finding new ways to reduce/replace the use of rare/precious metals. Specifically, it will focus on research areas with applications for catalysis, energy storage/conversion, construction materials, and environmental safeguard more sustainably. Representatives from each country's science and technology funding agencies also participate in the symposia. These meetings have been developed multilaterally through discussions of the chemical societies in each participating country (American Chemical Society in the US). This series is intended to be of great value to the global chemistry enterprise and to the world at large as it attempts to foster work in trans-national teams, across scientific disciplines, and beyond institutional boundaries. The workshop proceedings are promoted and distributed to the global science and technology community and the general public through journal articles and reports on the web, respectively. These results and recommendations illustrate chemistry's role in solving challenges in green energy and in pursuing economically-feasible and environmentally-benign commodity chemical production.</AbstractNarration>
