<AbstractNarration>The brain is composed of two major cell types: Neurons and glial cells. Glial cells are traditionally regarded as the brain's supportive cells. However, many lines of work over the past decade have documented that glial cells may also participate in complex neural processes and thereby comprise an integral element of higher cognitive function, such as working memory, learning, and sleep. Other lines of work have shown that human astrocytes are larger and structurally more complex than astrocytes in the rodent brain. In support of this concept, transplantation of human glial cells into mice resulted in generation of mice that were faster learners and performed better on memory tests.  However, existing computational modeling techniques employed for understanding the processes involved in learning and memory do not include glial cells. The aim of the proposed research is to: 1) Develop computational modeling techniques that incorporate glial cells. 2) Use these novel computational modeling techniques to make predictions  regarding  the role of glial cells in learning and memory. 3) Test the predictions using a combination of patch clamping and Ca2+ imaging. 4) Use the data collected to continuously refine the computational modeling techniques. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this proposal will be to further the scientific understanding of underappreciated, yet essential substrates of learning and memory.  Including glial cells in addition to neurons in modeling approaches additionally carries the hope of increasing computational power and processing capabilities of adaptive learning technology, in addition to improving the performance of bio-integrated prostheses for individuals with impaired learning or other debilitating neurological disorders.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The complexity of the brain has baffled scientists and the public for centuries. We are attempting to understand how it can do complex visual computations and are developing ideas that extend computation from networks of neurons to include other classes of cells. Progress was made in understanding the function of certain glial cells that, if verified experimentally, could completely change our view of how the brain 'computes.'  The visual computations relate to notions of determining which regions of our visual space correspond to figure (objects in the foreground) and which regions correspond to background (areas to which we are not paying attention and which might be obscured by the foreground object). There are many 'reversible' figures or visual illusions that make these ideas popular.  The basic theoretical challenge derives from the combinatorial complexity of determining which side of a boundary is figure and which is background, regardless of the figure. The insight guiding this work is that such computations might be realized by what are called 'local field potentials,' or a kind of average voltage surrounding boundary selective neurons. Previously such local fields were thought to carry no significant information beyond what was already represented by the neurons. Our explorations challenged this view, by placing a figural completion task well within their capabilities.  When human glial cells were recently incorporated into the developing mouse brain, spectacular behavior resulted. Perhaps this was because of the type of involvement in cognitive activities directly analagous to those in the visual system.
