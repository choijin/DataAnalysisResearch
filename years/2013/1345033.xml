<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to Washington State University to organize a national effort to raise awareness of the Partnership for Undergraduate Life Science Education (PULSE).  Last September, the PULSE partners (HHMI, NIH, and NSF) appointed 40 Vision and Change Leadership Fellows to stimulate transformative changes in the undergraduate life science education community. All Fellows met in October 2012 and have since organized into four working groups to address different challenges to reforming how biology is taught at all types of undergraduate institutions. The Vision and Change Leadership Fellows are focusing on how life science departments can encourage and reward faculty members' efforts to improve undergraduate life sciences education. Such improvements should increase student learning, should increase retention rates for students in the sciences, and should prepare all students to be more curious and scientifically literate citizens.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current award is to fund a Public Awareness Campaign by the Raising the Pulse Working Group. One barrier to implementing the recommendations made in the Vision and Change Call to Action is an awareness of the report itself. Therefore, this multi-step campaign plans to ensure that all department leaders in the US know about the Vision and Change report and know about PULSE activities. These goals will be accomplished by developing promotional materials to be used at conferences, production of a video documentary to highlight the need to reform undergraduate life science education and to highlight effective efforts that are underway, and develop two Local Impact Maps, one to catalog national reform efforts underway and the second to document the continuing activities of the Fellows. The project team anticipates that the PULSE Public Awareness Campaign will increase participation of faculty engaged in Vision and Change efforts and will also motivate departments to implement systemic change in biology education. A greater awareness of PULSE and Vision and Change will help catalyze systemic change in undergraduate biology education throughout the country. Results from the Public Awareness Campaign will be shared at specific regional and national conferences and more broadly with the life sciences community, primarily via the www.pulsecommunity.org website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to support Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This EAGER award was used to further the mission and aims of the Partnership for Undergraduate Life Science Education (PULSE).  PULSE was created in 2012 to transform the education of all students in the life sciences through the widespread dissemination and implementation of the best practices identified in the Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education report (Vision &amp; Change) in departments and institutions of all types across the United States.  The PULSE organization has created and introduced an interconnected suite of products that are designed to allow instituions and departments to first assess their current educational practices, create a vision for their future state, and finally take deliberate actions to improve the educational outcomes of all students that interact with their programs.  These products include the PULSE Vision &amp; Change Rubrics and associated PULSE Recognition Program, the PULSE Regional Networks, and the PULSE Ambassadors Program.   To introduce departments and institutions to Vision &amp; Change and available PULSE programs, clear communication channels and vibrant communities of practice are required.  Funds from this award were used to improve the communication mechanisms used by PULSE and to interconnect individuals and institutions that are engaged in the process of transforming their life science education to effect sustained improvment of life science education for all students in the US.  The first resource that will be a legacy of the work of this EAGER project is the PULSEcommunity.org website.  This site has been continuously upgraded over the life of this grant to be a user-friendly, one stop resource for PULSE programs and  additional resources that institutions need to initiate and sustain their transformation cycle.  One of the Broader Impacts of our work will be the long term maintainance of this website and the continued expansion of the PULSE community of practitioners into the future.  On PULSEcommunity.org, we have explored new avenues for cataloging and communicating transformation efforts at diverse institutions of higher education-one example is the adaptation of Vision &amp; Change and PULSE Impact Maps (a marriage of geographical data with stories of transformation and resources that have been made available to other change agents).   Another avenue for dissemination of Vision &amp; Change to the broader community has been through direct, personal communication with life science educators and administrators.  These interactions have occured at many national and regional meetings of scientific societies or other communities devoted to the transformation of undergraduate life science education.  To facilitate this communication, funds from this EAGER award were used to develop and disseminate PULSE recruiting materials.  These materials have helped recruit new members to the PULSEcommunity as evidenced by continuous growth of membership in PULSE over the past four years (~200% growth over the life of the EAGER award).
