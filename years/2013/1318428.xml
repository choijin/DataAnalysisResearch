<AbstractNarration>This project involves the development and delivery of software security education to university students and professionals, and the dissemination of curricular materials to educators to enable effective security education throughout their courses. A large intentionally vulnerable electronic health record (EHR) application with associated artifacts to support the lessons is provided to all student and educators.  Instances of the EHR application are hosted in a virtual environment such that students can get their own virtual instance and practice attacks against the system whereby the attacks would be contained/safe and not cause actual damages.  All curricular resources are made freely available to educators.  Students are educated in a laboratory-based course with learning objectives met through active learning exercises.  Professionals are provided with options for taking the course via a Massively Open Online Course (MOOC) or by taking a course through an always-available system. The educational practices (a) increase the knowledge level of practitioners and students in issues related to software security; and (b) increase the understanding of two forms of online education and on active learning in the university classroom.  The research enhances the infrastructure by providing open resources and educational modules for software security.  The work improves the ability of practitioners to produce secure and reliable software products so that people can justifiably rely upon computer systems to perform critical functions securely.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An article published in the March 16, 2017 issue of Forbes magazine predicted a global shortage of two million cyber security professions by 2019 based upon input by ISACA, a non-profit information security advocacy group.  Additionally, Forbes reported that cyber security data tool CyberSeek predicts that every year in the U.S., 40,000 jobs for information security analysts go unfilled, and employers are struggling to fill 200,000 other cyber-security related roles.    The purpose of this grant was to provide software security education on a widespread basis to increase the supply of cybersecurity knowledge workers.   We also sought to compare platforms for providing knowledge on software security to university students and professionals.  The three platforms we compared are (1) in-person in a university setting; (2) a synchronous online class whereby the class proceeded through lessons at the pace of the instructors; and (3) asynchronous whereby students were provided educational resources and proceeded at their own pace.  The course was focused on providing students the knowledge to design, implement, and test secure software products.  The course had four learning objectives: (1) security risk management: assessing the security risk of a system under development, including formal and informal abuse case, threat models, and security metrics; (2) security testing: a variety of types of securing testing, including static analysis, fuzz testing, and penetration testing; (3) secure coding techniques, including coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities from being injected into software; and (4) security requirements, validation and verification, including privacy requirements. Course resources can be found at this link: https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/csc515-software-security/Schedule-of-Subjects/Prelim.  During the grant period, the in-person class was taught four times, the synchronous online class was offered two times, and the asynchronous online class was offered two times.  In all cases, the in-person students outperformed the online students.  The in-person students were learning in a regular semester-long class with more assignments and projects than the online students due to the inability to automate the grading of student projects (and not having enough resources to manually grade projects of online students).  The student population on the online classes was more diverse than the in-person classes, indicating that the online class has a greater potential to reach Caucasian, African-American, and Hispanic professionals in information technology.  We also learned that students expect online courses to be free, based upon the prevalence of free courses.  In our first offering of the online courses, we used an asynchronous platform (DigitalChalk) in which students had to pay $25 for the hosting service.  We had zero students take that course.  In the second version, we used an Amazon Web Service platform paid for by the grant.  Students enthusiastically took that free version.  We also learned that we could retain more students through the production of professionally-developed course modules.  The first version of the online class utilized videos produced via the Camtasia tool by the research staff.  The second version utilized professionally developed videos by StemBrite (http://STEMbrite.org).  Our feedback on the professional videos was significantly higher than the first offering, and we retained more students in that class.
