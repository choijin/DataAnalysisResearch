<AbstractNarration>The goal of this Baja Basins Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) project is: (1) for student participants to develop skills in conducting and communicating scientific research, (2) to employ an integrative field and lab research approach, using digital technology and modern analytical lab equipment, and (3) to learn international cooperation by collaborating side-by-side with Mexican students, professors, and mining professionals to address research questions on the tectonic evolution of the economically important Santa Rosalía rift margin basin in Baja California Sur, México. Few places in the world expose volcanic and marine sedimentary sequences and large uplifted Quaternary terraces that can be used to understand the processes involved in the progressive stages of continental breakup, including magmatic activity and economic  mineralization.  The  geologic  youthfulness  of  the  Santa  Rosalía  basin  along  this segment of the Gulf of California, as well as excellent exposures make it ideal for resolving the rates of development of structures and resulting depositional systems. Participants will spend three weeks in México conducting field research during the winter intersession to take advantage of cooler  weather.  This  will  allow  time  for  sample preparation  to  be done before  the  four-week  summer laboratory  analysis  session  is  conducted,  on  the campus of the University of Missouri-­Kansas City. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This REU site will recruit junior undergraduate geoscience majors with an emphasis on Hispanic, bilingual, veteran, and women students. The collaboration with Mexican scientists, mining professionals, and the international nature of the fieldwork will provide an unparalleled avenue for cultural enrichment for the students as well as an experience in global cooperation between academia and industry that will be invaluable for a student's future success in an increasingly global workforce and economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being co-funded with the Office International and Integrative Activities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Baja Basins Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site is a U.S. National Science Foundation-funded program that seeks to provide students with a unique U.S.-Mexican collaborative research opportunity that combines digital field mapping techniques on economically important rocks with state-of-the-art laboratory analytical work. The research led by Prof. Tina Niemi of the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC) and Prof. Cathy Busby of University of California-Davis focused on investigating the tectonic evolution of the Santa Rosal&iacute;a basin area with three weeks of field research in January in Mexico combined with a month of analyses at UMKC in July each year of the project. In collaboration with Minera Boleo mine, the program introduced 30 U.S. students to professional-level scientific inquiry and research skills while collaborating side-by-side with U.S. and Mexican students, professors, and Minera Boleo mining professionals. &nbsp;</p> <p>Studies conducted during the three years of the Baja Basins REU program made progress toward solving a number of geologic questions in the Santa Rosalia Basin of central Baja California. Geochemistry and <sup>40 </sup>Ar/ <sup>39</sup>Ar geochronology on volcanic rocks within the basin record the transition from subduction (13.32&ndash;9.95 Ma) to rifting (younger than 9.42 Ma) prior to deposition of the upper Miocene Boleo Formation. In contrast, magnesian andesite lavas and intrusions on the south margin of the basin are dated at 6.1 +/- 0.3 Ma, and may have provided the heat engine for Boleo basin mineralization, which occurs in strata-bound layers called &ldquo;mantos&rdquo;. Mineralizing fluids in the Boleo Formation, had near-neutral pH, evolved from a low Eh to more oxidizing conditions, were relatively low-temperature (near ambient T during manto ore deposition), and likely derived the Cu, Zn, Co, and Mn by leaching of mafic minerals in the volcanic rocks underlying the basin. Deposition of the ores was driven by oxidation as warm spring fluids vented to subaerial or near-shore marine environments, producing blankets of precipitated oxides interlayered with detrital fine to very coarse clastic beds. Integration of geologic map and fault data with detailed sedimentology and stratigraphic analysis provides evidence for syn-basinal tilting in two orthogonal directions during deposition of the Boleo Formation and Plio-Quaternary Tirabuz&oacute;n, Infierno, and Santa Rosalia formations. Pronounced tilting toward the SE is revealed by southeastward thickening and coarsening of deposits in the Boleo Formation, and was synchronous with northeastward<em> </em>tilting and thickening due to slip on a network of NW-striking oblique normal faults. We hypothesize that the basin formed, subsided, and deformed as a pull-apart basin in a releasing step-over between two propagating transform faults that opened the late Miocene Gulf of California. The neotectonic evolution and uplift history of the Santa Rosalia Basin is documented through mapping of fluvial and marine terraces, characterizing pedogenic development on them, and calculation of morphometric indexes, integrated with detailed coast-parallel and long stream topographic profiles. Quantification of uplift rates is ongoing through cosmogenic surface exposure dating and luminescence geochronology.</p> <p>Throughout this project, we have emphasized three main points that address broader impacts: 1) developing a learning environment that promotes undergraduate students&rsquo; taking ownership of their own research as evidenced in the presentation of 25 posters at professional meetings, 2) promoting women, under-represented minorities, and veterans in the field of geosciences, and 3) modeling international cooperation and training in a globalized workforce. Various levels of support (peers, graduate students, mentors, professors) provided instructional scaffolding to the REU undergraduate students and helped them achieve the learning and achievement outcomes of the Baja Basins REU program. As an additional benefit, Baja Basins REU students had the opportunity to see how geology is applied to the mineral industry by working with Minera Boleo mining engineers and exploration geologists, and touring the mines and the mineral processing facilitates. Rarely do undergraduates have the opportunity to gain working knowledge of the application of geology to industry. These are very important elements of the Baja Basins REU that, together with the ongoing basin analysis and tectonic investigations, models international research and collaboration and provides culturally-linked research opportunities for the participants in the program.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/21/2018<br>      Modified by: Tina&nbsp;M&nbsp;Niemi</p> </div> <div
