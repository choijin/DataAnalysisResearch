<AbstractNarration>In marine species, movement of individuals between sites is facilitated by long distance ocean dispersal but this may hamper the ability of populations to evolve adaptations in response to differences in environments. In the Hawaiian waterfall-climbing goby fish, Sicyopterus stimpsoni, island populations are connected through oceanic larval dispersal but juveniles entering freshwater streams on each island encounter different environmental pressures during migration upstream. Our study uses models of ocean currents, environmental features, land use practices, and the strength of natural selection between streams to predict survival and distribution of adults and juveniles across the Hawaiian Islands. We will compare these predicted patterns to measured values of genetic and morphological traits to better understand the relative roles of natural selection, ocean dispersal, and chance in maintaining viable populations of this native Hawaiian fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our results will identify populations most likely to persist and those most critical to future reproductive success. Such results will aid the Hawai?i Division of Aquatic Resources in designing plans to protect this unique and culturally important Hawaiian fish. In addition, undergraduates at Clemson University and in-service public school teachers, through SC Life, will be trained in inquiry-based research and molecular and computational techniques.</AbstractNarration>

However, organisms that can reach these new habitats are generally those capable of long-distance dispersal, resulting in migration between populations that weakens the impact of these new environmental pressures in promoting local adaptation. This is particularly true in the marine environment where barriers to dispersal are often less obvious than those in terrestrial environments and where quantitatively evaluating selective pressures can be difficult. The endemic Hawaiian waterfall-climbing goby, Sicyopterus stimpsoni, has an oceanic larval phase and encounters strong selective pressures (predation and climbing waterfalls) during post-larval migration up streams in order to reach suitable habitats for growth, maturation, and reproduction. However, the influences of these selective pressures vary across the Hawaiian Archipelago. Therefore, S. stimpsoni is an excellent candidate for studying how selection, drift, and gene flow interact to promote or impede the evolution of local adaptations.   Using an integrative approach of morphometrics, oceanographic and individual-based modeling, I compared the patterns larval dispersal, natural selection and morphological variation between populations from the islands of HawaiÆi and KauaÆi.  Despite there being evidence for high gene flow among populations, the direction and extent of gene flow are not uniform across space and time, and morphological differences are strongly associated with stream topography (Moody et al. 2015). Selection due to predation and waterfall climbing may override the effects of gene flow, but how and when is still needed to be determined. In order to understand how stream topography influences the opportunity for selection, and whether in-stream selective pressures are strong enough to overcome the effects of gene flow, I developed individual-based models coupled with oceanographic larval transports models.  These models demonstrated that larval dispersal across the Hawaiian Archipelago is asymmetric from Hawai'i to Kaua'i (southeast to northwest).  Furthermore, the amount of larval that settle at their island of origin varies between the islands (Hawai'i with the highest, ~50%, and O'ahu with the least, ~15%, amount of local larvae).  In addition, these models demonstrated that selection can override the homogenizing effects of gene flow and promote local adaptation, but only in combination with a modest degree of local retention or self-recruitment (~30%). Therefore, in order for natural selection to cause population divergence between stream environments, the larval pool must consist of roughly a third of locally adapted larvae.    Overall, the balance of selection on new recruits and larval dispersal facilitates the ability of subpopulations of S. stimpsoni to adapt to local stream environments while still maintaining population connectivity during the pelagic larval phase. Our study allowed us to determine whether natural selection within the stream habitats could override the influence of migration across the archipelago, allowing for the evolution of local adaptations that were consistent with observed targets of selection, and leading to morphotype divergence between subpopulations of S. stimpsoni juveniles and adults.  Our coupled models allowed us to address the complex evolutionary and ecological processes driving population connectivity and local adaptation in the marine environment.  By better understanding the complex evolutionary dynamics of this goby system, our results will aid in developing better management strategies to promote population persistence and protection of this ecological and culturally important Hawaiian endemic.
