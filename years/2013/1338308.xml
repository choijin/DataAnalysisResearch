<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for the 6th NSF Large Facilities Workshop, which will be hosted by the Associated Universities Inc./National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) at the Array Operations Center in Socorro, New Mexico on April 23-25, 2013. The NSF Large Facilities Workshop has been held annually since 2008 and provides a forum for discussing best practices and sharing lessons learned from operational experiences at the NSF-funded large facilities. The workshop will highlight performance measurements for scientific facilities and establishing measurement processes; experiences with competition of awards for facility management and operations; and various approaches to data management including the curation and distribution of scientific data generated by the facility for legacy use. The workshop will also emphasize fostering close interactions and making new contacts to facilitate continuous improvement in operational aspects of NSF large facilities.</AbstractNarration>
