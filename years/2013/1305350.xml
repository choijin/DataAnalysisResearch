<AbstractNarration>Increasing functionality and complexity of integrated circuits, particularly those used in high performance computational devices such as computers but also in portable and mobile devices, necessitate high frequency communication links.  The information generated and processed at the relentlessly increasing pace in these devices flows over the high frequency communication links between computation, storage and display units.  The design and analysis of these high frequency communication links, much like the computation, storage and display units themselves, necessitate design and measurement equipment that is capable of supporting their multi-GHz range of operation.  This project is for the acquisition of such a measurement testbed for high frequency interconnects to be located at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA.  Opportunistically, the measurement testbed is used for testing of many types of circuits and systems including those involving microelectronics, optics, sensors, radio-frequency applications, nano-electronics and molecular-electronics.  Measurements of the circuit and system devices enabled with this infrastructure enable the development of computing devices that are increasingly portable, fast and significantly less power demanding than the current electronic products.  The measurement testbed is used to develop lecture modules on high frequency measurement, bridging a gap with the US microelectronics industry demand with practical hands-on training with integrated circuit measurement and testing in undergraduate education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The measurement testbed is used by a large number of faculty members at the host institution (and users in the Delaware Valley region) in a number of computing and non-computing projects.  The primary computing projects that are enhanced by this measurement testbed are novel approaches in developing high performance integrated circuit interconnects: 1. On-chip wireless interconnects, 2. Resonant clock interconnects, 3. On-chip wireless interconnects. The measurement testbed is useful as a whole or in pieces to the many other computing and non-computing research areas thanks to enabling on-wafer testing and multi-port measurement.   These additional projects range from reduced dimensional photonics for THz sensing to nanowires for energy storage and IC-based artificial photosynthesis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was for the acquisition of electronic instrumentation devices (an oscilloscope, a network analyzer, a probing system) for the research and measurement of research projects in the area of high performance interconnects.  Increasing functionality and complexity of electronic devices such as computers and mobile devices necessitate high performance interconnects.  These interconnects are responsible for carrying the information between computing and storage devices, and across the stack from the chip to the cloud.  Innovation in this domain require research in multiple disciplines such as electrical and computer engineering, material science and mechanical engineering, where each one of these disciplines were represented by research projects on the investigator team from the host institution, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA.   Measurement of interconnects enabled with this testbed infrastructure, for the investigator team, enabled the development of computing devices that are increasingly portable, fast and significantly less power demanding than current electronic products.  Graduate and undergraduate students were trained on the testbed, contributing to the development of a competent, diverse US workforce, particularly important for the emerging gap between the US microelectronics industry demand and the research advancements reported around the world.  Multiple students were involved with the Vertically Integrated Projects teams of the investigator team, bringing together students from different academic years (freshman to graduate students and post-docs) to work on common projects.  A wide diversity of the VIP teams was strongly encouraged, with students from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM, as well as from different academic disciplines, were intentionally sought with direct advertisements, a grassroots effort of VIP students recruiting for their teams, and personal outreach of the investigators.  This project led to scholarly products that include two US patent disclosures, with the potential for more, as new research is enabled by the testbed, and the trained students continuing to perform research.  New research and ideas are formulated using the measurement results and capabilities introduced, including those on the energy-recycling circuits and voltage regulation on chips, the latter the topic of one of the two US patent disclosures.  The testbed is also providing a physical infrastructure that is allowing the research teams to build on additional capabilities for research that includes 5G communication, energy storage, artificial photosynthesis, hardware security, and reduced dimensional photonics for THz sensing.
