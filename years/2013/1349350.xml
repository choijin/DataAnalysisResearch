<AbstractNarration>An award is made to the National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota (NCMA) to serve as a central repository to receive, maintain and distribute living cultures of (primarily) marine algae. The NCMA holds 2,739 strains in 39 taxonomic classes, representing all the major photosynthetic algal groups. Thus, the NCMA maintains the largest and most diverse collection of publicly available marine algal strains in the world. Specific goals related to this project include: (1) Increasing algal diversity and reducing strain redundancy in the core collection; (2) Improving curatorial efficiency and user experience through upgrades in data management and website functionality; (3) Implementing an aggressive business strategy to ensure future sustainability to support our mission and; (4) Increase broader impacts through innovative IT-based outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NCMA represents a unique facility for researchers, educators and companies worldwide, all interested in working with algae as a resource to investigate fundamental questions in biology, global processes and biotechnology. Funding will facilitate expansion of education programs at NCMA to include short focused courses and webinars, increasing the opportunity for educational outreach. Through an upgraded website, the PIs plan to publish journalism-style featured articles: that will be actively presented to customers through 'got algae'?, a new monthly eblast magazine, blogs and social media.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Microalgae are essential photosynthetic plants that support the diverse ecology of aquatic food webs, play a central role in the global environment and climate, and more recently support a rapidly growing bioeconomy.  The National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota (NCMA) is one of a small number of culture collections focused on algae biodiversity, and the only one in the U.S. with a primary focus on marine microalgae.  The NCMA curates over 3,000 distinct algal strains isolated from around the world representing all classes of marine microalgae in culture, with many being unique and representing an irreplaceable genetic resource.  Professionally curated microalgae culture collections, from well-respected sources, are essential to support biological research in the U.S. and globally.  For nearly four decades, the NCMA has provided this unique resource for researchers, students at all levels, educators and companies worldwide, all interested in working with microalgae to investigate fundamental questions in biology, global processes and biotechnology.   This award supported the maintenance activities of the NCMA culture collection to ensure the continuation of this essential national public resource. NCMA is a public resource whose mission is to promote, support, and enable the use of algae for research, education, and commercial applications.  The increasing and diversifying interest in algae as sources of transportation fuels, human food, animal feed, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and many other uses makes NCMA cultures and services essential resources for any interested party. NCMA maintains an informative website to disseminate available information on the strains we curate, and this award supported the collection of additional value-added, and frequently requested, information on each of the strains distributed by the collection, such as cell abundance, size and imagery.  This information enhances the value of the collection and facilitates more effective and rapid advances in the sector of the U.W. bioeconomy.  As an example of the importance of the NCMA to the research community, each year, 200-300 published papers cite use of NCMA-curated microalgae strains, with many of these papers being supported by NSF-BIO.   Since its establishment, NCMA has been developing a robust, yet diverse, educational theme.  NCMA provides informational tours of our facility to the public and interested parties, we write general science articles for public outlets describing our role in preserving microalgae biodiversity, as well as the science we are conducting on globally relevant societal concerns.  NCMA personnel provide guidance to teachers and students in conducting innovative high school science projects and provide presentations on the scientific importance of algae to over 100 school children at local open house events. NCMA offers an internationally subscribed course program in general culturing techniques, mass culturing for biotechnology applications, and harmful algal bloom taxonomy.  Overall this approach of research support and education places NCMA in a unique position within the US as a national resource.
