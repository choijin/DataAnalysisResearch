<AbstractNarration>The ongoing changes in seawater chemistry caused by the dissolution of anthropogenic CO2 into surface seawater will affect the growth of phytoplankton and, hence, the functioning of marine food webs.  One effect of the acidification (lowering of pH) caused by the increasing CO2 is a change in the chemical speciation and bioavailability of essential trace metals.  Recent work with natural seawater samples has shown an unexpected result:  a decrease at low pH in the bioavailability of zinc (Zn), a metal that plays key enzymatic roles in phytoplankton.  Zinc, like other essential metals, is known to be bound to organic complexing agents in surface seawater.  Acidification is expected to decrease the extent of Zn complexation and thus augment its availability to phytoplankton.  Such increase in Zn biovailability is indeed seen upon acidification of laboratory media in which Zn is bound to a known complexing agent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, a research team at Princeton University will test whether the paradoxical decrease in Zn biovailabilty seen in acidified samples of natural seawater is explained by a shift of Zn from weak and bioavailable organic complexes to strong unavailable complexes.  Proof of principle for such a "two-ligand mechanism" has been obtained in laboratory systems and is generalizable in principle to other bio-useful trace metals such as manganese, cobalt, nickel copper and cadmium.  The experiments will involve parallel chemical and biological experiments with natural surface seawater samples at different pHs:  (i) electrochemical measurements of Zn and Cd complexation by weak and strong ligands, and ( ii) Zn and Cd uptake experiments with model phytoplankton species and natural populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This project is directly relevant to an issue of great concern to society and will further our understanding of the possible ecological effects of global ocean acidification, an ineluctable consequence of the ongoing increase in atmospheric CO2.  It will also augment our understanding of the processes that control the bioavailability of essential trace metals to marine phytoplankton.   The results of the research are thus expected to generate wide interest and some will likely be published in journals with broad dissemination and high impact. They will be also incorporated into two of the courses taught by the Principal Investigator at the undergraduate and graduate levels and in a "Science day" event at a local elementary school.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Marine Phytoplankton, the photosynthetic organisms that constitute the base of the food chain in the oceans, are responsible for nearly half of the primary production on Earth. This project is concerned with the effects of the ongoing increase in the concentration of atmospheric CO2 and the attendant acidification of the surface ocean on the physiology and growth of marine phytoplankton.   We conducted a detailed study of the effects of acidification on the bioavailabilty of some trace metals (particularly zinc) that are essential to  phytoplankton and sometimes limit the growth of these organisms in the ocean.  Laboratory experiments demonstrated that acidification increases the bioavailability of Zn in the presence of some organic compounds, but decreases it in the presence of others.  Those results are explained by the different acid-base chemistries of these organic compounds and their different effects on metal bioavailability.  In addition the results of the biological experiments could be matched quantitatively with purely chemical measurements of the chemical reactivity of the metals using electrochemical analytical techniques.  Results obtained in the course of this project are clearly advancing our understanding of the effect of increasing CO2 on the physiology and ecology of marine phytoplankton and primary production.  In addition, our work is elucidating fundamental processes that are at the core of the fields of algal physiology and biological oceanography.  Over the years, several postdoctoral researchers, doctoral students and undergraduate interns worked on this project which provided an excellent platform to further their training and scientific development. Most of these people have obtained good university positions (as faculty members, postdoctoral researchers and graduate students) which allow them to pursue careers in science. These young people are now part of a cadre of young environmental scientists and oceanographers who will develop a molecular understanding of environmental and oceanographic processes.
