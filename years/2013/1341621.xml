<AbstractNarration>Patterns of variability in sea level pressure (SLP) are a potential diagnostic of the Antarctic atmospheric circulation, and may be used to model polar forcing mechanisms such as stratospheric ozone depletion, greenhouse gas (GHG) increases, tropical SST changes and intrinsic extra-tropical climate dynamics. Previous work has shown some skill in gridded reconstructions of temperature over Antarctica, yet no similar Antarctic-focused data sets exist for SLP. A few studies have recognized the fact that SLP variability over the Antarctic is the largest of any comparably sized region on Earth. This implies low signal-to-noise ratios. For both modeling and observation-based studies, long time periods need to be considered, not just the data-rich instrumented period since ~1979, in order to assess the roles of various types of forcing and to detect their signals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to answer two sets of questions: (1) How has the Antarctic circulation changed during the last century, both at individual stations and across the continent? Are changes in the past three decades unique in the last 100+ years? (2) What mechanisms are associated with these changes, both in the zonal mean and regional circulation patterns? What is the range of natural (internal) variability, and what role do changes in SSTs, GHG forcing, and/or ozone depletion play in driving any of these changes?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project's main goal in terms of intellectual merit was to understand the range and scope of the Antarctic atmospheric circulation variability during the 20th century.  However, because little climate data exist over Antarctica prior to the International Geophysical Year (1957-1958), new datasets (reconstructions) had to be generated in order to extend available observations back throughout the 20th century.  This was accomplished using statistical models to relate pressure variations in the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere with those in Antarctica.  Pressure anomalies at 18 Antarctic stations, displayed in Image 1, were reconstructed for each season.  Because the mass of the atmosphere is a constrained quantity, we were able to produce skillfull reconstructions at individual stations. The second image displays samples of the highest and least skillful pressure reconstructions across all 18 stations; correlations with observations during the period of overlap indicate the highest skill in austral summer, and lower, but still reliable, skill in austral autumn (MAM) and spring (SON).  These reconstructions were then interpolated to produce a spatially complete reconstruction of pressure poleward of 60&deg;S, extending back to 1905, more than doubling the length of most Antarctic atmospheric observations.  The third image shows time series of area-averaged pressure reconstructions over Antarctic for austral summer since 1905.  These reconstructions agree well with a reanalysis product, ERA-Int, and provide a new long-term estimate of Antarctic pressure variability throughout the 20th century.  A seoncd half of this project analyzed these reconstructions to assess the Antarctic pressure variability and change, and to place recent pressure changes (particularly in austral summer and autumn) in a longer historical context.  Given the stronger forcing and higher reconstruction skill in austral summer, we primarily analyzed pressure variability in this season, but also investigated the other seasons as well.  The primary outcome of this analysis was that only in austral summer are there significant long-term trends (since the early 20th century), mostly in stations on coastal East Antarctica, as shown in the fourth image.  The recent negative pressure trends are unique in the context of the entire 20th century, and follow a period of positive trends in the early 20th century (which themselves are significant in the coastal south Atlantic sector of Antarctica).  To understand the causes of these pressure trends, the reconstruction was compared to climate model simulations that isolated the role of tropical sea surface temperature (SST) variability, ozone depletion, and the comination of tropical SSTs and radiative forcing (including both greenhouse gas increases and ozone depletion).  These comparisons identified ozone depletion as the primary mechanism for the recent negative summer Antarctic pressure trends, but with an important secondary role from tropical SSTs, especially after 2000, as shown in the final image.  Comparison of the reconstructions with the model simulations in other seasons further indicate the dominant role of internal climate variability and tropical SSTs, with no discernable impact from ozone depletion.   A separate portion of this project generated a new monthly reconstruction by interpolating the long-term station observations directly.  This new dataset was compared to other existing datasets, and shown to provide a more robust comparison to data across Antarctica, especially in capturing periods of positive pressure trends in the non-summer seasons.  Broader impacts of this work include the creation of several new pressure datasets for Antarctic climate research, with the potential for use in other areas outside of meteorology and climatology including glaciology, oceanography, and biology.  The project supported and trained several undergraduate students (5 in total) and 2 masters-level graduate students.  Outreach through yearly presentations at a local middle school and across campus formed an important component of this project outside the laboratory.  All data generated as part of this project have been placed on figshare for future scientific use, and are freely available and citable.
