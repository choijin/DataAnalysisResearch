<AbstractNarration>Fossil insects provide a unique deep-time record of ecological and evolutionary response to past environmental changes and therefore are invaluable for understanding the impacts of climate change on the current biodiversity crisis.  Given current models of future climate change and the important role that insects play in human society (biodiversity, pests, pollination, vectors of disease) the ability to access these data and make predictions about future insect populations becomes even more urgent. The Fossil Insect Collaborative will make available all the major collections of fossil insect specimens in the United States by creating electronic specimen records consisting of digital images and associated collection data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The digitized fossil insect collections will be made broadly accessible to the research community, K-16 education, government and industry, the general public, and the media through the project website and a central site integrating all the paleobiological Thematic Collections Networks called iDigPaleo.  Mobile apps and activities that allow a wide variety of users to experience and interact directly with the collections data will be developed. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of the present project was to capture data from the resident insect fossil collection at the University of Kansas and make these data available freely via the web.  The data could then be linked to the data from other fossil insect collections in the collaborative project (e.g., American Museum, Harvard University, Yale University), and these data would then be collectively available for use by researchers in a variety of disciplines.  During the course of the project we trained two graduate students and several undergraduate students in modern insect paleontology, arthropod evolution, curation of major research collections, conservation and preparation of museum specimens, and modern digitization techniques and database design.  In addition, we captured data from the historical fossil insect collection resident at the University of Kansas, representing unique material from the Paleozoic (particularly from Kansas and Massachusetts), as well as Cretaceous and Cenozoic fossils, mostly in amber from deposits in the Baltic, Dominican Republic, and Southern Asia.  These data represent a unique source of information available for understanding paleoclimates, arthropod communities in deep time (particularly changes in those communities), paleoecology, extinction patterns, and the general evolution of insects.  The data are freely accessible via the University of Kansas Natural History Museum website (https://biodiversity.ku.edu/entomology), as well as via data aggregators such as GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), among others.  The data are also integrated with data from modern insect species in these collections, permitting direct comparisons between living and fossil relatives of a particular insect lineage and thereby allowing the exploration of patterns through time within a given family of insects.  As the most diverse and abundant form of life on Earth, insects are of considerable ecological significance, particularly those families that relate directly to human health and security through their roles in agricultural and urban ecosystems.  Accordingly, any understanding of their present diversity and responses to environmental or ecological change are best understood in the context of their responses to analogous events in deep time, thereby making a link between data from living and fossil species of considerable importance and value to researchers in fields as disparate as paleontology and conservation.
