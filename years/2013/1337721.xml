<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor David Rovnyak from Bucknell University and colleagues Thomas Selby, Marie Pizzorno, Timothy Strein and Charles Clapp will acquire an isothermal titration calorimeter (ITC). The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) study of molecular interactions by microscale calorimetry; (b) guest-host binding by bile micelles; (c) study of protein-protein interactions between viral proteins; (d) characterization of inhibitors of soybean lipoxygenase-1; and (e) binding and specificity of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) enzymes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a very sensitive thermodynamic technique that is used to characterize binding interactions between species such as those between a small molecule and an enzyme. ITC measures directly the heat absorbed or released during a binding process. This provides insight on the strength of chemical and biochemical binding interactions. The calorimeter will also be incorporated into several upper division level laboratory classes. Thus this instrument will be used not only in research but also in educational and outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Individual molecules in any liquid solution are always in motion.  When two molecules collide in solution and stay associated for some time (informally, ?stick together?), then these molecules have a lower energy together (energetically favored) than apart.  The change in energy that occurs when two molecules make a stable association can be measured using an isothermal titration calorimeter (ITC).   The magnitude of the energy change when molecules interact with one another provides a measure of the strength of the molecular association (informally, the ?stickiness?) and often leads to deeper insights on what factors contribute to strong or weak binding among such molecules.  This project allowed the acquisition of an ITC instrument to measure the strength of intermolecular interactions to support research at Bucknell University.  Bile acids are a family of naturally occurring molecules found in the liver.  One broad reason for their importance is that they participate in the transport of lipids and cholesterol in our bodies.  Experiments enabled by this project measured energy changes when bile molecules assemble to form micelles, which are aggregates of individual bile salt structures.  Importantly, this project also measured the energy change that occurs when a guest molecule enters the bile micelle host.     Intellectual Merits  Bile acids can act as molecular shuttles in our bodies.  First, bile molecules can self-associate in to super-structures called micelles.  Next, these bile micelles have pockets that can accommodate guest molecules.  The micelle-forming and guest-binding processes of bile salts were examined with ITC.  Thermodynamics of Micelle Forming.  The ITC data reveal many critical features of the energetics of bile micelles.  The ITC data show a sensitive entropy-enthalpy compensation effect for bile micellization, a thermodynamic reality that is expected for order-disorder transitions, where the disordered state has a higher heat capacity.  The ITC data directly reveal the enthalpy change (DH) of solution interactions, but also reveal the critical micelle concentration for bile micelle formation, allowing calculation of the  the Gibbs Energy change (DG), and by and the entropy change of micellization (DS).  We find that entropy makes a large contribution to the binding process, indicating the importance of the solvent molecule rearrangement in the process.  Interestingly, the enthalpy change is negative below room temperature, but can become slightly positive if the binding occurs at higher temperatures in aqueous solutions.  Selective Binding of Chiral Guests.  Some molecules have a property of handedness called chirality.  In some cases, bile micelles may bind one ?handed? form of a molecule more strongly than the other form.  Fulfilling one of the key goals of this work, we carried out measurements which show the energetic advantage of binding one handed form of a guest molecule versus the other form (see accompanying figure).  Using two different bile systems, cholate and taurodeoxycholate, we found that bile micelles bind with the S-isomer of a particular guest molecule more strongly than the R-isomer by just 0.7 kJ mol-1, a difference on the order of one extra non-covalent interaction.     Broader Impacts  The acquisition of an isothermal titration calorimeter has stimulated research across several laboratories at Bucknell University.  Approximately 10 students have gained first-hand experience using this  instrument intensively in research efforts, while about 50 students to date have used the instrument in formal instruction.  Bile acids exhibit remarkably complex behavior.  The work here builds systematic evidence on how bile acids associate and how they bind guest molecules, and does so without the use of any probe molecules.  The information gained through these experiments contributes to a growing base of knowledge that should help to better understand the biochemical activity of these molecules, but which also helps to understand their potential for use in applications such as separating chiral molecules from each other.
