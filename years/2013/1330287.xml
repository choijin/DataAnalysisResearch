<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on a novel ultrasonic acoustophoretic separation technology that is economic, efficient, sustainable, and environmentally benign.  Current technologies, e.g., hydrocyclones, and membrane filtration, suffer from problems, such as high energy costs, use of consumables, fouling, and limited efficiency in separation of micron-sized particles.  The proposed technology does not generate waste, does not use consumables, operates at a low energy cost, and provides efficient separation for micron-size particles.  Ultrasonic standing waves are used to trap secondary phase particles in a fluid stream, when the acoustic radiation force exerted on the particles is stronger than the combined effect of fluid drag and buoyancy.  The action of the acoustic forces on the trapped particles results in agglomeration and/or coalescence of particles and droplets.  Heavier than water particles are separated through enhanced gravitational settling, and lighter particles through enhanced buoyancy.  During Phase I, successful prototypes were designed with a separation efficiency of more than 90% of a 1000 ppm emulsion at flow rates of 2500 Liters per minute.  Phase II focuses on the development of a system capable of processing 4 gpm, with fully integrated customized electronics, and testing of the system on real-world emulsions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the novel acoustophoretic separation technology provides for a cheaper and lower cost of energy separation of multi- component phase mixtures.  It can function as a drop-in replacement for conventional separation technology, such as hydrocyclones and other methods.   The societal impact is the development of separation technologies that are sustainable and environmentally benign since they do not generate any waste or use consumables.  Enhanced extraction of micron-sized oil droplets from water offer opportunities for enhanced oil recovery and oil-spill cleanup and reduce the emission of micron-sized oil droplets into the environment. This project increases the science and technology behind the use of acoustic radiation force on large volume flow rate. Full numerical models will be created to use in conjunction with experimental results. Dissemination of this work will be done by publishing our results in peer reviewed journals and conferences.  This project provides several internships to undergraduate engineering students, an opportunity to learn and practice engineering, innovation, and entrepreneurship at a small start-up company.  FloDesign Sonics has a strong history and commitment to integrating undergraduate students in the development of their technology through offering internships and providing supervision for senior capstone design projects.</AbstractNarration>
