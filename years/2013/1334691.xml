<AbstractNarration>The warm mid-Pliocene, when on average global temperature was 2-3 degrees C warmer than at present, is within the range of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections of global warming for the 21st century, and hence offers a good analog for future climate change. This work, conducted by a team of scientists from Rutgers University, will generate new geochemical proxy records (Mg/Ca, B/Ca, and Neodymium isotope composition) from deep sea sediment cores that will provide key constraints on spatial and temporal variations in the deep ocean hydrography in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Southern Oceans during the transition from the mid-Pliocene warm period to the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation (~2.5 to 3.5 million years before present). The new records will improve our understanding of the response of the deep ocean to the mid-Pliocene warmth and provide valuable insights into the ocean sensitivity to warmer/higher pCO2 conditions and during the subsequent transition to overall cooler climates in the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to better understanding links between the oceans and climate in a past analog to modern conditions, broader impacts include education and training of a female post-doctoral fellow and research opportunities for undergraduate students. The results will be presented in seminars, at national professional meetings, and incorporated into teaching curricula at undergraduate and graduate levels. The datasets generated in this research will be made available through the NOAA-NCDC web site.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The transition from the warm Pliocene period about 3 Myr ago to the Pleistocene climate, which is dominated by strong glacial-interglacial variability has puzzled paleoceanographers for a long time.  This is partly because it seems to occur apparently independently of major changes in atmospheric pCO2. Likewise, previous studies have suggested that, on average, sea surface temperature (SST) in the western Pacific warm pool (WPWP) remained stable during these transition. Previously, using benthic foraminifera Mg/Ca we have documented cooling of ~3-4&deg;C of North Atlantic deep water since the mid-Pliocene warm period (~3.2 Ma) to the present, consistent with marine and terrestrial temperature records from northern hemisphere sites. In this study we have generated additional records of deep ocean temperatures for the period of ~2.5-3.2 Ma from the Pacific and South Atlantic Oceans, which are compared with the North Atlantic record from DSDP Site 607.  The new North Pacific record shows no long-term cooling at during that time interval.  Based on these records we have argued that expanded Antarctic glaciation 3.15 to 2.75 Ma imparted changes to inter-hemispheric oceanic transfer of heat and salt, which fundamentally altered deep ocean geometry and circulation, contributing to the NHG (Woodard et al., 2014; McKay, 2014). Thus, we have put forward the hypothesis that by altering oceanic circulation and the distribution of heat and salt in the ocean, the expansion of the Antarctic ice sheet has been the trigger for the intensification of northern hemisphere glaciation and the ensuing glacial cycles.  The records also provide evidence for changes in the seawater carbonate chemistry at that time (derived from measurements of B/Ca ratios in benthic foraminifera) suggesting that these dynamic changes were associated with perturbations of the carbon cycle.  Broader impacts: The project was carried out primarily by post-doc Stella Woodard.   In addition, several undergraduates have participated in the research at various roles.  This includes one funded through NSF-REU supplement.  Results of this research have been discussed in scientific meetings and also in the general media.
