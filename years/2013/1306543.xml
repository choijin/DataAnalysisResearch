<AbstractNarration>The main objective of this project is to support participants to attend the special session "Advances in Symplectic Geometry and Topology" in the first edition of the Mathematical Congress of the Americas, which will be held in Guanajuato Mexico, August 5-9, 2013. The goal of the Congress is to highlight the excellence of mathematical achievements in the Americas within the context of the international arena, and foster collaborations amongst researchers, students, institutions and mathematical societies in the Americas. Our participants consist of established scholars, mid-career mathematicians as well as PhD students. The aim of the session is to offer an opportunity for interaction amongst researches in different stages of their careers, and to discuss the current developments in the fields of Symplectic Geometry and Topology. More information about the session is posted in http://www.math.umb.edu/~eduardo/MCA2013/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic Geometry and Topology have become ubiquitous branches of Modern Mathematics, and play a central role in several of the latest cutting-edge problems of interest in Mathematics and Physics. Since its early origins in classical Mechanics, Symplectic Geometry has undergone several revolutionary transformations which have helped to systematically understand complex natural phenomena, from dynamical systems to strings. This meeting will expose current research in Symplectic Geometry and Topology to a broad audience in an international arena. We expect to cultivate collaborations between multinational institutions and researchers. We want to influence graduate students, postdocs and junior scholars and give them access to the expertise of several established researchers in the field.</AbstractNarration>
