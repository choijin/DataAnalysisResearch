<AbstractNarration>The widespread availability of communication networks fosters interactions among nodes that constantly affect each other by exchanging information over the available communication links. This dynamic, interactive, aspect of communication is common to many networked systems, from social networks to biological networks. Its causal nature differs from the batch coding and processing of classical communication systems and is not handled well by the traditional information theory results. These settings are more appropriate for the functioning and the understanding of control and regulation processes and, more generally, processes of learning and adaptation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of the proposed research is to characterize the fundamental limitations of interacting dynamical systems over noisy communication links.  We start analyzing the problem of interactive point-to-point communication where the encoder has access to noisy feedback from the receiver based on a new information theoretic quantity that captures the actual information flow in the forward channel when the feedback channel is noisy. From it, we propose to derive computable bounds on the noisy feedback capacity for common channels, to develop control-inspired practical coding schemes that are robust to noise in the feedback link, and to characterize costs and benefits of using noisy feedback.  Further, we propose extensions of the theory to other new noisy feedback structures motivated by remote guidance and virtual reality applications. The resulting dynamical systems are both communication and control systems at the same time. We aim to study properties and limitations of these interacting dynamical systems, in an integrated way, by extending the relevant results in networked control systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of the project has been to understand and characterize limits of information transfer in feedback applications. These applications include classical point-to-point data communication with access to feedback, as well as new ones, like stabilization, learning, and optimization, where information is transmitted through feedback loops or networks.   In particular, we have focused on four main directions of research: 1) Limits of reliable transmission for communication systems with access to feedback 2) Limits of stabilization and performances of linear control systems over Gaussian channels. 3) Design of networked distributed optimization algorithms resilient to unreliable form of communications.  4) Identification of socially optimal cooperative games, which require no communication.   The main results and discoveries are summarized as follows.   Feedback capacity of Gaussian Channels.   We provided the first algorithm to compute the feedback capacity of Gaussian channels with memory. We have derived efficient computing methods for Inter-Symbol-Interference channels with colored gaussian noise. We have extended the capacity results to unstable channels. We have also provided encoder and decoders to achieve the capacity and extended the results to MIMO channels.   Limitations of control systems  The optimal feedback communication schemes we have derived are tightly related to linear feedback control systems.  The flows of information of a feedback control system can be analyzed and fundamental performance limitations of the closed loop systems can be computed using the tools we have developed. Viewing sensors as communication channels, we have introduced the concept of sensor feedback capacity. Thus, when used in feedback applications sensors with memory   have a larger capacity then when used in open loop data acquisition which we can compute. Understanding the implications and applications of this fact will be the focus of future research.         Optimization systems resilient to unreliable communication  We have derived completely asynchronous distributed optimization algorithms based on fixed point algorithm for non-expansive maps. The methods allow multi-agent algorithms to progress toward the common optimum point as far as information reaches them. We have also developed scalable distributed solvers of linear systems of equations that are resilient to link dropouts.     Cooperative games with no information exchange.  Lastly, we have investigated the role of information exchange in certain cooperative games. We have identified certain cost functions that can be socially optimized by selfish agents. These results points to extreme situations where cooperation is possible without coordination and information exchange among the agents.  These network free settings are of interest on their own and provide a baseline for cooperation inducing cost functions, without any information exchange.         Broader Impacts:   Three PhD’s and one MS students have been partially supported by the grant. They have received multidisciplinary training in control, optimization, and information/communication theory and presented their work at relevant conferences in control and information theory.   The PI gave several invited talks on the research developments at national and international academic institutions. The networked control laboratory at Iowa State University, provided hands on experience and training to several undergraduate students involved in senior design projects on cooperative netowked robotics and to a graduate student. Thus far, the NSF support of this grant has led to 4 journal papers and 12 conference papers.                 Last Modified: 02/03/2021       Submitted by: Nicola Elia]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
