<AbstractNarration>Part of the Standard Model of particle physics, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the fundamental theory of the strong interactions between quarks and gluons. The phase structure of QCD is explored via ongoing experiments at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider. In these experiments, the strongly-interacting matter at high temperatures and densities that prevailed in the first microseconds of the Universe can be recreated for a short moment in the laboratory by colliding heavy atomic nuclei at high energies. This project will advance the theoretical understanding of the Quark-Gluon Plasma by studying the electromagnetic radiation and the heavy flavor hadrons used as penetrating probes in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion reactions. The results will be used to improve our understanding of the relationship between the fundamental properties of the strong interactions and the generation of the visible mass in the Universe and the confinement of quarks and gluons into nucleons, the building blocks of atomic nuclei.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental research conducted by graduate students and post-doctoral associates is integrated with education and outreach activities involving undergraduate and high-school students, including the continued and improved operation of the Saturday Morning Physics program at Texas A&amp;M University that benefits high schools and the general public in Southeast-Central Texas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the early Universe, about 10 microseconds after its birth, a very hot plasma of elementary particles -- quarks and gluons -- condensed into hadronic matter which exists today in the form of atomic nuclei. In this transition, quarks and gluons were permanently confined into their bound states ("hadrons"), thereby generating about 98% of the visible mass in today's Universe. By colliding heavy atomic nuclei in accelerator experiments at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and its transition into hadrons can be induced, for a short moment, in the laboratory. The transient nature and microscopic size of the fireballs formed in these reactions makes it very challenging to infer the properties of the medium from its decay products which are measured in large detectors. In this project, the PI has developed theoretical methods and their applications to probe and extract fundamental properties of the strongly interacting medium formed in nuclear collision experiments.  A particularly valuable probe of the fireball medium is its electromagnetic radiation of photons and dileptons. Once produced, photons and dileptons traverse the strongly interacting fireball essentially unscathed, providing direct information on the temperature and degrees of freedom of the emitting medium. The PI's work has established the invariant-mass spectra of dilepton radiation as a precise and universal observable to measure the lifetime and early temperatures of the fireballs over a wide range of nuclear collision energies. He contributed to resolve the so-called ``photon puzzle" through his calculations of thermal photon emission rates from the hadronic phase of the fireballs. Finally, his theoretical investigations of in-medium hadron properties suggest a general mechanism whereby hadron masses degenerate and ultimately melt in the transition to a QGP.  The heavy charm and bottom quarks are excellent probes of the modifications of the fundamental force between quarks in matter, including its confining property. Utilizing modern many-body theory techniques, the PI extracted the in-medium heavy-quark potential from numerical results of computer simulations of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory underlying the strong nuclear force. The resulting heavy-quark potential exhibits a long-range remnant of the confining force in the QGP. This feature implies a strong coupling of a heavy quark to many surrounding quarks and gluons in the QGP, and suggests the emergence of a strongly coupled medium. This has important consequences for the transport properties of heavy quarks diffusing through the fireball of a nuclear collision. These properties are being quantitatively tested by ongoing and future measurements of spectra of hadrons containing heavy quarks.  The PI has continued to build a vigorous higher education and research program in forefront nuclear theory. He has led a productive group of young researchers including one postdoctoral research associate (who joined the high-skill workforce in the software industry), five graduate students (leading to one MS and one PhD degree over the 3-year project period), and three Research Experience for Undergraduate students during summer (who subsequently  were all accepted into reputable physics graduate programs). He also fostered public outreach by running the Saturday Morning Physics (SMP) program for regional high-school students that he introduced and directed since 2006 at Texas A&amp;M, for the three consecutive spring terms (with 7 events each) during the reporting period. SMP remains an effective tool to engage underrepresented groups in the STEM disciplines, with, for example, a ~40% fraction of female participants out of a total of over 100 high-school students each year.
