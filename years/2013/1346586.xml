<AbstractNarration>1346586 &lt;br/&gt;Carlson, Ross P.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the participation of US investigators and graduate students in the Metabolic Pathway Analysis meeting to be held in Oxford, UK from Sep. 16-20, 2013.  The meeting has a primary focus on the structural (topological) analysis of metabolic networks, and in particular techniques allied to linear algebra, linear programming and computer modelling. This focus may be applied at many levels of abstraction, from individual reaction mechanisms, through pathways, organelles, whole organisms and, most recently, mixed populations. Covered topics will include Metabolic pathway analysis, Metabolic flux analysis, Elementary mode analysis, Metabolic modelling, Metabolic engineering, Genome scale modelling. One day will be devoted to Thermodynamics in Metabolism.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF support will help ensure the success of the meeting by partially defraying conference costs for select US academic scientists and engineers with an emphasis on underrepresented groups and graduate students. In the absence of NSF support, many US academic scientists and graduate students would not be able to attend and to benefit from interactions with the international community of metabolic analysis/engineering  researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award from the Biotechnology, Biochemical, and Bioengineering Program of the CBET Division is co-sponsored by the Synthetic and Systems Biology Program of the Molecular and Cell Biology Division.</AbstractNarration>
