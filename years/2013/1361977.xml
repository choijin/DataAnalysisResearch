<AbstractNarration>The I/UCRC for Disruptive Musculoskeletal Innovations intends to bring together expertise in medical device design; new advancements in materials, nano-technology, and medical imaging; computer modeling; clinical expertise in musculoskeletal care; business acumen for medical device innovation; and analysis of large national databases that include both clinical outcomes and cost data. By doing so, CDMI has the potential to advance knowledge by bridging these academic skills to pressing needs of the medical technology (MedTech) industry.  CDMI plans to conduct research encompassing multiple disciplines, including material science, biomedical engineering, nanotechnology, biosensors, implant design, information technology, and advanced imaging that have the potential to reduce costs and improve outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The med-tech industry has an important role in the US economy. However, US pre-market regulatory processes, combined with coverage and reimbursement uncertainties, create significant deterrents to innovation, and places America?s leadership position in jeopardy. Without confidence that a new medical technology will be paid for, industry cannot justify the investment required to bring that technology to market. As a result, there is a pressing societal need to create more value from the money spent on medical technology, and thereby manage healthcare cost increases without sacrificing the benefits of innovation.&lt;br/&gt;For the US to maintain its leadership in medical technologies, healthcare dollars need to be channeled in ways to foster innovation that is sustainable. The cooperative research efforts of the CDMI seek to provide, in part, a framework to achieve these ends.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overall mission of the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded Center for Disruptive Musculoskeletal Innovations (CDMI) at three Institutions is to address pressing societal needs associated with the growing burden of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). MSDs are the second largest contributor to disability worldwide, with low back pain being the single leading cause of disability globally. Treatment for MSDs in the US, including indirect costs, was $874 billion (5.7% of GDP) in 2015. MSDs are a significant underlying factor in the current opioid epidemic, as they are the primary, non-cancerous, reason for opioid prescriptions in the US. The important research areas pursued at three sites included: characterizing MSD causal pathways; developing tools for MSD risk assessment, diagnosis, and functional recovery; predictive analytics for clinical care management; medical device design and testing; and clinical outcomes assessment with an emphasis on cost/benefit and patient value. The goal is to generate data on incidence, pathomechanisms, treatment outcomes, and costs associated with MSDs, and based on these data, develop new technologies for MSD prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. During Phase I funding, the University of Toledo - UT with expertise in Medical device design, computational modeling, empirical testing, and testing standards undertook 33 projects and published 57 research articles. During this 5-year period 38 undergraduate students were trained; 15 students were graduated with degrees (Figure 1).
