<AbstractNarration>Brookdale Community College (BCC) is designing, implementing, and evaluating an innovative pathway from cyber talent to cyber workforce. It includes a unique public-private partnership that leverages the agility of community colleges and the course material of the SANS Institute to develop a scalable, competition-driven, hands-on education model that has a potential to help with the nation's critical shortage of cybersecurity workforce. The project designs metrics to identify individuals with the appropriate aptitude and expose them to vital, in-depth, hands-on learning model focusing on defending computer systems and networks. The project utilizes a multiphase competition-based model and, at each stage, students compete to demonstrate their competence and to advance to the next phase of the program. Students who successfully complete all components of the program and demonstrate their mastery have the opportunity to apply for residency positions where they can hone their skills working with practicing security professionals on real-world projects. The proposed competition and residency based model for developing the cybersecurity technical talent has a real potential for dissemination and implementation in a large number of the 1,200 community colleges nationwide.</AbstractNarration>

These sessions, led by Qaissaunee and co-PI Ed Skoudis, although not included in the original project plan were added to encourage team-building and to develop hands-on and leadership skills.

Direct outreach to the K-12 community has also occurred through a partnership with two Red Bank Regional HS teachers (both CyberAces Academy graduates) and faculty in our Computer Science department.

Within our courses, we have explored a variety of lab offerings to ensure that we provide our students with the most impactful hands-on experiences. These have included labs performed on our own physical infrastructure, as well as access to labs maintained by the National Center for Systems Security and Information Assurance (CSSIA) center, Jones and Bartlett Learning, Infosec Learning and TestOut.
