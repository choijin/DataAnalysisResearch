<AbstractNarration>1338167&lt;br/&gt;Christopher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for acquisition of a Shimadzu Nexera High Resolution Liquid Chromatograph Coupled to a Shimadzu Quadrupole Ion Trap Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (LCMS-IT-TOF?). This state of the art equipment is a critical asset for advanced research that will maximize the integration of research and education and accelerate progress in the areas of Energy and Environment and Materials and Manufacturing -two of the top priorities for research and development at SDSM&amp;T. The instrument will fill a critical gap in research infrastructure and capabilities at SDSM&amp;T as there is currently no such instrument on campus. Similar LC/MS systems are available at the South Dakota State University in Brookings and University of South Dakota in Vermillion, which are both approximately 400 miles away from Rapid City. The proposed equipment will serve a large number of departments and individual users across campus and will be a critical asset for accurate molecular mass measurements, reaction monitoring, identification and quantitation of impurities and target compounds in complex chemical and biological systems, rapid screening of small and large molecules, proteomics research for amino acid sequencing, structural analysis and quantitation of enzymes, etc. The LC/MS system will be used for research in a number of disciplines on campus such as chemistry, chemical engineering, bio/geo/chemistry, bioprocessing, microbiology, molecular and applied biology, ecosystems, environmental sciences and engineering, and  materials engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ After receiving a NSF major research instrumentation grant, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology acquired a liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer that combines ion trap and time-of-flight technologies from Shimadzu Scientific.  After the installation, the instrument has been available for researchers both on and off campus.  In coordination with Shimadzu Scientific, we hosted multiple on-site training events for the instrument in 2015.  These events included multiple faculty, postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students.  Many departments and programs at SD Mines were involved in the aquisition of the instrument and participated in training including: Atmospheric and Environmental Scienses, Chemistry and Applied Biological Sciences, Chemical and Biological Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Industrial Engineering, and Materials Engineering and Science.  Additionally, one of the SD Mines chemist faculty members was given one-on-one training by the specialists that came from Shimadzu Scientific to ensure proper care of the instrument.  Since the installation and training, the instrument has supported 3 avenues of research from a collaborative group of chemists and biologists at SD Mines.  In addition, it has supported biomedical research.  Further research collaborations may be possible due to the increase in research infrastructure.  For our outreach component, a ninety minute STEM module was created and delivered to South Dakota GEARUP students on behalf of this NSF MRI Project.  South Dakota GEARUP, Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, helps prepare American Indian high school students for college.
