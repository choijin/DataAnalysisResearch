<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: recent work has suggested and demonstrated a mechanism connecting Arctic Amplification (AA ? enhanced Arctic warming) with an increased probability of extreme weather events in northern hemisphere mid-latitudes, as well as a feedback to arctic wind patterns that drive further ice loss. This study will extend this work using output from reanalyses, model simulations from the CMIP5 archive, and experimental CESM model runs to investigate how and why the ongoing loss of arctic sea ice and high-latitude terrestrial snow cover may cause mid-latitude weather patterns to change. Past and projected patterns in 500 hPa heights will be analyzed using a combination of Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) ? a neural-network-based technique that reduces large data sets to their representative patterns ? a new meridional circulation index, and an extreme weather index to address the hypothesis that Arctic Amplification of past and future global climate change promotes circulation patterns that favor extreme weather events in middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere. The PIs suggest that changes in the energy budget of the arctic surface, because of sea-ice loss and earlier snow melt on high-latitude land, reduce meridional thickness gradients, which induce generally weaker zonal flow aloft and higher amplitude circulation features. They think these upper-level flow patterns slow the eastward progression of large-scale atmospheric Rossby waves, favoring more persistent weather conditions that increase the probability of extreme weather such as cold-air outbreaks, heat waves, droughts, and heavy precipitation. They believe the primary physical mechanism driving the change is an enhanced and seasonally varying arctic heating: in fall/winter it is ocean-based associated with substantial sea ice loss, while in warmer months it is land-based due primarily to earlier snow melt and reduced soil moisture. Higher-amplitude flow trajectories may also exacerbate sea-ice and snow-cover loss, thereby constituting a positive feedback loop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because extreme weather events, such as temperature and precipitation extremes, are often caused by high-amplitude, slow-moving upper-level circulation patterns, this analysis will focus on detecting and characterizing these patterns, interpreting the weather conditions associated with them, and identifying regions that are likely to be affected. This study attempts to connect arctic change with the rest of the global climate system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Changes in extreme weather as a result of greenhouse gas accumulation will directly and dramatically affect millions of people across the globe, thus a better understanding and more accurate future projection of changes in the frequency, location, and severity of droughts, floods, and temperature extremes are urgently needed by decision-makers at all levels of society. Preliminary work has already attracted world-wide attention via articles in prominent newspapers, radio interviews, interviews for the Weather Channel, magazine articles, and numerous online blogs. This will also be an opportunity for a new post-doc. The PIs will prepare a module for the NSF-supported ?Beyond Penguins and Polar Bears? project for K-5 teachers. Both PIs make frequent public and school presentations on climate-change related issues, and because extreme weather is so relevant to society at large, results from the proposed study will figure prominently into these presentations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary  The focus of this project was to detect and characterize the Arctic's influence on weather regimes condusive to extreme events in mid-latitudes, interpret the weather conditions associated with them, and identify regions that are likely to be affected. We employed a variety of existing data sets and metrics, and developed new metrics, that helped elucidate relationships between rapid Arctic warming and changing mid-latitude weather patterns. The novel metrics included self-organizing maps, new measures of weather-regime persistence, and a jet-stream waviness indicator called sinuosity. Both reanalyses of past atmospheric conditions as well as model simulations of the past and future were used to assess past and future changes and relationships.  Intellectual Merit  Funding for this project supported wholly or in part the publication of about 20 peer-reviewed research papers, summarized as follows:  Extreme winter and summer weather events were associated with amplified Arctic warming (AAW): Tang et al 2014; Overland et al 2015; Francis and Skific 2015; Wu et al 2016; Francis et al 2017; Vavrus et al 2017; Cohen et al 2017; Wu et al 2017; Cohen et al 2018.  A wavier jet stream is associated with a warm Arctic: Francis and Vavrus 2015.  Arctic sea ice loss is associated with increased surface melt on Greenland: Liu et al 2016.  The influence of sea-ice loss on Arctic amplification is modulated by SST fluctuations associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation: Screen and Francis, 2016.  Extreme weather patterns over North America are influenced by Arctic warming and snow cover on high-latitude land areas: Vavrus et al 2017.  The ongoing controversey over Arctic/mid-latitude weather connections is due to the use of inappropriate metrics and certain model shortcomings: Francis 2017.  Arctic influences on mid-latitude weather forecasting are increasing relative to tropical influences: Cohen et al 2017.  Summers with low sea ice amounts were linked with spring atmospheric patterns. (Kapsch et al, 2018).  The episode of past Arctic warming in the late 1930s exhibits similarities to and differences from the present warming: Chen et al 2018.  Broader Impacts  Numerous non-technical articles about the findings of this project were written. Some of them include:  Francis (AWIS Magazine) 2014; Francis and Overland (U.S. CLIVAR Variations) 2014; Francis and Vavrus (Climate Change and Public Health) 2015; Francis (The Conversation) 2015a, 2015b, 2018; Whiteman et al (World Economic Forum) 2018; Francis (New Jersey Bar Foundation) 2018; Francis (Washington Post OpEd) 2018; Francis (Scientific American) 2018.  The PI also gave numerous presentations to various non-academic groups, including:  New England Aquarium, Freshwater Society of Minnesota, Woodrow Wilson Center, Al Gore's Citizen's Climate Lobby, Metcalf Institute, Glen Gerberg Weather and Climate Summit, National Academies, The World Bank, the FBI, National Teachers Association, realtors, insurors, Arctic Research Consortium of the U.S., and many local groups.  The PI was interviewed dozens of times for articles in various print and online journals, blogs, radio shows, and TV news shows.
