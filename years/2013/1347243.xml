<AbstractNarration>This WIDER planning project is examining teaching, learning, and co-curricular evidence-based practices (EBPs) among underclass STEM majors and faculty at Otterbein University. Through an interdisciplinary initiative led by STEM practitioners and educational experts, the project is seeking to understand factors that influence the use and effectiveness of evidence-based practices for STEM students. These factors include faculty members' knowledge and use of EBPs, barriers to implementation of EBPs, and impact of EBPs on student learning and retention, as well as the role of student confidence and culture on learning and persistence. The team is using a rigorous, mixed-method design that employs a combination of validated assessment methods, classroom observations, focus groups, and data mining, focusing on gateway courses for majors in Biology, Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, and Zoo &amp; Conservation Science. The mixed-method design is informed by multiple change theories, including Senge's model of learning organizations, and the results are being used to develop strategies for change at both the individual level (i.e., developing reflective teachers and disseminating curriculum and pedagogy) and the organizational level (i.e., enacting policy and developing a shared vision). The goal is to drive strategic, comprehensive reforms to the STEM programs at Otterbein and also to disseminate findings to other primarily undergraduate institutions in order to improve student learning and retention in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Otterbein University is a primarily undergraduate institution with a rich history of commitment to education within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  In particular, many Otterbein STEM faculty employ teaching practices supported by research (evidence-based practices, or EBPs).  This study examined the extent to which EBPs are employed across STEM departments, the nature of the experiences of math/science students within and beyond the classroom, and factors influencing student persistence in STEM majors.  This was done to inform anticipated reforms of Otterbein STEM programs to improve student learning and retention. Through an interdisciplinary initiative led by STEM practitioners and educational experts, researchers examined the state of faculty practice, student learning, student culture, persistence, and contextual factors influencing them. A rigorous, mixed-method design employed a combination of validated assessments of student motivation and content understanding, classroom observations, surveys, focus groups, and data mining. Additionally, researchers conducted an analysis of faculty members? knowledge and use of EBPs, barriers to implementation of EBPs, and impact of EBPs on student learning. Researchers also examined the role of student confidence and culture on learning and persistence.  Faculty demonstrated considerable knowledge of EBPs, and reported in a survey, on average, using eight different evidence-based teaching practices per course.  Despite these high levels of reported EBP use, classroom observations indicated that faculty lectured 59% of the time and students passively listened or took notes 83% of the time.  Moreover, faculty accurately described their own classroom behaviors, but were less able to accurately describe student activities and experiences.  Part-time faculty used fewer EBPs compared to full-time faculty.  Examination of laboratory manuals and syllabi indicate the use of mostly prescriptive laboratory experiences with little student input into development of problems, procedures, or methods.  This led to a pilot effort to increase student input into laboratory exercises, resulting in measurable but limited improvements.  This effort continues. Based on research-validated test scores, gains in conceptual understanding were low across departments, and end-of-semester conceptual understanding correlated only weakly to course grade. There were no differences in conceptual understanding by academic rank, gender, underrepresented minority status, or first-generation student status. We observed no correlations between conceptual gain and classroom behaviors or student-reported motivation. Student motivation declined during the semester, but recovered by the start of the following semester. Students who ultimately received higher STEM grades exhibited the least decline in motivation, while students who received lower grades had greater declines. Compared to male students, female students reported higher levels of determination to succeed but lower levels of belief in their accomplishments. Several pre-college characteristics affected STEM persistence, including high school GPA, level of high school math classes taken, and first generation status. Students who switched out of STEM reported lower levels of social integration with other STEM majors and a lower sense of belonging in STEM departments. Perceptions of classroom environments were also more negative by students who changed out of STEM fields; they reported fewer interactions with other students in the classroom, a less engaging atmosphere, and a less supportive environment.

The PIs widely shared the results of this study, even hosting a conference at Otterbein about EBPs for other similar institutions, research universities and community colleges. This extended the impact of the study and contributed to the founding of a regional community of evidence-based practitioners. To develop faculty and improve student experiences, we recommend increased university support for course and laboratory revision and improved training for part-time faculty.  Opportunities should be created for faculty networking within and across departments to discuss teaching and learning, with consideration of different needs and experiences based on faculty demographics. A summer faculty institute for new and returning faculty should be offered on topics such as: alignment of teaching practices with course learning goals, techniques for improving conceptual understanding, mitigation of gender differences in motivation, interpreting student behaviors and cues, active-learning strategies, hidden curricula (with a focus on first generation students), and metacognitive strategies to improve student perception of the classroom environment. We recommend restructuring academic support to enhance opportunities for students who are less likely to engage with other students and utilize current support systems, reaching out to students earlier about career opportunities in STEM to address identified misunderstandings of non-persisters, providing STEM students opportunities to interact with one another and faculty outside of the classroom to improve experiences of social integration, and identifying strategies to help students align confidence with performance.
