<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Richard Saykally of the University of California - Berkeley and his graduate research students are investigating structure and dynamics of small clusters of water as well as water clusters containing other atmospherically-abundant molecules (nitrogen, oxygen, and small hydrocarbons).  Specifically, Prof. Saykally and his group will probe water clusters produced in the laboratory with modern THz light sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of the work by Professor Saykally and his group is to develop a better quantitative understanding of the complex interactions in water.  Results of this work could have profound impacts in biology and environmental science.   In addition, Prof. Saykally will help to train a new generation of scientists skilled in cutting-edge research.  Prof. Saykally and his colleagues are also involved in scientific outreach, including the Math, Science and Engineering Resource Support (MASERS) program, which brings hands-on science activities and science professionals into middle schools in the San Francisco Bay area.</AbstractNarration>

Perhaps surprisingly, and despite centuries of study, we still lack the complete understanding of this remarkably complicated substance necessary for accurate and reliable prediction and modeling of its behavior in vitally important contexts, e.g. living cells. For example, we still do not even understand the details of how liquid water evaporates!

We seek to understand every detail of how two, three, four, etc. molecules of water interact to yield the complex nature of the extended hydrogen bond network of the liquid and ice.
