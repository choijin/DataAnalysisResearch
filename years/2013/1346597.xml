<AbstractNarration>The proposed grant will promote the design, development and analysis of embedded and networked sensor technologies, systems, and applications by encouraging student participation in the ACM Sensys 2013 conference. Besides technical paper presentations, Sensys, through this grant, will be able to stimulate several intellectual activities by students. Furthermore, the conference offers several opportunities for intellectually stimulating discussions between the students and researchers from around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participation of students in Sensys can have an important impact on their development as a junior researcher. The grant will also promote diversity by encouraging and enabling women and other underrepresented minorities to participate.</AbstractNarration>
