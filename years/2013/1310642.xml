<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Implantable medical devices touch virtually every major function in the human body. Cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators, neural recording and stimulation devices, cochlear and retinal implants, etc.  Wireless telemetry for these devices is necessary to monitor battery level and device health, upload reprogramming for device function, and download data for patient monitoring.  Antennas are inevitably one of the largest if not the largest component of the telemetry communication system and are generally mounted on or in the implanted battery pack, usually in a body cavity.  This limited real estate significantly constrains the performance of implantable antennas and results in substantial power loss in the body.  Lost power means lost transmit distance and lost battery life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will fundamentally change the design of implantable antennas by tattooing (nearly invisible) conductive nanoparticles in the skin and adjacent fat layer at the body surface, coupling passively to the implant.  The antenna will be able to use as much surface area as needed, and dramatically reduce the transmission lost in the body tissues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fundamental, transformative shift in antenna design for implantable medical devices, enabling the next generation of tiny wireless sensors and devices in the body.  This work will evaluate the fundamental options and tradeoffs in implantable antenna design including losses in the antenna (resistive losses), coupled feed system (near field body losses), and antenna radiator (body losses).  Both SAR and MedRadio regulations will be taken into account.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the direct benefits to improved medical care, this project  includes a substantial educational outreach/dissemination component for undergrad/K12 retention and recruitment and general public interest.  In addition to traditional scientific dissemination, video tutorials, lab tours, interviews with the research team, etc. will be produced and disseminated broadly following methods currently in use by the PI.  Engaging public outreach will leverage this compelling bio-themed NSF research project (having likely appeal to a diverse audience) for use as a recruitment and retention tool in undergraduate programs and high school science/math programs, or just for general interest.  This will help students see that their math/science/engineering programs can be used for fascinating science that can make a difference in the world, and will help show the fun and excitement of research and invention.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Implantable medical devices (IMDs) include cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators, deep brain stimulators for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, epilepsy and severe depression, hormone and insulin pumps, and more. Physicians need to be able to communicate with these devices to monitor the device and its batteries, evaluate data the devices collect (such as recordings of the cardiac rhythm), and change the settings of the device. This communication link from outside the body to the IMD inside requires an antenna at both locations. The antenna for the IMD is the focus of this work. Implantable antennas are challenging because of two things &ndash; (1) The allowable frequency (402-405 MHz) requires a resonant antenna to be several inches long; and (2) The tissues in the body are relatively saline (salty), and therefore tend to electrically short out the antenna.</p> <p>The size of the antenna is a particular problem, because innovations in battery technology are enabling much smaller IMDs. Today&rsquo;s IMDs are on the order of 3-4 cm on a side, but future IMDs are anticipated to be around 3-4 mm on a side. This is too small to support a traditional 402-405 MHz antenna. We need to make a radical change in the whole antenna configuration, which is what we have proposed in this project. Rather than putting the whole antenna on the IMD, as is done today, we propose putting only a small feed (a coil) on the IMD. The coil can then send the communication signals the small distance to the surface of the body. A second, much larger, antenna just under the skin can receive these signals, and re-radiate them &nbsp;to a nearby receiver to complete the communication link. This new configuration can enable much larger antennas than would be possible on the IMD alone, thus enabling communication with next generation IMDs that are much smaller than today&rsquo;s.</p> <p>The shorting effect caused by the salinity of body tissues is another key challenge when designing implantable antennas. In previous designs, silicone, plastic, or other electrical insulators have been used to electrically insulate the antenna from the more conductive body tissues. In this project, we have proposed a novel solution to this problem. Rather than encapsulating the antenna in a bulky insulating material, we propose placing the antenna in the fat layer. Fat is a natural semi-insulator, and this project has shown that it can provide an effective alternative approach for implantable antenna design.</p> <p>In this project, we used a new gold nanoparticle composite material to the create the implantable antenna.
