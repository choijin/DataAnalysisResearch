<AbstractNarration>Li-ion batteries have enabled tremendous breakthrough in applications but the need for advanced battery electrodes that can deliver high capacity and power continues to drive battery producer R&amp;D efforts. The PI and his team have developed a low-cost, high-throughput self-assembly process to create diverse well-organized nanoparticle structures in the electrodes with electric field. In the fabrication of electrodes, the PI's research has demonstrated advanced battery electrodes with enhanced rate capability, high energy density, long cycling life, and reduced cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technique proposed in this project will produce high performance batteries needed by electric vehicle and other applications, which will benefit the society by addressing global energy and environmental challenges.  Translating the technique to commercial applications will not only create new jobs and contribute to the economy, but will also increase the US competence in the important area of Li-battery manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>
