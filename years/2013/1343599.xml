<AbstractNarration>This grant supports student travel for select students participating in the Doctoral Consortium at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2013), that will be held in Beijing, China, August 3-9, 2013.  The biannual IJCAI conference is the premier international conference spanning all topics in AI across a fully international research community.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This consortium is oriented on research and career development for students who have identified their PhD topics and are just embarking on that independent research.  This consortium is covering topics that are important and relevant to the success of these students, including, "funding and strings attached to them, use of subjects in research (including IRB), data collection, maintaining privacy and integrity of data, authorship (single and multi-author submissions, ghost writing), plagiarism and self-plagiarism, proper use of citations, reviewing of papers and proposals, and how to get the best out of attending a conference."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student participation in this conference has direct impact through encouraging promising U.S. students to engage in internationally-competitive research.  This program will also enhance the broader scientific community through exposure to emerging research topics.  IJCAI is the major international conference that will figure prominently in the research careers of these young investigators.  Students gain valuable research insights from the exchange of technical ideas in this broader venue.  In the process, they make valuable connections with potential collaborators from around the world.  In addition, students participate in the main IJCAI conference activities.  This allows them to attend presentations of the leading research in AI, as well as avail themselves of the available tutorials, workshops, and demonstrations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project funded a selected group of Ph.D. students from the US to attend the Doctoral Mentoring Consortium at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI, which was held in Beijing, China, August 3-9, 2013.  The Doctoral Mentoring Consortium consisted of a full day of activities,  which included two invited speakers who talked about how to do PhD research  and how to givetechnical  talks, a career panel, short talks by  the students who had an accepted abstract on their research, and a poster  session.  Sharing research ideas and collaborating on research projects across national boundaries is becoming critical to accelerate the research progress, avoid duplication, and produce a greater return on investment.  The fact the Doctoral Consortium included students who are not studying in the US (none of them funded under this grant) exposed the students to different cultures and broadened their professional networks outside their own institution and their own country, preparing the foundations for long trem international cooperation and better cultural awareness.  The students funded by this project have received unique and highly valuable training.  A valuable part of training new researchers is giving them the opportunity to interact with leaders in their research field outside their own research group.  This helps the students seeing their work in a broader context, gives them opportunities for receiving different feedback, and makes them more independent of their research advisor. The students had multiple opprtunities to extend their professional network to other students and senior researchers.
