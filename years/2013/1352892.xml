<AbstractNarration>Nearly all wild plants depend upon beneficial fungi, called mycorrhizal fungi, to obtain adequate nutrition. This relationship between plants and fungi may help solve a key puzzle in the study of biodiversity, how so many species of plants can compete for the same resources of water, light, and soil nutrients and yet co-exist in the same natural community. This project will conduct experiments in a highly diverse tropical forest in Costa Rica to test if: 1) different plant species associate with different fungi; 2) species only occur where the appropriate beneficial fungi for that species are present; and 3) association with different fungi reduces competition between plant species and promotes co-existence. The research will focus on the rich array of orchids that grow on the trunks and branches in the forest, since it is already known that these species form close associations with mycorrhizal fungi. Results will advance understanding of the mechanisms that maintain natural diversity, and the project will disseminate findings to the public as well as to the scientific community to promote conservation of the diversity in tropical forests. The project will also train undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, including members of groups under-represented in science, and promote international scientific collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed conceptual model for how plant-fungal associations could shape orchid communities and their niche structures is that fungi are themselves resources exploited by the plants, as well as the means by which plants acquire resources such as water and nutrients, and thus determine plant spatial distributions and species coexistence. This hypothesis will be addressed through two integrated studies that will (1) conduct the first such spatial sampling of orchids, fungi, and environmental variables in a tropical forest and (2) experimentally determine whether orchid seed establishment is limited by the distribution of fungi by placing seed packets in locations with and without suitable fungi. Both studies will employ next-generation sequencing methods to identify fungi in the environment and will include novel statistical analyses of the niches and interaction networks of orchids and fungi. Findings will show whether (1) fungi are patchily distributed, (2) orchids differ in their fungal associations, (3) orchid seedling establishment and adult distributions are limited by fungal distributions, and (4) co-occurring orchid species show niche partitioning in their use of fungi and in the substrates from which their associated fungi draw resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Orchids are one of the most diverse family of flowering plants, both globally and locally: there are about 28,000 species worldwide and about 250 species just in our tropical rainforest study. Orchids also are highly dependent on symbiotic fungi ("orchid mycorrhizal fungi"). Studying these fungi in the field has been difficult but now is feasible due to new high-throughput methods of DNA analysis. This project is a collaboration between Texas Tech University, the University of New Mexico and the University of Hawai`i, with participation by the University of Costa Rica and Costa Rica’s Tapanti National Park, and is focused on the community of orchids and fungi living on tree branches ("epiphytically").    Our overall aim is to determine whether interactions with fungal symbionts affect where orchid species occur within this habitat. Although the University of Hawaii portion of the grant has ended, the larger project will continue for several more years, and at present results are available only for one part of the project, a fine-scale study of spatial patterns in the fungal community. We found that the fungal community is extremely diverse (thousands of species within our very limited set of samples), varies substantially among samples only 1 meter apart on the same branch, and differs between layers of the epiphytic substrate (live moss, dead moss, bark).

This will directly test our core hypothesis, which is that the orchid seeds can only germinate and grow where the symbionts are present.   These studies, once completed, will increase our understanding tropical orchid biology, which should aid in conserving the orchids, some of which are rare. To pursue this goal of orchid conservation more directly, we have collaborated with Tapanti National Park staff to try to reduce illegal harvest of orchids in the park, by teaching people from neighboring communities how to propagate orchids.
