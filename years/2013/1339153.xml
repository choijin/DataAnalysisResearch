<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program supports work by Professor Glen Jackson at Ohio University to develop a hand-portable mass spectrometer.  The instrument is designed to operate above 1 mbar (0.75 Torr), eliminating the need for expensive, complex pumps.  The design includes a robust and flexible ion source that can analyze gas-phase neutrals (such as volatile organic compounds and chemical warfare agents) or ions formed from nonvolatile materials via atmospheric pressure ionization techniques.  Resolution exceeding that of portable ion mobility spectrometers (the current instruments of choice for screening protocols at most US airports) is expected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential applications include national security, forensics, health, and environmental monitoring. The instrument will also serve as a focus for educational outreach, including demonstrations and hands-on experience for high school students, undergraduate students, and field-scientists through both formal and informal avenues.  Students will help disseminate knowledge of the new instrument and its capabilities to the broader scientific community by presenting results at national conferences and publishing the results in peer-reviewed journals.</AbstractNarration>

Miniature mass spectrometers are used to monitor the air quality in space flights, to measure the composition of other planets, to detect chemical warfare agents and to detect drugs, explosives and chemical warfare agents. We demonstrated that we could operate a mass filter at higher pressures and with lower voltages than has previously been demonstrated before. Although we have not yet engineered a prototype, miniature instrument, our results show that miniaturization will be possible because our device can use smaller vacuum pumps and smaller power suppliers than other instruments. We have shared our findings with other scientists and the general public through various publications and presentations. In addition to several public lectures, we have helped educate the general public about forensic science through the dissemination of several educational YouTube videos. These forensic science videos, produced, acted and directed by undergraduate students, have received more than 70,000 views. The PI has also taught mass spectrometry workshops to more than 200 practicing forensic professionals over the lifetime of the project.
