<AbstractNarration>Title: Hormones as Mediators of Life History Tradeoffs Over Evolutionary Time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tradeoffs between the future well-being of an organism and investment in offspring represent a hallmark of biological diversity. Much research has focused either on the evolutionary reasons to expect certain tradeoffs or the physiological mediation of individual life history traits. Recent research suggests that individual hormones regulate multiple life history traits. However, it is unclear whether the multifaceted role hormones play represents an adaptation, or an unavoidable result of a limited number of available physiological mechanisms. The research will compare the results of evolutionary simulations to novel empirical data to test these contrasting hypotheses. The proposed research makes use of butterflies as a model due to the extensive natural history information available for many species, combined with their experimental tractability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research represents a potentially transformative contribution to the understanding of how hormones mediate life history tradeoffs, and how these relationships evolve. In addition to the research aims, the fellow will design a blog incorporating stop-motion animation to present training objectives to a wider audience in an entertaining format. The fellow will mentor over ten undergraduates who will have opportunities to develop related independent projects. During the final year of funding, the fellow will be involved in teaching undergraduate and graduate courses. A team of mentors will train the fellow in new laboratory and field skills, mathematical modeling, and computer programming.</AbstractNarration>

Swanson was entitled, "Hormones as Mediators of Life History Tradeoffs Over Evolutionary Time," and had three main components: research, teaching and mentoring, and training. The research described here was largely conducted at the University of Minnesota (UMN), as was the teaching component of the fellowship award.

The research resulting from this award will contribute to our broader understanding of how hormone variation influencing growth, reproduction, and aging relates to evolution.  Teaching was also a major part of this fellowship. In the final year of the fellowship, Swanson focused on three teaching opportunities. Swanson was invited to teach a course called Nature of Life at UMN. Nature of Life is a freshman orientation course, and the first experience most undergraduates at the College of Biological Sciences at UMN have with faculty. Nature of Life gave Swanson the opportunity to interact with large numbers of both students and faculty in a variety of situations, and with pedagogical training Swanson pursued during the award, prepared him to teach as sole instructor a freshman seminar he designed called "Evidence-based living." In the final spring of the award, Swanson co-taught a writing-intensive animal behavior course with his primary mentor for the award, Dr. Emilie Snell-Rood. During the award tenure, Swanson also published a blog focusing on making difficult science widely digestible, and participated in educational outreach activities such as a butterfly natural history presentation at the Minnesota State Fair every year of the fellowship.

Interactions with a variety of mentors, a great deal of directed reading, both research- and teaching-related seminars, and coursework resulted in major additions to Swanson?s scientific ?toolbox.? During this award, Swanson has gained a great deal of both philosophical and practical experience, particularly with regard to integrating modeling and biology, bioinformatics, curriculum development, teaching with writing, and student mentoring in research.
