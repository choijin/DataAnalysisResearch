<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to further develop the research team's privacy preserving secure data exchange technology. This technology uses a two-party secure computation mechanism allowing for verifiable private data reconstruction and comparison without the sender revealing the data to the receiver. The technology is designed to assure an individual's privacy by empowering the individual to have full control of their own data with three advantages. First, the data exchange technology does not need a trusted third party to act as a proxy to realize privacy protection. Second, data intended for an exchange is based on reconstruction by the receiver using helper data and does not require the data owner to disclose or share private data over the communication channel. Third, the technology is scalable for use in a distributive computing environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This technology has the potential to provide a foundation for a number of technical solutions for various applications and markets. There is a need for this type of technology in emergency management and emergency health data management, for example, this technology would allow an emergency medical technician responding to an incident to reconstruct the emergency health data of an individual without that individual having to unlock their smartphone and reveal the emergency data it stores. In addition to facilitating secure emergency health data exchange, this technology could also be used with biometric authentication applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[SIPPA Health is the outcome of the commercialization effort of our technology on security and privacy for data exchange. It aims to provide usable technology as a tool for patients, care providers, and care management professions to effectively interact with each other. Our technology tool offers four unique distinct features:  Enable biometric security and privacy protection for Electronic Health Record (EHR) stored in a mobile device using fingerprint or voice; thus eliminating the need to memorize and the risk of losing/forgetting the username/password. Provide a mobile solution, with a button push, to retrieve and exchange electronic health records in common standards such as C-CDA and CCD. Provide decoding service to translate electronic health records from common standards using XML format to human readable text format. Enable dynamic content-driven presentation that can be tailored to three different groups of users; i.e., patients interested in the vital sign information in the health record, physicians interested in the medical information presented in either problem based, or chronological based order depending upon the situation, and care management professions interested in the wellness information.   The economic and social impact of the commercialization effort pursued in this project are highlighted as follows:  Although the commercializaton venture aims at creating new employments, the most significant economic impact will stem from the health care cost saving for the society due to the targeted consumer groups in this venture; i.e., poly-chronic individuals, among others. In the U.S., poly-chronic patients account for 5% of the population. Yet this population accounts for 45% of the health cost (U.S. $1.2 trillion). By improving the health of even just 1% of the poly-chronic patients, this will translate to $12 billion saving on the health cost.  Although this venture is about innovative health technology, the technology embodiment that allows an individual to be the main facilitator for secure and private EHR exchange and consolidation has also a significant social impact; namely, increasing individual awareness about his/her own health. Specifically, by placing the individual "in the loop" to interact with health and care providers during EHR exchange will increase the awareness of the individual to his/her own health condition. By improving the individual's awareness, this will increase the likelihood of the individual to change his/her behavior towards a healthier lifestyle.
