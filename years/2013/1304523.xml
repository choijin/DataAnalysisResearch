<AbstractNarration>Terrestrial high-latitude ecosystems are experiencing dramatic increases in temperature, changes in precipitation, and advancement of the growing season with important implications for trophic interactions. Uncoupling of the temporal relationships between migratory animals and the phenology of the forage they rely on for energy, nutrition, and rearing of young is one of the most glaring consequences of these changes. Furthermore, herbivores in high latitudes are likely to mediate biogeochemical responses to climate change substantially altering ecosystem function. However, little is known about how changes in the synchrony of herbivore-vegetation interactions will influence biogeochemical cycles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be conducted on the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) Delta in western Alaska, where there is strong evidence that climate change is driving temporal decoupling of the evolved linkage between the phenology of plants and the timing of goose migration. There is an urgency to the research because: some of the most rapid climate changes in the world are underway in Alaska, leaving migratory geese and the ecosystem processes they influence vulnerable to new conditions, and with the rapid advancement of the growing season, migratory goose feeding ecology is lagging substantially, threatening an irreplaceable subsistence resource for Native communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall research objective is to quantify how an advancing growing season and changes in the synchrony of vegetation-goose interactions alter the magnitudes and patterns of C and N cycling in the Y- K Delta. Two specific questions will be addressed with an experiment: How does the timing of plant growth interact with goose arrival time to alter summer-long magnitudes of plant production, foliar chemistry, and N availability; and, How does the timing of plant growth interact with goose arrival time to alter summer-long magnitudes of net ecosystem CO2 exchange, gross ecosystem photosynthesis, and ecosystem respiration? SAVANNA-YK, a biogeochemical model that considers grazing a critical control on vegetation and trace gas processes in the Y-K Delta, will be used to predict how these ecosystem processes and plant-herbivore interactions will continue to change, altering the nature of ecosystem processes and landscape dynamics in years to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the research is three-fold:  The focus on phenologic decoupling of migratory birds and their primary forage on ecosystem biogeochemical cycles is the first of its kind. More specifically, the research is the first to investigate how the timing of herbivory interacts with plant phenology to affect biogeochemical cycles compared to other programs that have focused on the presence or absence of herbivores and/or on herbivore density effects on these cycles; The research is the first to take an experimental approach to the issue of trophic mismatch in the western Alaskan sub-Arctic while integrating these findings with forecasting ecosystem models tailored to wet sedge systems of the north. This combination allows investigation into how climate change effects on herbivore-vegetation interactions will influence large spatial scales in years to come; and The research focuses on plant species that are critical to migratory geese, while other northern studies focusing on climate change effects have focused on tundra plant species that are not critical to migratory bird foraging ecology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the research will be realized throughh several activities. First, a citizen- science observatory will be established using protocols of the National Phenology Network. Students throughout the Y-K delta will record goose arrival times and key phenological events in grasses and woody plants. Second, students from Bethel Regional High School will be recruited to assist in the field research and be given the opportunity to develop small projects. Researchers will visit village classrooms each spring to introduce the project, climate change, and plant-animal interactions; share results of previous and ongoing research in the study area; and recruit interested students. Third, Native Alaskan undergraduate students through the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program (ANSEP) will be recruited as field and laboratory technicians; these students may also develop their own projects. Fourth, Virtual Science will be used with local teachers to develop blogs, pod-casts, and instructional videos that can be distributed to remote classrooms throughout western Alaska and beyond. Fifth, objectives and results will be communicated to Native organizational bodies, which have representatives from each major village, to build knowledge and support for the research, and provide educational outlets for families who rely on geese for subsistence. Finally, one post-doctoral researcher, one graduate student, and several undergraduates will be provided new training, mentoring, and an opportunity to collaborate on project activities and present their findings at scientific meetings.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>As climates warm in the northern latitudes, growing seasons start earlier and migratory species arrive functionally later. There have been studies looking at how this &ldquo;late&rdquo; arrival by migratory species influences their fitness, primarily because they are no longer maximizing their timing to take advantage of high quality forage. Our study was the first of its kind to investigate how timing of these events (the start of the growing season and migratory species arrival time) interact to influence biogeochemical cycling. Our research was conducted in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (Y-K Delta) Wildlife Refuge in western Alaska. The Y-K Delta is an important summer breeding area for millions of migratory birds; our study focused on Pacific black brant because they are experiencing declining populations at the site and may be vulnerable to climate change. Our main approach to studying this was a three-year field experiment where we manipulated the start of the growing season of an important goose forage species (<em>Carex subspathacea</em>) and the timing of goose arrival with captive geese. We measured many biogeochemical responses to these timed events, including changes in forage quality, measured as carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios of the foliage, carbon and nitrogen cycling in the soil, and greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>In general, our experiment showed that arrival time by geese was more important than the start of the growing season in influencing these biogeochemical responses. We found that when geese started grazing earlier, there was both less above- and belowground biomass in the vegetation, and that the quality of forage was higher for geese than when geese arrived later. Early goose grazing also resulted in greater inorganic nitrogen and amino acid availability in soil, which likely resulted from less plant growth with early goose arrival and could influence the competitive ability of these plants over the long term. We also found that there was more carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) released and less methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) released if geese grazed earlier. But, overall, there is a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions if geese graze early to the system. This likely occurred because early grazing led to lower primary productivity and the decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> uptake that overwhelmed the decrease in CH<sub>4</sub> emission. For all these measures, the influence of timing of the growing season was small compared to the timing of grazing and mostly showed the opposite pattern. The scenario that represents the most likely future Arctic, with green-up advancing more rapidly than arrival of migratory geese, we expect geese to experience lower forage quality, possibly further reducing their population sizes, but greater GHG equivalent uptake from the site. Our results suggest processes that alter when peak grazing occurs in the future can have a large impact on carbon balance in northern coastal wetlands and that processes influencing timing of migration in the winter range can influence ecosystem function in summer habitat.</p> <p>We primarily worked with two secondary school teachers from the Lower Kuskokwim School District (LKSD) to provide a broader impact to our project.&nbsp;Four main<strong> </strong>activities took place:</p> <p>1. We developed a project website <a href="http://learnscape.org/goose/" target="_blank">http://learnscape.org/goose/</a> , which includes a research project overview and student unit overview. The information presented uses an open source platform, so that teachers all over the world can use these materials and they can be accessed for free with a creative commons license.</p> <p>2. During the spring and summer 2016, 15 science teachers field tested the 6-9 goose units on our website. The units focused on Place-Based Science. We collected teacher and student feedback on the field test of this unit in cooperation with a PREPARES-NSF grant.</p> <p>3. The teaching modules were presented at the 2017 Alaska Cross Content Conference in October 2017 to share resources with science teachers from Alaska. In addition, they were shared at a meeting with the LKSD Science Teachers in 2016, which included all secondary science teachers from 25 schools during this informal network-sharing meeting. The unit is now part of the LKSD Ecology curriculum, which is a science elective for 9-12 graders.</p> <p>4. A videographer visited the field site, summer 2016.
