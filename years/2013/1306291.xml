<AbstractNarration>Technical Description: The objective of this project is to synthesize and investigate iron oxysulfide, in particular sulfurized hematite, with the goal of replacing critical components in the current solar cell technologies for next-generation photovoltaics. Sulfurized hematite, with an appropriate concentration of sulfur, will potentially meet the cost and efficiency requirements for terawatt photovoltaics. The scientific tasks of the project include: 1) First-principles studies of iron oxysulfide and copper oxysulfide as solar photovoltaic materials; 2) Development of deposition and sulfurization methods for sulfurized hematite; 3) Investigation of its electrical and optical properties as a function of sulfur content; and 4) Development of solution-based n-type and p-type doping methods for hematite. The major innovations in this project include: 1) the use of three Earth-abundant elements, iron, oxygen and sulfur, for bandgap engineering to create a semiconductor better suited for solar photovoltaics; 2) the use of largely solution-based processes for film deposition and doping to ensure low-cost solar cells in the end; and 3) a multidisciplinary approach, where first-principles studies and experimental studies are joined to push forward the technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: The success of this project will enable a sustainable solar cell technology, which is capable of low-cost, high-efficiency and most importantly terawatt-scale deployment, allowing solar electricity to become a major source of energy in our future. In addition, this project includes a targeted effort to increase the representation of American Indians in science and engineering as well as increase the awareness of local Arizona tribes on photovoltaic technologies. The principal investigators work with entities such as the American Indian Science and Engineering Society and Arizona Department of Commerce to promote photovoltaic technologies in remote tribal communities, provide research opportunities to American Indian science and engineering students, and engage and interest American Indian youth about science and engineering in general. This project also provides synergistic support to the newly-established U.S. Photovoltaic Manufacturing Consortium (PVMC) for its mission to facilitate a robust domestic solar cell industry. The success of this project will provide a technology pipeline for PVMC, while PVMC provides industrial connections for this project.</AbstractNarration>
