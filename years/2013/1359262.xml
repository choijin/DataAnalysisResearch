<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) project recognizes the national priority to support research that addresses the fact that students tend to lack the ability to understand scientific phenomena that are not directly observable.  The research team at Rochester Institute of Technology involves undergraduate collaborators in the investigation of how students learn from the tools we use to explain scientific concepts; models (bridges between ideas and empirical observations) and representations (descriptions of models).  Ancillary activities include cohort-wide research methods workshops, research group meetings, communication workshops, and social events.  The work takes place within the Science and Mathematics Education Research Collaborative (SMERC), a group of ten faculty members interested in exploring questions related to Discipline-Based Educational Research in biology, chemistry, and physics.  In order to broaden participation students who are from underrepresented groups in STEM, including Native American, African American, Latino, and Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing populations, are actively recruited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-part REU project consists of a virtual, pre-summer training session followed by and intensive 9-week summer research experience.  In the virtual course, January Jump-Start, students are introduced to the research projects, professional ethics, and research methodologies.  Students also perform literature reviews and initiate the Institution Review Board (IRB) process as part of this course.   During the summer, students participate a research experience within the following clusters: (a) use of models and representation in experimental laboratory work, (b) conceptual meaning underlying mathematical representations of physics, (c) conceptual meaning underlying visual representations of biochemistry and molecular biology, and (d) developing and evaluating curricula emphasizing modeling and representation.  Data generated through entrance and exit surveys, weekly meetings, and assessment of research artifacts and workshops reflects the student's satisfaction with the experience, attitudes about research, and preparation to apply for research careers in Discipline-based Education Research (DBER).  After graduation, the students are tracked and interviewed about the project's impact.  Dissemination of the project results should provide a model for cross-disciplinary DBER research.  The project team presents their work through at a variety of disciplinary national meetings including, the Society for the Advancement of Biology Education Conference, the Annual Meeting of the American Chemical Society, the American Association of Physics Teachers/Physics Education Research Conference, and  the Conference on Transforming Research in Undergraduate STEM Education. Project deliverables include results of summative evaluation and the course materials developed for the January Jump Start.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Discipline-Based Education Research (DBER) is a scholarly field that combines disciplinary expertise in a STEM field (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.) with research methods from cognitive science, psychology and the learning sciences.   Researchers in this field are interested in studying and transforming STEM Education through basic and applied research.  The Science and Mathematics Educational Research Collaborative, an interdisciplinary DBER group at the Rochester Institute of Technology, developed and hosted a DBER REU program which was designed to allow STEM undergraduate students to apply their growing disciplinary knowledge to investigate important problems in education research.  To help ensure students had a productive on-site summer experience on the RIT campus, we developed a novel program feature; the January-Jump start.  During these virtual sessions mentors and participants communicated and collaborated remotely (email, video conferences, online journal club sessions, etc.) to get familiar with the DBER literature and start developing summer projects.  REU participants had the opportunity to engage in novel mentored-research projects in an important and exciting DBER field:  model-based reasoning in STEM Education.  Models (computer simulations, physical hand-held models, mathematical models, cognitive models) are simplified versions of real-world systems that allow scientists to ask new questions, test new hypotheses and communicate explanations to a broad audience.  Modeling is an important practice of science as models bridge ideas and observations of real phenomena and major STEM educational reform initiatives support increased opportunities for students to engage in modeling throughout the curriculum.  These initiatives must also be supported by a research base that includes well-defined goals, assessment tools, an understanding of common student difficulties, and effective curricular approaches.  We aimed to give participants opportunities to contribute to this important DBER field through our program which aimed to:  Engage students in rigorous education research projects  Build and support student development of research, communication and professional skills, as well as their sense of identity as scientists. Prepare undergraduates for DBER Ph.D. programs and careers. Introduce future educators to teaching, learning, and assessment of a core scientific practice of using models and representations. Disseminate research with undergraduate student co-authors. Recruit and retain diverse undergraduate students into the STEM community.   With funding from the NSF we were able to host the DBER REU in Model-based Reasoning in STEM Education during the years 2015, 2016 and 2017.  In total we supported 31 undergraduate students; 61% (19/31) of our participants were female, 26% (8/31) were female students majoring in physics and/or mathematics programs and 39% (12/31) of our students were from underrepresented groups.  During the on-site experience students participated in research methods workshops, research group meetings, individual mentoring, Professional Development workshops and cohort-building events.   We also report that 21 of our 31 students (67%) students have co-authored a contributed talk/poster at a National Scientific meeting or have co-authored a peer-reviewed publication.   The research conducted during our DBER REU has resulted in 17 contributed talks/posters that have been presented at National or Regional Scientific meetings and 11 peer-reviewed publications.   From the information gathered from 22 of our former students, 15 students have graduated (all from STEM or STEM Education program) and 7 are still in undergraduate programs.  Of those who have graduated, 8 are attending graduate school in STEM or STEM Education and 2 are enrolled in Post-baccalaureate programs in STEM.  Former students shared these reflections about our DBER REU program:  It influenced my decision to pursue graduate school greatly. Prior to the DBER REU I was not aware of graduate school and research opportunities. With the help [program mentors], I was accepted into ASU's doctoral program!   I think the most valuable thing was getting research experience and learning more about what the research and graduate school environment is like. My school does not have a strong grad program, so I've not heard a lot about all of this.   The remaining 5 participants who have graduated secured full time jobs, with 3 of the 5 choosing to pursue a career in education. These individuals are now influencing the next generation of scientists and mathematicians through their roles as K-12 educators.  Former REU students have shared the following reflections:  This has helped me earn my career as an Elementary teacher at Pasquotank Elementary School in Elizabeth City, NC teaching 5th grade math and science. It gave me the passion to help students see their full potential in math and science.  All of my undergraduate and REU experience helped to make me a research-driven teacher with a deep insight on how to help students learn.  Though I'm planning on doing my time as a teacher, ultimately I'd like to take my education further and pursue a degree in Learning Sciences which was inspired through conversations with my REU mentors.  The 28 disseminated research products and the success of our former participants strongly suggests the DBER REU at RIT was a worthwhile and impactful program.
