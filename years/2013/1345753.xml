<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will research, design and demonstrate a new technique for dynamically controlling the operating mode for DRAM devices. Today memory is set to the highest performance and highest power mode at boot regardless of usage, an antiquated approach creating thermal hotspots and wasting power. The intellectual merit is a combination of both frequency and voltage scaling by monitoring activity to boost memory bandwidth under high demand conditions and resume lower frequency modes when higher performance is unnecessary. Traditionally, operating mode of memory is fixed at levels that will provide the peak performance required and is not modified while the system is running. The research objectives are to select a target architecture and platform, conceptualize dynamic mode switching by creating simulation models of the memory and determine minimum required supply voltages and frequencies, build an evaluation unit, and test and demonstrate activity-based dynamic mode switching. This dynamic mode concept will allow the memory to speed-up to complete activities sooner and optimize power consumption in real time providing both system and performance benefits for consumers and resulting in the world?s first dynamic real-time architecture for varying memory clock frequency and voltage based on activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant power savings to address green energy initiatives and poor battery life across consumer, business, and military electronic market segments. This includes memory applications such as data center servers, notebooks, and extending battery life in handheld electronics. This technology will enable smaller, more flexible, and more easily integrated power management with an improved cost/benefit ratio. Commercially, annual memory module shipments are expected to reach over 1 billion units by 2014. With market penetration rate of 0.2% there is a commercial potential of $5 million in revenue in 2017 and $11 million by 2019. With this technology in their mobile devices the consumer will see reduced power consumption resulting in extended battery life, lower heat dissipation and cooling costs and increased reliability. Compared to statically assigning a power saving mode the consumer will see faster response to application starts and improved performance, throughput, and bandwidth while still saving power and costs during less demanding activities. This project is a truly unique project that has far reaching benefits for today?s handsets, tablets, PCs, and servers.</AbstractNarration>

Dynamic power consumption in electronic circuits scales with switching frequency. A typical DRAM memory configuration uses a constant frequency, and reduces power consumption by entering low power modes, in which no data can be accessed.

A DDR3 DRAM simulation environment was developed to confirm that power could be saved without corrupting memory contents.

Various usage scenarios ranging from entirely idle to constant memory accesses were simulated. The results showed that certain scenarios could benefit from a reduction in operating frequency. Table 1 shows the simulation result for dynamic mode adjustment over several different operation conditions.  Figure 1 shows the power savings graphically as a function of activity.     Not only would a slower frequency save power by itself, but it is expected that lowering the operating frequency will also allow reductions in supply voltage, thereby saving more power. Previous work by Packet Digital has proven that reducing the DDR3 supply voltage in certain scenarios can reduce power consumption by up to 20%.     This NSF Phase I effort also supported the initial work of implementing dynamic frequency adjustment algorithm into hardware. An FPGA SoC platform with an integrated ARM core and external DDR3 memory was chosen. This platform also contained a soft DDR3 memory controller which was used as the foundation for the dynamic frequency adjustment algorithm. Significant progress was made in the implementation efforts. These efforts will be continued in Phase II.     As high performance memory controllers are very complex and typically integrated on silicon with a processor core, taking this technology to market will require a partnership with a third party. Initial conversations with suppliers of memory controller IP were initiated to begin working out the details of taking this project to market.    With continued support, this work will help address heat, performance, and battery life issues in portable electronic devices.
