<AbstractNarration>This award will support student travel to three co-located conferences: the International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO 2013), the International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2013), and the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP 2013). The conferences are being held in Shenzhen, China in February 2013.  These conferences are top-ranked in the fields of architecture, compilers and parallel programming.  Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF.  Broader impacts include building the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce.</AbstractNarration>

The Principal Investigator (PI) for the grant proposal was Ronald Mak, who was the CGO 2013 Student Travel Chair and who teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in the Department of Computer Science at San Jose State University (SJSU) in California. The grant funds were administered by the SJSU Research Foundation, and the funds were initially divided evenly among the three symposia (i.e., $15,000.00 each).     These symposia are leaders in their respective fields, and each traditionally has had high rates of student attendance and participation. Co-location in China offered unique opportunities for U.S. students to interact with Chinese students, senior researchers, and developers in these fields. Such interactions improved mutual understanding and created opportunities for future collaborations.     As stated in the grant proposal, student applicants for the travel reimbursements all attended U.S. universities. To apply, each student submitted a cover letter stating his or her reason for attending one of the symposia, a resume, a description of his or her research interests, and a letter from the student's advisor that confirmed the student's eligibility and recommended that the student attend the symposium.     The selection process by the symposia organizing committees considered each applicant's level of participation (paper author and/or presenter), followed by how closely the student's research interests matched areas covered by the respective symposium, and, in the case of undergraduate and recent graduate students, the advisor's endorsement stating the student's potential for research.     Following the close of the symposia, the awarded students each provided a one-page report on his or her impressions of the symposium that he or she attended. These reports were read by the symposia organizers.     CGO 2013Æs share of the grant partially or fully reimbursed the travel expenses of 9 students.     HPCA 2013Æs share of the grant partially or fully reimbursed the travel expenses of 22 students.     PPoPP 2013Æs share of the grant partially reimbursed the travel expenses of 10 students.     As per regulations of the California State University system (to which SJSU belongs), each studentÆs reimbursement amount included $50.00 for an international travel insurance policy.     All but two of the students who received travel reimbursements from this grant authored and/or presented papers at the symposium that they attended.     Among the 41 student in total who received travel reimbursements from the grant, 4 were female and 2 were Hispanic (including one Hispanic female). The other students were Caucasian, Asian, or Indian.       Last Modified: 01/24/2014       Submitted by: Ronald Mak]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
