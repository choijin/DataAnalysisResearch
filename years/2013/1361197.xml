<AbstractNarration>Simulation tools for astrophysical and space physics systems share a set of common requirements: they need to robustly simulate magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows around spherical bodies with high accuracy. This multidisciplinary project will develop algorithms from applied mathematics for robust, highly accurate non-relativistic MHD on geodesic meshes. In the past few years new schemes for simulating conservation laws with truly multi-dimensional divergence free approximate Riemann solvers for applications have been developed. Currently, these Riemann solvers are only available for two-dimensional rectangular structured meshes for MHD. This project will employ a geodesic mesh to provide the best possible coverage for simulations of magnetohydrodynamic flows around spherical bodies and to incorporate Delaunay triangulation to achieve high accuracy. Divergence-free formulations of vector fields can be found on these triangular meshes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simulation tools for astrophysical and space physics systems share a set of common requirements: they need to robustly simulate magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows around spherical bodies with high accuracy. Building a computational framework, based on shared needs in space physics and astrophysics, will unleash important synergies between these two allied fields of study. The MHD equations are a combination of the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid dynamics and Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism.  Thus, the MHD equations require numerical solvers that incorporate the hydrodynamic fluid motion and enforce the divergence free magnetic field, i.e. no magnetic monopoles, requirements on the geometric domain approximated by a polygonal mesh. The nature of the MHD equations closely couples solution methodologies to the underlying mesh, making it necessary to develop new algorithms for the divergence-free reconstruction of the magnetic field on novel mesh structures. Additionally, the MHD system is formulated as a system of conservation laws. With a traditional conservation law, the fluxes can be evolved on a dimension-by-dimension basis. The fact that different flux components are coupled in an involution-constrained system also makes a case for multidimensional upwinding based on multidimensional Riemann solvers. Such solver strategies are again intimately coupled to the mesh structure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       There are many situations of great practical interest where one has to obtain answers to computational problems. This includes the numerical solution of partial differential equations. Such equations regulate several physical processes like the flow of wind on Earth, Space Weather and Astrophysics. All such systems have one common theme -- the physical processes of interest take place on a sphere. For example, the Earth is a spherical system and wind flows that take place on earth respond to the fact that the earth is a spinning system in space. Similarly, solar storms (which affect satellite communication on earth) also respond to the fact that the Sun is a spherical system. While rectangular domains are easy to simulate, carrying out high accuracy simulations on a spherical system requires attention to further detail. This attention includes the use of a spherical mesh and careful representation of partial differential equations on such a mesh.        This project looked into the process of simulating fluid and magnetofluid flows on spherical meshes. We, therefore, devised geodesic meshes, which give the most accurate representation of the uniform partition of a sphere. So, in effect, we designed a very high quality mesh.
