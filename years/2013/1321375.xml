<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Research (SBIR) Phase I project tests the application of a thermally responsive biopolymer, simultaneously to deliver breast cancer therapy and to prevent disease recurrence. Encouraging responses to multimodal treatments (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) are too often  followed by more aggressive and resistant breast cancers, attributed to cancer stem cell survival and proliferation, as  regulated by the oncogenic role of Notch signaling.  This Phase 1 project seeks: (1) to achieve targeted reduction of breast tumor stem cells during treatment through externally triggered delivery of potent chemotherapeutics via Notch signaling pathway inhibitory peptides that are optimized to selectively accumulate within breast tumors, (2) to evaluate in an established, in vivo mouse model of breast cancer this approach?s capacity to reduce breast tumors and spare healthy tissue, and (3) to identify, in a subpopulation of treated animals, the presence or absence of tumor recurrence over 5 months.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad, commercial impact of this project lies in its technological potential to deliver a therapeutic peptide that targets and inhibits cancer stem cells, thereby boosting prevention of and lowering likelihood for cancer recurrence. Success in the proposed experiments would further indicate that this technology can be modified to achieve the targeted delivery of other highly specific anti-cancer drug that are designed to target any solid tumor, increasing treatment specificity and efficacy, while reducing cytotoxicity in normal tissues. It would further indicate that the technology can be modified for other diseases requiring targeted delivery of therapeutics.  Immediately, however, cancer recurrences arising from triple-negative breast cancer are a rapidly increasing clinical problem. They are associated with poor prognosis and limited systemic therapeutic options, diminish gains achieved through current standard of breast cancer care and weigh heavily on patients in remission and strategies of their treatment team. Success in the proposed in vivo studies of the biopolymer could lead to clinical translation, commercialization, and most importantly greater effectiveness in initial cancer regimens, with greatly lessened likelihood of recurrence, of broad clinical and health care significance and impact.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In order to improve current approaches for the treatment of solid tumors and quality of life for cancer patients, our long term goal is to develop and refine a targeting method able to increase cancer treatment effectiveness and to reduce side effects. Toward achieving this goal, we have developed an externally triggered drug delivery system able to selectively deliver cancer therapeutics to solid tumors.     Our drug carrier, based on the thermally responsive biopolymer elastin-like polypeptide (ELP), is soluble at physiological temperatures (31-32&deg;C), but undergoes a phase transition and aggregates in response to an externally applied, mild hyperthermia (40-41&deg;C). To promote cellular uptake, we modified our ELPÆs coding sequence by adding a cell penetrating peptide (CPP), along with a dominant-negative peptide fragment of the dominant-negative form of the Notch co-activator MasterMind-Like1 protein (dn-MAML1). dn-MAML1 inhibits the Notch signaling implicated in many cancers and interrupts/interferes with the Notch signaling pathway, which is crucial to the regulation of cancer stem cell (CSC) self-renewal and differentiation. Mounting evidence suggests that CSCs are responsible for cancer recurrence; thus targeting Notch signaling and the Notch signaling pathway represents a novel therapeutic opportunity.

Minimizing such recurrence would represent a critical advance, as tumors that recur are more aggressive than primary lesions and exhibit greater resistance to a broad range of cytotoxic agents, a particularly important factor in long term morbidity and mortality for patients with breast cancers.     In Phase I we showed that our drug carrier: (1) Remains longer in circulation and has a significantly longer plasma half-life than free peptides, (2) Exhibits an approximately 2-fold enhancement of tumor uptake with hyperthermia, and (3) Shows complete tumor regression and a reduced population of cancer stem cells when used in a combination therapy with taxol.    The project realized through Phase I funding thus showed that this novel, emerging biotechnology, based on genetically engineered biopolymers, has the potential to achieve targeted drug delivery while reducing systemic toxicity. The broader impact of our project outcomes include potential clinical applications of this delivery system so as  to increase treatment efficacy, reduce cancer recurrence, provide a higher cure rate, and provide an overall improvement in the quality of life of patients with cancer, and particularly for patients with breast and other reproductive cancers.
