<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award will enable the PI, Dr. Anil Seth, to study the formation of massive black holes and nuclear star clusters through detailed studies of some of the nearest galaxy nuclei. By combining a wide range of data sets, the PI will determine the masses of a sample of resolved nuclear star clusters in nearby galaxies, estimate the masses of a population of nuclear star clusters out to 10 Mpc, and measure the properties of galaxies that host tidal disruption event candidates. The work will subsequently address two key questions in our understanding of galaxy nuclei: (1) how and when do nuclear star clusters form?; and (2) do lower mass galaxies host supermassive black holes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will also launch an ambitious program to expand the highly successful night-time astronomy program at Bryce Canyon National Park. In particular, the PI will (1) create a ranger talk on nearby galaxies and their nuclei to be used by staff at Bryce, (2) create an astronomy outreach training program for rangers at other parks nationwide so they can replicate Bryce's success, and (3) develop a summer internship program for undergraduate astronomy students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will provide critical contributions to our understanding of the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes, as well as the incredibly dense stellar clusters that lie at the centers of galaxies. It will leverage data from numerous federally funded astronomy facilities, and link with computational simulations of the evolution of the universe. Furthermore, the PI's outreach program will extend beyond Utah and Bryce Canyon to inspire national park visitors across the country to learn about the night sky.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There have been two primary outcomes from the research funded by this grant:  (1) We have shown for the first time that low mass galaxies (with 10-50 times fewer stars than the Milky Way) do commonly host central massive black holes.  These black holes have typical masses of a few 100,000 times that of our sun -- this is much smaller than the supermassive black holes previously found in more massive galaxies.  We do not yet know how central black holes form in galaxies, but our findings that a high fraction of low mass galaxies host black holes, and the masses of the black holes in these low mass galaxies, provide unique constraints on the initial formation of these enigmatic objects.   (2) We have found the first supermassive black holes living outside the centers of galaxies, in objects known as ultracompact dwarfs that are dense star clusters found orbiting massive galaxies.  The presence of supermassive black holes in these objects confirms earlier suggestions that these ultracompact dwarfs are the nuclei of galaxies that were torn apart during interactions with a more massive galaxy.  These former nuclei contain a large fraction of all the massive black holes in the local Universe.   These results (and others) were published in a series of 24 papers supported by this grant; combined these have already garnered over 600 citations, and this work has been presented by myself and my group at dozens of conferences and colloquia worldwide.     In addition to the research, this program funded a variety of astronomy outreach events in our Utah national parks.  Most successfully, the program started the ongoing astronomy outreach internships at Bryce Canyon National Park, a program that is now in its sixth year.  Two undergraduate students each summer selected from across the nation have shared and interpreted the wonderful dark skies at Bryce for about 10,000 visitors each summer.  This grant also funded two ranger training workshops where the PI helped train park rangers from across the nation in communicating astronomy to the public.   This project partially funded the PhD theses of three students, Dieu Nguyen, Chris Ahn, and Renuka Pechetti, all of whom have finished their degrees and found subsequent employment.  It also (partially) funded salaries for two postdocs, Mark den Brok and Karina Voggel, both of whom continued on to positions within the field.  The PI of this grant was granted tenure and promoted to associate professor during the time period of this grant, and was recently honored a Presidential Scholar at the University of Utah based largely on work funded by this grant.
