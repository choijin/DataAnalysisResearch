<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program of the Chemistry Division in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, the Developmental Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems of the Directorate for Biological Sciences, and the CBET-Nano-Biosensing Program in the Directorate for Engineering are funding Dr. James Chen from Stanford University to develop lanthanide-based systems for the imaging of RNAs and proteins in vivo. RNA aptamers and polypeptide receptors that bind to lanthanide chelates and enhance their photoluminescence will be developed through iterative rounds of molecular evolution, selection, and amplification. The receptor/chelate pairs will then be used to detect subnanomolar levels of mRNAs and proteins in live zebrafish embryos, taking advantage of the long luminescence lifetimes of lanthanide complexes. In combination with genome editing using transcription activator-like effect nucleases, these technologies have the potential to enable the simultaneous observation of tissue patterning and organogenesis and the macromolecules that regulate these processes. Through this interdisciplinary approach, the study will help decode the dynamic genetic programs that give rise to complex organisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While currently embryonic development can be observed with single-cell resolution by time-lapse microscopy, the biological molecules that contribute to this remarkable transformation remain largely invisible. As a result, our understanding of how specific RNAs and proteins contribute to the formation of distinct tissues and organs is limited. This study develops new technologies that may overcome this hurdle by enabling the real-time detection of RNAs and proteins in live zebrafish embryos and other organisms. The approach is based on use of methods pertaining to different related disciplines, specifically synthetic chemistry, molecular imaging, and developmental biology.  A scientifically multilingual cadre of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be trained. The project will also promote interdisciplinary research in scientific communities from developing countries through a chemical biology short-course at the University of SÃ£o Paulo in Brazil and by exposing talented Brazilian graduate students to research at Stanford University.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Fluorescent tags are often used to visualize proteins and other macromolecules in whole organisms; however, our ability to detect these labels is often hindered by the background fluorescence of natural compounds. A potential solution is the use of photoluminescent tags that emit light at much slower rates than natural fluorophores, as their photons can be selectively acquired through temporal gating. Lanthanide ions such as Eu<sup>3+</sup> have luminescence lifetimes that are approximately 100,000 times longer than those of common synthetic and biological fluorophores, and our project goal was to use lanthanide-based probes and time-resolved microscopy for ultrasensitive biological imaging. To achieve this objective, we first identified three major problems with current lanthanide microscopy systems: slow imaging rates due to the millisecond lifetimes of photo-excited lanthanides, background photoluminescence from the microscope optics, and inefficient lanthanide excitation by the light-emitting diodes typically used for time-resolved microscopy. We solved these issues by developing a new imaging modality (termed QSL trLRET) that incorporates a Q-switched laser light source, transreflected illumination, and a photophysical process called luminescence resonance energy transfer. These technological improvements enhance lanthanide signal intensities by 170-fold and signal-to-background ratios by 75-fold, and we applied QSL trLRET to visualize proteins and nuclei acids in zebrafish embryos.
