<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Adam Urbach of Trinity University explores the hypothesis that the terminus of a polypeptide chain has unique structural and conformational properties that may provide a general approach to protein recognition that is specific to a single site and is predictable both from the sequence of amino acids and from the receptor's ability to recognize short peptides of the same sequence. The project has three complementary aims. The first aim focuses on the discovery and characterization of new motifs for the recognition of peptide termini by synthetic receptors. The second part asks whether these receptors can recognize proteins containing the same terminal sequences. The third part involves the application of the recognition work to the labeling, capture, and release of proteins using conjugates of the synthetic receptors to bring functionality to the terminus of the proteins targeted in these studies. In addition to the societal benefits of being able to identify, isolate, and label specific proteins, the broader impacts involve intense training of undergraduate students in the research laboratory and a plan for the training of postdoctoral scholars that addresses crucial aspects of professional development in scholarship, teaching, and service in order to best prepare them to begin a career at a primarily undergraduate institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to distinguish between the numerous proteins in living systems is crucial to biological and biotechnological processes, but currently only antibodies can do this reliably and antibody-based technology can be very costly. This research aims to address this problem by developing new methods for interacting with proteins using synthetic receptors, which can be much less expensive and easier to modify. The focus of this project is to explore the recently developed concept that the very end of a protein chain (the terminus) is an ideal site for interacting with a receptor because the tail, like the end of a ball of string, can easily unravel. If successful, this research would establish a general method for predictably interacting with proteins, and it would form the foundation for developing tools that substantially improve our understanding of protein function in living systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The activities enabled by this grant have produced several important and substantial outcomes that contribute to the competitiveness of the United States by providing innovations in research and exceptional training for students who enter the scientific and medical workforce.  Fifteen undergraduate students, one postbaccalaureate research associate, and two postdoctoral scholars were involved in this research.  One of the postdocs (Andrew Bockus) is now working as a scientist at a pharmaceutical company in California.  The postbaccalaureate research associate (Lauren Gann) is now a PhD candidate at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla.  Among the students who have graduated, two are pursuing PhD?s (Rice University and UT Dallas), two are in medical school, and one is pursuing a master?s degree in health care administration.  Among the current students, four are planning to pursue a PhD in chemistry, and three are planning to pursue a medical degree.  These examples show the high quality of the participants and demonstrate the value of the research training as an important outcome, perhaps the most valuable societal outcome, of this grant award.  The research activities have produced six peer-reviewed publications, including five top-tier journal articles and a book chapter.  Three of the articles are published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.  The publications include eleven undergraduate coauthors.  For context, the many thousands of different molecules in living systems work together in a coordinated hierarchy of structure and function.  This cooperation is possible because the molecules are able to find one another and stick together highly selectively&mdash;that is, they "recognize" one another and stick only to their partners. The principal investigator?s research program studies this process, known as "molecular recognition," and focuses on the design and characterization of man-made (synthetic) molecules that recognize biological molecules such as proteins and peptides.  The publications enabled by this grant award describe our efforts to improving the interaction between synthetic receptors and peptides and proteins.  One publication describes the discovery of a new way to recognize peptides with what is currently the highest reported strength and selectivity.  As such, our receptor has the characteristics of an antibody but is less expensive, reusable, and more reliable.  We are currently working to establish the scope and limitations of this technique.  In another report, we used a synthetic receptor to isolate a protein of interest from a complex mixture, which is the most stringent test of selectivity.  One paper describes the use of a synthetic receptor to significantly enhance the analysis of proteins by mass spectrometry.  These examples highlight the potential impact of this work in fundamental and applied biochemistry.       Last Modified: 12/11/2017       Submitted by: Adam R Urbach]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
