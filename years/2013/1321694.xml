<AbstractNarration>Catchments are fundamental landscape units that contain interpretable physical, chemical and&lt;br/&gt;biological signals in their soils, drainage waters and ecosystems and record the effects of&lt;br/&gt;climate warming, atmospheric deposition, land use shifts, catastrophic events and other global&lt;br/&gt;change drivers. Catchment Science, the focus of the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and&lt;br/&gt;Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for which we seek financial support, is a truly interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;and international endeavor conducted by hydrologists, ecologists and biogeochemists whose&lt;br/&gt;goal is to explore and understand catchment response signals in order to better anticipate future&lt;br/&gt;challenges facing water and ecosystem managers. The purpose of this conference is to bring&lt;br/&gt;together established and developing experts in the field of Catchment Science to share the&lt;br/&gt;results of cutting-edge research, develop new collaborations, and assess where we are and&lt;br/&gt;where we need to go in order to understand the future of catchments in an era of global change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intelletual Merit. The theme of this GRC/GRS is "Catchments Through the Looking Glass:&lt;br/&gt;From Microscopes to Telescopes". There is compelling evidence that global change is affecting&lt;br/&gt;the physical, chemical, and biological resources of catchments in many parts of the world, and&lt;br/&gt;Catchment Science is increasingly at the forefront of driving our understanding of the many&lt;br/&gt;implications of global change. As catchment scientists, we each have our own unique&lt;br/&gt;perspectives and vantage points from which we view our scientific approach and interpret our&lt;br/&gt;data. This GRC/GRS will bring together leading experts in the field who will explain how their&lt;br/&gt;particular vision and research environment have shaped the direction of their cutting-edge&lt;br/&gt;research and how their approaches can be useful and applicable to other scientists and endusers&lt;br/&gt;working in the field. The GRC/GRS will focus on four sub-themes that span a broad range&lt;br/&gt;of Catchment Science perspectives: 1) "Changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes", where we&lt;br/&gt;will assess the similarities and differences of conducting catchment science in polar, boreal,&lt;br/&gt;temperate, arid and tropical settings as well as the societal implication and application; "Doors&lt;br/&gt;of perception", which will consider how the scale of our scientific lens, from microscopic to&lt;br/&gt;telescopic and with different levels of stakeholder involvement, shapes our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;catchments; "Animal, vegetable, mineral", where we will explore the inextricable linkages&lt;br/&gt;between biota and the Earth's surface that help to determine catchment function and&lt;br/&gt;sustainability, particularly under climate change concerns; and "Tools you can use", which will&lt;br/&gt;showcase novel analytical techniques and conceptual approaches that have revolutionized the&lt;br/&gt;field. The GRC provides the ideal format for promoting better communication and understanding&lt;br/&gt;of the various research approaches comprising Catchment Science, allowing a more focused&lt;br/&gt;attack on identified issues and improved international collaboration in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Our ability to successfully conduct Catchment Science in the future in&lt;br/&gt;response to global change rests largely in our ability to nurture the next generation of catchment&lt;br/&gt;scientists. This GRC will be immediately preceded by our second two-day Gordon Research&lt;br/&gt;Seminar (GRS), the participants of which will be mainly graduate students and recent advanced&lt;br/&gt;degree recipients from the various fields of Catchment Science, as well as senior scientists who&lt;br/&gt;will serve as mentors and discussion leaders. We expect all GRS participants will attend the&lt;br/&gt;GRC conference the following week, with the result of greatly increased participation of young&lt;br/&gt;scientists in the Catchment Sciences GRC series. We anticipate that the GRS is likely to&lt;br/&gt;increase the ethnic diversity of the GRC, attesting to the continually changing demographics in&lt;br/&gt;Catchment Science. In addition, our invited speakers and discussion leaders are nearly half&lt;br/&gt;female, reflecting our efforts to promote gender diversity in our program. The products of these&lt;br/&gt;efforts include increased communication among all levels and fields of catchment scientists, as&lt;br/&gt;well as the dispersal of new ideas throughout the broader scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
