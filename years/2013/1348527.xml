<AbstractNarration>This collaborative study is investigating how the STEM skills and training that individuals from underrepresented groups acquired during high school and postsecondary education have contributed to their STEM workforce success and the types of occupations they now enjoy in midlife.  It is uses the High School &amp; Beyond (HS&amp;B) database, a nationally representative study of high school sophomores from 1980.  HS&amp;B contains a large sample of African Americans and Latinos, women, and people with disabilities, including those who earned postsecondary degrees, to provide information about how our education system has and can prepare diverse students to fully participate in a complex and rapidly changing workforce, even during middle and later adulthood.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has the following three aims:&lt;br/&gt;1. Identifying the aspects of STEM training in schools, from specific coursework to degree attainment and field of degree, that contribute to workforce success and flexibility during early adulthood and in later midlife work.  &lt;br/&gt;Research Question: Which STEM skills and training have high labor market value in (i) early and (ii) middle to late careers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Analyzing whether the relationship between STEM training and workforce success is the same for all workers, and if not, how it differs for women and men, African Americans, Latinos, and Whites, and for persons with and without disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;Research Question: Do the relationships between skills and the labor market generalize to underrepresented groups?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Producing a database, that will be released through NCES, on HS&amp;B sample members' occupations that can be used by the broader research community to generate new knowledge on workforce development and broadening participation in STEM.</AbstractNarration>

HS&amp;B contains a large enough sample of African Americans and Latinos (including those who earned postsecondary degrees) to provide information about how our education system can prepare diverse students to fully participate in a complex and rapidly changing workforce, even during middle and later adulthood, and long past the completion of their formal education. HS&amp;B sample members occupy an important historical position at the end of the Baby Boom.  An important aspect of our rapidly changing economy is the high demand for workers with STEM skills who can innovate and flexibly adapt to innovation. What skills make individuals able to adapt and succeed? And what did their schools do to prepare them? This study is designed to answer these questions by effectively mapping backward from today’s workplace expectations for knowledge and competences to the skills that workers used to successfully adapt to changing workplace demands, and how schools helped students to develop those skills. Findings will directly contribute to our core knowledge about how to design more effective schools and programs to produce workers who will lead and innovate in a complex global economy. This project addresses the priority to increase U.S. economic competitiveness for the future. It provides information about what U.S. schools can do to contribute to a workforce with skills that can compete in the global marketplace. It identifies how to enhance students’ STEM skills that contribute to occupations that involve the highest levels of innovation and analytic tasks, as well as other occupations that require workers to successfully adapt to changes and innovations in the workplace.  We have found that aspects of the high school experience &ndash; especially the math and science courses that students took &ndash; affect students throughout their life course and into midlife. Our midlife outcomes range from educational achievement (both postsecondary and later life training), physical and mental health, disability status, body weight, labor market (occupations, including STEM occupations, skills demanded in occupations, employment/unemployment), and financial stability. We have modeled these outcomes later in life with a rich set of indicators of educational opportunity and course-taking (particularly mathematics, science, and computer programming course-taking), educational stratification, school effects, as well as non-cognitive skills.  Some of the more notable results include:  Individuals’ math-related skills and locus of control at the end of high school predict their employment status at midlife. College preparatory math courses serve as a safety net for women, protecting them from bad occupations later in life. Adolescent men who expected occupations that declined in labor market share during early adulthood are at increased risk of suicide or substance abuse mortality by midlife. Low educational expectation during adolescence, mismatched expectations, are harmful to occupational attainment in midlife net of academic performance and degree attainment.  Educational attainment is predictive of accidental (less education, more accidents) and other causes of death; math test scores are predictive of (protective against) death from heart disease; and lower level math coursework is predictive of suicidal death.      In addition to the results of our research team’s analysis of the data, this study is also part of larger study that followed up the original sophomore cohort of the High School and Beyond (HS&amp;B) study that began in 1980.  The purpose of this follow-up was to find out how the original participants were doing more than thirty years later.  This follow-up is ongoing and was funded by the National Science Foundation and by other funders such as the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Spencer Foundation, the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), and the National Institutes of Health.  These data will be made available to researchers through the National Center for Educations Statistics (NCES) restricted data program.  Researchers from a variety of disciplines will be able to use these data to study how education in high school and college affect a variety of aspects of people’s lives as they reach middle age and throughout the life course.
