<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate an energy storage technique utilizing water as the storage material in an ionic, time delayed, freeze-point-suppression refrigeration cycle. The project will demonstrate A) 70% Round-Trip-Efficiency on a 2kW system prototype utilizing diurnal ambient temperature swing and B) commercial feasibility of load shifting energy storage with &lt; 3-year payback. Successful integration within low temperature refrigeration architectures requires reducing membrane distillation feed temperature and liquid-to-solid thermal regeneration equipment costs, technical obstacles demanding membrane material coatings and advanced additive manufacturing research. More specifically, the project team will advance air-gap membrane technologies by enabling wide temperature module operation via new membrane and condenser surface coatings, while improving liquid-to-solid thermal regeneration utilizing a single, 3D printed heat exchanger designed and optimized for sub-0C applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project provides utilities peak demand relief, retail stores reduced freezer operating costs and regulators safer refrigerants. Unfortunately, no state-of-the-art system simultaneously addresses all these issues. Industrial/commercial energy storage is unaffordable, refrigeration costs account for 60% of a retail store?s electricity bills and equipment manufactures are scrambling to design around toxic ammonia and high pressure, high cost CO2. This energy storage technology provides load-shifting services and a 45% reduction in commercial freezer electrical purchases with a 3-year payback without large government incentives using safer, near ambient, materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Bound Thermal Storage (BTS) utilizes water in an ionic, time delayed, freeze-point-suppression refrigeration system to provide load shifting energy storage at a cost 80% lower than a vanadium flow battery while meeting the low payback periods required by commercial customers. BTS uses water-based storage materials, industrial waste heat and off peak electricity to generate low temperatures that offset freezer energy loads. Efficiency and energy storage benefits enable foodservice, food processing and retail facilities the opportunity to reduce their refrigeration costs by as much as 60% through a 40% reduction in total electrical purchases and time-of-use (TOU) rate arbitrage.         Rebound successfully moved the BTS technology from TRL 3 to TRL 4 via Phase I funding.   M1: Demonstrate viability of membrane seperator &ndash; Fully Achieved  Flux values of &gt;2kg/m2 were achieved in isolated testing. However, the waste heat quantity requirement led to the development of hybrid thermo-mechanical separation systems.         M2: Build and opperate ice regenerator &ndash; Fully Achieved   Ice regenerator tests were performed to isolate the ice regenerator performance.  M3: Brine flow / Ice mixing demonstrated &ndash; Fully Achieved   Freeze Point Suppressant (FPS) pressure drop far below 0.5bar was achieved thus indicating more than sufficient FPS circulation. Focus on reliable ice flow became the predominant tank design focus.   M4: Model and prototype match to within &plusmn; 25% - Partially Achieved   Prototype system provided 20% more cooling power than the design system at peak performance. Not all model-prototype comparisons were possible.  M5: Geographic/Utility regions with 3-year payback identified &ndash; Fully Achieved  Techno-economic modeling shows three-year paybacks with margins in excess of industry standards in all six United States geographic regions.          Objective 1: Prototype Operation   Task 1: Membrane Optimization   Optimizing the membrane separation process, responsible for concentrating the dilute Freeze Point Suppressant (FPS), represented a significant focus of this Phase I effort. Membrane testing, modeling, and customer feedback indicated that the separation step should not only concentrate the dilute FPS using waste heat from the medium temperature (&gt;0&deg;C) refrigeration system, but should also include a backup electrical concentration system. This was accomplished using a hybrid thermo-mechanical membrane separation process.           Although recorded flux values in the 3-10 kg/m2-h range were encouraging, the testing generated concerns regarding the waste heat quantity required to achieve these values. To address this obstacle, Rebound designed a hybrid thermal-mechanical separation process that reduces overall BTS cost and waste heat requirement.          Task 2: Thermal Regeneration   BTS ice flow moves from the ice maker at the top of the tank, to the bottom of the tank where it mixes with concentrated FPS, melts to create a dilute FPS, and then delivers refrigeration. Inbetween these two regions, the ice is pre-chilled using internally regenerated chill. The device to accomplish this was constructed and tested.            Objective 2: Techno-Economic Modeling           The goal of this task was to characterize the technologyÆs technical and economic performance by updating ReboundÆs previous models. Performance models were completed in the Python language and required updated membrane, fluids, and balance of system component sizing. Economic modeling was completed in the Simulink language and required the development of a fully transient system model based on performance correlations derived from the Python steady state performance models.          Initial runs indicated that due to the ice maker size, the decreased efficiency at high ambient temperatures, and the medium temperature refrigeration system (medium temperature rack) cooling capacity, some systems in some locations f...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
