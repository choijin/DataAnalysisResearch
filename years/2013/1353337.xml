<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a workshop to bring together thought leaders from a variety of disciplines to outline an agenda for scientific and engineering research in service innovation.  Solving service problems has enormous practical consequences for the economy and society because (a) more than 80% of jobs in the US are in the service sector, with most Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) graduates working in service; (b) many complex service problems resist traditional optimization solutions; and (c) private investment in service research is low because of low margins in non-technology-intensive service businesses, and the US lags in public investment behind countries such as Japan, China, Finland, and Germany. Simply put, the search for service innovation requires new theories and new methods to address problems unique to services, and what little students are being taught about the service sector has not kept up with the rapid growth of STEM jobs in service or with modern entrepreneurial opportunities. Effective understanding of complex services and innovation in services requires a new approach that combines multiple methods, for example, drawing from industrial engineering and operations research, social and behavioral sciences, information systems, and computer science and computational modeling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this workshop will develop a roadmap for future service research and education for NSF and industry partners by (a) laying out the societal context for service research, (b) identifying technology needs and knowledge gaps for service innovation, and (c) developing basic science and engineering questions to be addressed to satisfy the needs and fill the gaps. Anticipated outcomes also include new collaborations and increased capacity in the research community for advancing interdisciplinary studies of service. In addition, some focus on education in service from science, technology, engineering, and math fields are expected to result in plans for cross-disciplinary, cross-institution programs.</AbstractNarration>

Effective understanding of complex service systems requires a new approach that combines multiple methods, for example, drawing from industrial engineering and operations research, social and behavioral sciences, information systems, and computer science and computational modeling.  Participants at the workshop discussed specifically the need to create a research agenda focused on Human-Centered Service Systems (HCSS), configurations of people, information, organizations, and technologies that operate together for mutual benefit.  HCSSs depend critically on sharing capabilities among distinct economic entities to create value. HCSSs include family households, apartment complexes, online social media platforms, global non-profit social enterprises and aid organizations, hotels, hospitals, shopping malls, office complexes, schools, universities, airports, and cities.

Specifically, there are questions and research needed in theory creation, data collection, mathematical and computational modeling, service system design, performance measurement, and education for human-centered service systems. Service system problems relate to many separate areas and disciplines covered by the National Science Foundation (NSF),  and so the report and commentary discuss relevant NSF programs for which further synergies are possible. There are also several recommendations focusing on specific application areas including urban infrastructure, manufacturing servitization, information and ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
