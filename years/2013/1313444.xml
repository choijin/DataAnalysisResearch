<AbstractNarration>This is a theoretical project to calculate three-dimensional models of brown dwarf interiors and atmospheres, where rotation and convection are included, as well as the interaction between the interior and overlying stratified atmosphere.   The model will address observational data which are consistent with the presence of clouds, chemical disequilibrium, and temporal variability.  The research will predict infrared spectra, lightcurves and vertical mixing rates for comparison with observations, including directly imaged giant extrasolar planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include training a graduate student for his or her Ph.D., incorporating the numerical code in the graduate and undergraduate courses that the PI teaches, and dissemination of the results to the scientific community and general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was aimed at understanding the atmospheric circulation of objects intermediate between giant planets and stars, known as the brown dwarfs.  These free-floating worlds are similar to Jupiter in size but much more massive, and they commonly have temperatures of 1000 degrees or more.  Observations show that brown dwarfs are covered by patchy clouds that vary over time, but the nature of the underlying atmospheric circulation that causes the cloud patchiness and its time variability is not understoood.    Intellectual Merit: In this project, we implemented the first-ever models of the global atmospheric circulation on brown dwarfs.  Being pathbreaking in nature, our models were idealized, having the goal of understanding the role of various processes in causing an atmospheric circulation and shaping its behavior.  In particular, we explored the effect on the atmospheric circulation of (1) interior convection impinging against an overlying atmosphere, (2) a "hydrological"  cycle in which latent heat release due to condensation of cloud constituents (silicate dust in the case of brown dwarfs) leads to thunderstorm-like phenomena, and (3) radiative feedbacks involving clouds.  Our work showed that all three of these processes can lead to a vigorous atmospheric circulation, with the first and third processes (interior convection and cloud radiative feedbacks) being most important. We constructed analytic theories for the strength of the atmospheric circulation that would result from the perturbing effects of interior convection, and we subsequently tested this theory with detailed, 3D numerical simulations of the atmospheric circulation, which showed that interior convection can induce large scale atmospheric waves, turbulence, and east-west jet streams that would, in the presence of cloud decks, lead to large-scale patchiness like that seen in observations.  To explore the specific effects of clouds on the circulation, we constructed a series of idealized models in 1D, 2D,and 3D to understand how clouds radiative effects might influence the thermal structure and whether this can itself drive an atmospheric circulation.  We demonstrated the existence of positive feedbacks in which the existence of patchy clouds causes perturbations to the radiative heating and cooling that, in turn, drive an overturning circulation that maintains the cloud patchiness.  Thus, an initially cloud-free atmosphere that would lack a circulation in the absence of clouds can spontaneously develop a vigorous, self-regenerating atmospheric circulation once clouds are seeded into the flow field.  We showed how this circulation, once it reaches equilibrium, can comprise a complex, time-variable pattern of turbulence, waves, and jet streams, which modulate the cloud patchiness.  We published a stream of peer-reviewed papers from this body of work, each of which explores these processes in detail and shows how each process, when considered in isolation, can influence or drive an atmospheric circulation.  Broader Impacts: This project had important broader impacts in the areas of mentoring, education, and cross-disciplinary fertilization between fields.  The research performed for this project formed the core of former graduate student Xianyu Tan's Ph.D. thesis at the University of Arizona, with the PI serving as his Ph.D. advisor.  Thus this project was absolutely critical in training Mr. Tan, who obtained his Ph.D. in December 2018 and is now a postdoctoral scholar at Oxford.  The project was also critical in training former postdoctoral scholar Xi Zhang, who went on to become an Assistant Professor at U.C. Santa Cruz, again in part due to the research conducted for this project.  Finally, this project led to significant cross-field fertilization, in that we adapted numerical codes and analytic theory and insights from the terrestrial and solar system atmospheric dynamics communities for use in the brown dwarf field (which consists mostly of people with astronomy backgrounds, especially in observations).  From the perspective of the terrestrial and solar-system atmospheric dynamics communities, brown dwarfs represent an exotic regime, and we helped to introduce the terrestrial/solar-system communities to brown dwarfs as an extreme regime of atmospheric dynamics. The PI and other team members (Xianyu Tan and Xi Zhang) gave a number of colloquia and other presentations emphasizing these interdisciplinary aspects, not only in astronomy and planetary science departments but in Earth-science departments and conferences as well.  Overall, because of the interdisciplinary cross-flow, we think this project greatly increased the dynamical foundation of the brown dwarf field (helping observers to interpret their observations) and we also managed to get quite a few Earth and planetary scientists interested in brown dwarfs as a worthwhile field of study.  We feel proud of this accomplishment and I think this pathbreaking effort will help to encourage more solar system and terrestrial atmospheric scientists to take on brown dwarfs as a field of study.
