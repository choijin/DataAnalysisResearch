<AbstractNarration>INTELLECTUAL MERIT: Anthropogenic elevation of atmospheric pCO2 is increasing the acidity of the oceans, thereby reducing the saturation state of seawater with respect to calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Of mounting concern is the potential impact of these changes on the ability of calcifying organisms to form their shells and skeletons. Recent studies, including pilot work conducted by PI Ries and his colleagues on a suite of benthic marine calcifiers spanning broad taxonomic, mineralogical, and ecological ranges, have revealed that marine organisms exhibit a wide range of calcification responses to CO2-induced ocean acidification, including positive, negative, parabolic, threshold, and neutral responses. Marine calcifiers build their shells and skeletons from various forms (polymorphs) of CaCO3, most commonly aragonite, high-Mg calcite, and low-Mg calcite. These polymorphs differ greatly in their solubility in seawater and, therefore, in their potential response to CO2-induced ocean acidification. X-ray diffraction analysis of shells secreted by the organisms investigated in the pilot study reveals that the proportion of calcite (the less soluble form of CaCO3) to aragonite (the more soluble form) within their shells increases under elevated pCO2, while the Mg:Ca ratio of their calcite declines. These observations suggested that some marine calcifiers may partially adapt to a declining CaCO3 saturation state by accreting a greater proportion of the less-soluble form of CaCO3 (low-Mg calcite) at the expense of the more soluble forms (aragonite, high-Mg calcite). However, it is likely that such mineralogical and compositional changes in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms would alter their structural and biomechanical properties. The project seeks to build upon the results of the pilot study by rearing a suite of benthic marine calcifiers under past (280 ppm), present (385 ppm), and predicted future (540, 840 ppm) pCO2 and under three distinct temperatures to investigate changes in: (1) their rates of calcification and linear extension; (2) the relative abundance and micron-scale distribution of the various CaCO3 polymorphs within their shells/skeletons; (3) the ultrastructure and crystal morphology of their shells/skeletons; and (4) their biomechanical properties. The research would also build upon the pilot experiments by utilizing a more thoroughly replicated study design, by more precisely constraining the chemical parameters of the experimental seawater treatments, by investigating calcification responses under 3 different temperature regimes, and by employing a "pre-industrial" pCO2 level (280 ppm). The results of the proposed research should advance our understanding of how benthic marine calcifiers shall respond to future CO2-induced changes in seawater temperature and CaCO3 saturation state. And by investigating the response of organisms over the range of atmospheric pCO2 that has occurred since late Paleozoic time, this research should inform our understanding of the putative links atmospheric pCO2, mass extinction events, and secular variation in the polymorph mineralogy of marine calcifiers throughout geologic time. Finally, comparison of the observed biological responses to variable pCO2-T scenarios with that already established for abiogenic carbonates will advance our understanding of the very mechanisms by which marine calcifiers build their shells and skeletons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: The results of the proposed research will inform the decisions of policy makers and legislators working to mitigate the impacts of CO2-induced warming and ocean acidification by establishing pCO2-T tolerances for a range of marine calcifiers. Results of the proposed research would be widely disseminated through peer-reviewed publication, conference presentations, public outreach, the PI's website, and mainstream media outlets. PI Ries is an early career scientist whose developing research program would be materially enhanced by the resources and activities afforded via the research. This research would also promote the education, training, and professional development of graduate students Ann Mooney (a native Pacific Islander) and Isaac Westfield, and postdoctoral fellow Karl Castillo (a native Belizean of African descent), two of whom belong to minority groups that are underrepresented in the marine sciences. Finally, the proposed research would create valuable training and educational experiences for several undergraduates conducting research under the PI.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project objective: To investigate impacts of ocean acidification and warming on the calcification rate, elemental composition, mineralogy, and ultrastructure of a broad range of calcifying marine organisms.     Funding from this award supported a wide range of experimental and field-based research projects investigating numerous aspects of the impacts of ocean acidification (OA) and global warming (GW) on marine calcification. Examples are summarized below.     (1) Impact of OA on shell mineralogy of 18 species of marine calcifiers. OA alters mineral ratios of bi-mineralic calcifiers, but does not cause mono-mineralic calcifiers to start producing a new mineral, while also altering Mg/Ca ratios in some calcite-producing organisms.     (2) Impact of OA on the chemistry of the calcifying fluids of corals and coccolithophores.  Microelectrode and boron isotope measurements of coral skeletons show that although pH of coral calcifying fluid is substantially elevated relative to surrounding seawater, OA causes pH of this fluid to decline.  However, corals target a fixed external:internal proton ratio, regardless of seawater pH.  Boron isotope measurements of coccolith calcite show that coccolithophores maintain constant pH at site of calcification, allowing them to continue shell-building under OA.     (3) Modelling calcification responses exhibited by organisms to OA.  A simple and unified geochemical model of the calcifying fluids of marine calcifiers was developed that generates the full range of calcification responses that have been observed to date in various OA experiments (negative, neutral, positive).     (4) Impact of GW on Caribbean reef-building corals.  100-year cores obtained from corals on the Meso-American Barrier Reef System (coastal Belize) indicate that warming has caused forereef corals (Siderastrea siderea) to decline, but not backreef or nearshore corals&mdash;suggesting that forereef corals are more vulnerable to GW.     (5) Reconstructing past seawater pH.  A boron isotope indicator of past seawater pH was developed for the coral Siderastrea siderea.     (6) Impact of OA on calcification rates. Laboratory experiments show that OA has a negative effect on the calcification rates of juvenile American oysters, a neutral effect on the mud crab, and a parabolic (or æpeakedÆ) effect on the reef-building coral Siderastrea siderea.     (7) Combined impacts of OA and GW.  Laboratory experiments show that OA impairs calcification rates with the urchin Echinometra viridis, while GW has a positive effect. Thus, GW mitigates effect of OA on this species.  Laboratory experiments also show that the coral Siderastrea siderea exhibits parabolic (peaked) calcification responses to both OA and GW, and that GW amplifies the negative effect of OA, and vice versa.     (8) Impact of ocean acidification on behavior and predator-prey dynamics.  Laboratory experiments show that OA renders mud crabs less effective at opening and consuming juvenile oysters.      (9) Impact of OA and GW on stable isotopic composition of marine calcifiers. Laboratory experiments show that oxygen isotopes of urchin calcite and coral aragonite are negatively correlated with temperature and uncorrelated with pCO2, while carbon isotopes of the urchins were significantly correlated with both temperature and pCO2--suggesting that fossil urchin oxygen and carbon isotopes archive past oceanic temperature and pCO2, and that coral aragonite archives past temperature.      (10) Impact of OA and GW on the clumped isotopes of bivalve shells.  Laboratory experiments reveal a relationship between temperature, but not seawater saturation state, and the clumped isotope composition of bivalves&mdash;suggesting that clumped isotopes in bivalves archive past-ocean-temperature.     (11) Impact of GW and OA on elemental composition of marine calcifiers. Laboratory experiments show that OA impacts elemental ratios within various marine calcifiers and that GW alters elemental r...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
