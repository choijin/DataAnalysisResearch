<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Coe College provides eight undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in research on topics in optics, glass science, acoustics, molecular biology, modeling, biomaterials, all under the common focus of spectroscopy. In addition to participating in research with an experienced and dedicated mentor, the REU students will engage in activities such as seminars and lectures and give two oral presentations, one at mid-term and then a final twenty minute talk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) site, where each summer two  high school teachers from nearby school districts participate in a research project. During the academic year, the teachers are invited to bring their students to Coe College to learn about the work they carried out. The teachers will use their experience to motivate their students to better understand the physical world and prepare them to become the future generation of scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will have a number of broader impacts. The site has a strong plan to recruit undergraduate students from institutions offering little or no research opportunities and first generation students. The site has an excellent evaluation plan which is designed to give feedback and to improve the project on an on-going basis. Additionally, training students and teachers in spectroscopy has relevance to national security.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The best way to train to be a scientist is to actually do science.  At the Coe College REU site, 24 undergraduate students from across the nation&mdash;as well as 6 high school teachers&mdash;had the chance to carry out projects in physics, chemistry, and biology and to learn to use advanced equipment.  From developing detectors for medical instruments, to understanding how reed musical instruments make sounds, to looking at the role of the brain's glial cells, these researchers worked on many projects over the last three years of the site's operation.  Aside from the discoveries, which included a better understanding of how glasses conduct electricity, the creation of new composite materials that kill bacteria, a clearer picture of how atoms arrange in glasses, and insights into how sea worms make cement underwater, the site also trained many future scientists in all areas of spectroscopy.  This is especially important, as spectroscopy covers many techniques that are used throughout scientific research, and the development of these abilities is important even in national security.  For the teachers, the experience of doing science and carrying our research projects allows them to take back to the classroom stories of real scientific work, as well as new skills.  To give one example, one teacher took back a copy of their lab notebook, to show their high school students how much care and detail had to go into it.  Finally, all the participants presented their work to a general audience, sharing the results of their efforts with a broader group of lay persons.
