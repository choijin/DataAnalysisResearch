<AbstractNarration>The University of Nebraska partners with the National Center for Research on Rural Education, The Center for Science, Mathematics &amp; Computer Education (UNL), and Nebraska's 18 Educational Service Units (ESU 1-ESU 18) to utilize distance education and communication technologies to provide university outreach opportunities to students and teachers through science research to  high schools in Nebraska. The chief aim of the project is to serve the needs of students and teachers in the most remote rural areas of the state of Nebraska through fostered participation in a cosmic ray observatory experiment where students build, operate, maintain, and utilize cosmic ray detectors in schools across the state creating a network of observation points, a state wide learning community, and foster increased interest and learning in physics and astronomy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will employ a combination of video-conferencing, video-streamed demonstrations and instructions, summer workshops and academic year conferences, and internet social networking as delivery systems. It will focus on the comparison of the experiences of remote participants with those from local schools, and seek to optimize the level of contact necessary to sustain interest, activity, and long-term impact. The overall program goal is the development and implementation of a model strategy that encourages rural teachers' and students' active participation in STEM research in grades 10-12 both in class and through extracurricular/afterschool activities.</AbstractNarration>

CROP has demonstrated success in 1) increasing both teacher and student content knowledge and conceptual understanding of fundamental physics while extending it through enrichment of advanced topics grounded by a continually reinforced background of high school physics; (2) providing teachers and students with a deeper understanding and appreciation of science as process through engagement in actual research; (3) building student interest in science and its pursuit in post secondary education; (4) giving teachers new confidence to teach the more advanced topics in their curriculum with a renewed excitement for the field.</p> <p>The ITEST project goal was to explore the means and study the efficacy of extending these same opportunities to the underserved community of students in the most remote districts of our state, and provide for the professional development of the many rural instructors teaching out of their field. Over 41% of Nebraska's population is rural. Few outreach efforts nationwide reach rural communities. At best they target small districts within commuting distance (hardly remote) or make single (even if extended) visits with no regular follow-up. Exploiting the connectivity offered to schools through Nebraska&rsquo;s Education Service Units (ESUs) we explored combinations of video-conferencing, video-streamed training, and a series of summer workshops and academic year conferences hosted through ESU centers. Research questions compared the experiences of remote participants with those of our local CROP schools, seeking to optimize the contact necessary to sustain interest and activity.</p> <p>Decentralized 3-day workshops, hosted by the state&rsquo;s ESU centers and coordinated by regional ESU staff and local CROP teachers, complemented the summer workshops held on campus. Bi-weekly video-conference meetings with remote high school teams were hosted by program staff at the end of the school day. At these meetings students reported progress and staff answered questions, helped trouble-shoot problems, guided students in their independently chosen research problems and the preparation of reports on their findings. Each semester a Saturday research conference provided high-school student and teacher teams a venue for reporting their work. An established a network of speakers from local tech industries (both urban and rural Nebraska) conducted highly animated Q&amp;A sessions with students on STEM career opportunities at these conferences. An on-demand solution center promptly responded to student queries and all staff was trained in the use of CAMTASIA Suite software to create educational video training modules.</p> <p>All groups (teachers and students, rural and urban, public and private) showed marked improvement in performance in the content assessments of the mathematics, physics, and chemistry pertinent to the analysis of experimental science. This suggests with focused activities, and by careful selection of material, we still successfully trained students in short 3-day summer workshops (the original CROP program ran month-long training workshops).</p> <p>Modest gains in assessment of basic physics concepts reflect the strong focus of our workshops on the training necessary to master the use of the experimental equipment and data analysis tools, at the cost of more reviews of the underlying basics. Student participants ranged from freshmen through seniors with a wide range of preparation (many not yet taken physics). &nbsp;We need to revive materials we previously used to introduce and review those concepts, through remote delivery.</p> <p>Rural teams were at least as proficient, and possibly more active, than many of the local participating schools. Though limited by the statistics available in this small pilot, as a group rural students showed slightly bigger increases in the content knowledge assessment, exhibiting their preparedness to conduct and understand the research on their own.

Instead of lessons in pedagogy&nbsp;they want serious physics content that reinforces the fundamentals they need to teach. In addition to this reinforcement, they crave introductions to concepts just beyond the high school curriculum which they feel gives them more insight into the subject and more confidence to teach it, even tackling the questions of curious and better informed students. This all needs to be presented in ways that translate into material that can actually be used in the classroom.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/30/2016<br>      Modified by:
