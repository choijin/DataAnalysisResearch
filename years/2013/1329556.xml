<AbstractNarration>This project will engage in empirically-based research on the use of geospatial technologies  by supranational organizations. The PI will study documents including policy statements, field notes, scientific publications, supplementary maps, GIS coverages, demarcated areas, reports, memos; and identifying human (organizations, groups, individuals) and non-human actors (landforms, technologies, infrastructures), as a group of complementary and competing actor-networks. NVivo computer software will be used to store, organized, categorize, manipulate, and analyze data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will disseminate results directly to the populations studied via  a one hour presentation and informal roundtable to be held at several of the sites. Two journalism undergraduate students will help with the production of a non-academic report, production of a video, and creation of a website and interactive blog page.</AbstractNarration>
