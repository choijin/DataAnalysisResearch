<AbstractNarration>This project lies at the interface of geometry and partial differential equations.  The PI will further the study of natural geometric evolution equations designed to understand aspects of four dimensional geometry and topology.  One project is to understand the singularity formation and long time behavior of geometric flows on almost Hermitian manifolds, previously introduced by the PI in joint work with G. Tian.  One aspect of this is to fully understand how the long time behavior of the pluriclosed flow relates to the classification of complex surfaces.  Another project is to understand the subcritical behavior of the gradient flow of the Yang-Mills energy of a Riemannian metric.  One major goal here is to understand the possible singularities which can develop on four-manifolds with small initial energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of geometry and curvature in understanding spaces is a fundamental idea in mathematics and science.  Frequently the relevant curvature properties are closely related to equations relating to the laws of nature.  Geometric evolution equations of the kind proposed here arise frequently in various physical contexts, and see application to various areas including image analysis and material science.  The proposed research will advance fundamental geometric and analytic ideas which are the foundation of such applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project resulted in a significant strengthening of our knowledge of evolutionary processes in geometry and mathematical physics.  These processes lie at the heart of our deepest understanding of many aspects of geometry and physics, and thus these results broaden our intellectual foundation in these central areas.  A fundamental example from everyday life is the evolution of a soap film as it breaks into pieces that approach spherical shape.  The equations we study concern the intrinsic curvature of manifolds, such as that employed in the general theory of relativity.  One specific equation we study arose originally in mathematical physics, specifically string theory, from the study of renormalization group flow.  We approached this equation from a different, purely geometric point of view, resulting in further insight into the structure of possible singularities that can form, as well as insight into the possible topologies which can admit solutions to fundamental equations of string theory.  This project also provided many opportunities for graduate student education.  At various points funding was provided to UC Irvine graduate students Casey Kelleher, Jess Boling, and Chris Lopez.  Chris Lopez specifically was awarded further funding under an AGEP supplement.  This funding resulted in 7 publications by these students.  The PI also used NSF funding to travel to several international conferences to deliver lecture series on these results, disseminating these new ideas into the community.  We also produced lengthy lecture notes for a graduate course which will eventually be turned into a book.       Last Modified: 10/31/2016       Submitted by: Jeffrey Streets]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
