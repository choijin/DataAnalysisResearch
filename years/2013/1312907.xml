<AbstractNarration>Typically, optimization deals exclusively with instances of static problems, with few exceptions. Some exceptions include stochastic optimization and on-line optimization models that treat problems with time-varying uncertainties in the objective functions. Stochastic optimization anticipates that these uncertainties occur in a random fashion and on-line optimization allows for objective functions to be drawn from some pre-specified class of functions, again, in an arbitrary fashion. In the existing literature on constrained optimization, there is litte, if any, evidence of optimization theory or algorithms that treat the class of problems where the uncertainties are both in the objective function and the constraint. The goal of this proposal is to bridge this gap. The significance of the proposed research is twofold: (1) It critically expands the domain of optimization to include a new class of problems a with time-varying nature by developing their background theory; (2) It pioneers some new computational models for solving time-varying problems, and especially those currently arising in data classification, signal processing, and network resource allocations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research has the potential to impact the design and operation of autonomous engineering systems. It also has the potential to make contribution to the study of information processing systems that support human-centric operations and decisions. Some of the engineered systems that could benefit include: surveillance and monitory systems for tracking environmental and other changes, data management systems (including data analysis, information retrieval, decision support), and wireless communication systems, e.g. mobile phone networks. The proposed research could increase the stability, reliability, and the performance of these systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The outcomes of this work include the development of a basic framework, solution concepts and tools to address the decision problems that are made in face of uncertain changes over time. The methodologies developed in this project are capable of tracking optimal solutions with quantifiable performance guarantees. The proposed techniques are particularly relevant to detection, estimation and image processing in sensor networks. The main findings of this work are the following developments: (1) Novel framework and solution concepts for problems that vary with time, and the techniques developed to track the changes in the problem and its solutions. The algorithms have low complexity and explicit error-bounds for sub-optimality at every iteration;  (2) Performance guarantees that allow us to access the quality of algorithmic designs which include tracking within a desired user specified accuracy persistently or with high probability; (3) Algorithms for solving problems that vary with time and the changes in the problem are not known in advance. These algorithms include tracking module that allows them to estimate the changes in the problem data.  (4)  Reduced complexity algorithm for determining the clusters in large data sets with unknown number of clusters. The algorithm uses randomization to generate an auxiliary problem of a reduced size that is independent of the actual size of the feature vectors associated with the data.
