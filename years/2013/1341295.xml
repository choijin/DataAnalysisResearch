<AbstractNarration>involved in fields including archaeology, hydrology, climatology, ecology, and global change science. This workshop-- AmeriDendro 2013, to be held in Tucson, Arizona, in May 2013-- focuses on dendrochronology in both North and South America, and will cover more than a dozen topics ranging from tree-ring formation, fire ecology, and dendroclimatology to dendrogeomorphology, New- and Old-World archaeology, and tree-ring networks. The meeting will be hosted by the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona. Over 200 scientists from North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa will present results of their research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding supports student participation in the workshop. Students will gain valuable academic and professional experience, including networking with international colleagues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ BACKGROUND  The rapidly growing field of dendrochronology as applied to archaeology, hydrology, climatology, ecology, and global change science now has hundreds of practitioners worldwide.  Some of the results of their scientific investigations are presented at geophysical, geological, ecological and meteorological meetings to which results are most relevant, but dendrochronology-centered meetings have also been held around the world for over 30 years.  The international tree-ring conferences typically take place approximately every 4 years, between which regional meetings are held in Europe, Asia and the Americas accommodate the growing needs for scientific interaction and exchange in this rapidly expanding field and to expand opportunities for more scientists to participate in the meetings.                The Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research hosted the Second American Dendrochronology Conference, ("AmeriDendro 2013") in Tucson, May 13-17, 2013.  This meeting focused on dendrochronology in both North and South America, and covered more than a dozen topics ranging from tree-ring formation, fire ecology, and dendroclimatology to dendrogeomorphology, New- and Old-World archaeology, and tree-ring networks.  The meeting also offered an opportunity for attendees to visit our recently-completed Bannister Tree-Ring Building.  This is the largest building and tree-ring complex in the world devoted solely to tree-ring studies, belonging to the oldest and first tree-ring department in the world, which just celebrated its 75th anniversary.  The success of this meeting was enhanced by welcoming a good mix of established researchers and students, the attendance of the latter being promoted by NSF funds to help defray registration costs.     PRIMARY OUTCOMES  Sixty students received funding for their registration from the grant, the amounts of which varied from $120 to $171 with the higher values related to student who had to address issues of currency conversion service costs.  The NSF funds supported 34 US participants (8 of whom were on U of AZ payroll as TAs/RAs so 26% indirect costs were charged), and 26 foreign participants (17 from Canada, 3 from Argentina, 2 from Switzerland, and 1 each from China, Germany, Poland and Spain).     BROADER IMPACTS  Tree-Ring studies are highly interdisciplinary so the fields of archaeology, hydrology, climatology, ecology and earth sciences were represented among the presentations and sessions at AmeriDendro.  The student participants supported by the NSF funding contributed to knowledge acquisition in these subfields.  Students learned from the breadth of content conveyed at the meeting, and expanded their understanding of the field.  Additionally, all participants benefited from the presence of the students describing their own research projects, many of which were novel and "cutting-edge".
