<AbstractNarration>Seismic anisotropy is observed in many regions of the deep Earth and is believed to be due to texturing of mantle rock as a result of solid state convection.  Thus observations of seismic anisotropy can be used to interpret the dynamic processes occurring in the Earth's interior.  However, this requires that the relationship between deformation geometry, texture development and seismic anisotropy are well understood for the appropriate mineral phases.  In the upper mantle where deformation mechanisms are well understood, interpretation of seismic anisotropy in terms of mantle flow has been highly successful.  However, in deeper parts of the Earth, little is known about the deformation mechanisms of the major mineral phases such as MgSiO3 perovskite and post-perovskite.  This is largely due to the fact that pressures needed to stabilize these phases are beyond the range of conventional deformation devices.  The diamond anvil cell combined with radial diffraction technique can be used to study deformation and texture development in these phases, but until recently these experiments could only be performed at room temperature.  Since textures can be affected by temperature, it is problematic to extrapolate these results to the deep Earth where temperatures are high.  Recent developments now allow diamond anvil cell deformation experiments to be performed at lower mantle pressures and temperatures.  This project will use this new technique to study texture development and deformation mechanisms in lower mantle mineral phases at high pressure and temperature conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The significance of this project is that it will establish an experimental basis for linking seismic observations to deformation structure in the very deep Earth.  This will lay the groundwork to allow the use of seismic data to map flow patterns in the lowermost mantle.  Understanding the dynamics at the base of the mantle will provide new insight into the mechanics and geometry of mantle convection.  A better understanding of mantle convection, in turn, has implications for plate tectonics, mantle geochemistry, and thermal history of the Earth.  In addition, new technical developments resulting from this project will be available to general users at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and thus will serve the broader scientific community.  Furthermore, the capability to perform high pressure and high temperature deformation studies has application beyond the field of geophysics and will also advance knowledge of material science at extreme conditions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to develop an experimental basis for linking seismic observations to deformation structure in the very deep Earth.  Previous deformation studies of mineral phases relevant to the Earth?s deep interior were by in large performed at high pressure but only room temperature due to technical challenges.  Results of these experiments were problematic to extrapolate to the Earth?s deep interior where material deforms at high pressure and temperature. This grant leveraged new technical developments to perform high pressure and temperature deformation experiments to better simulate deep Earth conditions. Several technical developments were also pursued to improve the reliability and pressure temperature range of deformation devices for extreme conditions.  Data from these experiments helps us to understand the mechanical structure of the Earth's deep interior.  Experimental studies of deformation mechanisms in deep Earth relevant rocks and mineral phases, performed during this grant, allow us to relate seismic observations to mantle flow in the deep Earth. This provides new insight and understanding of the large scale dynamics of mantle convection, which drives plate tectonics and volcanism.  During the course of this grant we discovered that high temperatures change deformation mechanisms in bridgmanite and ferropericlase, the two most abundant phases of the Earth?s lower mantle.   This has important implications for interpretation of the dynamic state of the Earth?s interior.  In collaboration with scientists at the Advanced Light Source of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory we developed and tested a laser heating system for high pressure deformation experiments.  This capability at the Advanced Light Source is now available to the wider scientific community.  This development significantly extends the pressure temperature range available for high pressure and temperature studies of mechanical properties.   This not only impacts the fields of Earth and Planetary Science and Geophysics but also has impacts on Materials Science and engineering of superhard materials that experience extreme conditions. Finally this grant has provided funding to support and train 2 Ph.D. students and has provided research experience for 4 undergraduate students. Work supported by this grant has resulted in 7 publications with one more currently in revision.       Last Modified: 06/29/2018       Submitted by: Lowell Miyagi]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
