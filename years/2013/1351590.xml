<AbstractNarration>The PI intends to study a model for cluster algebras in terms of certain tensor diagrams called webs. This model relates to higher Techmuller theory, specifically to representations of fundamental groups of Riemann surfaces inside special linear group of a three dimensional vector space. This class of cluster algebras allows one to have a conjectured purely combinatorial model for some cluster algebras of infinite mutation type.  The PI also intends to study a generalization of cluster algebras called Laurent phenomenon algebras. In it, the exchange polynomials do not necessarily have to be binomial. The examples of such structures appear for example in the study of electrical networks, and in the study of hyperbolic metrics on non-orientable surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is rooted in two areas of mathematics: representation theory and combinatorics. Representation theory is an important area that is fundamental for the study of quantum mechanics and particle physics. Cluster algebras provide a new approach to representation theory and related disciplines, and have found their application in string theory and quantum gravity. The PI's research focuses on cluster algebras that lie just beyond the current frontier of our understanding (the so called infinite mutation type). Another part of the proposed research focuses on a generalization of cluster algebras, called Laurent phenomenon algebras. The educational part of the proposal pertains to creating a summer undergraduate research  program (URE) for international students which would run parallel to the already existing summer REU in combinatorics at University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ While funded by the grant, the PI completed more than 20 research papers, trained 3 graduate students and 4 postdocs, and published 2 volumes with AMS. The significant scientific outcomes of the project are as follows.  - Deeper integration of algebraic combinatorics with mathematical physics, with specific emphasis on physics of integrability. The significance lies in an unusual combination of the two areas: deeply theoretical area of combinatorics, and rooted in nature mathematical physics. The two areas have certainly interacted before the PI's research, however the results funded by the grant allowed for making the connection more robust in several directions. The specific developments in this direction include: important classification results in the study of phenomena studied by Zamolodchikov and their generalizations; integration of singularity confinement integrability test into combinatorial areas of study such as toggling and T-systems; study of discrete solitons and solution to their scattering problem.   - Discovery of connection between so called quiver mutations arising in the theory of cluster algebras and a classical subject of singularities of plane curves.  - Using combinatorics of plabic graphs to connect modern ABJM theory in string theory to the classical Ising model, those results have been already incorporated by physicists into their work.  - Developing affine type A Kazhdan-Lusztig theory with combinatorial tools of affine matrix-ball construction and affine dual equivalence graphs. Kazhdan-Lusztig theory is known to be a very deep and perhaps intractable part of modern algebra, the PI's work sheds light and presents in a lucid combinatorial form certain important aspects of it.   The results of the project have been presented at numerous seminars and conferences, with at least 15 talks by the PI between 2015 and today (Spring 2019), and numerous further talks by the PI's coauthors.
