<AbstractNarration>This EAGER proposal engages practitioner perspectives in improving research/evaluation capacity. This project conducts exploratory research to build on a previously developed conceptual framework and a cyberinfrastructure tool (Netway) and designs and tests  a protocol for research/practice integration. Twenty STEM education projects will be examined and new measures for engaging researchers and pracitioners will be developed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The specific aim of this project was to conduct exploratory research to extend both methodological and substantive knowledge that will enhance the integration of research and practice by using practitioner generated program descriptions and models as a mediating mechanism for receiving researcher input on program theory and identification of relevant research. Practitioners are increasingly expected to implement "research-based" programming, while researchers are increasingly expected to have a "broader impact." Yet, despite these apparently complementary needs, effective connections between researchers and practitioners are difficult to create and maintain. This method could provide for more effective engagement of and communication between practitioners and researchers of STEM outreach.  Our method piloted here was to present practitioner developed program descriptions and models to researchers in order to have the researchers identify research related to the program (see images of Example Program Information, and Example Program Pathway Model). This approach shows promise as a method to encourage the integration of research into practice. We coined this approach "Model-Mediated Collaboration". Measure Development: Previous research by others in the field identified the barriers to research-practice integration, factors that support research-practice integration, and the fundamentally different perspectives with which researchers and practitioners approach their work, but we found nothing that addressed the understanding each has of the other?s work, and their attitudes towards the other, much less any study of interventions actually changing (preferably, improving) knowledge and attitudes. We developed and validated a parallel pair of measures looking at attitudes and knowledge of researchers and practitioners towards each other.  The publication for this measure is in draft form, and was presented at the American Evaluation Association annual conference in November 2015. Using the knowledge and attitude measures developed, we determined that practitioners significantly increased in overall knowledge of research and researchers related to their area of programing; more specifically in 1) awareness of research related to their program outcomes, 2) understanding how to read a research article, and 3) knowing of research-based measurement tools relevant to the program. In addition, they said that this knowledge was moderately to very useful, and the process was not very difficult.

Their purpose in participating, however, was to be helpful to practitioners, and they succeeded in that. One interesting result was in the diversity of literature identified by researchers reviewing the same programs.  Twenty-eight researchers identified 353 resources for 10 programs (each researcher reviewed only one program), and there were only three instances where two researchers reviewing the same program identified the same article as a resource.  Additionally, we had conducted our own Web of Science literature reviews for each of those programs, and identified 549 publications, and the overlap between literature recommended by Researchers and our literature identified in a search on Web of Science was minimal &ndash; only 19 references were in both lists.
