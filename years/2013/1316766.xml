<AbstractNarration>This action funds Stephanie Raven Ann Hargrove of University of Tennessee, Knoxville to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Beijing Jiaotong University in Beijing, China.  The project title is "Traffic Enforcement in China using License Plate Recognition Technology." The host scientist is Dr. Xuedong Yan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;China has been in constant growth for many years, including the rapid rise of vehicle ownership, urban road development and construction of new roadways.  Though China is attempting to curb expansion by limiting vehicle ownership, this rapid growth of China's transportation system and users requires rapid responses to road safety problems including the implementation of programs, development of technology and increase of manpower to respond. This research aims to examine China's existing enforcement programs and optimize speed enforcement and urban vehicle tracking using license plate recognition (LPR) technology. The overall goal is to incorporate the findings of past research and advance the future use of LPR technology as a highly-accurate and dependable enforcement tool world-wide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the Fellow will present the research findings on the University of Tennessee campus and will continue mentoring undergraduates and high school students in the importance of science, technology and transportation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research was the opportunity to have a better understanding of factors that may effect an automobile driver's decision making when it comes to complying to driving restrictions in Beijing, China.  The driving restrictions are implemented by limiting the driver's ability to drive one day a week based on the last digit of their vehicle's license plate.  It's important to understand what causes a driver to risk receiving a fine by driving on their restricted day.  The factors examined included air quality, weather, and location in relation to the vicinity of the city center.  Another observance that was examined in the research, was the number of drivers that removed their license plates to avoid receiving a fine. Other research has been completed to examine the driving restrictions in Beijing, but this is the first to examine the factors that play a role in the decision making of drivers on whether to be compliant.    This project aides in the education of  transportation professionals and policy makers to allow them a better understanding of factors that effect driver compliance and how to improve current restriction policies. In effort to broadcast the results, this research is being submitted to international transportation journals and conferences.
