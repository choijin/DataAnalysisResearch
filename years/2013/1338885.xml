<AbstractNarration>This project will examine how energy is processed by collisional energy transfer through rotational and vibrational states of water and other small organic molecules.  These fundamental processes, which are at the core of many chemical phenomena, are very poorly understood and are not amenable to simple experimental analysis.  In collaboration with a leading computational expert at the University of Pierre and Marie Curie in Paris, France, the researchers will conduct benchmark calculations for these processes.  The data from this study has the potential to have a profound impact on the fields of astrophysics and astrochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding energy transfer in a molecule as important as water will provide a clearer understanding of how energy is processed, in both terrestrial and astrophysical environments.  This study has the potential to yield insight on the early history of the Earth?s atmosphere and make a significant contribution to global databases of astrophysics and astrochemistry.  The international collaboration will offer the postdoc involved in the study outstanding access to the facilities and expertise of leading scientists in the field, and ensure that the US postdoc can participate in a globally competitive workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this project was to establish international collaboration between the group of Dr. Babikov at Marquette University, USA, and the group of Dr. Dubernet at Observatory of Paris, France, in order to foster (i) development of the mixed quantum/classical theory for inelastic scattering and (ii) applications of this method to astrochemically relevant processes, such as rotationally-inelastic collisions of water molecules with helium atoms. To achieve these goals, Dr. Ivanov, a postdoc in Dr. Babikov's group, visited the Observatory in the summer and fall of 2013 (supported by French side). Next, Mr. Semenov, a graduate student in Dr. Babikov's group, visited the Observatory in the summer of 2014 (supported by this grant). Finally, Dr Babikov, the PI on this grant, visited the Observatory in July of 2014. The formalism of the mixed quantum/classical theory was worked out, a parallel computer code was written, and extensive calculations of inelastic scattering in a broad range of collision energies were carried out. The results were compared against the full-quantum data of the foreign collaborator, Dr. Dubernet, and excellent agreement was obtained. Major results of this work were published in two papers in the Journal of Chemical Physics and presented at the MOLEC 2014 conference. It was demonstrated that the mixed quantum/classical theory for inelastic scattering is an accurate and computationally affordable approach to molecular processes important in astrophysics.
