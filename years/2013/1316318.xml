<AbstractNarration>This project will explore whether intensive livestock production practices contribute to the evolution and increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus, including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Using field studies and genetic typing of Staphylococcus bacteria, principles for the emergence and dissemination of livestock-associated MRSA will be established, and models will be developed to explore transmission between food animal production systems, the environment, workers and communities. This project will build on existing partnerships with community groups in rural North Carolina and establish protocols and databases important for advancement of global scientific knowledge about MRSA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Models developed during this research will be useful to estimate the probability of transfer of MRSA from a farm into surrounding ecosystems and communities based on operational practices (e.g., antibiotic use, animal density, waste management systems). Outputs from the models could also help identify the most effective interventions to reduce transfer of MRSA into ecosystems and communities. Ultimately, these results will help evaluate whether modern livestock production systems affect the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and will provide important new insights into management practices that could impact the ecology of MRSA and other antibiotic resistant bacteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a critical and growing threat to global health. This work advances our understanding of the ecology of antimicrobial resistance using a one health framework that recognizes that resistance can be shared among humans, animals, and the environment. Using eastern NC as a model system, this project evaluated how intensive livestock production affects the disease ecology of antibiotic resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, including methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA), in one of the densest areas of swine production in the world. Our team was one of the first to report carriage of antibiotic resistant ST398, a livestock-associated strain of <em>S. aureus</em>, in farm workers in the United States. We have since documented other strains of antibiotic resistant <em>S. aureus</em> including ST9 that are shared between pigs and people in the United States. Our longitudinal studies have shown that workers who carry these bacteria tend to be persistent carriers even during times away from work, and that nasal carriage can be a risk factor for skin and soft tissue infections. Our studies have also shown carriage of livestock-associated, antibiotic resistant bacteria among children of farm workers and among community members who live near commercial hog operations. Based on these results, we studied routes of environmental transport for these antibiotic resistant bacteria and cascading ecological impacts. We have documented the presence of multidrug resistant <em>S. aureus </em>in surface waters adjacent to fields where swine lagoon waste is sprayed and in air samples collected outside of confinement barns. A pilot study of household surfaces also showed occurrence of livestock-associated <em>S. aureus</em> in homes including touch sites and non-touch sites such as the top of refrigerators. Probabilistic and spatial/temporal modeling shows that proximity to commercial hog operations and other exposure variables, e.g. weighting variables to account for the number and size of animals in nearby operations, is associated with contamination of environmental media, household surfaces, and people. We are also studying the evolutionary history of the strains circulating in the United States, and have identified mechanisms by which bacteria are able to jump among human and animal hosts.
