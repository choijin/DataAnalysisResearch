<AbstractNarration>This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity project from Utah State University (USU) is designed to move the unique properties of spider silk from the laboratory to the marketplace. Spider silks exhibit excellent strength and toughness simultaneously, a feat unachievable in most synthetic structural materials, and it has a thermal conductivity equivalent to copper. At USU, recombinant silks closely mimicking natural spider silk sequences have been developed and synthesized. The discovery and early development of spider silk?s properties has led to the current point of joint technology-oriented research with business and industry partners. Three industry partners and one non-profit collaborator all have potential of developing spider silk products. This project will produce bio-inspired fibers with materials properties specifically appropriate for each of the partnering companies? possible product prototypes. This research will combine expertise and resources to make it possible to move spider silk technology toward products in three distinct areas: 1) biomedical applications, in particular micro-fine sutures for eye and nerve surgery; 2) composite materials from synthetic spider silk fibers; and 3) media for microbial fermentation and synthetic feed for silkworms designed to augment typical materials for production of the unique proteins.  In addition, the unique thermal transfer properties of spider silk will be explored to assess its use in a variety of applications. The research will focus on which synthetic spider silks will be the best for the different possible uses, how to scale-up production of those spider silk proteins to levels that can be commercialized, and how to incorporate these fibers into the companies? prospective prototypes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the research lie in the potential of the partnership to develop the products and techniques described above that will open up new markets due to the unique properties of these materials, which cannot currently be matched by any other materials.   The new products envisioned would substantially increase the revenue for the partner companies, open up new product lines, and likely lead to increased jobs for them and downstream businesses. The companies will directly gain new technical skills such as electrospinning, fiber testing, methods for handling unique fibers, and testing methods for new feed media. In return, the Lewis Laboratory at USU will gain experience in composite material design and manufacture, 3D printing, rapid prototyping techniques, and methods for media analyses. Both the companies and the USU laboratory will gain access to unique instrumentation aiding both academe and industry in the future development of products from these unique materials.  Also, importantly the development of media and diets to improve the production of the silk fibers will be crucial for production to meet expected demand. These partnerships can also lead to the use of spider silk in additional products in other companies. In addition to the research scientists participating in this project, students involved in this project will also gain valuable experience working with industry partners and with company scientists not only in the research, but also in the planning and design phases. Students will also have opportunities to present on their research and work with the PI in outreach efforts to give several presentations and tours on spiders and spider silk to K-12 students. The project will also provide hands-on workshops for the Engineering State conference for high school students with a particular goal of recruiting women and Hispanic students. This research area has continued to produce enthusiastic media attention for both the PI?s research and sponsors in the U.S. and internationally from multiple television networks.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners at the inception of the project are Utah State University (Synthetic Bioproducts Institute and United Science Technology Advanced Research(USTAR) and three primary small technology businesses: Caisson Laboratories, Inc.(Logan, UT); Iso Nano International, LLC (San Diego, CA); Zigg Design, LLC(Logan, UT; and a non-profit collaborator, Space Dynamics Laboratory(Logan, UT).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Specific objectives of this grant include:  1) increase recombinant spider silk protein (rSSP) production in bacteria  2) improve spinning process for rSSPs to increase tensile strength  3) improve mechanical properties of transgenic silkworm silk  4) develop new rSSP based non-fiber materials  5) continue and develop new collaborations with our corporate partners  Major Accomplishments are:  1) We increased the production of spider silk protein (rSSP) to as high as 3.6g of protein per liter of bacterial culture.  This was the result of both increases in bacteria produced per L and the amount of protein produced per bacteria.  The rSSP purification protocol has been streamlined with a substantial reduction in cost.  The overall process has been scaled to 1000L.  2) Improvements in the spinning process have been incremental focusing on determining the best combinations of protein concentration, stretch ratios and stretch baths.  Two substantial accomplishments were the development of a spinning head that can produce 8 simultaneous fibers and production of fibers that are as strong as 6/0 commercial suture material.   3) The research effort in the transgenic silkworm arena has been focused on increasing the level of spider silk protein in the cocoon fibers. This has led to an increase to 10-15% spider silk protein in the cocoons of these transgenic silkworms.  It has also led to tensile strengths approaching those of spider silk dragline fibers.  4) Non-fiber based spider silk protein materials have become a major focus in the laboratory during the grant period.  These include: films, coatings, hydro- and lyo-gels, sponges and adhesives.  The key to this entire line of research was the discovery that a combination of heat and pressure, using a microwave oven, would solubilize the spider silk proteins in water.  We have found that with this method we can include a variety of additives such as antibiotics, growth factors and anti-clotting agents to create a wide variety of possible applications and products.  Two papers have been published on these topics, another is submitted with revisions and fourth is in preparation.   5) Collaborative efforts with both BST and Caisson Labs were not as successful as had hoped.  However, several new corporate partners have come on board and are particularly interested in the non-fiber uses for rSSPs as well as fibers. Fiber uses are currently focused on micro-sutures and fibers for composite materials.  The non-fiber uses are for dental implants, coatings for catheters and other medical implants and adhesives.  6)  Three papers have been published with three more in various stages of writing.  One patent has been issued and two others are be readied for submission.            Last Modified: 10/12/2016       Submitted by: Randolph V Lewis]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
