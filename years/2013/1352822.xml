<AbstractNarration>This workshop will bring together scientists, philosophers, administrators, community organizers, policy makers, and legislators to examine civic science. The main goals are to delineate what civic science is, to specify how it differs from citizen science and activist street science, and to generate best practices for civic science. The proposers also hope to develop strategies to impact policy discussions and professional education, and to make some headway towards shifting the national conversation about the role of science in society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work should help foster the collective capacities of scientists and non-scientists to come together to solve real-world problems in a democratic society.  A white paper will be produced</AbstractNarration>

The piece, co-authored with Margaret Finders, chair of the Department of Education at Augsburg College, includes a section on the interdisciplinary field of civic studies/civic agency.    Augsburg College organized a symposium on May 20, "New Approaches to Student Success: Fostering Cognitive Development through Civic Agency," continuing the dialogue on civic science and how to foster agency in young children.   One of the key items that was prepared in advance of the workshop was a white paper entitled: "A call to action: Civic science and the grand challenges of the 21st century."
