<AbstractNarration>1343468 &lt;br/&gt;Hatcliff, John M. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In previous NSF FDA SIR work, the PIs conducted an initial investigation of how the SAE standard Architecture and Analysis Design Language (AADL) might be applied to specify the architecture, interfaces, and high-level behavior of ICE apps and ICE devices. Recently, researchers at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) developed an Error Modeling framework (EMv2) for AADL that enables modeling of different types of faults, fault behavior of individual system components, modeling of fault propagation affecting related components, as well as specification of fault tolerance strategies expected in the system architectures. In this proposal the PIs will demonstrate how AADL EMv2 can provide semi-automated support of safety / risk analysis activities that can be used in regulatory submissions for ICE apps and devices. They will (a) define libraries of common errors / faults relevant to MDCF apps and devices, (b) illustrate how information needed to drive common risk analysis techniques such as Fault Tree Analysis, Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis, and Functional Hazard Analysis can be formalized in terms of AADL architecture annotated with Error Model information, (c) illustrate the benefits of formal interface specifications of device behavior and conditions under which errors may arise, be propagated, and be mitigated and (d) develop recommendations for how the artifacts resulting from these activities might be presented as part of regulatory submissions for ICE components.</AbstractNarration>

Initial integration efforts in industry are focusing on streaming device data into electronic health records and integrating information from multiple devices into single customizable displays. However, there are numerous clinical motivations for moving beyond this to consider frameworks that coordinate the actions of groups of cooperating devices to realize "closed loop" scenarios, automate clinical workflows bycontrolling networked devices as they perform cooperative tasks, and even automatically construct and execute patient treatments.   To provide a research foundation for investigating the engineering and verification of such systems, we have developed an open source Medical Device Coordination Framework (MDCF). The MDCF includes (a) middleware for integrating medical devices and EHRs and (b) a model-based development environment that could be used to quickly implement medical device coordination applications ("apps" for short), enabling a "systems of systems" paradigm for medical devices.
