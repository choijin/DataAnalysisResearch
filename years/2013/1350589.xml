<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program research project is to explore the causes of systems engineering failures in large projects in a three-step process: (1) Detailed analysis of past system engineering failures to identify deficiencies in systems engineering; (2) Investigations of systems engineering in practice at industry and government organizations to challenge or validate these findings; and (3) Use of these findings to improve systems engineering curricula and delivery methods.  Despite best efforts, projects fail in ways that systems engineering is intended to prevent.  The rate of failures shows no sign of decreasing. Therefore, current approaches based on methods, tools and processes are not working. We need to do more than propose better processes -- we need a foundational basis that is informative and can be adapted to a broad range of circumstances and industries, such as mining, oil and gas, chemical, and aerospace, to guide design and operational choices that prevent or mitigate failures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will contribute to reducing failures of engineering projects and form the basis for sound, data-informed improvments to the fundamentals of systems engineering. The educational component of this work combines research-based course improvements with rigorous assessments of actual student learning (as opposed to self-reported data) across a longitudinal set of courses. The findings will be used to improve the systems engineering curricula and delivery methods.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><h1><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal;">Failures in systems engineering have serious consequences. In the worst case they lead to loss of life. They can also lead to expensive program cancellations and recalls. Current approaches to reducing the occurrence of these failures often don?t work, and as we develop increasingly complex systems we can expect that more, and more costly, failures will occur. The goal of this project is to contribute to the fundamental understanding of why failures occur in systems engineering. More specifically, it addresses three objectives: (1) Detailed analysis of past system engineering failures to identify deficiencies in the foundational concepts of systems engineering; (2) Investigations of systems engineering in practice at several industry and government organizations to challenge or validate these findings; and (3) Use of these findings to improve systems engineering curricula and delivery methods.</span></h1> <p>We compiled a set of 62 case studies on systems engineering failure. We then modified an existing accident model and used it to analyze the case studies in a consistent manner. This approach allowed us to identify the differences and similarities in failure causation for accidents and project failures. We found 23 common reasons of failures and 16 remedial actions. We also found that different actors tended to make similar mistakes (e.g., both maintenance technicians and design engineers kept poor records) and that these actors made similar mistakes on different ?objects? (e.g., designers kept poor records of the design process as well as of the test process). We used this to construct and publish a web-based interactive network online, shown in different configurations below and accessible (https://engineering.purdue.edu/VRSS/research/force-graph/index_html).

We conducted semi structured interviews and distributed paper surveys to representatives from the companies to determine how the problems they encountered compared to the problems we identified that led to systems engineering failures.

We referred to systems engineering reference documents, to previously identified common causes of systems engineering failures, and to interviews we conducted with systems engineers. We obtained a set of 43 needed learning outcomes, that span the systems engineering process, from the identification of requirements to the deployment of the solution. We then investigated what systems engineering curricula are currently teaching, by identifying US universities which offer systems engineering programs at the undergraduate level and looking at the syllabi of their required courses. We used the published course learning outcomes to estimate what is currently being taught to undergraduate systems engineering students. We compared the set of industry-based learning outcomes to the current learning outcomes to assess whether systems engineering programs are teaching students what they need to know. The needed outcomes generation process revealed a lack of consensus on the duties of a systems engineer across the community. In terms of educational efforts, programs we examined so far seem to cover the outcomes that all our sources agree are needed.&nbsp;</p> <p>Additionally, we used these findings to refine our survey and develop questions that test how well students can recognize common factors leading to systems engineering failures and which needed learning outcomes they have learned.
