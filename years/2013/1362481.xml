<AbstractNarration>In this award, the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division supports Professor Thomas Meyer of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for the research on "Proton Coupled Electron Transfer (PCET). Redox Cofactors, Catalysis, and Photochemistry." PCET is a chemical process that involves movement of a negatively charged electron that is facilitated by the simultaneous transfer of a positively charged hydrogen ion. This process plays an important role in both chemical and biological systems. However, its implications for catalysis, energy conversion, and for biological function and disease are only beginning to be fully appreciated. In fact, a full understanding of the elementary processes in PCET has not been achieved. This project explores the details of the PCET mechanisms that help dictate biological function and involves both experimental and theoretical studies. In addition, PCET is being extended toward the preparation of valuable organic chemicals. Graduate students and postdoctoral research fellows are actively involved in the project as are undergraduate students from "Climate LEAP," a summer program that targets underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on two important themes. One is an investigation of the role of PCET in  key redox cofactors of biology with an eye toward elucidating its role in the larger sweep of enzymatic reactivity. In the other, recently uncovered roles for PCET in excited state chemistry are being extended to map its role in molecular photochemistry, and, potentially, its role in chemical synthesis and energy conversion. In the first, the PCET mechanism will be explored in concert with functional analysis of oxido-reductase protein structures with application of a computational protocol based on the Rosetta energy function. PCET and electron proton transfer (EPT) will be investigated in quinone/hydroquinone interconversion and in the isoalloxazine functional group of flavins and the dihydropyridine/pyridinium functional group of nictotinamides. Investigations on redox cofactors will be extended to modified electrodes to explore PCET/EPT at electrode interfaces with possible applications in analysis and electrocatalysis. Finally, excited state PCET will be extended to H-atom and photoEPT reactivity in solution and on the surfaces of mesoscopic, nanostructured oxide films with an eye toward photoelectrochemical organic synthesis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer  NSF-CHE-0957215  Project Outcomes Report for the Public     In the oxidation of H2Q to Q by a surface-bound Osmium phosphonate transition metal complex oxidant [Os(4,4?-CH2PO3H2bpy)(bpy)2]2+, the rate constants appear to be buffer base dependent. The oxidation is much slower in unbuffered water and accelerated in the presence of strong bases such as phosphate.      Excitation of a hydrogen bonded complex between either of the phenol, quinone and redox-active amino acids with MQ+ result in charge transfer bands that lead to concerted, proton-coupled electron transfer. For these transitions, electron and proton transfer occurs with the optical excitation, ArOH---MQ+ + h&nu; &rarr; ArO.,HMQ.+, as shown by ultrafast transient absorption monitoring and a Mullikan-Hush analysis of the steady-state absorption band.      The redox properties of a surface-bound phosphate flavin derivative (Flavin mononucleotide, FMN) have been investigated on planarFTO and nanoITO electrodes under acidic conditions. On FTO, reversible 2e&minus;/2H+ reduction of FTO|-FMN to FTO|-FMNH2 occurs with pH and a scan rate dependence is expected for a 2e&minus;/2H+ surface-bound couple. The addition of tetramethylbenzoquinone (Me4Q) results in rapid electrocatalyzed reduction to the hydroquinone.      An organic, inexpensive, metal free and environmentally benign flavin-based chromophore photocatalyst that uses molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant was reported. We described the use of a phosphate bearing FMN catalyst on ultra-thin metal oxide surfaces. The procedure enables photo-redox catalysis to on 4-micron films of 10 nm nanoparticles of ZrO2 with 15-20 nm nanoparticles of TiO2 on fluorine-doped tin oxide surfaces (FTO). We also established extended catalyst stabilities for the dye/catalyst (FMN) assemblies for extended periods (~3 hrs) and quantified reactivity.     A cohesive evaluation of the existing data has led to a detailed mechanistic understanding of the events that accrue following excitation of [Ru(bpy)3]2+  in a comprehensive review article.
