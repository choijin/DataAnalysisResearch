<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the&lt;br/&gt;Chemistry Division, Prof. Theodore L. Einstein of University of Maryland and Prof. Ludwig Bartels of&lt;br/&gt;the University of California, Riverside, and their students will use a combination of scanning tunneling&lt;br/&gt;microscopy and methods of statistical mechanics, especially Monte Carlo simulations and lattice-gas&lt;br/&gt;modeling, to understand the formation of large regular self-organized networks of acene-related&lt;br/&gt;molecules on substrates with prominent metallic surface states and the role of the resulting nanoscale&lt;br/&gt;pores in providing boundaries that modify the arrangements and reactions of small adsorbates like CO&lt;br/&gt;therein. With international collaborators they will test theories of modification (from large surfaces) key&lt;br/&gt;reaction rates because of altered entropy of mixing in the confined pores and will study the relation of the&lt;br/&gt;superstructure to the surface state on the close-packed face of the copper substrate and investigate the&lt;br/&gt;corrections to a simple picture of dot-induced pore formation. They will also take advantage of research in&lt;br/&gt;two dimensional (2D) materials dominated by electronic states with many similarities to metallic surface&lt;br/&gt;states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide state of the art modeling and/or laboratory experiences for graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students who will be learning the techniques of scanning probe microscopy and&lt;br/&gt;complementary Monte Carlo simulations and calculations of correlation functions, as well as ab initio&lt;br/&gt;electronic structure calculations to help parameterize the statistical mechanical studies. The project&lt;br/&gt;consists of an exploration of the formation of regular porous superstructures by organic molecules on&lt;br/&gt;substrates with slowly decaying 2D electronic states. The validation of the novel explanation of pore&lt;br/&gt;stabilization by 2D quantum-dot-like states will be pursued. The impact of such states on the distribution&lt;br/&gt;of small adsorbates (especially carbon monoxide) within the pore will be scrutinized. Calculations of&lt;br/&gt;associated parameters will require use of the latest advances in incorporating van der Waals interactions&lt;br/&gt;into density functional theory computations. Through leadership by a theorist experienced in statistical&lt;br/&gt;physics, this project will foster systematic perspective, deeper understanding and faster testing of results&lt;br/&gt;for phase and pattern formation and predictions promising alternative substrates and adsorbates. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed work is expected to have impact on industrial methodologies and society at large by providing&lt;br/&gt;access to large arrays of identical nanoscale cells in which one can do the experimental equivalent of&lt;br/&gt;parallel computation. Control of such structures will allow tuning of cell sizes to select for favorable&lt;br/&gt;configurations and enhance particular reactions, as well as to explore natural fluctuations. The work will&lt;br/&gt;also provide opportunities for educational and outreach activities with proven broad national,&lt;br/&gt;international and societal impact.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[                The central focus of this collaborative grant (and experimental partner grant under Prof. Ludwig Bartels) has been on the regular patterns formed by rod-like organic molecules on surfaces of metals that have atoms packed closely together.  These patterns are ?superlattices,? having a regular structure simply related to that of the metal surface but on a significantly larger scale.  Our principal interest has been on a system forming a honeycomb lattice (like in a beehive or the borders of hexagonal bathroom floor tiles).  The metal surface is of copper, with the atoms packed together like cannon balls.  The superlattice pattern is reminiscent of vintage tinker toys, with sticks connected at round hubs or vertices.  When there is a single stick between vertices, it is natural that the pattern is a highly regular pattern, with each cell of the honeycomb having the same size.  This is the case for most such patterns.  However, in our selected system the single sticks are replaced by several oblique sticks between vertices, so that the sides of the honeycomb cells could be of different lengths.  In analogous systems studied decades ago, it was found that were so many ways to form such irregularities that observing a regular (all cell sides of identical length) array was highly unlikely unless there was some underlying energy property that favored the regular pattern.               The observed regular giant honeycomb structure, with 186 exposed copper atoms per cell, has many potential atoms.  By depositing the same number of other molecules (in our case, carbon monoxide), one can essentially do the equivalent of parallel processing in computer science.  By monitoring the many cells and tabulating the various configurations in each cell, one can perform a statistical average in a single experiment.  One can also examine various chemical reactions, especially of a catalytic nature.  Our Israeli collaborator has predicted sizable changes in the rate constant when the reactants are confined to a limited area.  If different atoms or molecules are deposited into the different cells, the confinement prevents mixing with neighboring cells, enhancing control. Also, when the cells are filled with carbon monoxide, subtle asymmetry forces a characteristic line of mismatch (a domain boundary) with a kink between halves of the cell contents.              Explaining the origin of the regular structure proved challenging.  Based on my earlier work I had suspected that interactions through the substrate was the source.  We estimated the relevant interactions based on their general nature and on the pattern that formed.  With numerical simulations, we could generate tolerable agreement with experiment but with necessary simplifications of the model and with some rather implausible interactions.  An Lithuanian group made different simplifying assumptions.  In both cases the results were far from compelling.  We then sought to explain the patterns from a different viewpoint.  Eventually we found that we could account for the pattern by modeling the electrons in a cell as orbitals in what amounts to a two-dimensional (2D) atoms.  A similar model had been used successfully by a Dutch group for quantum dots.  Indeed, they constructed a periodic table for such 2D atoms.  Making some simplifications to allow feasible calculations, we could account for the pattern by describing the cell as a closed-shell second-row element in such a periodic table.  Detailed calculations showed that there were just enough electrons (from the through-substrate states that were originally thought to mediate the interaction) to populate the closed-shell orbitals in our new picture.  Furthermore, the calculations indicated the regular-shaped hexagonal cells with sides as seen in the experiment were most stable.  This achievement led to publications in several prestigious journals.               We also investigated several related secondary problems. We explored the implications of some novel models of crystal growth: with barriers that hinder attachment to previously deposited atoms and/or with an unconventional growth protocol (in which a small number of atoms are first deposited simultaneously, then temperature is raised so that the atoms can diffuse over the surface).  For analytic simplicity, we treated a one-dimensional model. This method provides a way to better distinguish between nucleation to form islands and aggregation of existing islands.          Also, we scrutinized Austrian experimental results showing curious striking differences in the behavior (in particular, the exponents characterizing growth modes) between early and later times.  We proposed that the unincluded role of hot precursors was essential. (High-temperature incoming molecules typically lose their energy quickly to the substrate, but in some cases--when there is weak thermal contact--the molecule continues ballistically for some distance before cooling and then diffusing as typical.) With this insight we could account for the four traces of data (each at different temperature) and concluded that the later-time state was different from the one that the experimenters had assumed. Also the crossover between the two regimes was smooth rather than dog-legged.       Last Modified: 11/22/2019       Submitted by: Theodore L Einstein]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
