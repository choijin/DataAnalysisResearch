<AbstractNarration>This project consists of processing, analysis, and exploration of field data taken during the Dynamics of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (DYNAMO) field campaign, which took place in the Indian Ocean during the 2011-2012 Fall and Winter seasons.  The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is an envelope of organized convection that propagates from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and constitutes the dominant form of intraseasonal precipitation and atmospheric circulation variability in the tropics. The MJO influences a variety of tropical weather and climate phenomena,including tropical cyclones (affecting hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico), the onset and intraseasonal fluctuations of the monsoons and rainfall over Asia, Australia, Africa, and the Americas, and the onset of El Nino events. Two complete MJO cycles were observed during DYNAMO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data for this project come from a 6-station network of radiosonde (weather balloon) stations which were organized and co-managed by the PI during DYNAMO,  augmented by a number of other Priority Sounding Sites throughout the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans.  The overall goal of the proposal is to use the sounding data, after some additional processing and in concert with other DYNAMO observations, to examine the processes associated with the evolution of atmospheric moisture during the MJO lifecycle.  Preliminary results show that there was a gradual increase in lower to middle tropospheric relative humidity leading up to the initiation of both MJO events, and this project seeks to identify the mechanisms leading to the build-up.  One avenue to address this question is the development of moisture budgets from the sounding data,  another is the use of radar data from the campaign to assess the contribution of clouds of various types to atmospheric moistening.  Additional work will consider the role of the diurnal cycles of sea surface temperature and non-precipitating clouds, and variations in the depth of the atmospheric mixed layer (the layer of the atmosphere in contact with, and strongly influenced by, the underlying sea surface).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite its importance and concerted efforts over several decades, the MJO has not yet been adequately explained, and global atmospheric circulation models have difficulty simulating and predicting it. The research thus has societal broader impacts as it is expected to contribute to improved understanding and prediction of MJO events.  More specifically, the PI will work with modeling centers around the world to enhance MJO prediction, most importantly by providing data products for their use such as large-scale forcing fields for use in numerical simulations of MJO initiation.  The PI notes that all radiosonde data collected through his DYNAMO sub-project will be hosted on several websites, and work funded here would enhance that data through quality control, removal of island effects, resolution of inhomogeneities, etc.  In addition, the project provides funding for a graduate student, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project has been directed toward an improvement in the understanding and prediction of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), a global atmospheric circulation phenomenon named in recognition of its discoverers in the early 1970s.  The research involves the use of atmospheric and ocean observations collected during the international field campaign DYNAMO that was conducted in the Indian Ocean in 2011 and 2012.     The first part of our research effort has involved the collection and quality control of atmospheric sounding observations taken from various islands, atolls, and ships in the Indian Ocean during DYNAMO.  These observations were carried out in part by graduate students from U.S. universities and Asian nations who were deployed to the Indian Ocean to launch weather balloons at the sounding sites.  Once processed, the sounding data were archived and made publicly available at websites at Colorado State University (http://johnson.atmos.colostate.edu/dynamo/products/soundings/) and at the Earth Observing Laboratory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, CO (https://data.eol.ucar.edu/master_list/?project=DYNAMO).  The quality-controlled sounding data have been accessed and used by many investigators worldwide in their research on the MJO and related topics.     One aspect of our research has focused on how the MJO is initiated over the Indian Ocean prior to the time that it then grows and begins to propagate to the east.  The MJO subsequently moves over Indonesia and the Pacific Ocean along the equator and eventually all the way around the world.  As it moves, the MJO has significant impacts on floods, winter storms, and hazardous weather at midlatitudes, indicating the global importance of the MJO.  With respect to its initiation, our research has discovered that the daily heating cycle (the diurnal cycle) over the Indian Ocean plays an important role in the lower-atmosphere moistening that is essential to the growth of the MJO.  In particular, during light-wind conditions, daytime solar radiation heats the upper few meters of the ocean leading to an increase in the sea surface temperature.  As a result of this heating, there is in an afternoon increase in shallow clouds, much like what occurs in the summertime over land.  Idealized modeling studies carried out by our group show that this afternoon development of shallow clouds serves to accelerate the MJO moistening process beyond what is achieved by other processes that have been studied by many groups.  Our new contribution then by this research is that successful prediction of the MJO will careful treatment of the diurnal cycle in both the ocean and atmosphere.     Our research has also elucidated processes involving clouds, precipitation, and deep convective storms in the diurnal cycle of an equatorial east-west band of precipitation stretching across the ocean basins, a phenomenon called the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).  Observations collected during DYNAMO have provided new insight into why the ITCZ tends to strengthen at night and weaken in the daytime.  This research has been recently published.     Another important finding of our project concerns tropical cyclone formation over the Indian Ocean.  Tropical cyclones in this region have major societal impacts, as attested by Cyclone Idai which recently ravaged Mozambique, leading to hundreds of deaths and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of families.  Motivated by observations in DYNAMO, our research has found that the island of Sumatra plays a role in tropical cyclone formation over the Indian Ocean.  Specifically, when flow from an eastward direction impinges on Sumatra, counterrotating circulations, one north and one south of the equator, develop downstream over the Indian Ocean.  These circulations under the right conditions can organize into tropical cyclones.  Using data for a 2.5-year observation period including DYNAMO and another international program, it was found that fully 25% of the tropical cyclones in the Indian Ocean during that period could be traced back to initiating disturbances called lee vortices downstream of Sumatra.  This finding has important implications for the improvement of tropical cyclone prediction in the Indian Ocean basin.
