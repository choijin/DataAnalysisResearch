<AbstractNarration>Although many virtual organizations (VO) are quite effective, not all VO practitioners are effective in each area, and there is no organized body of knowledge or set of ?best practices? among VOs to draw upon for key issues. Therefore centers are likely not as effective as they could be. This proposal involves the creation of an online knowledge exchange.  This Virtual Organization Resources and Toolkits Exchange (VORTEX) would provide leaders of virtual organizations with resources about running virtual organizations and access to relevant organizational scientists. VORTEX is intended to aid in building a community among virtual organization leaders so that they can collaborate, share, and learn with and from each other. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific Objectives of the work include development, evaluation, and improvement of an online Virtual Organization Resources and Toolkits Exchange (VORTEX) environment to aid scientists and engineers to more effectively lead virtual organizations. This type of environment is necessary in order to: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Connect leaders of virtual organizations with appropriate organization scientists; &lt;br/&gt;(2) Provide online educational and reference materials for issues associated with managing virtual organizations; and&lt;br/&gt;(3) Establish a center for leaders of virtual organization to share and collaborate with each other.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objectives of this research involved assessing the existing research on virtual organizations - which is quite a large body of work - and developing appropriate translational materials, while at the same time attempting to move research forward - theoretical work with the postdoctoral researcher, and meta-analysis with the graduate student.  Most of the results from the research involves summarizing findings of the enormous body of research on areas such as virtual organizations, virtual and geographically distributed teams, online and open communities, crowd-based organizing and similar topics in virtual organizations. Further, this includes an incredibly involved (and unforeseen) level of work relating this research to the existing research in non-virtual organizations. To do this we have developed a framework whereby we organized this array of work into four dimensions of work based on the coordination mechanism (platform vs. organizational) and the interaction, or interface, among components &ndash; whether they are tightly or loosely coupled. From these we have four dimensions that we refer to as virtual work teams, agent relationships, managed crowds, and open projects.  These idealized distinctions are helping us to (1) summarize and aggregate findings, and (2) infer distinctions across different bodies of work.  The end goal will involve generating new theory into the coordination of virtual work and the role of technical platforms as coordination mechanisms, as well as additional practitioner guidance based on the literature.  From this research, we have also dug more deeply into platform-centered coordination and how to get both participation and knowledge sharing through platforms.  This is very important for the practice of virtual organizations because, as we move increasingly to virtual coordination, the active engaged participation and in-depth knowledge-based collaboration is increasingly relevant. We are using meta-analyses of online communities for participation and knowledge sharing to gain insight into this issue.  Primary drivers of participation involve identification, commitment, and engagement with a community, and the primary driver of knowledge sharing in an online community is participation, of course, but also social ties and group identification with a community.  Clearly this notion of identification is critical to both participation and knowledge sharing and the meta-analysis unpacks this theoretical relationship.  The UGA team is also continuing to work closely with the UT Austin linked project in creating content for the website*.  In particular, we have worked with the UT Austin team to create the following initial set of "guides" for distributed organizing available on the website:      -        Guide to Structuring Distributed Work      -        Guide to Types of Distributed Organizations      -        Guide to Choosing Distributed Collaboration Technology      -        Guide to Distributed Data Management Plans      -        Guide to Managing a Virtual Meeting      -        Guide to Managing an Online Community      -        Guide to Distributed Knowledge Management      -        Guide to Structuring Distributed Work      -        Guide to Finding Online Conversations About Distributed Science      -        Communicating Impact of Distributed Science 1: Value Propositions      -        Communicating Impact of Distributed Science 2: Measuring Impact     * http://distributedscience.ischool.utexas.edu/       Last Modified: 10/10/2018       Submitted by: Nicholas Berente]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
