<AbstractNarration>Most traditional approaches to computer security assume that information from the system can only be sent through intended output channels, such as network connection, monitor, portable disk drive, etc. Side-channel and covert-channel attacks circumvent these protections by extracting information that is leaked or deliberately sent from the system through unintended signals, such as electromagnetic emanations, power consumption, timing of computational activity, etc. Methods for reducing such information leakage are usually tied to specific hardware and/or specific algorithms, and are very labor intensive. This allows specific fragments of code, such as cryptographic functions, to be relatively safe, but is not feasible for analysis and protection in large codes, such as entire operating systems or web browsers, that also tend to process sensitive information. This project is investigating the relationship between software activity and the resulting side-channel leakage, with the goal of automating software analyses that can discover which data might be leaked and in which parts of the code. These analyses can reveal both covert-channel (intentional) and side-channel (unintentional) leakage vulnerabilities in software, helping programmers focus their efforts on reducing or eliminating these vulnerabilities. In addition to these research components that will help increase national security, the project also includes specific outreach activities, such as building an interactive demonstrator to help educate the public about cyber-security concepts, and visits to local schools to help improve K-12 education and participation of women and minorities in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to enable systematic and quantitative reasoning about the security risks from electromagnetic (EM) signals that are inadvertently emanated by the hardware of a computer system as it runs a software program.  This project has resulted in 1) methods for systematically finding radio-frequency signals that are modulated by (and thus carry information about) program activity, 2) methods for practically measuring the extremely small differences in the signal that result from executing individual instructions (such as addition, multiplication, read from or write to memory, etc) in a processor, 3) methods for efficiently pinpointing the location in the system from which the information-leaking signals are emanated, 3) theoretical models for how the strength of the program-dependent signals is affected by distance and for how much information might possibly be leaked through these signals, and 4) methods that use side channel signals for beneficial purposes, such as identifying performance problems in a program and/or detecting when the program execution has been affected by malicious software (e.g. viruses, worms, etc.).  This project has resulted in much more systematic understanding of the security threats posed by EM emanations, and in the ability to systematically detect and quantify such signals in a way that helps hardware and software designers modify their hardware and/or software to reduce these security threats. Furthermore, this project has helped initiate work on leveraging these emanations for finding performance and security problems during program execution, rather than only treating these emanations as a security problem.  Finally, this project has provided training in inter-disciplinary research for a number of graduate and undergraduate students, and has helped educate the public through a number of news articles and interviews it in traditional media.
