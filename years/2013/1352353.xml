<AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding interesting physical phenomena often requires classifying potentially physical observable solutions as attractive critical points (or semi-stable long-lived orbits) of infinite dimensional dynamical systems through partial differential equation theory and numerical experiments, which provide a rich set of problems that can be accessible at all levels of research and training.  Such solutions and their stability can be studied on long time scales in relation to small scale models for light in optical media in nonlinear Schrodinger and Dirac models, surface waves on a surface tension scale in the gravity-capillary equations, or molecular dynamics in terms of both large scale nonlinear diffusions of crystals through thermodynamic fluctuations as well as Lagrangian mechanics for smaller systems of electrons trapped in various nuclear potentials.  They can also be studied in macroscopic systems such as interaction of surface waves and internal waves in coupled fluids models, vortex formation in fluid flow around biological objects in the Navier-Stokes equations with boundary, and dark matter formation in models from general relativity using Einstein-Scalar Field equations and their reductions as Schr√∂dinger-Poisson models.  In applications that include large systems, complicated nonlinearities, and/or interesting geometric settings, the analysis and numerics can become increasingly difficult.  The quest to understand complexity in partial differential equation models has led to the development of dramatically new analytic and computational techniques to explore questions of symmetry, phase transitions, uniqueness for the attractive states, as well as generalizations of Fourier transform methods using scattering theory, spectral theory and microlocal analysis to understand their stability.  These techniques can be applied for instance on spaces with curvature, boundary, metric singularities or other difficult features such as noise in a sample or trapping due to external potential wells.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will involve research in partial differential equations directly related to optics and electronic structure with relevant boundary conditions and potentials, as well as other equations from fluid dynamics, general relativity and thermodynamic fluctuations on crystal surfaces.  The PI will also work with postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduates on integrated research into models, computation and experiment, especially though collaboration with members of the UNC Fluids Lab and International Mathematics Climate Network.  An important aspect of that training will be to develop graduate courses and undergraduate courses in dynamics and computation to prepare trainees for a variety of careers in science.  From a human resources standpoint, models like those in this proposal provide a large pool of problems that give a strong background in computation and geometry, as well as some applied statistics, which can be used for training purposes in work with researchers of all levels, from undergraduate to postdoctoral, then applied in many scientific fields. In addition, the PI will continue to support the mathematics department role in the University of North Carolina Science Expo to work towards broader outreach goals of making mathematical sciences more accessible to the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This CAREER Award was received by the PI in 2014 and closed out in 2020.  It supported the PIs research in several areas of mathematical physics and geometric analysis, in particular with applications in both fluid and statistical mechanics.  The award supported the research of several graduate students, writing theses on the Dirac equation, modeling capillary waves, stochastic spin ensembles and more, as well as several undergraduate research projects some of which have resulted or will result in high quality publications for the students.  Undergraduate projects inculded the study of viscous waves in cylinders, microfluidic flow through pipes of various cross-sections, and models in crystal surface evolution.  In addition to his own graduate students and postdocs, the PI worked with graduate students and postdocs in many other groups/areas.      Through the time of the award, the PI was able to initiate collaborations in multiple areas, perhaps most fruitfully in material science models related to crystal surface flucutations and in linear/nonlinear models in the growing area of topological physics.   The PI also worked on numerical and analytic methods related to models from Density Functional Theory.  As the award winds down, the PI is working with a group of 4 graduate students on related projects as well as with his first postdoc in the area.  In addition, for multiple years of the award, the PI organized the UNC math department component of the UNC Science Expo, designed at attracting and exciting middle and elementary school students interested in math and science.
