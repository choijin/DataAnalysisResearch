<AbstractNarration>The PI's work is motivated by problems in the theory of automorphic forms and L-functions on higher rank groups. The main topics of research are on restriction theorems, zero free region for Rankin-Selberg L-functions and equidistributions of horospheres on higher rank groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The projects that the PI pursues not only have fundamental theoretical values, but also have important applications.  The research will provide new bridges among analytic number theory, representation theory and ergodic theory.  This introduces interesting subjects for experts in different fields. One would hope the interaction of these three different fields would produce fruitful results in the future.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Finding wide zero free regions for general L-functions  is closely related to one of the biggest open problems in number theory, the generalized Riemann hypothesis, which has vast  applications in number theory. Based on Sarnak's method,  the PI has been trying to find a novel technique. This new technique combines the use of Maass-Selberg relations on two different groups which removes the technical sieve arguments in Sarnak's work.  This work is in the process of writing up.  In a paper with Blomer and Miller, we develop a reciprocity formula for a spectral sum over central  values of L-functions on GL(4) xGL(2). As an application we show that for a self-dual everywhere unramified  cuspidal automorphic representation on GL(4) there exists a self-dual representation on GL(2) such that the Rankin-Selberg convolution doesn't vanish at the central point.  An important ingredient is a ``balanced'' Voronoi summation formula involving Kloosterman sums on both sides, which can also be thought of as the  functional equation of a certain double Dirichlet series involving Kloosterman sums and GL(4) Hecke eigenvalues. This paper has been submitted to a journal.  The PI has given an invited talk on Goldfeld's birthday conference in China related to the first work.  The work also produces thesis problems for PhD students.                   Last Modified: 08/14/2018       Submitted by: Xiaoqing Li]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
