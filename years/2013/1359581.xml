<AbstractNarration>The proposed innovation is for a robust, low-cost positioning and localization system that is suitable for use in non-factory manufacturing environments. The system combines focused-beam sonar sensor information with kinematic/dynamic model estimates of the local platform to provide simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) information. This system is well suited for manufacturing in which GPS is not available, and addresses many of the limitations in current mobile robot positioning systems based on Lidar (Laser Interferometry Detection and Ranging) scanning or vision.  Acoustic-based systems are much more robust in non-factory manufacturing environments but are not commonly used in mobile robot positioning systems because of the wide scan field associated with a single sensor. The proposed innovation will provide local processing capability dedicated to each sensor to collect feature information that can then be incorporated into the overall localization strategy. The proposed device will enhance the mechanization platforms that currently exist with basic positioning capability allowing improved performance by the operator and will open up new capabilities for machine control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this technology can have a significant impact on improving the productivity of workers in non-factory manufacturing environments. Historically, this industry has seen little application of technology that has revolutionized many other industries (factory automation, etc.). Field maintenance, fabrication and assembly has not seen the productivity gains of their factory based cousins. Field workers are less productive, subject to more injuries and have shorter careers. This effort will provide innovations to directly address enhanced productivity tools for these workers. Further, it enhances the productivity of many related developments in robotics intelligent machines for these industries. These tools make non-factory manufacturing safer, more productive, require greater skills, and promote the profession of manufacturing in the US.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   "Advancing precision manufacturing in non-factory environments with low-cost positioning sensor"    A new class of mechanized tools including mobile robots is emerging that hold the promise of bringing significant automation to non-factory environments.  These systems are limited, however, in navigation or automatic operation due to the fact that traditional localization systems do not apply well to the conditions found in these unstructured manufacturing environments.  Therefore, these tools are generally operated in a remote-control fashion that limits their potential for productivity increases.  During the course of this project, the authors applied the Lean Launch Pad process to advance the design of a localization device to operate in the harsh conditions of in-field manufacturing or maintenance tasks, focused on customer needs.  This device can be used on a variety of classical manufacturing mechanization tools such as those sold by companies including Bug-o, Gullco, Koike, Testex or in conjunction with in-field inspection equipment.  This device will significantly enhance these mechanization platforms with basic positioning capability allowing improved performance by the operator and opening up new capabilities for machine control.    The team spent an intensive eight week customer discovery process followed by a more in-depth 16 week customer discovery effort into the how this technology can satisfy key, identified customer needs and corresponding partners for the efforts.  Based on our early customer discovery, three customer segments were identified as key targets for implementation of the proposed technology (see letters of support); power plant managers in charge of production, Field manager for Inspection service providers working on large structures, and a manufacturing lead engineer in charge of welding at a ship or tank fabrication facility.  The prototype is being designed to address the needs of these early customer segments:  Each of these customers perceived significant value in our product, primarily through addressing the pain associated with placing highly skilled labor into hazardous or difficult environments.  The prototype is being designed to address the needs of these three customer segments in a setting that matches their needs.  These settings yield a set of well-defined metrics based on the operating environment and expected performance capabilities.  Based on in depth interviews with over 100 potential customers and follow-up exploration, a series of environment archetypes with associated features were chosen to cover most jobs discussed.  Here, an environmental archetype is defined akin to a customer archetype, with the purpose of describing the minimal performance required to meet a set of value propositions.  From our investigation, the environmental archetypes are:      Primarily steel surfaces with work requirements in horizontal, vertical and inverted positions (All customers)    Confined/Limited Access area (Ships, Power Plants)    Large Unobstructed structures (Large Tanks, Ship Hulls)\    Sections of Piping or tubing (Power plants, Ships, Pipelines)      While some of these could be identified as features, these primarily serve as a base set of capabilities our customers expect to see based on other types of equipment they purchase.      The manufacturing sector has long been an essential component of AmericaÆs economy. In unstructured manufacturing environments, labor is often the highest single cost factor. Historically, this industry has seen little application of technology that has revolutionized many other industries (factory automation, etc.).  Field maintenance, fabrication and assembly have not seen the productivity gains of their factory based cousins. Field workers are less productive, subject to more injuries and have shorter careers.  The net result for the United States is stagnant or slow productivity increases and loss of jobs due to labor cost advantages in other cou...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
