<AbstractNarration>This S-STEM project at Allegheny College is providing scholarships for fourteen undergraduates in the Natural Sciences for four years. Through its support for the education and training of academically talented, financially needy students, the project is helping to meet local and regional employment needs in research and technical fields, as well as serving as a source of lessons learned for other institutions facing similar challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several features of the project's implementation stand out. Eligible students are being selected from a pool of high school applicants based on their interest in STEM fields, academic potential, and financial need. Scholarship students receive academic and cohort support, which builds on the College's existing support structure. Academic support includes a co-advising component by which each student has one of the principal investigators as an academic advisor in addition to one of the full-time professional staff from the academic support office serving as a co-advisor. Scholarship recipients are also participating in a one-week academic enrichment program prior to the start of classes. Cohort support is being structured around a Living and Learning Community (LLC), which includes housing on the same floor of a designated residence hall, regular lunches (biweekly during the first year and monthly thereafter) along with presentations from support offices, career services, science faculty and students, and other personnel. Each student is also having regular contact with the Director and the Assistant Director of Allegheny College's diversity office. These individuals also serve as members of the management team along with the two principal investigators, the director of the academic support center, and the director of financial aid.</AbstractNarration>
