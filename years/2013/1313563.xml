<AbstractNarration>This project involves the design, development and integration of a new active limb sounding method modeled after the successful Global Positioning System (GPS) Radio Occultation (RO) sounding technique.  The difference is that the new method is not constrained to operate with radio frequency sources specifically allocated for GPS applications. Instead, source frequencies in the microwave are chosen relatively close to atmospheric absorption lines in order to maximize detection of single atmospheric constituents, such as water vapor. Both sender and receiver operate on those frequencies.  The operational concept is low Earth orbiting (LEO) satellite platforms flying both transmitter and receiver, each occulting one another.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is called The Active Temperature, Ozone and Moisture Microwave Spectrometer (ATOMMS).  In theory, ATOMMS will profile tropospheric and middle atmosphere water vapor and middle atmosphere ozone to 1-5%, temperature to 0.5K, and geopotential heights to 10-20 m, all with ~200 m vertical resolution, in both clear and cloudy air. This performance will improve significantly with averaging.   ATOMMS is self-calibrating, which eliminates long-term drift.   The success of this project is a necessary step toward space-based LEO ATOMMS measurements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator (PI) is modifying his earlier ATOMMS design by increasing the number of high band tones from 2 to 4, upgrading the instrument electronics and making commensurate changes in the retrieval system. These upgrades will provide the information needed to isolate, quantify and mitigate several recently recognized key sources of error. With 4 high band tones, the PI will be able to investigate and hopefully explain any discrepancies and surprises that are to be expected in a first time measurement demonstration such as this. Specifically, the 4 high band tones will provide the information to (i) isolate and reduce amplitude scintillations due to turbulent fluctuations in the imaginary and real refractivity, (ii) quantify and reduce residual biases left after incomplete removal of ice cloud scattering using only two tones, and (iii) quantify errors in spectroscopy that are otherwise likely to limit the accuracy of ATOMMS-derived profiles. In addition, 4 high band tones will increase the likelihood of acquiring useful measurements even if a tone were to fail during a flight and allow the PI to demonstrate profiling N2O and H3NO and the 18O/16O isotopic ratio of water vapor. Without the information from four channels of high band data in the aircraft to aircraft demonstrations the PI would be unable to quantify several critical errors leaving the assessment of ATOMMS incomplete and its ultimate performance uncertain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATOMMS observations will fulfill crucial needs for atmospheric, climate and geospace scientists, by providing new sources of global, high vertical resolution, highly stable and accurate data important to their research.  The observations will serve mission agencies in weather and chemical weather forecasting and would be a key element in the international Global Climate Observing System (GCOS).  In regard to education and training, several junior scientists, including the co-PI, will help to conduct this research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ ATOMMS Project Outcomes Report  by E.R. Kursinski   ATOMMS is a new atmospheric remote sensing instrument designed to profile the atmosphere from space with unmatched performance as needed to monitor and understand our changing climate, provide observations for forecasting weather, and better understand the key processes at work in the atmosphere in order to improve the atmospheric computer models used to forecast weather and climate. ATOMMS stands for Active Temperature, Ozone and Moisture Microwave Spectrometer. ATOMMS is an active system in that it uses microwave transmitters and receivers (versus passive systems which just use receivers).  ATOMMS will profile atmospheric temperature, pressure, and water vapor with 100 m vertical resolution in both clear and cloudy air with a unique combination of precision, accuracy, vertical resolution and all-weather sampling.  In flight, the profiles will extend from near the surface to approximately 80 km altitude.  ATOMMS will also profile the amount of liquid water in clouds and constrain the raindrop size distribution and rainfall.  It will also profile ozone and turbulence.   To better place ATOMMS in context, the goal of satellite remote sensing of the atmosphere is to profile the atmosphere with the quality that balloons provide but with coverage over the entire globe that only satellites can provide.  Satellites have not yet produced this combination of coverage and balloon-like performance.  Their vertical resolution and precision are generally much poorer than balloons.  Sampling by todayÆs satellites is not truly global because infrared sensors cannot penetrate much into and below clouds, where much of the interesting weather occurs, and passive microwave sensing of the lower atmosphere only works over oceans.  In contrast, ATOMMSÆ vertical resolution is at least an order of magnitude better than passive IR and passive microwave sensors, which are the workhorses of present satellite weather observing systems. Thus, ATOMMS promises something much closer to the precision and vertical resolution of balloons from space, under both clear and cloudy conditions and over both ocean and land.  The accuracy of ATOMMS will surpass that of balloons, achieving a key requirement for monitoring climate.  Because of its anticipated features and performance, NSF funded this ATOMMS project to build a prototype instrument and use it to further develop and assess ATOMMS potential as a future space weather instrument.     Key Outcomes  The ATOMMS instrument prototype that was designed and built consists of a set of transmitters and receivers that probe the 183 GHz water vapor (High Band) and the 22 GHz water vapor absorption line (Low Band).  It was used to make a number of measurements along an 820 m path on the University of Arizona campus and along 5.4 km and 80 km path lengths between mountaintops in Southern Arizona.   Water vapor was detected from the 820 m path measurements in clear conditions that were consistent with an in-situ water vapor sensor to better than 2%.   Measurements were made along the 5.4 km path during heavy rain and clouds that severely attenuated the ATOMMS signals.   However, through the use of a calibration tone close to 200 GHz, ATOMMS was able to separate the water vapor absorption spectrum from the attenuation due to rain and clouds to determine the water vapor to 1%.  This capability to probe through rain and clouds and achieve this level of accuracy is completely unprecedented. By isolating the attenuation just due to the rain, we were able to constrain the range of sizes of the raindrops and estimate the rain rate.  We estimated the cloud liquid water content from the measurements when a cloud was present. Atmospheric turbulence causes the ATOMMS signals to scintillate like the twinkling of a star. These scintillations can limit the accuracy to which the signal attenuation can be measured. We measured the ATOMMS signal scintillations due to turbulence along the...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
