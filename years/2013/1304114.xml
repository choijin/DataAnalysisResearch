<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2013 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Adam Topaz is "Computability in Galois Groups." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of California-Berkeley, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Thomas Scanlon.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On the one hand, Galois theory studies the symmetries of mathematical objects, and anabelian geometry attempts to reconstruct arithmetic/geometric data from such symmetries. On the other hand, model theory studies the combinatorial and geometric aspects of mathematical structures, through the point of view of first-order logic. The project was successfull in providing a new bridge between these two mathematical subjects, which resulted in several publications.  On the Galois-theoretical side, this project studied so-called "nilpotent quotients" of Galois groups. Passing to the nilpotent quotient has the effect of linearizing the data, making it easier to study, but, at the same time, losing some essential information. Nevertheless, the nilpotent context was sufficient for the considerations of the project.   The project gave a new link between such nilpotent quotients of Galois groups and the so-called combinatorial geometry associated to algebraic dependence/independence, in the context of function fields of algebraic varieties. Such combinatorial geometries play a central role in geometric model theory, and the specific ones associated with this project are well-understood from this point of view.  It is likely that this new point of view could lead to further substantial results in the context of anabelian geometry. Furthermore, this new point of view opens up the possibility of several new research directions emanating from both the Galois theoretical, and the model theoretical sides. Because of this, it would be beneficial to have increased interaction between the two subjects in the future.       Last Modified: 11/17/2016       Submitted by: Adam Topaz]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
