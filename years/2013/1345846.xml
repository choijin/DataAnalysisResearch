<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project represents a major advance in battery research, combining the use of large, comprehensive battery datasets with advanced data science techniques and cloud-based software architectures to bring an unprecedented level of analytical capability to the problem of modeling battery performance. Past efforts at developing&amp;#8232;battery performance models have relied upon manufacturers? performance data and limited single-discharge studies. This innovation applies contemporary data science techniques to the analysis of a&amp;#8232;large, normalized set of battery data including raw time-series data and aggregated per-cycle&amp;#8232;performance from many battery cycling tests, as well as "lab notebook" data including cell&amp;#8232;composition, dimensions, test methods, and observations. The result will be the first commercially-available tool for conducting comprehensive, multi-parameter empirical studies of battery performance.&amp;#8232;This unique, data-driven analytical capability will suggest new and promising research paths&amp;#8232;distilled from relationships hidden in the data, and will help to predict battery performance&amp;#8232;and lifetime.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is manifested in its potential to dramatically increase the pace of product innovation&amp;#8232;and improvement in the battery sector. Organizations developing new batteries and those integrating batteries into their products will perform more targeted and effective battery tests, and&amp;#8232;will gain deeper insights from the data more quickly. Furthermore, our predictive analytics&amp;#8232;module will become more effective as the total volume of battery performance data stored in&amp;#8232;the system increases, further accelerating the pace of development. As this innovation is&amp;#8232;applicable to the entire spectrum of battery chemistries and designs, its successful implementation and commercialization will result in improvements in performance and reliability of batteries&amp;#8232;and battery-powered devices across a wide range of applications; from smartphones and tablets, to medical devices, to electric vehicles, and grid-scale energy storage. Broad adoption of&amp;#8232;this software will accelerate the development and deployment of energy storage and alternative energy technologies, promoting economic growth, energy independence, and environmental benefits. Market research suggests a total addressable market of up to $600M per year for this battery&amp;#8232;data platform with advance predictive analytics.</AbstractNarration>

(formerly Subway Labs, Inc.) prototyped a cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) advanced analytics environment for battery testing and performance data. This web-browser-accessible software enables customers to derive much greater value from battery testing data collected during research and development, manufacturing quality control, and product integration by offering the ability to analyze much larger and more complete data sets than previously possible. It also provides powerful tools for building predictive models of battery lifetime, addressing a major pain point in the battery business. In Phase I/IB we also conducted an extensive in-house cycle life study of off-the-shelf rechargeable lithium batteries, and used the results of this study to train and validate preliminary machine learning models to predict battery lifetime across a wide variety of operating conditions.     As part of the NSF SBIR Phase I Awardee program, Voltaiq participated in the Beat-the-Odds bootcamp in order to obtain valuable insight as to the ultimate commercial value and potential of our innovation. Through a series of interviews with battery industry stakeholders we identified the following two pain points that could be addressed by the software developed through this project:  Data bottlenecks limit even basic battery analysis, slowing product development cycles and market penetration of energy storage to support renewable sources of energy. The current state of battery lifetime modeling and failure preduction is inadequate, and leaves companies that market batteries and battery-powered systems and services exposed to excessive product liability risk.        Voltaiq Analytics, our new software module prototyped during Phase I/IB, builds on our initial software module Voltaiq Core. Voltaiq Core automatically synchronizes, normalizes and process battery data from a variety of inputs and stores it in a comprehensive, centralized data repository. The data can then be easily sorted and organized for efficient search. Using the new analytics module prototyped in Phase I/IB of this SBIR, customers can now directly analyze their entire body of data including time-series charge/discharge cycling data, aggregated per-cycle performance and statistics, and unstructured "metadata" including build parameters, and free-text comments.         Research tasks undertaken during Phase I/IB included:   Development of an application programming interface (API) to access the battery datastore for advanced analysis; Implementation of a browser-based user interface (UI) for designing and implementing advanced studies of battery data; and Demonstration of this powerful new analytical capability using a large set of battery data generated in-house on standard battery test equipment owned by Voltaiq.   The results of this project included development of an initial prototype of Voltaiq Analytics, a scripting environment for the Python programming language, exposing the full body of battery performance data to the full suite of available Python numerical computing libraries. Voltaiq analytics can be run from any web browser.     In order to demonstrate the value of Voltaiq Analytics in addressing data bottlenecks across the battery industry, we developed scripts derived from real customer use cases, showing how Voltaiq Analytics facilitates much faster and more complete data analysis than previously possible. These demonstrations included:  Automated extraction of capacitance and equivalent series resistance (ESR) for supercapacitors. This script could extract these values in less than one second per device, compared to the existing spreadsheet-based process which takes an expert analyst 5 minutes per device. For a pilot production plant testing hundreds of devices per week, the time savings alone from using Voltaiq Analytics would be dramatic, and quality control testing could be increased as a result of streamlined data ana...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
