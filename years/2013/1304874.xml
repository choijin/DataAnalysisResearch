<AbstractNarration>This project is to enhance advanced, automated manufacturing and processing education at the College of the Canyons by aligning, expanding, and upgrading three manufacturing technology related programs: Manufacturing Technology, Electromechanical Systems Technology, and Welding (automated robotic and laser). It is based on a comprehensive needs assessment that included review of the following key factors: national and state training needs; emerging economic trends; new technologies and applications; skill gaps and shortages; opportunities for collaboration and leveraging of resources; the needs of students; and the needs of the community. The project features strong industry partnerships; new and upgraded curriculum for three AS degrees and certificates; curriculum development/adaptation for the Fast Track training format; curriculum development for customized incumbent worker training; upgraded laboratory facilities supporting all three programs; improving the K-12 STEM pipeline; work-based learning; outreach and recruitment; student assessment and support; faculty and teacher training; and evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's impacts include: 1) improving the STEM pipeline from high school through community college and to the university level resulting in increased student access to, and success in, STEM majors; 2) integrating upgraded technologies in targeted curricula to foster a qualified manufacturing workforce; and 3) preparing a new generation of engineers and technicians to meet the needs of manufacturing employers for highly skilled workers that are essential for U.S. industry to remain competitive.</AbstractNarration>
