<AbstractNarration>The Southeastern US faces a transition from water abundance to water scarcity due to population growth, economic expansion, and limits on new water supply development. Yet, the Southeast is not prepared for this transition because existing management systems are poorly suited for coping scarcity. Climate change will likely exacerbate this situation, especially if its effects are amplified by urbanization and changing land use. Consequently, Southeast communities must consider a wider range of supply and demand management alternatives. Unfortunately, there is little guidance for how potential solutions can be effectively coordinated. A portfolio approach to integrating a diverse array of water supply assets and demand management measures offers considerable promise, but this approach must consider not only the technical and economic realities of water management, but also the behavior of decision makers. Given that water-related investments have substantial environmental and social implications, improving their effectiveness in the face of growth and climatic uncertainty is a critically important task. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be the first to comprehensively assess and improve methods by which decision makers can design strategies to reconcile their multiple, and often conflicting, objectives (e.g. more conservation vs. lower utility revenues). A simulation-based framework will be used to design adaptive regional portfolios with broad relevance to regions in transition. This framework will combine physical models that analyze how climate change and land use trends impact hydrology with engineering, financial, and behavioral models. This work will also involve close interactions with decision makers, including assessments of their attitudes toward supply and financial risk, how these attitudes impact choices, and tools for mitigating risk. Additionally, the proposed research will contribute a computational platform that can serve as a template for adaptive water management, exposing regional tradeoffs, interdependencies and vulnerabilities. This project will leverage existing relationships with utilities and local governments to develop constructive learning feedbacks between the research team and decision makers, an element that will lead to strategies that are both practical and theoretically sound.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Historically, most regions have evolved as either water scarce or water rich. And, while drier regions continue to face many water resource challenges, another set of challenges has emerged in traditionally water rich regions where a combination of demand growth and climate change have driven increased levels of scarcity. Nowhere is this more evident than the Southeastern U.S. where rapid growth and two unprecedented droughts (2002 and 2007) have made improved water management a priority. Unlike the arid West, however, the Eastern U.S. has followed a very different developmental path, with land use patterns, infrastructure, institutions and even societal attitudes that are ill suited for managing water scarcity. This is a very different foundation for water management than that which exists in water scarce regions, one with a legacy that looms large as these regions seek to transition from a state of water abundance to one of scarcity. Consequently, they need (1) new strategies for designing water management systems to manage short-term scarcity (drought), and (2) long-term supply infrastructure development strategies that consider future uncertainty in climate, land use-land cover and demand growth while meeting multiple objectives related to supply reliability, cost, infrastructure dependence and financial risk.  Developing these strategies requires an understanding of a complex and interdependent set of factors, involving hydrology, engineering and the social sciences.  The research team had expertise in all these areas, with long experience involving academic research and its application, with the latter coming through established relationships with decisionmakers and stakeholders.  The study region was the Upper Neuse and Cape Fear river basins, which encompass the Research Triangle region of North Carolina, an area that exhibits characteristics common to many Southeast regions, including rapid population growth, economic expansion and a water management structure that is unprepared for managing water scarcity.  This research involved a set of interlinked investigations, each with disciplinary and interdisciplinary features, and the primary insights from the research are described below:  The coordinated use of adaptive measures, including conservation activities (e.g., pricing, restrictions) and inter-utility water transfers were shown to significantly reduce demand for new supply infrastructure, and thus the costs and environmental impact of managing drought.  Novel adaptive measures were designed. Highly resolved information on urban water demand was used to design more effective conservation measures (e.g., pricing, use restrictions), while innovative raw water transfer schemes were shown to enable greater flexibility in managing drought. Adaptive measures lower long-term average costs and environmental impact (e.g., fewer reservoirs), but impose financial risks in the form of intermittent, often large, revenue reductions (from drought-motivated conservation) and cost increases (from transfers).   These financial risks can endanger a utility?s ability to meet its budgetary obligations (e.g., repaying debt) and can result in higher costs of borrowing, a critical consideration given that debt service is the single largest expense for most utilities. A survey of utility personnel indicates that this financial risk can lead them to choose more expensive infrastructure solutions with constant costs over less expensive and environmentally benign, but more financially risky, adaptive strategies. Innovative strategies for managing the financial risk of drought can be effective and include drought pricing, cash reserves and novel forms of index insurance. Strategies that jointly manage supply risk and financial risk can lower infrastructure dependence, long-term average costs and environmental impact without sacrificing financial stability. Within a multi-utility regional context, adaptive strategies often involve cooperation between utilities (e.g., transfer agreements), and results reveal that choices made by one utility can strongly impact its neighbors. Adaptive management strategies lower vulnerability to short-term drought, but a key finding is that implementing these strategies also strongly influences long-term decisions on the timing of new supply infrastructure. In making infrastructure planning decisions, it is important to consider deep uncertainties in areas related to changes in climate, land use-land cover and demand growth.  Poor decisions can lead to increased risk of supply shortfall and severe financial disruptions. Cooperative solutions involving multi-utility infrastructure investments and adaptive transfer agreements can significantly mitigate risks associated from deep uncertainties and lead to more robust outcomes over a range of deeply uncertain future scenarios. The benefits of regional cooperation between utilities as they manage uncertainty over long-term planning horizons can be facilitated by both identifying opportunities for compromise, and the careful design of multi-utility infrastructure investments and transfer agreements that spread the risks of uncertainty across multiple utilities. While uncertainties related to climate, land use-land cover and demand growth represent water system design challenges, the results of this research clearly show that the adverse impacts associated with these uncertainties can be effectively mitigated with a combination of short- and long-term management choices. The findings of this research have been communicated to numerous water utilities through workshops and meetings, and are actually being integrated into planning and design decisions by our four partner utilities in the Research Triangle.
