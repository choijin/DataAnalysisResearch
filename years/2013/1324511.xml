<AbstractNarration>This dissertation investigates second language (L2) use of prosody--the "rhythm" and "melody" of sentences--to convey and comprehend Information Structure. In English, contrastive information ("Did Mariana make the apple bread?"-"Mariana made the BANANA bread.") and new information ("What did Mariana make?"-"Mariana made the BANANA bread.") are emphasized with higher pitch and longer duration, whereas old information is deaccented ("Who made the banana bread?"-"Mariana made the banana bread."). Contrastive information and new information are differentiated by tune of pitch: the former with low tone followed by high tone, the latter with high plateau tone. In Tokyo-Japanese, by contrast, presence or absence of pitch indicates word meaning ("a'me" 'rain' vs. "ame" 'candy'), not Information Structure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In light of these differences, this bi-directional study examines whether Target Language prosodic perception is modulated by native language (L1) properties and how L2 learners develop prosodic marking of Information Structure. L1-Japanese learners of English and L1-English learners of Japanese are tested on 3 prosodies--contrastive pitch, regular high pitch, deaccentuation--and their link to Information Structure: (1) a perception task in which naturalness of pitch and duration vis-a-vis information status is rated; (2) a dyadic picture-coloring production task, manipulating  information status of colors and drawing instruments ("Color the dog with the blue spray / blue pen / red pen. Now color the cat with the red pen."); (3) a comprehension task, the listening counterpart to task (2), utilizing eyetracking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first investigation of L2 prosody that systematically manipulates and analyzes prosodic details and tests L2 learners' perception, production, and comprehension in well-controlled, contextualized experiments. Since very little is known about L2 learners' use of prosodic information, the project could serve as an important data source for formulating an L2 acquisition theory of prosody and help set an L2 agenda for higher-level phonological acquisition/processing/teaching.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>English pitch accents signal the information status of discourse referents. Contrastive and new information are accented; given information is often unaccented/null (Bock &amp; Mazzella 1983; Dahan, Tanenhaus &amp; Chambers 2002; Terken &amp; Nooteboom 1987). Furthermore, contrastive information and new information are (often said to be) marked with different pitch accent types?L+H* and H*, respectively (Ito &amp; Speer 2008; Watson Tanenhaus &amp; Gunlogson 2008). In Japanese, new vs. given information is typically differentiated morphosyntactically rather than prosodically; contrastiveness is signaled by pitch range expansion (Ito, Jincho, Minai, Yamane &amp; Mazuka 2012), which is phonetically similar to L+H*. In light of the differences between English and Japanese, this study investigates whether Japanese second language learners (L2ers) of English can acquire three prosodic patterns?L+H*, H*, and deaccentuation?and their link to contrastive, new, and given information status. If, as reported (e.g. Braun &amp; Tagliapietra 2011), native language (L1) prosodic marking of Information Structure plays a dominant role in L2 processing, the L+H*- contrastive mapping should be easier than the H*-new and the null-given mappings for L1-Japanese L2ers of English. We conducted three English experiments with 70 native speakers and 64 L1-Japanese L2ers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Experiment 1, an offline naturalness rating task, examines L2 sensitivity to intonational and durational cues in interpreting English pitch accents. Participants listened to auditory stimuli with various pitch and durational values in three different discourse contexts; for each prosody-discourse pair, they rated the intonational naturalness of the target stimulus. L1-English speakers were able to link null accent to given information and H*/L+H* to new/contrastive information, but no distinction between H* and L+H* emerged. Advanced L2ers were able to associate null accent with given information and L+H* with contrastive information, but they did not link H* to any particular information status. Less advanced L2ers could only map L+H* to contrastive information. L1 results of durational sensitivity were much less robust, which may suggest that L1-English listeners rely more on pitch than duration in determining prosodic prominence (as it relates to Information Structure). The L2 group showed no duration-by-context interaction regardless of proficiency level, suggesting that L1-Japanese L2ers do not make use of duration when detecting English prosodic prominence (and associating it with Information Structure).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In Experiment 2, the production of targeted English pitch accents was recorded during a semi-spontaneous dyadic speaking task. Participants saw a slide that featured colored drawing tools and animals; their task was to give instructions to the confederate (e.g. "Use the green paintbrush to color the cow. Now, use the blue paintbrush to color the dolphin."). The information status of colors and types of drawing instruments was manipulated to create three discourse conditions: both new (e.g. red pen&ndash;blue paintbrush), adjective contrastive (e.g. red paintbrush&ndash;blue paintbrush), and both given (e.g. blue paintbrush&ndash;blue paintbrush). Acoustic analyses revealed that the L1 group used higher pitch for the adjective-contrastive condition than for the new condition which was in turn higher than the pitch in the given condition. These native speakers also produced longer duration of the critical region in the new and adjective-contrastive contexts compared to that in the given context. As for the L2 results, advanced L2ers, but not less advanced ones, used higher pitch and longer duration in both the new and adjective-contrastive conditions than in the given condition, suggesting that they were able to indicate new/contrastive referents vs. given referents prosodically in the production task.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Experiment 3 explores L2ers&rsquo; online integration of English pitch accent cues for identifying discourse referents using the eye-tracking paradigm.

On each trial, they saw a display containing drawing tools and animals; upon hearing the pre-recorded instructions (e.g. "Use the blue paintbrush to color the dolphin. Now, use the green crayon to color the cow."), they clicked on the appropriate drawing tool and animal. In the new&ndash;given session, the pitch-by-discourse interaction was significant for the L1 group, and marginally significant in earlier trials for the L2 group, which turned out to be a facilitative effect of null accent in the given context.
