<AbstractNarration>Network densification - where a multitude of base-stations and access points with overlapping wireless footprints and disparate capabilities pervade the physical domain - is the way forward towards meeting the tremendous demand for mobile data. The main objective of this project is to reevaluate the manner in which wireless networks are engineered and spectrum usage is managed so as to exploit dense access infrastructure. The project is expected to make contributions in three areas: 1) Design, analysis and prototyping of communications and network protocols to enable unprecedented fine grain control over transmissions over shared spectrum without requiring high coordination overheads, by leveraging emerging agile access techniques; 2) Design and analysis of novel, simple and sparse-state algorithms that leverage the large flexibility in such systems to achieve near-optimal resource allocations; 3) Modeling and analysis of extreme dense wireless networks using mean field games to both evaluate the performance of resource sharing between providers in this regime, as well as evaluate economic and policy incentives to deploy a range of contractual structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research activity relies heavily on the development of sound theory and analysis of extremely dense networks, algorithmic development, simulation for large-scale systems and finally prototyping small-scale regimes. The research will serve as a catalyst towards changing traditional wireless networking paradigm, from one where infrastructure points connect to many mobiles, to one where a mobile connects to a large number of infrastructure nodes. The research will be disseminated broadly to researchers, practitioners and policy makers, leveraging in particular, a strong industry focused research center, as well as in efforts reaching out to public high school students, parents and teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Wireless networks have revolutionized human communication in the last several decades.  A key recent development in operation of these networks is densificiation, where a multitude of base-stations and access points may be operating in very close proximity to each other as part of a common network infrastructure.  Such "extremely dense" wireless networks present a landscape of new opportunities, due to the wide range of possible frequency subchannels, base stations and access points, or even providers available for access by users.  However, to fully realize the benefits of such dense networks, new algorithms are needed to drive their operation.  This project undertook several key initiatives in support of this goal.   Intellectual Merit: Our research results revolve around the intersection of three themes: queueing, matching, and learning.  "Queueing" refers to a basic feature of network transmissions: each frequency subchannel of base stations and access points has a finite transmission capacity that needs to be shared among different users, and transmissions may be unreliable; therefore, when a user wants to transmit packet data, those packets may incur delay until successful transmission.  "Matching" refers to the fact that users need to be matched (to frequencies, to base stations/access points, and to platforms).  "Learning" refers to the fact that the states of transmission channels are not perfectly known; and therefore algorithms need to learn as they match users.  Our main contributions are to develop algorithms that learn to match efficiently, accounting for the queueing of their data in the course of transmission.    Broader Impact: We live in an era where matching platforms are revolutionizing all aspects of how we carry out basic business transactions -- e.g., transportation (Uber, Lyft), housing (Airbnb), labor (LinkedIn, Elance-oDesk), etc.  This revolution depends on technological innovation that enables efficient matching in relatively dynamic environments, together with economic innovation that delivers the right incentives in each application.  In some sense, matching in densified wireless networks is an extreme problem in this space, with very fast timescales, spatiotemporal diversity, and potentially many devices to be matched to each other.  As a result, algorithmic innovation in this space is uniquely able to contribute to other disciplines as well: by solving the harder problem, we make similar problems in other domains tractable.  In particular, we expect that our results on methods for matching in dynamic settings are likely to have broad societal impact in some of these other domains as well.
