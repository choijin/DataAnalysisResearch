<AbstractNarration>The REU Site program involves participants in research projects in machine learning techniques and emerging applications, including text analytics and health informatics. Student projects are expected to yield results that will contribute to ubiquitous software-based technologies in innovative ways. The students are introduced to the research topics and helped to obtain in-depth understanding through introductory and on-going presentations. The REU Site program is focusing on training future computer scientists from institutions with limited research opportunities. An emphasis is given to recruiting under-represented minority students into computer science research at an early age. The research experience will encourage these students to be productive researchers in academic and non-academic environments during their future careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU students will be involved in research in machine learning and its applications in diverse and emergent areas such as intelligent software testing, intelligent complier design, health informatics and natural language processing. Students have the opportunity to utilize a combination of theoretical reading, analysis, and research within laboratory environments. The students develop algorithms to solve interesting and timely problems, develop software, perform hands-on research on novel problems, conduct experiments, and gain experience writing scientific papers and in oral presentation of their work in a conference-like setting. More information on this project can be found at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs REU Site website (http://www.cs.uccs.edu/~jkalita/reu.html).</AbstractNarration>
