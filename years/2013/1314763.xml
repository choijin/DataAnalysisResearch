<AbstractNarration>Quantum information science (QIS) is the interdisciplinary field that investigates how to use systems obeying the laws of quantum mechanics to perform information-processing tasks.  This project is focused on a set of questions that lie at the intersection of QIS and the science of making high-precision measurements.  This intersection of QIS and measurement science is now called quantum metrology.  The specific questions to be investigated include how best to deploy physical systems, such as atoms and photons and tiny engineered resonators, to make the best possible measurements of such physical quantities as electric and magnetic fields and gravitational fields and how to use the strange property of quantum entanglement associated with interacting systems to improve such measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PhD students associated with this project will work within the framework of the Center for Quantum Information and Control at the University of New Mexico, which has a proven track record of training PhD students for careers in QIS.  CQuIC students take a sequence of elective courses on QIS topics, are exposed to the interdisciplinary ideas of QIS through a high-level, weekly seminar series and through the weekly CQuIC group meeting, at which papers posted to the e-print server arXiv.org are reviewed and discussed and at which students and postdocs receive intensive training in the art of giving technical talks.  CQuIC provides students the opportunity to participate in research collaborations with six external partnering institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Quantum information science (QIS) is the interdisciplinary field that investigates how to use systems obeying the laws of quantum mechanics to perform information-processing tasks.  Work under this award was focused on how to use quantum resources to make high-precision measurements.   We accomplished a surprising amount under this award.  We focus here on four chief accomplishments.   1.  There had been proposals to use a sort of pre-measurement to select and then use only particularly favorable ways of preparing a quantum system for a high-precision measurement.  The favorable results occur only part of the time, and we showed that this selection never improves on keeping and using all the results.  2.  The quantum method that will be used in the LIGO interferometers to improve the sensitivity for detecting gravitational waves is the use of squeezed light.  We showed that if the main power source for an interferometer is a laser, something that is certainly true in LIGO, then this squeezed-light method is the best quantum method for improving sensitivity.   3.  We developed a way of describing the properties and behavior of a dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC).  Our theoretical description goes beyond the standard, mean-field approach by including what are called two-particle correlations in the BEC.  The goal is to provide a method for controlling the behavior of BECs in metrological and other QIS applications.  4.  We used the techniques of QIS to formulate rigorous quantum bounds on the ability of instruments to measure the value of spacetime parameters, such as a gravitational wave.
