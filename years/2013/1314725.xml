<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project will support a workshop for emerging leaders and mid-career faculty to build support networks and strategize about leadership directions in the emerging research discipline of engineering education.  The workshop builds on a social identity theoretical framework to facilitate membership in a social group, defining the group of emerging leaders in engineering education research, and exploring how differences between groups can be acknowledged and managed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project arises from the potential impact on the engineering education research community, and thus the long term impact the research discipline can have on the STEM workforce.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers by making investments that lead to emerging new fields of engineering, or shifting existing fields.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project, Engineering Education Research (EER) Leaders NetWorkshop ("the NetWorkshop), seeks to bring about positive change in engineering education, in related fields of science education, and, through that, in our world at large. EER is an emerging discipline with a brief history and diverse perspectives as to our purpose, even among our own members. As a consequence, the goals for the EER disciplinary community have largely been surface layer objectives provided by reports and outside groups, e.g. increase the number of students seeking engineering degrees. While we need the surface layer objectives in our portfolio, we also need to have the deeper conversations within the EER community regarding what we want and why we exist. Without the deeper discussion, we have a limited understanding of the real impacts of our field, intended and otherwise.      The major goal of the NetWorkshop were to develop advocates and future leaders for this emerging discipline by focusing on three themes:     Community: building a community of future EER leaders and preparing to include new community members rising in academic leadership ranks     Communication: building skills to "manage up" and work with others at all levels of power     Action: identifying strategies for moving the emerging field forward and supporting rising EER leaders        Through monthly virtual meetings, annual face-to-face meetings, and special conference sessions, the NetWorkshop has established a safe space for our members to have deeply personal discussions about our perceptions of and beliefs about the roots and current state of the EER field, our goals for ourselves as educators and leaders, and ways to affect positive change in engineering and science education.  Intellectual merit: Through these discussions we developed a means by which a virtual community (i.e. one that is separated by distance but that shares common values and beliefs) to safely share our personal experiences in meeting the challenges of being a member and leader of the EER community. We provided resources (speakers, workshops and training materials) for NetWorkshop members to hone our leadership and communication skills through multiple online platforms, emails and workshops.  Broader impacts: We have reached out to a broader cross-section of the science and engineering education research community to share our resources and to seek input on the deeper goals of the EER discipline not only to help us answer the larger questions of how we serve society and empower people. Input from the larger community has also helped us evaluate the meaning, efficacy, and desirability of the objectives that others project onto us.  We will sustain this project beyond the life of the grant through virtual monthly meetings that are organized loosely along the lines of a book club. We have purchased books selected by NetWorkshop members, and we will focus on selected books throughout the year, with different members leading the discussions each month. The discussions will not be limited to the selected books, but the books will serve as a focal point and the basis for sharing our experiences and expanding the resources available to our members.
