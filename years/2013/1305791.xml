<AbstractNarration>Using complementary chemical tracer techniques to elucidate past migration patterns of Pacific open ocean predators&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highly migratory marine predators provide top-down ecological controls and maintain pelagic ecosystem biodiversity.  These predators face uncertain futures due to changing ocean conditions, exploitation of prey resources, and fishing pressure.  Understanding movement patterns is crucial to understanding predator biology and working towards ecosystem management.  This project will combine Fukushima-derived radiocesium, bulk stable isotope analysis, and amino acid-specific stable isotope analysis to generate novel insights into the movements of Pacific bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, sharks, sea turtles, and marine mammals.  The use of these approaches in concert will ground-truth the use of bulk stable isotope analysis for use ad infinitum in ocean systems, allowing for the analysis of changing migration patterns in response to changing ocean conditions in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study is an intersection of ecology, organismal biology, radiochemistry, and physiology.  Training objectives include sampling of pelagic animals in the Pacific, bulk and amino acid-specific stable isotope analysis, gamma spectrometry, and mathematical modeling of Cs cycling in tunas and other large organisms.  Mentors and collaborators include experts in pelagic ecology, metal biogeochemistry and radioanalysis, stable isotope analysis, and mathematical modeling.  Broader impacts include direct use of migration data in fisheries management models that necessitate international cooperation.  This multi-species approach will demonstrate the assimilation and consequent transport of radioactive material.  Public outreach upon data publication will put radiocesium levels in food fish in the context of safety limits.  As such, the impacts of this study are broad and have implications in social, health, economic, environmental, and fisheries policy realms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Daniel Madigan recently completed his Post-Doctoral work supported by an NSF Post-Doctoral Fellowship, entitled "Elucidating retrospective migration patterns of Pacific predators through complementary chemical tracer techniques".  In 2012 Madigan reported, with colleagues Nicholas Fisher and Zosia Baumann, that Pacific bluefin tuna had transported Fukushima-derived radionuclides across the North Pacific Ocean from Japan to California.  The realization that this could function as a tracer of biological migrations formed the basis of the Post-Doctoral work supported by NSF.  Using the above tracer (radiocesium from Fukushima) and analysis of non-radioactive isotopes, Madigan and colleagues have provided new information on fish migrations, contaminants in fish, and pelagic (open ocean) ecology of large predators such as sharks, tunas, and billfish (marlins and swordfish). Key findings include that radiocesium is decreasing in Pacific bluefin tuna since the Fukushima accident; most Pacific bluefin tuna migrate across the ocean at a young age, and populations in the east rely on lower fishing pressure on smaller fish; and many predators of high concern, including sea lions, salmon, tuna in Hawaii, and swordfish, carry no evidence of Fukushima-derived radiocesium.  The "chemical tracer" work extended beyond radioactive and stable isotopes, and Madigan and colleagues also established a new model to evaluate how open ocean fish like tunas and swordfish become so high in mercury (and how other fish, like dolphinfish and skipjack, remain so low).  As a whole, this work has provided new insight into the way contaminants find their way in (and out) of the fish people eat, and have provided new information on the biology of the fish themselves.  The work was highly collaborative, and relied on the experience and expertise of colleagues from NOAA, Stony Brook, Harvard, and Stanford Universities, the University of Hawaii, and collaborations in Japan and Taiwan.  Some of this work was covered by popular media, which was a major goal of the researchers: make their findings available to a concerned public.  Their work strengthens the concept that fish biology and ecology informs contaminant dynamics, and contaminants in turn can teach us more about the ecology and migrations of the fish themselves. Madigan will continue his collaboration with individuals from all of the above institutions as he moves on to a fellowship at Harvard University's Center for the Environment (HUCE) where this work will be completed, extended, and taken in new and exciting directions.
