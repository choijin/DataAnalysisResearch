<AbstractNarration>The growth of tin whiskers on fine pitched tin-plated electrical interconnect lines poses catastrophic short circuit problems in lead-free electronic components. In the past, this problem was mitigated by adding a few percent lead, which is no longer permissible due to a world-wide ban on lead. This research is aimed at developing robust strategies for mitigating tin-whisker growth by two different mechanisms. One path proposed is to alter the plating chemistry by adding dopants in the electroplating bath to emulate mechanisms that enable lead to impart whisker growth resistance to tin. Another is to modify deposition conditions to promote a near-equiaxed grain structure instead of typically prevalent columnar grains, allowing absorption of mass flow without whisker growth. To achieve this, the project will integrate an intellectual component of alloy-design/microstructure with a deliverable manufacturing component. To aid alloy-design, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations will be performed to provide insight into the influence of dopant elements on grain boundary energy and diffusivity in tin. The expected outcomes will be stress reduction in the tin plating as well as insight into the key mechanisms of whisker formation, including the impact of process conditions on the size and density of whiskers produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the process technology proposed here will have significant impact on the electronics manufacturing industry. The results will be particularly relevant for the power, space and military electronics industries, where lifetimes are measured in decades making whisker formation an egregious problem. The work will integrate research and graduate student training at New Mexico Tech and Washington State University by fostering discovery, interactions with the industry, dissemination of results in conferences, as well as mentoring of undergraduate and high school students. It will provide students with hands-on experience in an industrially relevant technology, where materials processing, microstructure, mechanics, and thermodynamics are all tied together in a single problem of world-wide impact.</AbstractNarration>

The primary goal was to develop mechanism based approaches to mitigating Sn whisker growthfrom Sn-platings on electronic components.          The specific objectives include: (i) identify the principal way(s) in which Pb mitigates Sn whisker growth; (2) identify potential dopants for Sn to emulatemicrostructure and mechanisms that enable Pb to mitigate whisker growth; (3) through a combination of modeling and experiments, identify the role of solute atoms on grain boundary self diffusion of Sn, and dopants besides Pb with similar effects; and (4) develop deposition processes to introduce grain boundaries parallel to the plating surface that act as vacancy sources to inhibit diffusion of Sn atoms to the plating surface. Satisfying these objectives would enable intelligent design of Sn-coatings on Cu that would be highly resistant to whisker growth.          Journal papers, patent applications and conference papers were produced based on this work. The team collaborated with Portland State University on part of the project. Several seminars were given by the WSU PI at universities and industries on the effects of In addition on whisker growth from Sn coatings.  The key outcomes of the work comprised the following.  (i) It was demonstrated that incorporating Indium into Sn electroplatings can dramatically reduce Sn-whisker growth; (ii) Molecular Dynamics simulations showed that the segregation of In into clusters at the Sn grain boundaries can significantly reduce the grain boundary self-diffusivity of Sn, but not sufficiently to rationalize elimination of Sn-whisker growth; (iii) FIB and microscopy showed that the presence of internal internal interfaces and/or grain boundaries cannot rationalize the elimination of whisker growth from Sn-In coatings; (iv) Auger, XPS and FEM results suggest that the surface oxide layer plays an important role in the observed reduction of whisker growth; (v) A new method for co-electroplating Sn with 3-20%In from an MSA bath containing Sn and In sulfate was developed, and it was demonstrated that the co-plated Sn-In coatings are highly resistant to Sn-whisker growth; (vi) Finite element studies showed that the surface oxide on top of the Sn film has a significant correlation with whisker growth, and decreasing oxide stiffness, e.g., by incorporating In in it, or by having the In break up the oxide substantially reduces whisker growth.
