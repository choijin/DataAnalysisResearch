<AbstractNarration>Technical Description:  Ion-based processes play a vital role in a wide range of thin-film growth, surface etching and surface modification processes. A major impediment to developing a robust understanding of surface evolution during ion bombardment has been the difficulty of quantitatively examining the kinetics of nanoscale morphology evolution. This project meets the challenge using a unique facility for in-situ x-ray surface studies developed at the National Synchrotron Light Source. In-situ grazing-incidence small-angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS) studies measure the wavenumber-dependent linear response governing the fundamental stability/instability of a surface to ion bombardment. The project pursues an integrated approach to resolve outstanding problems of ion-surface interaction along three directions. First, systematic studies of native semiconductor surface stability/instability to ion bombardment are carried out to test existing theory and provide insights for its further development. Stress development and its relationship to surface morphology evolution is an issue of particular focus. Second, nonlinear surface evolution and dynamics of the final steady-state surface morphology is examined using conventional real-time x-ray scattering and x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, respectively. The latter technique uses a small x-ray beam, partially coherent across its width, to go beyond traditional kinetics studies. Finally, the effects of seeding are systematically examined to resolve the relative importance of stress and phase separation in driving nanostructure development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: A fundamental understanding of surface evolution during ion bombardment is an "enabling focus" because hyperthermal bombardment is so ubiquitous in surface and thin-film growth processes. Results from this research project could thus potentially impact a wide range of deposition and surface modification techniques. Moreover, the development of coherent GISAXS studies to investigate surface dynamics envisioned in this project would be a powerful tool with a broad range of potential applications in the surface growth/modification community. Graduate, undergraduate and high-school students participating in this research project have an opportunity to work in an area that bridges basic research and application. In addition to experiencing, and contributing to, an important topic in current materials research, they learn to use a wide range of characterization tools. Students interact with a growing materials research community at Boston University and the graduate student also have an excellent opportunity to participate in the multi-disciplinary synchrotron research environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ion-based processes play a vital role in a wide range of computing, communications and energy technologies. This program worked to understand the ubiquitous phenomenon of spontaneous ion beam nanopatterning using grazing-incidence small-angle x-ray scattering to measure the evolving surface morphology during the ion bombardment process itself.  The experiments utilized capabilities that we have developed with colleagues from the University of Vermont at synchrotron x-ray sources located at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island and Argonne National Laboratory outside of Chicago.   Our work pushed forward understanding of ion beam nanopatterning in both monatomic semiconductors and the more complicated case of compound semiconductors. The most widely investigated theoretical approaches to understanding nanopatterning in monatomic materials treat surface evolution as being due to the superposition of surface height changes ("craters") associated with individual ion impacts.  A key goal of such theories is to predict surface evolution from knowledge of the average response to an individual ion impact.  To facilitate the use of computer simulations in predicting surface behavior, a simpli?cation, which we term "truncated" crater function theory, assumes that knowledge of the crater function formed on a ?at surface is suf?cient to determine the surface stability/instability during bombardment.  In collaboration with colleagues at Harvard University, we examined the ability of this truncated crater function theory to predict nanopatterning and showed that the truncated theory predicts certain relationships of morphology evolution.  Our x-ray scattering studies of Ar+ ion beam nanopatterning on Si and Kr+ nanopatterning of Ge then showed that those relationships are not satisfied in those important, but presumably simple, cases.  Thus, we showed that the truncated model is insufficient to correctly predict nanopatterning.  At "long" length scales (greater than a nanometer) fundamentally different physical mechanisms can yield qualitatively similar behavior.  For instance, at long length scales both surface diffusion and surface viscous flow mechanisms would lead to relaxation of surface roughness at a rate that varies as the length scale to the inverse fourth power.  A similar ambiguity exists when trying to distinguish between crater function theories of pattern formation and recent theories which instead ascribe surface behavior to the development of stress during ion bombardment.  In both cases, the ambiguity between competing theories is relieved if we can measure the patterning kinetics on short length scales instead of long scales.  In collaboration with colleagues at Harvard University and Southern Methodist University, we developed approaches to measuring the kinetics of Ar+ patterning of Si at short length scales.  We found that the short length-scale data unambiguously point to surface viscous flow as the dominant relaxation mechanism at room temperature and that stress-based theories of pattern formation fit the short length-scale data rather better than existing theories based upon the general crater function approach.  Some of the most ordered nanopatterns created by ion bombardment have been made on compound semiconductors.  Because these materials have two or more chemical components, the mechanisms causing ion beam nanopatterning are presumably even more complicated than is the case in monatomic materials.  Several proposed mechanisms and theoretical models exist, but making quantitative contact between experiment on the one hand and model parameter-dependent predictions from different theories on the other is usually difficult. In collaboration with colleagues at Purdue University, the University of Illinois and Southern Methodist University, we therefore took a different approach, investigating with a range of targets (GaSb, GaAs, GaP) and ion species (Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) to determine new parametric trends regarding nanostructure evolution. Concurrently, atomistic simulations over the same ion/target combinations were performed to determine parametric trends on several quantities related to existing models.  Our comparison of experimental and numerical trends revealed that the two are broadly consistent under the assumption that instabilities are driven by chemical instability based on phase separation.  Traditionally x-ray scattering experiments have used x-ray beams which are much larger than the photon coherence length, so that successive photons are not in phase &ndash; i.e. they?re out of step with each other.  With the development of high brilliance synchrotron x-ray sources capable of producing small beams having a reasonable degree of coherence (successive photons are in step), however, there is increasing potential for coherent x-ray techniques.  In a final direction, we have been developing coherent x-ray scattering as a new technique to investigate ion beam nanopatterning.  As part of this process, we must understand what the signatures of different theoretical models would be in the coherent scattering signal.  We have therefore undertaken analytical calculations and simulations of widely used equations that seek to describe surface evolution.  Our results will be important guideposts as the x-ray coherent scattering field moves forward.  Under this program, two doctoral students (one each in Physics and in Materials Science &amp; Engineering) and an undergraduate physics major gained an excellent training in current materials research.  All three are women, who are underrepresented in these fields.          Last Modified: 09/11/2017       Submitted by: Karl F Ludwig]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
