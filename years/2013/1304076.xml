<AbstractNarration>This action funds Chad Mangum of North Carolina State University to conduct a research project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Xiamen University in Xiamen, Fujian, China.  The project title is "An Alternative Description of Infinite Dimensional Algebras: Representations of Twisted Toroidal Lie Algebras."  The host scientist is Dr. Shaobin Tan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The representation theory of Lie algebras has been a significant area of mathematical research for several decades, particularly that of affine Lie algebras (an infinite dimensional generalization of finite dimensional semisimple Lie algebras).  A generalization of affine algebras known as toroidal Lie algebras will be the topic of this research endeavor, in particular the twisted 2-toroidal (a natural generalization of the so-called twisted affine algebras, as opposed to nontwisted).  The realization of affine algebras as a one-dimensional universal central extension of a loop algebra is expanded to include Laurent polynomials in 2 variables (hence the term 2-toroidal), with the universal central extension now itself being infinite dimensional. A Drinfeld realization of such algebras (which defines the algebra via generators and relations) will be sought, as well as progress toward both fermionic and bosonic representations of such algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, since the host researcher is an expert in toroidal Lie algebras, the Fellow has the opportunity to begin cultivating an international network of pioneers in the field.  The Fellow plans to present the results of this work at a seminar upon returning to the U.S., aiding the dissemination of results into the relevant mathematical and scientific communities.  The results themselves are likely to have applications to other areas of mathematics and physics (such as particle physics), which is itself a broader impact.  Sharing not only results but also other aspects of the Fellow's EAPSI experience with others will advance the program's goals further by making more scientists aware of them, helping to establish even more broadly the goals of long run international collaborations and globally aware scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ EAPSI China 2013 Project Outcomes Report   Research Title: Representations of Toroidal Lie Algebras EAPSI Fellow, Author: Chad Mangum, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC EAPSI Host Adviser, Researcher: Dr. Shaobin Tan, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China   My EAPSI research was conducted in a subdiscipline of theoretical algebra known as toroidal Lie algebras. This field has been a vibrant area of mathematical research for the last 20-30 years partly because of its many connections with other mathematical fields (such as geometry, manifold theory, representation theory, combinatorics, and vertex algebras) and physics (such as string theory, conformal field theory, and quantum mechanics). There are a handful of algebraically distinct toroidal Lie algebras, known as nontwisted toroidal algebras, that have already been classified for years, and they can be defined axiomatically in a way amenable to usual algebraic study (in this case, using polynomials with coefficients from finite dimensional Lie algebras). An alternate definition of these, known as the Drinfel'd realization, was proven by the author's graduate advisers in 2010. The first research question during the EAPSI fellowship was to mathematically construct the Drinfel'd realization for a subalgebra of one of the nontwisted toroidal algebras. This subalgebra is called "twisted" because it has the special property of each of its elements being fixed by a function associated with the nontwisted case. My research was to determine the mathematical elements which would generate this twisted toroidal algebra, and also the set of relations (calculations which the generators satisfy) required. Once the generators and relations are determined, the goal was to rigorously prove that indeed these were the correct sets for the twisted toroidal algebra they were claimed to present. Secondly, the question was to construct a representation of this twisted subalgebra using linear operators. This representation would use the same relations, but different kinds of generators (this latter type of representation is considered worthwhile because the generators contain more structural information than the usual set of generators). Since it uses linear operators, it would also allow us to study it with linear algebra, a well-understood field. These research questions are part of an ongoing project that are too difficult to be asked and answered in one summer. However, the EAPSI fellowship was very valuable to their progress. During the EAPSI fellowship, this work was advanced by:  One of the existing relations was modified by a negative sign. Three relations were added at the end; these will be necessary to finish the proof, as pointed out by the host adviser. The existing generators were confirmed, and the final generator was  researched at length. This final generator contained the deepest theory  and structure behind it, and hence was the most difficult to determine.  While not complete by the end of the summer, the theory behind it was  much better understood. The host adviser supplied a different perspective about how to approach  the Drinfel'd realization. This led the author to a revamped strategy  that has promise to lead more (and more efficient) results in the future.  In addition to the above progress (which was specific to the current research project), many other more broad research-related accomplishments were brought about by involvement in EAPSI. They include:  Many seminars and conference talks have allowed the author to learn  about certain subfields of math related to this project (most notably  vertex algebras). This opens up possibilities for many new research  projects similar to the one being undertaken. The extension of a network of mathematicians makes future collaborations  more feasible, which will further advance the field. The host adviser  was active in helping to build this network. He invited numerous  high-profile professors and researchers to visit Xiam...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
