<AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 13-37732&lt;br/&gt;PI(s):  Lumetta, Steven S.&lt;br/&gt;  Iyer, Ravishankar; Jongeneel, Cornelis Victor; Robinson, Gene E.; Sinha, Saurabh&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Illinois - Urbana-Champaign&lt;br/&gt;Title:   MRI/Dev.: Novel Computing Instrument for Big Data        &lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project, developing CompGen, an instrument that adopts a hardware-software co-design approach, aims to provide a&lt;br/&gt;- Vehicle for biologists and computer scientists to collaborate and develop new algorithms that are significantly faster and more accurate at a scale essential for handling the data deluge;  &lt;br/&gt;- Software framework and tool set for algorithm development that support diverse data analysis and visualization; &lt;br/&gt;- Framework for developing accelerators and mapping to heterogeneous computational resources and hierarchical database storage. &lt;br/&gt;Promising technologies include emerging die-stacked and non-volatile memory technologies as well as accelerators (GPUs, FPGAs, APUs). &lt;br/&gt;The project brings together a multidisciplinary team of geneticists, bioinformatics specialists, computer and algorithms designers, and data mining experts. The research to be enabled includes a wide and eclectic variety of problems with direct impact on health and social issues. Some directions include understanding the impact of climate change on gene expression and ecosystems, bringing genetic analysis into medical clinics, identifying effective antibiotics, and exploring socio-genomics relations between stress, depression, and genetics among low-income African-American mothers.  &lt;br/&gt;CompGen provides an environment that enables managing and processing genomic information and developing new algorithms. The instrument brings disruptive computing architectures and algorithmic techniques to facilitate analysis of genomic data while providing high accuracy results, resilience to errors, and scalability with growing volumes of data. It enables addressing the challenges of scale and diversity in genomic data through the development of new algorithms, models, and statistical methods. The instrument development focuses on reduction of data volume, optimization of storage hierarchy, identification and implementation of computational primitives, data visualization, mathematical toolkit optimization, and performance and reliability assessment. These developments are expected to lead to new computational structures and hardware/software architectures that can be incorporated into hierarchical databases as well as heterogeneous processors for data analysis, compression, and optimization.  &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  &lt;br/&gt;In addition to serving many areas, CompGen will serve as a tool for educating students and professionals in efficient ways to process and analyze genomic data and for handling big data in general. The instrument will serve multidisciplinary classes in which students gain hands-on research experience and introductory classes that expose students to applications and tools. Existing outreach and education programs will be utilized to expose the instrument. Plans include Open House events attracting thousands of visitors, Coursera courses, and minority outreach workshops. A mentoring tool, Mytri, will be used for networking among female students. Moreover, the CompGen design will be made available to others by fundamentally changing the methods by which big datasets are handled in genomics research. To this effect, an R&amp;D consortium of hospitals, companies, and universities has been established to help identify needs, provide sources of data, act as early adopters, and ensure that new technologies are transferred smoothly into widespread use.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The program and instrument developed through the program served as a central focus in energizing the cross-disciplinary efforts at UIUC and, more broadly, our collaborative efforts with industry and academic partners.  Dr. Richard Weinshilboum of Mayo perhaps best summarized the impact when he addressed the CCBGM (an NSF I/UCRC spawned from the initial MRI Industry Consortium) in November 2019: "The NSF is playing a critical role as a catalyst in eliminating both the psychological and the real barriers between the computational science and wet lab biomedical science."     Local funding has been allocated to ensure that the vision of the initial proposal survives well beyond the end of the MRI grant.  Provided cooperatively by the Vice-Chancellor for Research, the Institute for Genomic Biology, the Coordinated Science Lab and the College of Engineering, these funds are used to support core staff in high-performance genomic computing, to host periodic meetings as a forum for discussing opportunities and sharing results, to fund a diverse group of more than 30 graduate student fellows supervised jointly by biology and computing faculty, and to seed new projects at the interface of the disciplines.  CompGen Fellows have gone on to positions with other faculties, IBM, Mayo, and so forth.  This project has also had a significant impact on faculty recruiting, serving as a core focus and resource to attract those with interdisciplinary interests and to help them to succeed.  Our faculty involved have also developed educational materials ranging from genomics-focused data science and probability courses for senior undergraduates through graduate seminars focused on genomic technologies.     Since the inception of the MRI, UIUC has been successful in obtaining numerous additional grants and collaborative efforts in related areas, including a BD2K Center, a software tools and methods grant, and an R25 education and training grant.  Internal and external collaborations have also deepened as a result of the MRI.   Within the University, meaningful benchmarks for the MRI machine arose through joint efforts with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), led by its Innovative Systems Lab and by the Blue Waters project.  CompGen also continues to hold regular joint workshops with the UIUC Cancer Center.      Our close connections with industrial partners enabled us to go beyond our original plans in developing the instrument.  For example, as an upgrade, we were able to leverage our close collaboration with IBM to acquire their latest Power9 CPU based systems as well as their Spectrum-Scale based SSD storage equipment.  These systems further improve performance through support for the latest NVLink and OpenCAPI technologies.  Using the IBM CAPI along with Xilinx FPGA technology led to development of accelerators for several common computational kernels commonly used in computational genomics.     The collaborative industry relationship envisioned and initiated by the MRI has been realized in the new Center for Computational Biotechnology and Genomic Medicine (CCBGM), developed with Mayo Clinic and U. Chicago and supported by the NSF I/UCRC program and industry partners.  This new center seeks to advance pressing societal issues, such as enabling patient- specific treatment of cancer and other diseases, understanding and modifying microbial communities related to human health and agriculture, and supporting humanity’s growing need for food by improving the efficiency of plant and animal agriculture.  CCBGM has also begun to contribute significantly to knowledge in a wide range of disciplines centered around computational problems in genomics and related fields. Our work with Mayo has continued to grow both within CCBGM and outside of it.     In addition to numerous theses, papers, web sites, and educational materials, the grant produced several designs and tools now available for general use.  The TCGA hardware design developed by the DEPEND group includes accelerators for Levenshtein distance computation, HMM execution, and De-Bruijn Graph construction, and demonstrates a ~16x improvement in throughput and a ~180x improvement in throughput-per-unit-energy consumed for the Variant Calling and Genotyping workflow (based on the Broad Institute Best Practices Workflow).  The Symphony runtime scheduler for the instrument uses a data-driven strategy of integrating real-time performance-counter measurements, prior workload knowledge, and information about system architecture and interconnect topology to infer system state (resource utilization) information to schedule tasks to processors.  Improved training and inference models as well as error correction methods when using hardware performance counters enable Symphony to reduce benchmark execution time on the instrument from 73 hours (CPUs only) to 1.2 hours (61x) using our FPGA-based accelerators, and to under 40 minutes (109x) using NVIDIA K80 GPUs.  Additional freely-distributed software includes tools for unsupervised learning of mixtures of Gaussians, synthetic generation of genomic reads based on empirical models, computing the mapability spectrum of a reference sequence, visualization of microbial communities, and execution of long short-term graphical models (LSGMs).
