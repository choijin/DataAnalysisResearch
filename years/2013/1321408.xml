<AbstractNarration>This project supports the Doctoral Consortium held with the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) in Portland, Oregon, in June 2013. CVPR is the premier annual conference with about 2000 senior and student participants in computer vision, held in North America and attended by members of the international research community. The goal of the Doctoral Consortium is to highlight the work of senior Ph.D. students, who are close to finishing their degrees, or recent graduates, and to give these students the opportunity to discuss their research with senior researchers matched with their expertise. NSF support covers some of the costs for the selected US graduate students to attend the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project rests in the selection of top-quality Ph.D. students whose research is showcased and to whom feedback is provided by senior researchers. The opportunity to receive advice on their research and career plans from experts from different institutions, and with potentially different perspectives, in many cases is not available internally within one's own institution. The broader impacts of this project include supporting the career development of some of the brightest junior researchers in computer vision, contributing to the research community in general by drawing attention to an important aspect of graduate student development, and potentially increasing the number of active researchers and teachers in STEM. The doctoral consortium event aims to have representation from a diverse group of participants in terms of gender, ethnic background, academic institution and geographic location.</AbstractNarration>
