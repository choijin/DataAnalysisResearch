<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of the dynamics of horizontal-axis wind-turbine blades, and the loads that they impart to the gearbox and bearings, ultimately to provide guidelines for wind-turbine designers to develop turbines with significantly higher reliability.  A wind-blade dynamic model involves effects of rotation, cyclic excitations due to gravity and steady wind shear (producing both parametric and direct excitation), aeroelasticity, and arbitrary wind-gust excitations.  This work is focused on the resonances and instabilities associated with nearly identical wind blades coupled through the hub.  Such symmetric arrangements are prone to vibration localization, which increases the vibration of a single blade.  This project addresses these dynamics with fundamental modeling of the blades and hub, reduced-order modeling and perturbation analysis which yields the role of parameters and mechanisms underlying critical behaviors, high fidelity simulation studies that include the imparted loads on gears and bearings, and correlation of simulated events with field observations as available from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Sandia. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This study will provide insight to the unknown dynamic loadings that can contribute to premature wind-turbine failures.  The work thus enables a more reliable and cost-effective wind-energy fleet, which in turn promotes diversification of the renewable energy supply and the reduction of greenhouse gases.  Understanding of resonances, localization, and instability of coupled blades with direct and parametric cyclic and aeroelastic excitation, and the effects on dynamic loading of the gearbox, will provide improved design guidelines for wind-turbine engineers, and will also advance the field of dynamics.  Results will be disseminated through journal publications, conference presentations, and wind energy meetings and workshops.  A doctoral student and an undergraduate will be prepared for the wind energy workforce.  The PI will conduct outreach through existing university programs for high-school students and gifted middle school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this work, the vibrations of wind turbine blades with hub coupling under a combined constant load (such as mean wind load) plus cyclic load (gravity and wind shear) were studied to obtain understanding that will help improve reliability.  The first focus was on formulating a beam-based model for in-plane and out-of-plane bending and twist deformations of a blade.  Blades tend to be shaped nonuniformly with a taper and pre-twist, which couples the in- and out-of-plane deflections.  Resulting characteristic shapes of vibratory motion (mode shapes) are dominantly in-plane or out-of-plane, which is consistent with how the industry treats the deflections.  Cyclic compression and tension of the blade under its own weight during rotation causes a cyclically varying stiffness, which was quantified and shown to be significant to the vibrations as the blades get very large; this cyclic stiffness should be considered with the largest blades in development, and in future designs as the blades continue to increase in size.  Coupled three-blade-hub dynamical equations were derived for in-plane motion.  An analysis of these equations showed that symmetric three-blade sets can have resonance behavior at rotational speeds of half the lowest modal frequency, and possibly lower speeds.  When the symmetry is disrupted slightly (for example due to manufacturing imperfections) the modal frequencies split up a slightly, and the resonance speed range broadens.  The vibration at resonance can be localized, meaning one blade takes on more deflection (and deformation strain) than the three would endure if purely symmetric.  We have also developed an analysis method for handling transient vibrations with cyclic stiffness, which is significant for wind-blade vibration models under sudden events such as gusts.  INTELLECTUAL MERIT:    The turbine blade modeling made use of ideas from helicopter blade literature, and accommodated cyclic gravitational stiffening (a parametric effect).  The effect of blade scaling on the parametric effect was quantified.  The modal analysis of the beam-based blade model was consistent with other computational models, and quantified the relative degree of in-plane and out-of-plane deflection in the modal motions.  A second-order perturbation analysis of the model for very large single blades with a parametric effect showed that a constant load or cyclic load could cause resonance at rotor speeds well below the modal frequency.  An analysis of the blade-rotor set also showed the existence of resonances at low rotor speeds, with an estimate of the associated rotor motions.  Slightly mistuned rotor sets were shown to have splitting of the resonances with a capacity for vibration localization.  A Floquet-based analysis applied to the transient part of response was applied to single-degree-of-freedom systems (such as a reduced model of a single blade) and multi-degree-of-freedom systems (such as an in-plane or out-of-plane coupled rotor set) led to approximations of the response to initial conditions and its frequency content and stability.  BROADER IMPACTS:  Understanding vibrations and dynamic loads is imperative for designing wind turbines for longer lifetimes, lower-cost maintenance, and improved reliability.  The benefit to society is a more robust and reliable wind-energy contingent, which will help reduce overall energy costs and contribute to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  This has been a very challenging task for very large turbines, and there is a thrust to continue increasing the turbine size as we move off shore.  The work will be significant to the design of such turbines.  This work involved the training of two doctoral students, who have developed expertise in dynamical modeling and analysis that can be applied in the future to renewable energy research and development.
