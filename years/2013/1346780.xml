<AbstractNarration>This is an I-Corps project from the California State University (CSU) Program for Education and Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB) for an I-Corps Biological Sciences Site. The activities proposed aim to smooth the development path for nascent academic entrepreneurs across the CSU. The Site recognizes the learning obstacles along the path to biological sciences commercialization including cultural differences between academic research and commercial development, product regulation, intellectual property management, and financing for long product development cycles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSUPERB will:&lt;br/&gt;1) Recruit biological sciences researchers and fund 30 Site Teams annually, providing opportunities to explore biotechnology commercialization pathways;  &lt;br/&gt;2) Draw upon CSUPERBs existing network of alumni, industry experts and campus-based entrepreneurship resources, to offer tailored advice for science-based ventures; &lt;br/&gt;3) Tailor a curriculum for biological sciences entrepreneurs to explore venture ideas, assess the maturity of their technology, and map out development milestones; and  &lt;br/&gt;4) Organize recurring, regional meetings co-hosted by industry associations and partner organizations for curious academic biological sciences entrepreneurs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The I-Corps Biological Sciences Site will nurture CSU researchers so that they gain confidence in their entrepreneurial abilities, greater understanding of biotechnology commercialization pathways, and a better calibration of their concepts maturity level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: More than a quarter of the California State University STEM baccalaureates are from underrepresented populations. The CSU educates more Hispanic, African-American, and American Indian undergraduates than all other institutions in the state combined. The immersive learning provided by biological sciences research and entrepreneurial activity is engaging and valuable to CSU students, even the most at-risk populations. Employers and investors greatly value creative students who graduate with demonstrated accomplishments in team-based research, the ability to solve real-world problems, and experience with technology commercialization. A Biological Sciences Site program gives students and faculty access to mentors, sources of capital, business expertise, and leadership opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
