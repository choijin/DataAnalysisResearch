<AbstractNarration>Understanding the risk and reliance on specific system security practices is critical in order to formulate a coherent strategy on safe cloud adoption. This work will investigate techniques for security risk evaluation for cloud computing with specific focus on the two areas of off-line risk management and on-line trust evaluation. The research will develop a project assessment model to capture relations between threats, tasks, assets and business logic; develop a vender assessment model to evaluate the vender?s share of security responsibility; and develop a cost benefit trade-off methodology for optimal cloud adoption strategy.&lt;br/&gt;Based on these, will develop an on-line assessment methodology for cloud service providers assessment based on different applications, services and vendor compositions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the proliferation of cloud architectures, it is critical that their security be assessable and issues addressable. The proposed work has the potential to enable loud users to gauge the trust-worthiness of individual cloud elements or aggregated cloud resources and to analyze and suggest appropriate risk mitigation strategy. The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board and will engage multiple industry members of the center. The center will involve graduate students and be integrated in graduate course offerings.  Industry tutorials will also be developed and offered.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
