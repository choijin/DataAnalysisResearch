<AbstractNarration>This project establishes and operates the EarthCube Research Coordination Network (RCN)&lt;br/&gt;Collaboration and Cyberinfrastructure for Paleogeosciences (C4P) to advance the role of cyberinfrastructure&lt;br/&gt;(CI) in unraveling the large-scale, long-term evolution of the Earth-Life System through the&lt;br/&gt;study of the geological record.Paleogeosciences research into our large-scale, long-term Earth-Life system is an ambitious&lt;br/&gt;program that informs public debate on human stewardship of the earth and has - since its inception&lt;br/&gt;- caught public imagination on issues such as species survival under environmental changes.&lt;br/&gt;In the last decade, fresh discoveries, plus the application of new technologies of measurement,&lt;br/&gt;data analysis, and modeling have revitalized the science. Bringing to bear recent advances&lt;br/&gt;in computing and mathematics will further quicken the pace of discoveries, synthesis and publication&lt;br/&gt;in the science. This RCN intends to stimulate and grow CI-focused collaborations and&lt;br/&gt;partnerships among paleogeoscientists, paleobiologists, bioinformaticists, stratigraphers,&lt;br/&gt;geochronologists, geographers, data scientists, and computer scientists that will help dissolve&lt;br/&gt;existing intellectual barriers to dramatically improve the application of modern data management&lt;br/&gt;approaches, data mining technologies, and computational methods to better analyze the heterogeneous&lt;br/&gt;and sparse data of the Earth record in sediments, rocks, and ice within the paleogeosciences&lt;br/&gt;and other domains and disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities envisioned include a series of coordinated workshops and webinars, web-enabled networking, outreach events such&lt;br/&gt;as symposia and town-hall meetings, and cross-EarthCube coordination, and creation of an interoperable&lt;br/&gt;C4P resource catalog that will be integrated with other EarthCube resource inventories. High-priority&lt;br/&gt;themes in C4P are the management and representation of age and age uncertainty in data models&lt;br/&gt;and computation to advance interoperability among and analysis of time-referenced data types,&lt;br/&gt;the integration of physical samples into digital data infrastructure, and the need to properly&lt;br/&gt;track and attribute provenance of data to ensure trust in the data and credit to authors.</AbstractNarration>
