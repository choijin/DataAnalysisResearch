<AbstractNarration>This project will fund a named lectureship and a workshop for early-career women at the 2014 Annual Meeting of the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) in Chicago, Illinois.  The Sonia Kovalevsky Lectureship features significant contributions by women to applied areas of the mathematical sciences. These lectures reach a broad audience, highlight important contributions by women, and serve as inspiration for those entering the profession.  The workshop, organized by the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM), is part of a series of interconnected conferences and workshops designed to create sustainable networks, encourage mentoring relationships, and promote research collaborations.  The 2014 AWM-SIAM workshop will focus on numerical algorithms for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).   Nonlinear PDEs arise in many different fields and have been a core research area of theoretical and numerical analysis for many decades.  Due to the nonlinearity, solutions to these PDEs may have singularities and thus cannot satisfy the equations in the classical sense.  In recent years, numerical simulations have dramatically enhanced our understanding of the properties and behaviors of such solutions.  The workshop will focus on numerical methods for some of the most widely studied PDEs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is designed to address issues that frequently cause women in the mathematical sciences to leave the profession or fail to thrive.  Studies show that increasing the visibility of women scientists, providing mentoring and networking opportunities to combat isolation, and offering resources for launching careers are key to combating this problem.  The AWM workshops, which include both research talks and panel discussions on career development, provide a natural environment for establishing mentoring relations and research collaborations.  Contacts formed at these meetings lead to greater integration of the participants into the broader research community.  The Kovalevsky Lecture is an opportunity to display outstanding work by accomplished female mathematicians, providing both role models for younger women and visual reminders to the broader community of the significant contributions being made by female mathematicians.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project included two workshops for early-career women and one named lectureship organized by the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) and held at major national mathematics meetings.  The first workshop and the Sonia Kovalevsky Lecture were held at the Annual Meeting of the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) in Chicago, July 7-9, 2014. The second was held at the Joint Mathematics Meeting (JMM) in Seattle, January 6-9, 2016.  Intellectual Merit   The workshops included research talks by early career mathematicians, a poster session for graduate students, a career panel and mentoring events. While the presenters were all women, the events were open to all registered participants of the national meetings.  The talks at each workshop focused on a topic of current interest and brought together junior and senior women working in the field.  The poster sessions featured the work of graduate students on a wide range of topics.    At the SIAM workshop, talks focused on numerical approaches to nonlinear partial differential equations. Nonlinear PDEs arise in many different fields and have remained a core research area of theoretical and numerical analysis for many decades. The applications include fluid dynamics, mechanics, climate research, ecology, and biochemical models, among others.   The JMM workshop focused on algebraic combinatorics.  This is a growing field of pure mathematics that employs combinatorial techniques to study algebraic questions in group theory, representation theory, lattice theory and commutative algebra.  Broader Impact   The events supported by this grant were designed to address issues that frequently cause women in mathematics to leave the profession early in their career or fail to thrive.  The AWM workshops are designed to create sustainable networks, encourage mentoring relationships, and promote research collaborations.  By focusing on a particular area of mathematics, these workshops help to build a sense of community among women in that area and to reinforce existing networks.  Contacts formed through these workshops also lead to invitations to future meetings and new reserch collaborations, thus resulting in greater participation in the broader research community.    Named lectureships at major national meetings, such as the Sonya Kovalevsky Lecture at the SIAM annual meeting, offer a unique opportunity to highlight the work of a distinguished female mathematician.  These lectures provide inspiration to younger women and offer a visual reminder of the significant contributions of women to the field.  Research on implicit bias indicates the importance of such reminders.          Last Modified: 05/28/2016       Submitted by: Ruth Charney]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
