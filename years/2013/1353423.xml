<AbstractNarration>An award is made to the University of Florida to develop a bioaerosol instrument whose purpose is to enable highly efficient and rapid detection of airborne viruses. Existing bioaerosol sampling systems are designed for bacterial aerosol collection/detection, which are very ineffective for capturing viral aerosols because viruses are much smaller than bacteria. In addition, conventional detection methods for viruses are time consuming and therefore do not allow determination in field investigation. The novel Highly Efficient and Rapid Viral Aerosol Detection System (HERVADS) utilizes cooling and mixing methods to enable particle size amplification so that the nanosized viruses can be efficiently collected from air (&gt;90% of the new device compared to 5-10% of the existing device). Integrated with a paper-based microfluidic device with selective and sensitive immunoassay, the instrument allows detection of sampled viruses in minutes, orders of magnitude faster than the current method (in days), thus enabling its uses in the field. Incorporation of electrostatic mechanism into the system further enables detection of viral aerosols even in low concentration. By working closely with an industrial partner, the research team will have frequent and in-time feedbacks that allow incorporation of critical features for successful commercial development in the future. The University of Florida?s Office of Technology Licensing will also assist the research team in feasibility assessment, dissemination and outreach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful development and implementation of the novel HERVADS will have significant societal impacts. The HERVADS will impact environmental field studies, enabling the sampling of viruses of environmental and agricultural importance and furthering our basic understanding of the natural diversity of viruses associated with a variety of environmental niches.  The HERVADS can also be used to help monitor air quality in critical environments such as emergency rooms, detecting biological pathogen threats, and would be useful for monitoring respiratory pathogens in mass gatherings. In addition, the cohesive collaboration among mechanical engineering, environmental science and virology will train graduate students with multi- and inter-disciplinary knowledge. Involvement of undergraduate researchers will motivate and better prepare them for pursuit of advanced education. YouTube videos created for this project will be a vehicle to reach the public, for course materials, as well as to promote the interest in utilizing the HERVADS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being made jointly by two Programs- (1) Instrument Development for Biological Research, in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Biological Sciences Directorate), and (2) the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (Engineering Directorate).</AbstractNarration>
