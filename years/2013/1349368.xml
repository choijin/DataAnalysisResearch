<AbstractNarration>EAGER: Mississippian Bear Gulch Limestone Paleoecology, Stratigraphy, and Geochemistry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;George Stanley, University of Montana, EAR-1349368&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt; The Bear Gulch Limestone (BG) in located in central Montana and is a plattenkalk representing one of the most outstanding Mississippian marine konservat lagerstätte. It is a thin limestone lens 30 meters thick, that suggests restricted conditions. Deposited during the latest Mississippian the BG records a time of great climatic, environmental, and potential evolutionary change as yet unstudied. We know so little about the paleoecology of this lagerstätte as well as the chemical and physical setting which allowed the amazing preservation of soft-parts which characterizes much of the fauna. Most of the exposures are located on private land and due to the activities of commercial fossil marketers, only a single landowner is now permitting access. This project aims to undertake a field and laboratory study aimed at providing needed physical, chemical and paleoecologic data. The acquisition of such data will provide the intellectual background and broader impacts for formulating a later, more fully developed project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Montana Bear Gulch Limestone (BGL) is an outstanding Mississippian marine Konservat-Lagerst&auml;tten located in in Fergus County, Central Montana. The  shallow-water invertebrate fossils of the BGL consist of abundant algae, sponges and brachiopods and rarer  soft-bodied  taxa. The biota are atypical of normal Mississippian limestone in  lacking  corals, crinoids and bryozoans.  The abundant and diverse invertebrate paleoecology and sedimentology as well as some geochemical investigations were the focus of this EAGER project. As a Lagerst&auml;tte the BGL reveals fine preservation of the hard and soft-bodied marine biotas and a rare glimpse into marine life during a critical time in Earth history. As a plattenkalk, the micritic limestone of the BGL was deposited as two types of finely laminated, alternating sets beds (flinz and f&auml;ule). The research revealed variations in both benthic invertebrate fossil content and deposition environment.  In terms of intellectual merit, the project sought to reconstruct the BGL benthic macroinvertebrate paleoecology and paleoenvironment by investigating three interrelated components of  geochemistry, sedimentology, and paleoecology.  This pilot project developed a comprehensive BGL fossils and sedimentological collection (deposited in the University of Montana Paleontology Center) as well as detailed locality and stratigraphic data, combined with quantitative point counts of paleoecology from bedding planes. sedimentological samples. Geochemical results helped clarify the depositional conditions for the two types of bed sets.  Together results indicate a restricted environment for the BGL with respect to oxygen with fluxuating redox conditions. Marine changes were closely tied to climate and terrestrial environments. Differing fossil assemblages in the flinz and f&auml;ule laminasets indicate different physiochemical conditions during deposition. Higher concentration, abundance and diversity of invertebrates in the flinz laminasets indicate strong biotic responses to these fluxuating marine conditions.   Newly acquired fossil and sedimentological material allowed improved analysis of  the  paleoecology and reconstruction of the paleoenvironment and provide important data for future investigations of the BGL.
