<AbstractNarration>The Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is designed to support improvements in the scientific, mathematical, engineering and technological education infrastructure in (a) tribally-controlled colleges and universities, or (b) those colleges that serve significant numbers of Alaska Natives or Native Hawaiians. Targeted STEM Infusion Projects (TSIP) is offered as a TCUP strand for meritorious projects that focus on smaller scale transformative efforts, such as within a department.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will establish the first associate of science degree in forensic science at a tribal college.  It is anticipated that such a degree will encourage more interest in STEM studies generally, and can provide short-range employment preparation, and the foundation to transfer to further studies in the field of forensic science.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cankdeska Cikana Community College's "CCCC Targeted STEM Infusion Project" aims to develop and implement an associate of science degree in forensic science with seamless matriculation into the third year of the University of North Dakota's (UND) Bachelor's of Science (BS) degree in Forensic Science.  This initiative responds to a national growing interest and demand by tribal college students in the field of forensic science.  Cankdeska Cikana Community College's (CCCC) TSIP proposal is designed to take into account the particular needs of tribal college students by offering a bridging pathway based on hypothesis-driven summer research internships in addition to state of the art technologies that will facilitate the transition of tribal college students to a large university campus.  The general strategies are: to establish a forensic science curriculum that is on par with national standards, and that will seamlessly matriculate to a BS program at UND; to effectively prepare CCCC students for other (STEM) academic and professional aspirations; to enhance the college's science courses to include forensic science modules; and to ensure that the college's course requirements will be culturally appropriate to fit the needs of tribal colleges and students as well as mainstream institutions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utilizing both formative and summative evaluation steps through the various stages of development and implementation of this project will provide CCCC with explicit insight on success of the broader outcomes for this project, increasing applied and basic science enrollment for tribal college students in mainstream universities and in developing science professionals that will serve American Indian communities and the nation.</AbstractNarration>

&nbsp;There was faculty turnover, which resulted in a change in the scope of the project.&nbsp; It changed from forensic science to a broader infusion of science into the curriculum with a focus on environmental forensics.&nbsp; The second PD, Ms. Carrie Ann Duafala, infused forensic topics into the classroom (tracking, scat, etc.) but then Ms. Duafala entered maternity leave and ultimately resigned from her position.&nbsp; Ms. Heidi Ziegenmeyer was hired as the third PD and introduced skills in aquatic ecosystems and sampling techniques to add to the wildlife topics and Mr. Douglas Cudworth's geology and soil science topics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>A major outcome of the TSIP grant was funding the STEM faculty charged with incorporating environmental forensics into the curriculum.&nbsp; Two faculty were funded in part along with some related staff for oversight and assistance.&nbsp;</p> <p>Connections with Spirit Lake Tribal EPA and Fish and Widllife agencies were created as a result of TSIP.&nbsp; The grant funded two student internships, one with Tribal EPA and one with the Spirit Lake Fish &amp; Wildlife Department in the field of Environmental Forensics.&nbsp; One student worked as a Solid Waste Compliance Officer and earned some certifications in the field as well as receiving credit at CCCC for the internship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Another outcome was the incorporation of environmental forensics into the Natural Resource Management (NRM) curriculum.&nbsp; Ms. Carrie Ann Duafala had specialties in terrestrial ecology, so she was able to purchase and utilize materials related to tracking of animals and scat analysis while Mr. Douglas Cudworth incorporated kits involving soil testing or geology to solve fictional crimes.&nbsp; In the final year of the grant, Ms. Heidi Ziegenmeyer introduced her expertise in aquatic ecology and purchased items for water testing (looking for contaminants) and a pontoon boat for water, algae, and plant sampling and completing lake profiles.&nbsp;</p> <p>The terrestrial ecology activities relate to environmental crimes that might occur to wildlife while the soil/geology relate to the identification and use of soils/minerals to prosecute a crime.&nbsp; The aquatic activities allowed for testing for contamination and environmental pollution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The students greatly enjoyed these experiential learning opportunities and these activities were highly rated in written and verbal surveys.&nbsp; Incorporating environmental forensics increased classroom enrollment over time due to the interest in experiential learning and real-world applications.&nbsp; Utilizing real, professional-grade equipment with students made them feel very invested in the projects.&nbsp;
