<AbstractNarration>Project Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an interdisciplinary conference to promote an exchange of ideas with the hope of initiating collaborative efforts between young researchers in psychology and philosophy. The topic of the conference is cognitive penetration of perception; that is to say, participants will discuss whether perception is primarily input-driven, or whether cognitive states such as beliefs, moods, fears, expectations, emotions, desires, can influence the content or character of perception. Perception is widely researched in experimental psychology, widely discussed in philosophy of mind, and a constant part of our everyday experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary aim of the conference is to bring together the different perspectives indicated above on theorizing about perception, and to address the implications of different theoretical positions on the topic of cognitive penetration for epistemology and theories of perception more generally. Theorizing about the epistemic impacts of cognitive penetration and related psychological phenomena has only begun to take hold in recent years, and could benefit immensely from increased interdisciplinary discussion that serves to integrate psychological research with theorizing in philosophy of mind. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both the psychological and the epistemological issues related to cognitive penetration have recently taken a strong hold in philosophy, with a host of new work by graduate students and young researchers. This conference will serve to deepen discussion of the issue, and to widen the range of experiments analyzed by philosophers. It may also encourage the dissolution of the boundaries between academic disciplines, and explore the impact that this line of research and theorizing has for understanding our experience of the world. The conference is open to all, and is expected to draw attendance from across a number of academic areas, including philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and literature; it will thereby broaden thinking on fundamental questions about how the mind works.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An interdisciplinary conference on the cognitive penetrability of perception organized by Susanna Siegel was held in July 2015 at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. The conference aimed to facilitate discussion between scientists and philosophers about the ways in which our cognitive states (including beliefs, fears, desires, emotions, expectations, and moods) can influence the way we perceive the world.  One of the major themes of the conference was how to situate cognitive penetration of perception with respect to both descriptive Bayesian psycholgocal models, and Bayesian epistemic norms. Bayesian frameworks are an increasingly popular way of understanding the mind. They postulate substantial and pervasive reliance on prior information in both beleif updating and perceptual processing, making them useful tools for understanding how our cognitive and perceptual systems interact.  Additional issues discussed at the conference included whether Bayesian processing is always epistemically rational and ethically justified, the scope of the Bayesian framework, what types of mental states can come in degrees, and how our social structures can influence the way we absorb information from the environment.  Speakers included Moshe Bar (Harvard), Michael Rescorla (UCLA), Eric Mandelbaum (CUNY), Jessie Munton (Yale), John Morrison (Columbia), Jona Vance (Northern Arizona), Sarah Moss (Michigan), Lu Teng (NYU Shanghai), and Cat Wade (Harvard). Commentators included Zoe Jenkin (Harvard), Farid Masrour (Wisconsin), Susanna Siegel (Harvard), Matthew McGrath (Missouri), and Briana Toole (Arizona). Participants at large included David Chalmers (NYU), Anya Farennikova (Bristol), Chris Hill (Brown), Claudia Passos (UFRJ), Nico Silins (Cornell), and Scott Sturgeon (Birmingham).  The group of conference participants included both psychologists and philosophers, as well as both early career scholars and established researchers. By bringing together such varied perspectives, we were able to approach the issues surrounding the cognitive penetrability of perception from a wide range of angles. We were also able to foster collaboartive and mentoring relationships between researchers across departments and specializations. The discussion among this diverse group helped bring into focus the broader import of the psychological data on cognitive penetrability. Understanding these psychological mechanisms not only helps us to better understand our own experience and behavior and that of others', but is also the first step in learning how to emend our behaviors when they are epistemically or ethically inappropriate.
