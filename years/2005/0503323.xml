<AbstractNarration>Surfaces, thin films, and self-organized surface structures can exhibit interesting and useful properties markedly different from their bulk counterparts due to geometric confinement of electrons and boundary effects. The underlying quantum physics is a cornerstone for nanoscale science and technology which is a broadly based interdisciplinary enterprise highly relevant to the advancement of materials, devices, and technologies. Thin films, in particular, are of fundamental interest, as they are widely employed in devices and coatings. They also provide a research path bridging surfaces and bulk materials. This project aims at a systematic study of the electronic structure of thin films and the connection to physical properties including lattice structure, strain, thermal stability, work function, surface energy, adsorption, electron-phonon coupling, and superconductivity. Emphases will be placed on highly perfect, atomically uniform films that can now be routinely prepared. The proposed work will include photoemission at the Synchrotron Radiation Center in Stoughton, Wisconsin, and x-ray scattering and diffraction at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Integrated with the research effort is education and training of students and postdoctoral associates, as well as outreach to the broader community through publications, lectures, facilities tours, and collaborative projects.&lt;br/&gt;%%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultra thin films can exhibit interesting and useful properties markedly different from their bulk counterparts due to geometric confinement of electrons and boundary effects. The underlying quantum physics is a cornerstone for nanoscale science and technology which is a broadly based interdisciplinary enterprise that is of national importance and where there is intense international competition. Thin films are widely employed in devices and coatings, and perfection of thin film properties is a critical issue in the worldwide quest for advancement of materials, devices, and technologies. This project aims at a fundamental understanding, atom-by-atom and layer-by-layer, of the electronic structure of thin films and the connection to physical properties including electrical characteristics, lattice strain, stability, and superconductivity. Emphases will be placed on highly perfect, atomically uniform films that can now be routinely prepared. The proposed work will include spectroscopy measurements at the Synchrotron Radiation Center in Stoughton, Wisconsin, and x-ray measurements at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Integrated with the research effort is education and training of students and postdoctoral associates, as well as outreach to the broader community through publications, lectures, facilities tours, and collaborative projects.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
