<AbstractNarration>Undergraduate students who have a solid background in mathematics and some knowledge of computation will be engaged in an eight-week research experience in computational number theory and combinatorics to be held at Clemson University.  Members of underrepresented groups are particularly encouraged to apply.  Preference for four of these positions will be given to qualified applicants who have roots in the Southeastern United States, provided that there are a sufficient number of qualified applicants from this region.  The participants will be offered up to $400 in travel support, a dorm room to be shared with other participants in the REU, up to $800 for meals and a stipend of $2,900 in return for their participation in this program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants will be introduced to various tools, techniques and problems from computational number theory and combinatorics.  The participants will be divided into teams of two or three and will pick one problem on which to focus for the remainder of the REU.  The goal of the program is to help students attain a higher level of independence in mathematical research by giving them the opportunity to take part in a significant and interesting research project.  Students will also  be encouraged to attend appropriate conferences and present their work there. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a complement to working on their research, students will be required to attend a weekly lecture series.  These lectures will be given by faculty who have been recognized as leaders in the various fields related to the students' research problems and who have demonstrated the ability to clearly communicate mathematical ideas to audiences of varying levels of mathematical maturity.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Producing publishable research has always been a goal of past REUs at Clemson University.  Other equally important goals have been to give the participants an accurate experience of what being a professional mathematician is like, give them guidance if they feel this is a path they would like to pursue, and if they decide research is not for them, we provide advice on career paths in mathematics outside of academia.  While many REUs only accept participants that are already set on their career goal of being a professional mathematician, we take many students who are unsure of exactly how mathematics fits in their future career plans so this is a particularly important goal of our program.  Of the previous 86 participants in the REU program at Clemson University, 62 of them have gone on to enroll in graduate school or professional school.  Many of these students have attended top graduate schools in mathematics such as Harvard University, University of Chicago, and University of California - Berkeley.  We have also had several students decide to pursue degrees outside of mathematics such as law school and graduate work in psychology.  Of the 24 participants that did not attend graduate or professional school, eleven are still undergraduates or high school students.  The two high school students will be enrolling for college in the near future: one will be attending Yale University and the other the University of South Carolina.  Several of the nine that are still undergraduates are strongly considering or positive about attending graduate school.  One previous participant is participating in the SMALL REU this summer and another in the REU at Emory University.  We have also had five participants go on to become math teachers with one participating in Teach for America.  Our REU research has focused on topics from number theory and combinatorics.  We have had 42 participants be co-author on either a publication or a journal article that is currently in preparation.  Almost all of the other participants were co-authors on final reports that produced publishable research, but were unable to find the time after leaving the program to get the work published.  The publications provide another instance of vertical integration in our program as the graduate student mentors provide a great deal of guidance and assistance not only in advising the research, but helping the participants write-up their results and submitting them for publication.
