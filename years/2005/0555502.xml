    <AbstractNarration>P.I.: David Ruth&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0555502&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;California-based glass sculptor, David Ruth will travel to Palmer Station on the peninsula of Antarctica to examine the geology of ice in its many forms. His research in Antarctica will allow him to gain an understanding of how best to duplicate and synthesize the look of Antarctic ice in cast glass. Ruth's many years of experience in sculpting glass has lead him to enlist the help of scientists and engineers to develop revolutionary techniques for working with glass. His innovative approaches have allowed him to push the limits in his medium with a body of work that includes both ephemeral personal sculpture and more site-specific, client designed architectural work. Ruth's project, Antarctic Ice: Sculpture in Cast Glass, will focus on Antarctic ice and how it can be imitated, resulting in a large-scale sculptures that will give public viewers a more realistic sense of the scale and texture of Antarctic ice formations, typically only seen in photographs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The artist's work will allow viewers the opportunity to experience large ice-like formations first hand, which will be available in several shows at major galleries as well as the Oakland Museum in California. Additionally, the artist will teach workshops about his study in Antarctica and give public lectures on the subject. The artist's writings have been published in various artistic journals, something he will also pursue in conjunction with this project.
