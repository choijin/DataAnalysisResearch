<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;         Stein's method is a remarkable and largely unexplored&lt;br/&gt;        technique for proving approximation and limit theorems in&lt;br/&gt;        probability, and the investigator hopes to develop versions of&lt;br/&gt;        it which can be used to solve problems of interest to&lt;br/&gt;        researchers in algebra, probability, and statistics. More&lt;br/&gt;        precisely, there are five specific problems of interest the&lt;br/&gt;        investigator would like to solve. The first problem is to use&lt;br/&gt;        Stein's method to prove approximations to the Tracy-Widom&lt;br/&gt;        distribution (whose merit lies in its applications to random&lt;br/&gt;        matrix theory, tiling problems, percolation, queuing theory,&lt;br/&gt;        and much else). The second problem is to continue the&lt;br/&gt;        investigator's work on Stein's method and the spectrum of&lt;br/&gt;        random walks. The third problem is to use Stein's method to&lt;br/&gt;        prove approximations to the semicircle distribution (the free&lt;br/&gt;        probability analog of the normal distribution). The fourth&lt;br/&gt;        problem is to use Stein's method to bound convergence rates of&lt;br/&gt;        Markov chains, building on ideas of Diaconis. The fifth problem is&lt;br/&gt;        to prove chi-squared approximation for contingency tables with&lt;br/&gt;        fixed row and column sums, which would be quite valuable because&lt;br/&gt;        such approximations are frequently used in statistical work even&lt;br/&gt; though their accuracy is poorly understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  In making decisions of public policy, it is important&lt;br/&gt;        that one draws correct conclusions from the data available. A&lt;br/&gt;        drawback to many of the statistical methods applied today is that&lt;br/&gt;        the accuracy of the conclusions is unclear. As one example, in&lt;br/&gt;        determining whether there is gender bias in the promotion of&lt;br/&gt;        employees, it is common to use a statistical test called the&lt;br/&gt;        chi-squared test. As a second example, work on DNA sequences of&lt;br/&gt;        interest to biotechnology and health uses Poisson approximations&lt;br/&gt;        from probability theory. As a third example, in physics and&lt;br/&gt;        chemistry one uses Markov chain methods to test theoretical&lt;br/&gt;        models. These methods are routinely applied so it is important to&lt;br/&gt;        quantify their validity. A remarkable technique, introduced by Charles&lt;br/&gt;        Stein at Stanford, offers hope of better quantifying the accuracy&lt;br/&gt;        of such procedures. Stein's method has proven successful in&lt;br/&gt;        applications to DNA sequencing, but the technique is largely&lt;br/&gt;        unexplored. The investigator plans to extend the scope and&lt;br/&gt;        applicability of this method. As a final goal, the investigator&lt;br/&gt;        plans to study the use of Stein's method in Markov chain theory,&lt;br/&gt;        which as mentioned above, is crucial to drawing reliable&lt;br/&gt;        conclusions from computer simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
