<AbstractNarration>Alectra is a group of around 30 species of herbaceous parasitic plants that occur primarily in southern/eastern Africa and Madagascar. Species of Alectra parasitize grasses or cultivated legumes. Two types of parasitism exist within flowering plants (semi- and full-parasitism), and within Alectra both types are known; this situation is unique and allows for an examination of the evolutionary shift between the two habits. Full parasitism results in plants no longer producing their own food and losing their green pigmentation and leaves, while semi-parasites retain green leaves and only obtain water and nutrients from their "host" plant. Thorough examination of floral, stem and leaf characteristics, in combination with DNA sequences, will be utilized to examine the evolutionary history of this group. Additionally, as Alectra belongs to a completely parasitic family of plants, the evolution of genes involved in the photosynthetic (food-producing) pathway will be examined for degradation in the fully parasitic members of this family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves collaborations with scientists and researchers in countries within southern/eastern Africa and Madagascar. All parties involved will learn about the practical aspects of conserving rare and threatened habitats and the plants within them. The production of dichotomous keys, species descriptions and illustrations will facilitate identification of rare Alectra species in the wild, and this information will be available to the public via the World Wide Web, making it easier for local management authorities and conservation agencies to protect them.</AbstractNarration>
