<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0540236&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Robert D. Friedman, Peter S. Ozsvath&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal for a four-day-long, broad conference at&lt;br/&gt;Columbia University on "Topology, Geometry, and Physics.'' The&lt;br/&gt;conference will focus on the following major themes, and their&lt;br/&gt;interconnections: hyperbolic manifolds and geometrization gauge&lt;br/&gt;theory, three- and four-manifolds, Hodge theory, and interactions&lt;br/&gt;between mathematics and modern physics. Such a conference is&lt;br/&gt;particularly timely, in view of the many breakthroughs in each of&lt;br/&gt;these subjects. In particular, the recent spectacular work of&lt;br/&gt;Perelman on the Poincare conjecture and Thurston's geometrization&lt;br/&gt;conjecture, as well as new developments in hyperbolic geometry,&lt;br/&gt;make this an especially opportune moment to survey the new&lt;br/&gt;landscape of three-manifold theory. At the same time, new&lt;br/&gt;techniques of gauge theory and new combinatorial methods have&lt;br/&gt;deepened the current understanding of three- and four-manifolds&lt;br/&gt;and it is time to take stock of these developments and their&lt;br/&gt;relation to other work in the field. Many of the new results in&lt;br/&gt;geometric topology have been based upon ideas arising in&lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics and geometric analysis, and these kind of&lt;br/&gt;interactions will serve as a unifying theme for the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental problem in mathematics is to describe all possible&lt;br/&gt;shapes. In the case of surfaces (two dimensional objects),&lt;br/&gt;possible shapes include a sphere (the surface of the earth, for&lt;br/&gt;example), a torus (the surface of a tire) and more complicated&lt;br/&gt;generalizations. A great deal of research has been concerned with&lt;br/&gt;dimension three, the dimension of space, and dimension four, the&lt;br/&gt;dimension of space-time.  Because of its relevance to&lt;br/&gt;understanding our physical world, understanding all possible&lt;br/&gt;shapes in these dimensions is particularly&lt;br/&gt;important. Paradoxically, these cases are much harder to&lt;br/&gt;understand and to classify than higher-dimensional objects (which&lt;br/&gt;in turn are much harder to visualize in any meaningful way). The&lt;br/&gt;study of dimensions three and four has drawn on a rich variety of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical and physical ideas. Recent work of a Russian&lt;br/&gt;mathematician, G.  Perelman, seems to confirm one of the famous&lt;br/&gt;outstanding conjectures of topology, the Poincare conjecture&lt;br/&gt;(which gives a complete characterization of the three dimensional&lt;br/&gt;analogue of a sphere), as well as a profound generalization of&lt;br/&gt;this conjecture, the geometrization conjecture of Thurston, which&lt;br/&gt;gives in principle a scheme whereby one could describe all&lt;br/&gt;possible three-dimensional shapes. A major goal of this&lt;br/&gt;conference is to understand these new ideas, as well as other&lt;br/&gt;recent work in dimensions three and four, and to evaluate our new&lt;br/&gt;understanding of geometry and topology in these dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
