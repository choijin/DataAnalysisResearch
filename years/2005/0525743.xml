<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL: This grant supports a workshop of scientists who are not only using field ion microscopy and atom-probe tomography, but also STEM, HREM, and AFM to discuss the development of atomic resolution techniques. This workshop is aimed at a young audience, as it is essential that we preserve the intellectual history of this activity.  The observation of individual atoms is basic to a great deal of current and future scientific activity in a broad range of disciplines.  The workshop takes place at the Pennsylvania State University on June 15th to 17th, 2005, hosted by the Pennsylvania State University Physics Department in association with the International Field Emission Society (IFES). Topics to be addressed at the workshop are: (1) A history of achievement and ultimate development of atomic resolution by FIM; (2) Applications of FIM to surface science; (3) Origin of atom probe FIM and early applications in materials science and engineering; (4) Later improvements and present state-of-the-art in APFIM and applications; (5) Atomic and sub-atomic resolution STEM, atomic resolution HREM, atomic resolution STM, and atomic force microscopy (AFM); and (6) Applications of atomic resolution microscopy in surface and materials science.  NONTECHNICAL: The conference commemorates the ability to view individual atoms in the structure of a solid material. For the first time in history, atoms were no longer merely a theoretical construct, but an experimental reality observable using a field-ion microscope (FIM). Atomic resolution commenced on October 11th, 1955, at the Pennsylvania State University with the achievement of lattice atomic resolution by Professor Erwin W. Mueller's FIM. Thus the year 2005, in addition to being the World Year of Physics, will be the 50th anniversary of atomic resolution microscopy. This was many years before observations of atoms by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HREM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were achieved. All of these microscopies benefited directly or indirectly from Erwin Mueller's early research in field electron microscopy (FEM), the precursor to FIM. The workshop brings together leading scientists from around the world who are using these microscopies. The workshop includes young research scientists to further excite their enthusiasm for using a broad range of atomic resolution techniques for application to many different problems in materials science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
