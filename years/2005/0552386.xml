<AbstractNarration>The Laboratory for Elementary-Particle Physics (LEPP) at Cornell University will provide 10 undergraduates with the excitement and challenge of frontier research and with opportunities to acquire new skills and meet researchers at all stages of their careers. Supported by NSF, the Laboratory has an international reputation for research, with a unique constellation of programs including elementary particle physics, accelerator physics, synchrotron radiation research, and microwave superconductivity. The student participants have full access to the resources of the Laboratory and University and work on projects that advance LEPP's scientific mission. Some projects may also center on Cornell's new association with the CMS experiment at CERN. Although LEPP research is focused on understanding fundamental physics, the techniques and technologies utilized are applicable in a much wider range of scientific research. The undergraduate researchers in this program work closely with physicists and participate in seminars, lectures, facility tours, and activities that promote interactions among them. Group housing is provided through Cornell for the participants in this program. The LEPP REU Site program is also linked to the Wayne State University REU/RET programs which use LEPP facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
