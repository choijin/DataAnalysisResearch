<AbstractNarration>The core of an ideal in a commutative ring encodes information about all&lt;br/&gt;possible reductions of the ideal. It also has a close connection to&lt;br/&gt;Briancon-Skoda type theorems and to a conjecture by Kawamata about&lt;br/&gt;sections of line bundles. The proposer intends to further explore this&lt;br/&gt;interplay by studying the relation between cores and adjoints or&lt;br/&gt;multiplier ideals. Having worked on a formula for the core in&lt;br/&gt;equicharacteristic zero, he wishes to obtain a similar explicit expression&lt;br/&gt;in positive characteristic, where the shape of the core is markedly&lt;br/&gt;different. Likewise he would like to find a combinatorial description for&lt;br/&gt;the core of monomial ideals. The investigator plans to continue his work&lt;br/&gt;on blowup algebras of ideals, most notably of zero-dimensional ideals in&lt;br/&gt;regular local rings. He asks whether the quasi-Gorenstein property of the&lt;br/&gt;extended Rees algebra implies the Gorensteinness of the associated graded&lt;br/&gt;ring. He also suggests that the normality or Cohen-Macaulayness of the&lt;br/&gt;special fiber ring of a Gorenstein ideal may force the ideal to be a&lt;br/&gt;complete intersection. On a more computational note, he addresses the&lt;br/&gt;problem of constructing the integral closure of algebras, in particular of&lt;br/&gt;Rees algebras. Passing to the integral closure of the Rees algebra of an&lt;br/&gt;ideal is the first step towards resolution of singularities and the only&lt;br/&gt;known general method for computing the integral closure of the ideal. The&lt;br/&gt;proposer wishes to estimate the complexity of this process by finding bounds&lt;br/&gt;on the number of generators of the integral closure, the degrees of the&lt;br/&gt;generators and the number of steps required in the computation. As another&lt;br/&gt;measure of complexity he plans to study the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity&lt;br/&gt;of powers and symmetric powers of homogeneous ideals having dimension at&lt;br/&gt;most one. He expects that estimates on the regularity do not only persist&lt;br/&gt;when the ideal is raised to powers, but that they actually improve. Similar&lt;br/&gt;improved bounds for the regularity of symmetric powers would help finding&lt;br/&gt;the equations of Rees algebras and thereby lead to efficient algorithms in&lt;br/&gt;elimination theory. The proposer also intends to continue his work on&lt;br/&gt;generalized principal ideal theorems. The goal is to bound the codimension&lt;br/&gt;and prove connectedness properties for degeneracy loci of maps of modules&lt;br/&gt;that are not necessarily free; here one has to assume that the maps are not&lt;br/&gt;`too generic'. The investigator proposes a weak version of this condition&lt;br/&gt;by introducing a notion of ampleness for modules over local rings. He&lt;br/&gt;hopes to prove principal ideal theorems that only require the weaker&lt;br/&gt;assumption, thus generalizing the known results in both local algebra and&lt;br/&gt;projective geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator works in Commutative Algebra, an area concerned with the&lt;br/&gt;qualitative study of systems of polynomial equations in several variables.&lt;br/&gt;Such systems arise in numerous applications outside of mathematics. Over&lt;br/&gt;the past two decades commutative algebraists have become increasingly&lt;br/&gt;interested in computational aspects, thereby emphasizing connections to&lt;br/&gt;applied areas such as computer algebra, robotics, cryptography and coding&lt;br/&gt;theory. This investigator's research too has a strong computational&lt;br/&gt;component.&lt;br/&gt;Part of the project involving the  collaboration with mathematicians in Brazil is funded by the NSF&lt;br/&gt;Office of International Science and Engineering &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
