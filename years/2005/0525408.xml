<AbstractNarration>This study is investigating postsecondary degree program cultures in a strategically selected sample of Florida State University System (SUS) schools and Florida Community Colleges. Specifically, the project is comparing and contrasting STEM programs that are successful with those that are not as successful in graduating underrepresented populations in STEM fields. College degree program culture is measured using mixed methods and at multiple levels employing both qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques. This research is guided by the following questions:&lt;br/&gt;1. What contextual (e.g., cultural/climate) factors in STEM programs affect students' motivation and ability to successfully complete college degrees in these areas?&lt;br/&gt;2. Do these factors differentially impact female students and members of underrepresented minorities?&lt;br/&gt;3. How do students' self-reported reasons for leaving a STEM program compare with&lt;br/&gt;objective, independent measures of the program climate/culture?&lt;br/&gt;4. Which specific culture/climate differences between programs and schools are&lt;br/&gt;associated with these programs' success graduating females and minority students?&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The research represents the state-of-the-art in organizational culture and climate research. As such, it has the potential not only to contribute to the knowledge base concerning education and STEM careers, but also to contribute more broadly to the literature on organizational culture and climate and the ways in which they affect important organizational outcomes. The measurement of culture is difficult and time consuming, and this diverse team of anthropologists, industrial psychologists and sociologists is uniquely qualified to collect high quality program culture information. By building on the team's current research using archival databases in Florida, this research can be conducted efficiently as well. Finally, and most importantly, the current state of knowledge concerning how STEM programs affect a student's motivation and ability to complete STEM programs is limited, even though it is widely believed that the program context is important. The research will result in a comprehensive understanding of those aspects of the culture, climate, and practices in STEM departments and degree programs that support and enhance student retention and STEM degree completion, particularly for members of underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The research questions being addressed in this study have implications for higher education policy throughout the U.S., in terms of developing interventions that focus on improving degree program culture and other contextual factors to increase undergraduate students' interests in and ability to obtain degrees in STEM fields. The research also bridges research with practice by developing a partnership between USF education researchers and the Florida-Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, a program focused on increasing numbers of STEM bachelor's degree recipients. In addition, since women and minorities are the fastest growing sectors of the U.S. workforce, it is imperative to attract and maintain their interest in STEM education and careers.  Results of this research will provide the knowledge base needed to improve interventions that seek to increase STEM student recruitment and retention, particularly for women and minorities, and this can promote a healthy economy by ensuring a diverse and well-qualified STEM workforce. Results will be disseminated widely not only to the academic community but also directly to the educators and policy makers who are working to build the future STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
