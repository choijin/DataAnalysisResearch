    <AbstractNarration>Asymptotic equivalence theory has emerged as a growing new area of &lt;br/&gt;mathematical statistics research. The purpose of this project is to &lt;br/&gt;describe the asymptotic behavior of some nonparametric curve estimation &lt;br/&gt;models, which have distributions that depend on a smooth function f(x). &lt;br/&gt;For each of these nonparametric models, the investigator derives a &lt;br/&gt;limiting model that can be used as an asymptotic approximation, such &lt;br/&gt;that inference in the original experiment can be performed under the &lt;br/&gt;limiting experiment without loss of information. Many regular &lt;br/&gt;nonparametric models have been shown to be approximable in the limit by &lt;br/&gt;a Gaussian white-noise-with-drift experiment which observes a Brownian &lt;br/&gt;motion plus a mean that depends on f(x). In this project, the &lt;br/&gt;investigator considers extensions of the regular nonparametric problem &lt;br/&gt;to include nuisance parameters such as an unknown variance or an unknown &lt;br/&gt;distribution of sample points. The limiting experiments in these cases &lt;br/&gt;contain a secondary component that describes the nuisance parameter, and &lt;br/&gt;this demonstrates that the estimation of f(x) can be separated from &lt;br/&gt;other unknowns in the problems. The investigator also approximates &lt;br/&gt;nonparametric problems with two-dimensional sample spaces by a Brownian &lt;br/&gt;sheet process plus a mean. These asymptotic approximations allow the &lt;br/&gt;non-standard problems to be solved using techniques from the simpler &lt;br/&gt;Gaussian models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many areas of technology today, large sets of data that do not follow &lt;br/&gt;a typical pattern are difficult for scientists to analyze. This problem &lt;br/&gt;comes up in tasks such as interpreting medical images and signals, &lt;br/&gt;describing distributions of plant species, and analyzing financial &lt;br/&gt;series. In this project, the investigator transforms the problem into a &lt;br/&gt;form that can be solved by already existing statistical tools. As a &lt;br/&gt;result, existing methods of analysis can be applied to a wider range of &lt;br/&gt;technological problems. Thus the techniques developed by the &lt;br/&gt;investigator may be used to improve the efficiency of medical imaging, &lt;br/&gt;signal interpretation, financial analysis, and other applications.</AbstractNarration>
