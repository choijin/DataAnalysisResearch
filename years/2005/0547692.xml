<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes the PIs early career development plan for integrated research and education&lt;br/&gt;centered around the unified theme of cooperative systems design by a stochastic games approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: A cooperative system consists of a number of interacting (semi-)autonomous agents&lt;br/&gt;where each individual agent makes local decisions based on the local information available to optimize its own&lt;br/&gt;local objective. The purpose of designing such a cooperative system is to optimize a global objective which&lt;br/&gt;may be thought of as system designers objective. In other words, system designer seeks the optimization of&lt;br/&gt;its own objective through multiple agents that seek the optimization of their own individual self-objectives.&lt;br/&gt;Examples of cooperative systems include multi-vehicle search and rescue operations, multi-vehicle search&lt;br/&gt;and target assignment for military mission planning, multi-sensor deployment for anti-submarine warfare,&lt;br/&gt;and cooperative multi-user MIMO signaling in wireless communication systems. Stochastic games, which&lt;br/&gt;generalize Markov decision processes to multiple decision makers, emerge as the most natural framework to&lt;br/&gt;study cooperative systems. The main goals of the proposed work can be summarized as follows:&lt;br/&gt; Developing theoretical and computational tools for the analysis and synthesis of cooperative systems&lt;br/&gt;within the framework of stochastic games&lt;br/&gt; Demonstrating the value of the stochastic games approach in cooperative systems design to industry&lt;br/&gt;through new applications.&lt;br/&gt; Introducing the game theoretical methods for engineering to graduate and undergraduate students&lt;br/&gt;through new course development and application based multidisciplinary research projects.&lt;br/&gt;Making the subject accessible to a broad audience including traditionally under-represented groups&lt;br/&gt;and engineering community affiliated with the local industry throughout Hawaii islands using distance&lt;br/&gt;and web-based learning tools some of which are already available within University of Hawaii system.&lt;br/&gt;The basic premise of the proposed work is that the PIs postdoctoral research at UCLA, which led to significant&lt;br/&gt;insights to design of cooperative systems within the context of finite games, has the potential of&lt;br/&gt;breeding more breakthrough ideas to push the state of the art knowledge in cooperative systems to new&lt;br/&gt;frontiers by accomplishing the above goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact: Cooperative systems design is truly an inter-disciplinary topic that connects to a many&lt;br/&gt;real-world applications in such diverse areas as national security, telecommunications, transportation networks,&lt;br/&gt;and power systems. As such, the research and education activities delineated in this proposal would&lt;br/&gt;potentially make a positive impact on the lives of many citizens. More specifically, the university-industry&lt;br/&gt;collaborations are expected to help improve nations economy and create employment while contributing&lt;br/&gt;to national security. Another specific benefit of such collaborations in the area of transportation systems&lt;br/&gt;would be congestion reduction in heavily congested traffic systems using the design methods developed for&lt;br/&gt;cooperative systems as a result of the proposed research activities.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed educational activities are expected to make the subject of this proposal accessible to a&lt;br/&gt;broad audience including traditionally under-represented groups and engineering community affiliated with&lt;br/&gt;the local industry throughout Hawaii islands using distance and web-based learning tools. This would create&lt;br/&gt;more educational opportunities to those groups that have limited access to education. An interactive website&lt;br/&gt;that will be developed as part of this project is expected to increase public knowledge about game theory&lt;br/&gt;and its applications to cooperative systems design. Moreover, such a web-site is expected to intrigue curious&lt;br/&gt;K-12 students and help them in their career decisions by illustrating the significance of cooperative systems&lt;br/&gt;design through simulations and animations.&lt;br/&gt;A1</AbstractNarration>
