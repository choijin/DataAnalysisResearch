<AbstractNarration>This RUI proposal requests continuing support for a program of research on the possible violation of Lorentz symmetry, one of the basic axioms of modern physics, and of the CPT theorem, which guarantees that particles and anti-particles have precisely the same masses and exactly opposite electromagnetic properties. At present there is no evidence for the violation of these two symmetry properties, but string theory suggests that at the very high energy associated with the Planck scale, Lorentz symmetry may be spontaneously broken.The aim of the research is to examine the consequences of Lorentz Symmetry Violation (LSV) and the possible violation of CPT (CPTV) and develop experimental tests for them. Many of these tests can be performed at low energies in atomic and elementary particle systems. The PI has established an active collaboration with Prof. Alan Kostalecki, of Indiana University, a leader in this field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include the involvement of undergraduates at Colby College in the research and the general drawing together of teaching and research at the institution. This type of experience should encourage students to go on to graduate school in science. The general subject of the research also has popular appeal and articles about it have appeared in the popular press. The PI plans to give talks to general audiences about this field. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
