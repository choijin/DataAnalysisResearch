    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will utilize an innovative manufacturing process to fabricate components used in high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). This innovative manufacturing process is based on a patented extrusion freeform fabrication (EFF) technique that is used for the production of complex shaped and highly loaded ceramics, polymers, and metals. EFF can be tailored to the selected polymer rheology and processing properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader (commercial) impacts from this manufacturing method is the ability to produce at low cost, complex shaped and customized components for PEMFC with improved properties and performance compared to the current conventional polymer processing techniques. The manufacturing process will contribute to making the country's manufacturing base more competitive through innovation and responsiveness to a future societal need for an alternative and environmentally friendly energy. It will also enable the fabrication of value-added polymers that could find applications in a broad range of engineering applications.</AbstractNarration>
