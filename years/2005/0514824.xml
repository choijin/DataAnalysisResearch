<AbstractNarration>This proposal is to continue a 25-year long study of demography and social behavior of cliff swallows  in southwestern Nebraska.  We will monitor survival, dispersal, and colony choice for a sample of marked birds that now numbers 158,373 individuals.  This information will be applied to ongoing investigations of swallow population biology that incorporate study of the effect of group size, and will also be used to study the long-term consequences of two rare climatic events that occurred in the study area in 1996 and 2004.  Severe weather of the timing and magnitude of these events has occurred in southwestern Nebraska only twice in the last 130 years.  Data gathered will be applied to work on (1) the ecology and evolution of a virus associated with cliff swallows and their ectoparasites, in which we are studying how often this encephalitis-related virus is transmitted between colonies within the study area by birds, how colony use in a given year is related to prevalence of virus, whether bird movement is related to patterns of evolutionary divergence of virus subtypes within the study area, and how the virus affects survival of marked cliff swallows within and between years and thus to what degree it represents a disadvantage of living in colonies; and (2) morphological evolution and natural selection on breeding time, in which we are studying evolutionary changes in body size and extent of bilateral asymmetry in wings and tail brought about by the rare climatic events, and whether the widespread nesting failures in the 2004 breeding season will exert selection on breeding time and lead to earlier egg-laying in the population in successive generations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      Arrthorpod-borne viruses include many that affect humans (e.g., West Nile virus, eastern equine encephalitis, western equine encephalitis).  Many of these require a bird host in order to sustain themselves in natural ecosystems.  Thus, understanding the spread of these viruses, and thus the potential for them to cause epidemics in humans or domestic livestock, can depend on our knowing the degree to which these viruses can replicate in wild birds and how the ecology of birds contributes to disease persistence.      Buggy Creek virus is a virus pathogen very similar to western equine encephalitis virus, and this class of viruses is known to severely affect humans and livestock.  Buggy Creek virus is associated with cliff swallows and house sparrows that often nest in large colonies and occur in proximity to humans.  This research used long-term information on the behavior and ecology of these bird hosts to understand more about the ecology and evolution of this pathogen.  Its ability to overwinter in bird colonies, the extent to which the different bird species replicate it, the extent to which it moves between colonies, and the extent to which it has diverged evolutionarily in different locales were studied.  This pathogen appears well adapted to the natural ecosystem it inhabits and appears benign to cliff swallows under normal conditions, but the arrival of the invasive house sparrow in these areas has perturbed the system.  House sparrows are unusually effective amplifiers of the virus, and consequently it is now more prevalent in many areas than before house sparrow colonization.  The virus also appears to have evolved greater virulence in response to its being exposed to house sparrows.  Because house sparrows often occur near people, their exposure to Buggy Creek virus has increased the chances that this pathogen will be detected in humans.      This research also investigated rapid evolutionary changes in bird morphology..  An unusual climatic event in 1996 killed about 50% of the cliff swallows in the Nebraska study area, and those that survived were larger  (as measured by skeletal size) than those that died.  By following the population in the 10 years after this event, we determined that these evolutionary changes appeared to be permanent:  the larger-sized birds have persisted, and there has been no evidence that selection has favored smaller birds in the years after the climatic event.  This study illustrates how evolutionary changes can occur relatively rapidly in contemporary time.       Last Modified: 11/17/2011       Submitted by: Charles R Brown]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
