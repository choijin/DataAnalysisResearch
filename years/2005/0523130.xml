    <AbstractNarration>This international doctoral dissertation enhancement project will provide a U.S. graduate student and an undergraduate research assistant an opportunity to work in the Republic of Georgia. The general focus of their research is on environmental factors determining the upper elevation limit observed for forest trees. The principal investigators are William K. Smith from Wake Forest University and Maia Akhalkatski from the Institute of Botany in Tbilsi, Georgia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most previous research on the ecological or physiological factors responsible for maintaining tree lines has focused on older saplings or mature trees. Recent studies have shown that young, newly emerged seedlings may suffer the greatest mortality, by far, of all life stages. High mountain plants have always received special attention at the Institute of Botany in Georgia because mountainous regions dominate the country. The Department of Ecology of the Institute of Botany has recently been re-oriented to emphasize the reproductive ecology of plants in extreme environments. This research specifically focuses on seedling establishment in Betula litwinowii, with and without association with Rhododendron caucasicum in the Greater Caucasus mountain range of Georgia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project in environmental biology will provide a U.S. graduate student and an undergraduate research assistant access to unique research specialties that are not available in the U.S. - as much of the research on tree line questions originated in Europe and Eurasia. This project also fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central Europe and Eurasia to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.</AbstractNarration>
