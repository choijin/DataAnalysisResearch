<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funding for the partial travel support of young physicists from U.S. institutions who wish to participate in the 2005 Les Houches Workshop.  A series of workshops titled "Physics at TeV Colliders" has been held at the Centre of Physics of Les Houches every two years starting in 1999. These 10-day workshops have created an atmosphere where some of the leading experimentalists and phenomenologists have explored the physics potential of both the Tevatron and of the LHC. In addition to the approximately 400 page writeups from each of the three workshops, a number of Les Houches "accords" have been produced which have had a profound effect on the manner in which theoretical predictions for collider phenomenology have been generated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops have also had a strong pedagogical component. In addition to the senior physicists discussed above, a number of younger physicists, graduate students and postdocs, have also participated. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
