<AbstractNarration>Molecules in Space: A Symposium  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST 0553919 Herbst&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Eric Herbst, at the Ohio State University, will organize a symposium on Molecules in Space at the 26-30 March 2006 national meeting of the American Chemical Society, in Atlanta, GA. Astrochemistry is of importance in an era when new and better telescopes provide for more detailed observations of molecules in assorted environments, and progress requires the study of the unusual chemistry of molecules found in regions with physical conditions far different from those on our planet. This symposium will run for four full days, and have 32 invited talks as well as contributed oral and poster presentations. The cross-disciplinary nature of this symposium provides for broader impact, as does the involvement of foreign speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
