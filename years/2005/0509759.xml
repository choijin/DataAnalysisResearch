<AbstractNarration>Pyrak-Nolte&lt;br/&gt;0509759&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal challenge of upscaling techniques for multi-phase fluid dynamics in porous&lt;br/&gt;media is to determine which properties on the micro-scale can be used to predict macroscopic&lt;br/&gt;flow and the spatial distribution of fluid phases at core- and field-scales. First-principles&lt;br/&gt;theoretical formulations over the past decade have been derived from volume averaging&lt;br/&gt;theorems in which microscopic interfacial behavior is explicitly incorporated. These theories have&lt;br/&gt;proposed that interfacial area per volume directly affects macroscopic behavior, and that this&lt;br/&gt;variable may govern the observed hysteresis in the capillary pressure - saturation relationship.&lt;br/&gt;The scientific objective of this proposal is to measure the evolution of interfaces among&lt;br/&gt;multiple phases in a porous medium. Two- and three-dimensional micro-models will be used to&lt;br/&gt;directly image and quantify the behavior of the interfacial geometry while concurrently measuring&lt;br/&gt;fluid pressures (globally and locally) and fluid flow. The specific scientific goals are: (a) to&lt;br/&gt;determine if an ensemble-averaged relationship among capillary pressure, saturation and&lt;br/&gt;interfacial area per volume may be universal for statistically similar pore distributions, (b) to&lt;br/&gt;quantify the relationship between interfacial geometry, saturation and relative permeability for&lt;br/&gt;steady-state flow conditions, and (c) to determine if the relaxation coefficient associated with&lt;br/&gt;dynamic flow conditions depends on the evolution of the interfacial geometry with time. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, we propose to revolutionize the use of micro-models in the study of fluids in porous&lt;br/&gt;media in two ways: (a) the incorporation of local probes into two-dimensional micro-models to&lt;br/&gt;measure local pressures; and (b) the development of a new two-photon lithographic technique for&lt;br/&gt;creating transparent three-dimensional micro-models that can be directly imaged by using laser&lt;br/&gt;confocal microscopy.&lt;br/&gt;Merit  Criteria:&lt;br/&gt;1. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is the acquisition of explicit data sets&lt;br/&gt;connecting interfacial areas, and other relevant geometric micro-scale data, with macroscopic&lt;br/&gt;hydraulic properties on truly three-dimensional micro-models. The proposed combination of&lt;br/&gt;experimental methods and analysis will make it possible for the first time to answer the principal&lt;br/&gt;question of which microscopic properties are most useful for predicting macroscopic flow&lt;br/&gt;properties of a porous medium.&lt;br/&gt;2. The broader impact from the proposed activity will be confirmation/disproof of theoretical&lt;br/&gt;methods used for addressing the prediction of flow and distributions of multiple fluids in a porous&lt;br/&gt;medium which affects applications in oil, gas and water production, ground water protection,&lt;br/&gt;chemical mixing and processing in chemical engineering, and in porous tissue applications of&lt;br/&gt;biology and bioengineering. Our outreach objective is three-fold: (1) To train and educate&lt;br/&gt;graduate and undergraduate students in the science of laboratory research; (2) To work with&lt;br/&gt;science education majors to develop hands-on experiments for grades 7-12; and (3) To integrate&lt;br/&gt;the hands-on experiments into our Physics Outreach Program which reaches students in grades&lt;br/&gt;7-12, as well as parents and teachers throughout Indiana.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
