<AbstractNarration>NONLINEAR PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Lawrence Craig Evans&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to analyze the properties of solutions of certain classes of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE).  One class is "Weak KAM" theory which studies far-from-integrable Hamiltonian systems, using variational and PDE  methods to identify certain classes of well-behaved trajectories, associated with  action minimizing measures. New PDE approaches will try to discover, for instance, the full implications of nonresonance conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another class of problems is the regularity of solutions of the infinity Laplacian equation and Aronsson's equation. These highly degenerate, highly nonlinear equations model variational problems in the sup-norm as well as certain random-turn stochastic games. A major goal here will be to prove that weak solutions are continuously differentiable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will also investigate a  "lakes and rivers" PDE model.  This is a singular limit of a certain nonlinear parabolic diffusion equation, which has a simple interpretation: the limiting solution either hugs a given landscape or else forms flat ``lakes'' connected by ``rivers''. The technical challenge will be to develop PDE and measure theory tools to understand and predict the location of the "lakes and rivers".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will also explore the use of certain entropy type inequalities to study the asymptotic limit of a regularized nonlinear diffusion equation. We expect that for a nonmonotone linearity this asymptotic limit should develop hysteresis effects, called   dynamic phase transitions.  A different and quite speculative undertaking is to develop for fully nonlinear PDE some kind of analog of the important kinetic formulation for conservation laws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These various PDE arise in a variety of settings including physics, game theory and image processing, so the results should be of  importance in many  application areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
