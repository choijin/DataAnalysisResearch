<AbstractNarration>The basic science goal of Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) is to understand the physics of the Southern California fault system and encode this understanding in a system-level model that can predict salient aspects of earthquake behavior. Southern California's network of several hundred active faults forms a superb natural laboratory for the study of earthquake physics. Its seismic, geodetic, and geologic data are among the best in the world. Moreover, Southern California contains 23 million people, so that high seismic hazard translates to nearly one-half of the national earthquake risk. The Center's tripartite mission statement emphasizes the connections between information gathering, knowledge formulation through physics-based modeling, and public communication of hazard and risk. An important part of SCEC's mission is to increase the diversity of its scientific workforce; SCEC values diversity in all aspects of its activities. Created in 1991, SCEC has since expanded to 54 institutions involving over 560 scientists. The core institutions, currently 15, are committed to SCEC's mission and offer sustained support for its programs; the participating institutions, currently 39, are self-nominated through their members' participation. The Center is open to any credible scientist from any research institution interested in collaborating on the problems of earthquake science. However, SCEC is structured to achieve prioritized science objectives within the Southern California Natural Laboratory, and resources are allocated accordingly.</AbstractNarration>

The latter has been enabled by a new cyberinfrastructure for physics-based seismic hazard analysis that comprises a complementary and interactive set of high-performance computational platforms. These vertically integrated platforms are now capable of executing the principal computational pathways of earthquake system science on NSF and other national supercomputers at unprecedented resolution, with outer-scale/inner-scale ratios up to 1017.        Through integrated studies of earthquake processes, SCEC has worked with its principal agency partners&mdash;the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the California Geological Survey&mdash;to translate this basic geoscience and computational research into practical products that can reduce seismic risk and improve community resilience to earthquake disasters. A steadily improving series of Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecasts (UCERFs) has been developed on the OpenSHA platform by the Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities (2008, 2012) in response to requests from the California Earthquake Authority and the National Seismic Hazard Mapping Project. The CyberShake ground-motion prediction platform is now capable of running, processing, and archiving the very large suites (~106) of earthquake simulations needed for the probabilistic calculations of physics-based seismic hazard analysis. CyberShake has produced the first comprehensive, simulation-based hazard models for the Los Angeles region. These models are being extended statewide, and they are being coupled to structural models of the built environment developed by NSFÆs earthquake engineer research centers, with the goal of achieving a "rupture-to-rafters" simulation capability that will aid in the design of earthquake-resilient communities.        Meta-organizations fostered and administered by SCEC, such as the statewide Earthquake Country Alliance and the 60-institution EPIcenters program of informal education, have provided entirely new venues for helping the public understand and deal with seismic risks.

One transformative activity that binds together this diverse assemblage of expertise is the Great ShakeOut drills. These annual earthquake preparedness exercises, which have been developed by SCEC and its partners since 2008, now involve millions of people across the United States and in other several other countries, including Canada, New Zealand, Italy, and Japan.
