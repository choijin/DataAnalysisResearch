<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 04-043, category NER.  The objectives of this research are to explore an innovative approach in developing a nanotechnology-based cooling device being capable of removing high heat flux for cooling the next generation computer chips, and to nurture a new generation of young engineers in nanoscience/engineering.   The approaches employed in this project include plasma nanocoating technology to fabricate self-dispersing nanoparticles for stable nanofluids and nanofluids Oscillating Heat Pipes (OHPs).  The exploration of plasma nanocoating technology will focus the surface modification of nanoparticles with targeted functions including the effects of  plasma chemistry, coating nature and uniformity, and surface functionalities on improving dispersity of nanoparticles and consequently on stability and heat conductivity of nanofluids.  The pioneering research of nanofluid OHPs will integrate the ultra-high thermal conductivity of nanofluids, high heat transfer coefficient of thin film evaporation, and heat enhancement of oscillating motion into one nanotechnology-based cooling device for high heat flux removal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary project presents a unique opportunity to explore the frontiers of nanoscience/engineering for intelligent design and development of new-generation heat transfer fluids and cooling devices. Fabrication of the novel nanofluid OHPs will unleash the computing power needed to meet the high demands in scientific computing, image analysis, and remote sensing.  Life-science-related research will also benefit from the nanotechnology-based rapid cooling to protect the cells/tissues by eliminating ice formation and solute damage.  Cross-trained by experts in a combined setting of academia, national laboratory and industry, the students involved in this project will be tailored to form much broader visions than those for supporting their discipline-specific research alone.  Most importantly, the students will be trained to plan for and perform independent research on different sets of constraints and criteria in demonstrating their excellence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
