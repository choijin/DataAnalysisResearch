<AbstractNarration>This Third International Conference on Microstructology advances the science of microstructural-related materials research. Particular areas of concentration include stereology, computer simulation, three-dimensional reconstruction, and modeling of mechanical deformation and physical processes, such as recrystallization, grain growth, and sintering. Invited presentations by approximately 30 leading researchers in these areas are complimented by adequate discussion after each talk. A relaxed conference style format, with afternoons available for interaction among the attendees, should greatly aid discussion and debate. Of special scientific importance is the Rhines Memorial Lecture on Microstructology, a keynote address by a renowned scientist in the field of microstructure-related research. This lecture honors Dr. Frederick N. Rhines, who conceived the First Microstructology Conference many years ago. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the conference include expanding the microstructure knowledge base to graduate students and young faculty. Since the conference format enables extensive discussion, both within and outside of the technical sessions, opportunities are provided for the transfer of expert information to the younger participants and the creation of new collaborations. The conference plan is to invite approximately 50 students and young faculty.  Schools with extensive minority student populations with ties to UAB will be specifically targeted for invitation. Registration fees will be waived for graduate students and young faculty in need of aid. A standing poster display that includes non-speakers is planned for a "commons" area where attendees can mingle and discuss posters with the authors. The availability of this display during the week provides a good opportunity for new researchers to gain insights from experts in the field.   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
