<AbstractNarration>0510830&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Extensive sediment transport research has been accomplished primarily in&lt;br/&gt;steady flow, although significant amounts of sediment movement occur in unsteady flow.&lt;br/&gt;Despite some early attempts, sediment transport in unsteady flow remains an open research&lt;br/&gt;question in hydrologic sciences, mainly due to the inherent mathematical complexities in the&lt;br/&gt;fully coupled flow and sediment equations, and the technical difficulties encountered in&lt;br/&gt;experimental measurements. Availability of a more sophisticated mathematical approach (Tsai&lt;br/&gt;2002, 2003, 2005 and Tsai and Yen 2001, 2003; Tsai and Kuai 2004 a,b; Kuai et al. 2004)&lt;br/&gt;suggests that it is time to revisit the problem of sediment transport in unsteady flow. Success of&lt;br/&gt;this pilot study would pave the way for a new approach to investigating the coupling of water&lt;br/&gt;and sediment movement and to experimenting with transport of sediment in highly unsteady&lt;br/&gt;flows such as dam-break induced floods.&lt;br/&gt;Research Hypotheses and Scientific Objectives: The major objectives of this basic research are&lt;br/&gt;to quantify the time-varying changes in water- and bed-surface elevation and sediment&lt;br/&gt;concentration associated with the passage of a dam-break induced flood and to examine the&lt;br/&gt;validity of the quasi-steady uniform flow assumption in unsteady sediment transport modeling.&lt;br/&gt;The basic hypotheses guiding the proposed research are that time dependence of inflow&lt;br/&gt;hydrograph affects sediment transport so that standard steady flow formulas will not provide&lt;br/&gt;accurate estimates of sediment discharge, and that when analyzing the hydraulic response of a&lt;br/&gt;bed to rapidly changing inflow hydrographs, the time scale of interest concerning bed elevation&lt;br/&gt;may no longer be long compared to that of the flow so that only fully coupled models of flow&lt;br/&gt;and sediment equations would properly characterize the phenomena. The work proposed here is&lt;br/&gt;considered the first phase of our unsteady sediment transport research. Specifically, this research&lt;br/&gt;aims to address the following issues: (1) For the simulation of a catastrophic flood induced by&lt;br/&gt;the breach of a dam in a natural river, can the decoupled and steady uniform flow modeling&lt;br/&gt;approach still yield satisfactory results? (2) Is the time scale of interest concerning bed elevation&lt;br/&gt;change still long compared to that of the flow in rapidly changing flows such as dam-break&lt;br/&gt;induced floods? (3) How can the phase difference among sediment concentration, friction factor,&lt;br/&gt;flow velocity and depth, as evidenced in laboratory and field observations, be quantified and&lt;br/&gt;interpreted? The proposed research intends to provide an improved physical framework to study&lt;br/&gt;sediment transport and morphological evolution in natural rivers in response to a highly unsteady&lt;br/&gt;flow such as dam-break induced floods. The main research tasks involve model development,&lt;br/&gt;calibration, verification and comparison, collection and compilation of existing laboratory and&lt;br/&gt;field data, and evaluation of critical flow and sediment parameters involved in this&lt;br/&gt;morphological process.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The most significant and broadest impacts of this project are twofold. First,&lt;br/&gt;research outcomes will provide useful information for policy decision-making by federal and&lt;br/&gt;state agencies, such as evaluation of transport capacities of rivers and streams, estimation of&lt;br/&gt;environmental impacts of riverbed and bank erosion and deposition, and assistance in the&lt;br/&gt;evaluation of design alternatives. Potential applications of the research results include design of&lt;br/&gt;dams and reservoirs, floodplain analysis and management, and estimation of possible maximum&lt;br/&gt;scour during large flood events. Secondly, this proposed project would also have significant&lt;br/&gt;educational impact on both undergraduate and graduate levels. Findings of this fundamental&lt;br/&gt;research will be integrated into the teaching of science, math and engineering to benefit a broader&lt;br/&gt;student community.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
