<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Human activity and thought is embedded within and richly structured by the space around us. We have detailed knowledge of the objects that surround us-where they are, what they are, how they are arranged relative to one another. And we can easily remember the layout of objects in completely new situations, quickly learning which things go where. This grant investigates the dynamics of spatial cognition, that is, the time-dependent processes that underlie such coordinated spatial behaviors. &lt;br/&gt;Spatial cognition has typically been studied as isolated parts-spatial perception, spatial memory, spatial attention, and so on. Consistent with this approach, neurophysiological evidence suggests a functional and anatomical segregation of the visual system into one neural pathway that represents spatial locations ("where") and another neural pathway that represents object property information ("what"). Critically, we know very little about how information in these two pathways is integrated, despite the fact that most behaviors rely on both spatial and object information.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this grant is to tackle the integration of "where" and "what" systems using a neurally-plausible theory of working memory, the Dynamic Neural Field Theory (DNFT). This theory captures how people hold information in working memory, how they use perceptual cues to keep memorized information accurate, and how long-term memories emerge from this mix. Critically, our new model specifies not just where objects are located, but what those objects are and how spatial and object information can be brought together to guide action. The research plan formalizes this new model and tests a set of critical predictions across 10 experiments.&lt;br/&gt;The DNFT is the first theory of spatial cognition that integrates perception, working memory, and long-term memory in a neurally-plausible way that makes specific predictions about how people behave. As such, this project will advance our understanding of the processes that govern human activity in space-how people think about space, how people organize spatial activities, and the local "maps" of the world people bring with them from context to context. Such information could have a critical impact on how groups and individuals structure spaces to foster communication and lessen memory and attentional demands. Moreover, there is compelling evidence that deficits in where-what integration underlie the behavior problems prevalent in several mental health disorders. The DNFT takes an important step toward addressing both the behavioral and neural processes that likely underlie these behavioral disorders. The space around us has a profound effect on human thought and activity. The proposed research will move us closer to understanding this pervasive aspect of human and social dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;The present work will advance two educational goals as well. First, the PI and co-PIs will establish an international graduate student exchange to foster the education of promising scholars in both the US and Germany. Second, funds from this grant will support a high school outreach program to expose AP calculus students to the application of mathematical models in "real world" science. Beyond these educational impacts, the proposed project will impact the general scholarly community through the publication of empirical and theoretical manuscripts and the creation of a web-based dynamic field simulator. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
