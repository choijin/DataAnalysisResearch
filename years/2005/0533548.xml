<AbstractNarration>0533548&lt;br/&gt;Christian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the participation of American scientists in a U.S.-Thailand joint workshop on interfaces of analytical sciences to be held in Chiang Mai, Thailand from January 6-9, 2006.  The co-organizers are Professor Gary Christian at the University of Washington in Seattle and in Thailand Professor Kate Grudpan at Chiang Mai University, Professor Vichai Reutrakul at Mahidol University and Professor Pavich Tongroach, Secretary General of the Commission on Higher Education (CHE).  The Thai Ministry of Education is a partial sponsor of the workshop. The focus of the workshop will be the analytical sciences broadly, but with an emphasis on bioanalytical chemistry and techniques for the investigation of biochemical processes, particularly in the neurosciences, which is a research initiative in Thailand.  Their country is rapidly developing its scientific infrastructure and this type of activity will help nurture bilateral scientific and cultural relationships.  The U.S. presenters are all prominent members of the bioanalytical and related sciences communities.  Their presentations and tours of Thai universities will stimulate the interest of Thai students to seek graduate studies in the U.S., which will be beneficial to both countries.  It is also anticipated that the U.S. postdocs and graduate students participating in the conference will return for collaborative research in future years.       &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The co-organizers have complementary scientific expertise in the field.  This enables them to evaluate and attract the best science researchers to participate.  The workshop organizers have made a special effort to involve postdocs, graduate students and underrepresented groups as both participants and observers. The exchange of ideas and data with Thai experts in this field will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Following the seminar the organizers plan to establish a workshop web page.  Conference proceedings will be published on this web site.        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
