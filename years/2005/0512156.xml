<AbstractNarration>We propose to combine surface sensitive infrared-visible sum frequency generation&lt;br/&gt;spectroscopy (SFG) with insitu friction and adhesion measurements. The experiments&lt;br/&gt;are motivated by results of Chaudhury and Brown using poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)&lt;br/&gt;lenses and Israelachvili using surface force apparatus; where they find a relationship&lt;br/&gt;between friction, adhesion hysteresis and mobility of the molecules at the interface.&lt;br/&gt;However, there is no information on how different relaxation processes are at&lt;br/&gt;polymer/solid or hidden interfaces in comparison to that in bulk. Recent experiments of&lt;br/&gt;glass transition temperature of polymer thin films indicate that the relaxation at the air&lt;br/&gt;interface can be several orders of magnitude faster than in the bulk. The relaxation&lt;br/&gt;times of polymer chains are expected to be altered in contact with surfaces of different&lt;br/&gt;surface energies. Furthermore, there is no direct information of the change in the&lt;br/&gt;structure of molecules at moving or sliding interfaces. Understanding these properties is&lt;br/&gt;crucial to understand friction. Recently, we demonstrated that SFG can be applied to&lt;br/&gt;study the contact interface between an elastomeric PDMS lens and a polymer or solid&lt;br/&gt;substrate. Here, we take advantage of this design to measure simultaneously the&lt;br/&gt;changes in structure between two sliding surfaces, friction and adhesion. In addition, we&lt;br/&gt;propose to measure the relaxation dynamics at interfaces using SFG to understand the&lt;br/&gt;relationship between mobility and friction coefficient. As a Director of District 5, I have&lt;br/&gt;been actively involved in organizing District 5 Science Day for students from K5-K12 for&lt;br/&gt;the past five years. In addition to this outreach activity, this proposal offers research&lt;br/&gt;opportunities to two high school students from a local high school to work during&lt;br/&gt;summer in my laboratory under the supervision of graduate students. The research of&lt;br/&gt;these high school projects can be submitted as a part of their science project for&lt;br/&gt;competition in the Intel Science and Engineering Fair. This effort will be integrated with&lt;br/&gt;the NSF-REU undergraduate program already existing at The University of Akron.                                   &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Friction between two surfaces is of utmost importance in a variety of&lt;br/&gt;technological and biological applications. The understanding and control of these&lt;br/&gt;phenomena will have a tremendous impact in conserving and using precious energy&lt;br/&gt;resources. The advances in this field are limited by the lack of understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;structure and properties of molecules at the interface. This proposal provides a new&lt;br/&gt;experimental method to probe molecular motion or deformation taking place at the&lt;br/&gt;interface and studies its relationship to friction and adhesion. This will broadly impact&lt;br/&gt;our design of surfaces, lubricants and micro or nano-actuators. The education and&lt;br/&gt;outreach activities target local schools in District 5 to promote an interest in science by&lt;br/&gt;encouraging students to undertake science projects and compete at district, state and&lt;br/&gt;international level.</AbstractNarration>
