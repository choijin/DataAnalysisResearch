<AbstractNarration>This project is designing and implementing an AAS (Associate of Applied Science) certificate and AS (Associate of Science)transfer degree program in Geographic Information Science and Technology (GIST) for the Four Corners region.  By adapting materials and involving experienced instructors, as well as practicing scientists and technicians, this project is developing a program for rural education of undergraduate students, current workers, future technicians and teachers.  The project is assisting San Juan College in addressing the intellectual challenge in providing quality student learning of important science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) principles, providing a means to technical education currently available only at a great distance and expense.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in its efforts to develop a core set of academic skills across disciplines, and in its training of students in both practical and problem solving skills, improving student involvement and interest in learning. Effective use of technology and distance education helps provide a bridge for students to four-year degree programs at a collaborating university.  Project outcomes include collaborative learning experiences for secondary teachers and their students, the coordination of GIST information resources, and providing leadership among local agencies and private industries for cooperation and the sharing of resources. The broader impacts of the GIST program are in its efforts to address the current and future needs of business and industry by providing highly skilled undergraduates to the workforce in the region. The GIST program provides training and educational opportunities in emerging technologies to undergraduate students and active members of the workforce.  Technicians are able to further their careers and enhance their ability to effectively contribute to their respective companies.  The goal is to create a model program for the integration of GIST and other technologies across disciplines that other institutions seek to emulate. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
