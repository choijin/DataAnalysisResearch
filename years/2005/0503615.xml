<AbstractNarration>The main goal of the Oglala Lakota College Wayawawicakiya Waste (Good Teacher) &lt;br/&gt;STEM Teachers of Excellence Education Program is to increase the number of highly qualified &lt;br/&gt;reservation based certified math and science secondary teachers in rural school systems.  &lt;br/&gt;Statistics indicate there is a severe shortage of quality teachers in secondary schools across &lt;br/&gt;reservations in South Dakota (SD).  Oglala Lakota College (OLC) has begun to address this &lt;br/&gt;problem by creating a composite secondary baccalaureate degree program in Physical Science.  &lt;br/&gt;Graduates earning this degree are certified to teach secondary chemistry and physics in South &lt;br/&gt;Dakota, and endorsements exist in math, biology and earth science.   &lt;br/&gt;The Wayawawicakiya Waste program builds the capacity to graduate 25 new secondary &lt;br/&gt;teachers and sustain a pipeline of future teachers.  OLC has the infrastructure and expertise in &lt;br/&gt;place to offer degree programs at distance to students across South Dakota.  In addition, the &lt;br/&gt;program offers face-to-face summer sessions designed to engage students in methodology &lt;br/&gt;techniques, hands-on experience in science, opportunities to practice teaching and constructive &lt;br/&gt;evaluation sessions.   &lt;br/&gt;To properly address the problem in reservation school systems, a project must include in-&lt;br/&gt;service K-12 teachers.  The Wayawawicakiya Waste program extends the collaborative &lt;br/&gt;relationships between OLC and partner K-12 schools by providing professional development &lt;br/&gt;opportunities in math and science for K-12 teachers and administrators.  Increasing the number &lt;br/&gt;of high quality secondary teachers and improving in-service teacher skills makes a broad impact &lt;br/&gt;in South Dakota school systems dominated by Native American students.  Partner K-12 &lt;br/&gt;systems enroll over 14,000 students, approximately 90% of which are Native American.</AbstractNarration>
