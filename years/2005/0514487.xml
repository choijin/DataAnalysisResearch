<AbstractNarration>Static non-linear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) describe a variety &lt;br/&gt;of problems in physics and engineering. Numerical schemes are commonly &lt;br/&gt;used to approximate the solution satisfying particular boundary &lt;br/&gt;conditions. Such schemes usually require solving a large system of coupled &lt;br/&gt;non-linear discretized equations. Iterative methods for such systems can &lt;br/&gt;be very expensive computationally, often leading practitioners to use &lt;br/&gt;alternative problem descriptions to avoid solving the full boundary value &lt;br/&gt;problem. The investigator proposes a family of fast (non-iterative) &lt;br/&gt;methods for a wide class of static PDEs, for which the direction of &lt;br/&gt;"information flow" defines a natural ordering on the discretized &lt;br/&gt;equations. In a joint work with J.A. Sethian, non-iterative Ordered Upwind &lt;br/&gt;Methods (OUMs) were introduced for Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs arising in &lt;br/&gt;anisotropic (&amp; hybrid) control and in front propagation. The investigator &lt;br/&gt;proposes to extend OUMs to boundary value problems describing differential &lt;br/&gt;games and non-autonomous optimal control problems.  &lt;br/&gt;In a joint work with J. Guckenheimer, the OUMs were &lt;br/&gt;previously applied to a special system of quasilinear PDEs to approximate &lt;br/&gt;invariant manifolds of vector fields. The investigator proposes to extend &lt;br/&gt;the invariant manifold approach to compute multi-valued solutions of &lt;br/&gt;boundary value problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The efficiency of the proposed methods stems from the notion of &lt;br/&gt;"causality" -- unobvious yet natural ordering of the elements of &lt;br/&gt;computation.  This approach is relevant for the applications as diverse as &lt;br/&gt;robotic navigation and photolithography, seismic imaging and computational &lt;br/&gt;geometry, optics and transient elastography, differential games and &lt;br/&gt;segmentation of images.  Which trajectory is optimal for a rover traveling &lt;br/&gt;on the surface of Mars?  With what delay and how strongly will an &lt;br/&gt;underground explosion be felt by a sensor at a given point on the surface?  &lt;br/&gt;What are the optimal parameter values for etching and deposition in the &lt;br/&gt;integrated circuit manufacturing?  What is the minimum safe distance for &lt;br/&gt;the aircraft collision avoidance?  Will the electrical power system &lt;br/&gt;automatically recover after a "fault"? Answering these important practical &lt;br/&gt;questions in real time requires efficient and robust numerical methods for &lt;br/&gt;solving the corresponding partial differential equations. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
