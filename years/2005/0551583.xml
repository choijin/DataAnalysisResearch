<AbstractNarration>Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project, planning the development of a comprehensive infrastructure model program that encourages attraction, retention, and support of students, centers on developing appropriate curriculum for engaging women and underrepresented minorities in the sciences. A center and curriculum devoted to inspiring the young minds through inventive video games is expected to broaden participation. During the planning period, the investigators will draw on unique resources to create a successful infrastructure scheme based on a detailed assessment of needs in the areas of facilities and support systems. A set of hypotheses about female and minority recruitment and retention will be converted into a formal study to test and evaluate the effectiveness of the enhanced infrastructure in attracting and retaining the target student population. The project collaborates with the Tiltfactor Laboratory in the department of Film and Media Studies. This group promotes research, scholarship, and creative practice centered on the social impact of digital technology, particularly gender and computing. Planning activities include:&lt;br/&gt;Designing the research study,&lt;br/&gt;Developing an assessment plan and gathering baseline data,&lt;br/&gt;Exploring outreach to high schools and community colleges,&lt;br/&gt;Determining the requirements for and designing a state of the art instructional computer laboratory,&lt;br/&gt;Arranging support services such as tutoring and mentoring,&lt;br/&gt;Exploring innovative curriculum, &lt;br/&gt;Solidifying collaborations to create undergraduate research opportunities,&lt;br/&gt;Forming an external advisory committee, &lt;br/&gt;Visiting departments that have made progress in increasing female and minority enrollments, and&lt;br/&gt;Organizing a retreat to generate consensus, cohesion, and synergy for the infrastructure acquisition proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The work stresses the support of underrepresented groups and aims at creating a model of best practices.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
