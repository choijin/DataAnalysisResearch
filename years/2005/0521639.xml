<AbstractNarration>This MRI award provides funds to purchase a high-performance cluster computer for modeling; a high repetition-rate laser amplifier for a 100 picosecond laser system; two optical parametric amplifiers for generating tunable ultrashort (40 femtosecond pulses in association with a 30 femtosecond laser system); and frequency resolved optical gating apparatus for diagnostics of short pulses. The research goals that this equipment will enable cover the topics of (1) Quantum measurement, control, entanglement and information, (2) Coherent dynamics of optical, semiconductor, and plasmonic waveguide devices, and (3) Complex systems. The equipment will be housed in a new joint-use laboratory, where it is expected to facilitate ongoing and future collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum information and control comprises a broad interdisciplinary field involving physics, chemistry, and engineering that addresses the controlled manipulation and state measurement of small quantum systems including atoms, molecules, semiconductor structures, metal nanofilms, and photons. A critical aspect for making progress in quantum-control research is the ability to model theoretically complex quantum dynamics. A massively parallel (cluster) computer architecture should make possible the solution of problems involving coherent dynamics and quantum stochastic behavior, which arise either as an intrinsic part of a system's dynamics or as a necessary consequence of state collapse during quantum measurements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the project is twofold. In the scientific and technological arena, much of the research has direct implications for future quantum-information technologies. These include increased computer capability and new types of electronic, optical, and communication devices. Ultimately, information-processing devices operating at the quantum level may lead to a revolution of our understanding of physical processes as well as our ability to solve computational problems that are now inaccessible. In addition, there will be spin-off technologies such as the 100ps pulse-shaping devices, which will immediately impact other areas such as telecommunication and laser spectroscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be a direct impact on the educational mission of the university. Both the lasers and cluster system will be used by postdoctoral research associates, as well as Ph.D., masters, bachelors, and high-school students associated with the research programs of the participants. This will be the only laboratory of its kind in Oregon, and will provide expanded opportunities for students in the region. The interdisciplinary collaborations of the proposed research will add greatly to the breadth and quality of the student and postdoc training. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
