<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Traditional multivariate statistics focuses on the analysis of data that&lt;br/&gt;are vectors of finite length. However, modern data collection methods are&lt;br/&gt;now frequently returning observations that should be viewed as the result&lt;br/&gt;of digitized recording or sampling from stochastic processes. These types of&lt;br/&gt;data occur in the context of functional data analysis (where the&lt;br/&gt;observation process has a one dimensional index set), image analysis and&lt;br/&gt;spatial statistics, for example, and arise from every aspect of the modern&lt;br/&gt;world. Our ability to process and to make use of such data directly&lt;br/&gt;affects the way in which scientific inquiries are conducted and practical&lt;br/&gt;problems are solved. Goals for analyzing this type of high dimensional&lt;br/&gt;data include the detection of structure and dimensionality reduction and&lt;br/&gt;these are the issues that will be addressed in the proposed project.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, a number of topics will be investigated concerning dimension&lt;br/&gt;reduction for data from stochastic processes including i) canonical&lt;br/&gt;correlations analysis for two or more processes, ii) mixed models methods&lt;br/&gt;for analysis of data from multiple processes, iii) inverse regression and&lt;br/&gt;iv) varying coefficient models. The unifying theme in all this work is the&lt;br/&gt;use of reproducing kernel Hilbert space methods to formulate both the&lt;br/&gt;problems and their proposed solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With fast progressing modern technology in fields such as medicine,&lt;br/&gt;environmental science, and homeland security, the data collected in those&lt;br/&gt;fields today are frequently curved or spatial data, and may be even more&lt;br/&gt;complicated in terms of scope and structure. Traditional statistical&lt;br/&gt;methods were created to primarily deal with&lt;br/&gt;low-dimensional data, and are not suitable for the high-dimensional or&lt;br/&gt;``functional'' nature of the data described above. This research is aimed&lt;br/&gt;at addressing a number of fundamental issues in the emerging branch of&lt;br/&gt;modern statistical data analysis that deals with high-dimensional data.&lt;br/&gt;The results to be obtained will not only potentially impact&lt;br/&gt;high-dimensional data analytic methodology across a myriad of&lt;br/&gt;disciplines, but will also provide a theoretical foundation and&lt;br/&gt;directions for future statistical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
