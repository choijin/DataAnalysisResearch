<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose an exploratory project to build a fast and scalable architectural simulation&lt;br/&gt;platform using clusters of commodity FPGA boards. It is inherently parallel: A FPGA board simulates a&lt;br/&gt;processor core, a group of FPGA boards simulates a multicore processor chip, and a cluster of such groups&lt;br/&gt;simulates a full computing cluster. By careful analysis using the performance data of Xilinx FPGA board,&lt;br/&gt;we show that the slowdown will be less than two orders of magnitude, which makes full-scale evaluation&lt;br/&gt;feasible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By comparison, the slowdown of a software simulator will be at least five orders of magnitude. The&lt;br/&gt;system is scalable in that one can increase the system size by adding more FPGA boards. The platform is&lt;br/&gt;also affordable, flexible, and easy to replicate, and can be widely used by industry and academic researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boarder Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Performance computing applications have deep impact in our daily life and their computing demand would never be fully satisfied. However, without a fast simulation platform, multicore and multithreaded processors are not being evaluated by large-scale parallel programs until they have been manufactured. The proposed research removes this limit. It will prompt early consideration and evaluation of system-level methods for improving processor efficiency, providing important input to computer architects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus, it may help reduce the trials and errors that would be very expensive and would delay the&lt;br/&gt;improvement of high performance computing systems. The proposed experiment support will benefit other&lt;br/&gt;researchers in both computer architecture and high-performance computing communities, and help them see&lt;br/&gt;the needs of each other before the real machines are available.</AbstractNarration>
