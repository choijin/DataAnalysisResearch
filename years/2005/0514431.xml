Specifically, the study will address the following questions: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.    What is the level and depth of the mathematics and related teaching knowledge attained by prospective primary and lower secondary teachers that enables them to teach the kind of demanding mathematics curricula currently found in the higher achieving countries? &lt;br/&gt;2.    What learning opportunities available to these prospective teachers enable them to attain such knowledge? &lt;br/&gt;3.    What are the intended and implemented policies that support these teachers' achieved level and depth of mathematics and related teaching knowledge? How do teacher policies influence the structure of their opportunities to learn mathematics at national and institutional levels? &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
