<AbstractNarration>This project is focused on the discovery of driving forces that support&lt;br/&gt;the Kraichnan theory of 2-D fully developed turbulence.  In recent work&lt;br/&gt;the investigators and their collaborators have identified critical wave&lt;br/&gt;numbers expressed as averages of different norms of the solution to the&lt;br/&gt;Navier-Stokes equations (NSE).  These wave numbers provide necessary, and&lt;br/&gt;nearly sufficient conditions for the Kraichnan theory to hold.  This team&lt;br/&gt;has also localized to some extent the global attractor of the NSE in a&lt;br/&gt;plane spanned by two of these norms (one being the energy), to help&lt;br/&gt;understand which driving forces produce these conditions.  The proposed&lt;br/&gt;work will combine this analysis with computational optimization to zero in&lt;br/&gt;on such forces, and then study in detail the turbulent features they&lt;br/&gt;produce.  The mathematical treatment of turbulence is largely driven by&lt;br/&gt;the heuristic theories of Kolmogorov, Batchelor and Kraichnan.  The&lt;br/&gt;approach taken in projecting the attractor however, seems to be entirely&lt;br/&gt;new.  The information provided by this analysis will guide the&lt;br/&gt;computational component which otherwise would be confronted with a vast&lt;br/&gt;landscape of possible driving forces to consider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turbulence is readily observed in three-dimensional physical space&lt;br/&gt;domains.  Most people think of a bumpy plane rides (in this case the&lt;br/&gt;domain is the volume around the airplane).  Like the swirls generated by&lt;br/&gt;rocks in a stream, rapidly changing patterns form in the air around the&lt;br/&gt;plane.  Turbulence theories do not attempt to predict the precise&lt;br/&gt;development of these patterns, but rather find (a) consistent laws which&lt;br/&gt;describe how, on average, energy is transferred to smaller length scales,&lt;br/&gt;and (b) critical length scales at which this this phenomenon changes. &lt;br/&gt;True 2-D flows in nature are less prevalent.  The most prominent example,&lt;br/&gt;the earth's atmosphere, is actually a thin 3-D domain, whose behavior&lt;br/&gt;approaches that of a 2-D flow.  The fate of energy over different length&lt;br/&gt;scales is more complicated for 2-D flow, though that of 3-D flow is in&lt;br/&gt;some sense embedded into it.  Though 2-D experiments are difficult to&lt;br/&gt;carry out in the laboratory, they allow for much finer study on a&lt;br/&gt;computer.  Of all 2-D flows, the one studied in this project is arguably&lt;br/&gt;the most amenable to analysis and efficient simulation.  Yet it is&lt;br/&gt;fundamental, not only to 2-D and nearly 2-D flows such as the atmosphere,&lt;br/&gt;but also to 3-D turbulence due to universality. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
