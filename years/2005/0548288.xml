<AbstractNarration>0548288&lt;br/&gt;Fouch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from CAREER award are being used to develop an integrated research and education program linked directly with the EarthScope Project through a range of new, innovative research projects that combine analyses using data from the Plate Boundary Observatory and USArray. The results of these analysis efforts are being integrated via both forward and inverse modeling approaches that will enable new discoveries of the links between deformation of Earth's surface and subsurface crust and mantle.  The synergistic course modules developed as part of this work will be coalesced with the research effort to bring EarthScope directly into the university classroom at an advanced scientific level.  PI Fouch is designing these modules to utilize EarthScope as a long-term "teachable moment" used to expose students to the process of active Earth science research.  Modules from the integrated research and teaching efforts will be available for use in both introductory and advanced Earth sciences courses, thereby providing real-world, exploration-based experiences that not only will support the vision of Arizona State University's new School of Earth and Space Exploration but also will be available to the broader academic community.</AbstractNarration>
