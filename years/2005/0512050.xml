<AbstractNarration>In this proposal, the investigator and his collaborators address &lt;br/&gt;several questions arising from the mathematical analysis of multiscale &lt;br/&gt;geometries of sets, and multiscale decomposition of function spaces, &lt;br/&gt;that arise from the action of a diffusion semigroup on a manifold, a &lt;br/&gt;graph and other rather general metric spaces. While these multiscale &lt;br/&gt;geometries are partly implicit (and classical) in differential geometry, &lt;br/&gt;in partial differential equations, as well as in many branches in graph &lt;br/&gt;theory (with applications to problems in computer science), only &lt;br/&gt;recently a very general, yet efficient, coherent and unifying &lt;br/&gt;construction has been introduced by the investigator and his &lt;br/&gt;collaborators. Multiscale function space decompositions that mirror &lt;br/&gt;these multiscale diffusion geometries are also constructed, through the &lt;br/&gt;introduction of special wavelet functions. This is a far-reaching, and &lt;br/&gt;long sought, generalization of wavelet analysis, both mathematically and &lt;br/&gt;computationally. The investigator and his collaborators have shown that &lt;br/&gt;algorithms for efficiently computing these multiscale decompositions &lt;br/&gt;exist, which generalize the fast wavelet transform and Fast Multipole &lt;br/&gt;Methods, yielding fast multiscale algorithms guaranteeing &lt;br/&gt;high-precision. The investigator will study the construction of &lt;br/&gt;biorthogonal diffusion multiscale decompositions, multiscale function &lt;br/&gt;approximation on rough sets, multiscale diffusion analysis of data sets &lt;br/&gt;and its relationships with geometric measure theory, multiscale Markov &lt;br/&gt;chains, numerical analysis of PDEs, learning theory, hyperspectral &lt;br/&gt;imaging and document corpora analysis.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator expects this novel multiscale construction to have &lt;br/&gt;impact in all these disciplines, in a way similar to the impact wavelet &lt;br/&gt;analysis had on low-dimensional signal processing and numerical analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present proposal stresses the inter-disciplinary nature of several &lt;br/&gt;aspects of multiscale analysis, and the vast applicability of the ideas, &lt;br/&gt;tools, constructions, to pure and applied mathematics, and to other &lt;br/&gt;disciplines such as computer science, physics, engineering, astronomy &lt;br/&gt;and statistics, among others. The introduction of these novel multiscale &lt;br/&gt;techniques reveals new and interesting multiscale geometric structures &lt;br/&gt;of graphs and sets, together with effective computational tools to &lt;br/&gt;discover them. The range of applications is very wide, and includes the &lt;br/&gt;analysis and organization of large and complex networks (e.g. computer &lt;br/&gt;networks, biological regulatory networks etc...), document corpora for &lt;br/&gt;information extraction, hyperspectral imagery (for applications to &lt;br/&gt;medicine, target recognition etc...), and large datasets in general. It &lt;br/&gt;has also applications to the development of new algorithms for learning &lt;br/&gt;and artificial intelligence, for the automation of complex tasks. The &lt;br/&gt;investigator aims at strenghtening his existing collaborations, and &lt;br/&gt;establishing new ones, with other institutions, both in the United &lt;br/&gt;States and abroad, across several disciplines, in particular computer &lt;br/&gt;science, astronomy, biology, and medicine. He will continue his existing &lt;br/&gt;collaborations with companies developing next-generation &lt;br/&gt;instrumentation, for applications to hyperspectral imaging. He will &lt;br/&gt;continue to actively participate in multi- and inter-disciplinary &lt;br/&gt;conferences, workshops and research activities, and effectively &lt;br/&gt;communicating and disseminating ideas and techniques to &lt;br/&gt;multi-disciplinary audiences, making his work, including papers and &lt;br/&gt;computer code for the corresponding algorithms, easily accessible &lt;br/&gt;electronically.</AbstractNarration>
