<AbstractNarration>The project will develop technologies for distributed computer and data intensive application environments such as those encountered in e-commerce, entertainment, financial, search engines, medical informatics, genomics, and web-based content delivery. Many of these emerging applications are quite data-intensive in nature. Data is being generated from multiple sources such as transactions, instruments, and through simulations. Not only datasets are increasing in size, they are becoming more dynamic and distributed.  The designs used by current-day data-centers have several limitations to achieve good performance and scalability with low cost for handling the emerging trend of dynamic and geographically distributed data. The proposed research is built around computer architecture, networking, cluster computing, and data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will carry out research along the following directions: designing advanced communication protocols and subsystems by taking advantage of novel mechanisms and features of modern networks;  designing and developing novel data-center primitives such as soft shared state, distributed lock managers and global memory aggregators;  designing dynamic content caching services; and designing constraint-based active resource adaptation services to provide Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees.  Solutions developed along the proposed directions are planned to be integrated on an experimental data-center testbed and a simulated testbed and evaluated using a set of commercial workload.</AbstractNarration>
