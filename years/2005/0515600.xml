<AbstractNarration>The enormous advances in methods to synthesize nanometer-sized Fe(III)-&lt;br/&gt;hydroxide clusters can answer questions about the Fe(III)-solid surfaces that have&lt;br/&gt;puzzled geochemists for decades. These questions include: (i) Which bridging hydroxyls&lt;br/&gt;exchange oxygen isotopes with bulk solution via what rate laws? (ii) Where do electronexchanges&lt;br/&gt;proceed? (iii) Can our computer models predict this chemistry? (iv) What&lt;br/&gt;level of accuracy, that is, expense, is needed?&lt;br/&gt;We propose a set of projects involving molecular clusters that have many Fe(III)&lt;br/&gt;or Al(III) atoms linked together with sets of hydroxyl bridges. The family of&lt;br/&gt;homologous molecules (Fe17, Fe19, Al13 and Al15) have a similar structural core but&lt;br/&gt;varying numbers of Al(III) or Fe(III) metal centers. Clusters can be chosen that have, or&lt;br/&gt;do not have, bound water molecules. The fact that Fe(III) and Al(III) clusters can be&lt;br/&gt;synthesized that are structurally similar is an enormous experimental advantage. The&lt;br/&gt;Al13 and Al15 clusters are diamagnetic and allow NMR experiments, including 17O, 27Al,&lt;br/&gt;13C and 1H. Even the Fe(III) clusters allow probing via the methods of isotope-exchange&lt;br/&gt;and paramagnetic NMR.&lt;br/&gt;The projects that we propose are to: (i) Determine the reactivity of different&lt;br/&gt;oxygens in the clusters via isotope-exchange experiments; (ii) Evaluate the dynamics in&lt;br/&gt;the 'adsorbed' organic ligand that makes the clusters stable in water, including the&lt;br/&gt;residence times in the bound state; and particularly: (iii) Evaluate the tools needed to&lt;br/&gt;predict reactivities in Fe(III)-hydroxide solids and molecules. This last point can be&lt;br/&gt;restated: 'What level of quantum sophistication is required to obtain a structure accurate&lt;br/&gt;to better than 0.05 A? Better than 0.01 A'? In previous studies, we found that a change in&lt;br/&gt;bond length of 0.03 A changes the adjacent hydroxide oxygen-isotope exchange rates by&lt;br/&gt;a factor of i-103. 'How sophisticated must our methods of treating electron correlation&lt;br/&gt;be?' 'What constitutes an adequate basis for wave-function representation?' and: 'What&lt;br/&gt;are the most promising types of computationally inexpensive methods that can yield&lt;br/&gt;hidden reaction pathways in systems that are sufficiently large to be geochemically&lt;br/&gt;relevant?' How does one construct a useful reduced representation of electronic&lt;br/&gt;structure? The molecules allow a fairly dense progression from small to large&lt;br/&gt;(monomers, dimers, tetramers, Al13, Al15, Fe17, and Fe19 clusters) and this series provides&lt;br/&gt;a way to systematically extrapolate accurate calculations that are possible on small&lt;br/&gt;molecules to more approximate methods needed for extended solids surfaces and&lt;br/&gt;geochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;The implications of this research extend well beyond Earth science. This research&lt;br/&gt;will be used by many disciplines, including colloid chemistry, nanoscience, and medicine&lt;br/&gt;(metalloproteins such as ferritin resemble these clusters). Also, enrollment at UCD draws&lt;br/&gt;disproportionately from the high population of new immigrants to the United States, so&lt;br/&gt;these funds bring nontraditional but highly talented students into the Earth Sciences. We&lt;br/&gt;train a diverse group of students in the latest techniques of quantitative geochemistry and&lt;br/&gt;we blur the distinction between Earth science and inorganic chemistry, which is&lt;br/&gt;important for the training of fearless young geochemists.</AbstractNarration>
