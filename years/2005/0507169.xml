<AbstractNarration>Support for the Workshop??Frontiers in Contemporary Physics 2005? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is a request for support for the "Frontiers in Contemporary Physics 2005 (FCP05)." This conference will be held at the Scarritt-Bennett Center, neighboring the Vanderbilt University campus in Nashville, Tennessee from May 23rd through May 28th, 2005. The scientific program of FCP05 will focus on the areas of high-energy physics and cosmology and their interface. &lt;br/&gt;At FCP05 the experimental and observational aspects of this science will be emphasized. There will be talks about all the major accelerator and neutrino experiments as well as the main observational work which impacts on the dark energy and dark matter issues. Frontiers in Contemporary Physics 2005 promises to be a comprehensive meeting where all the major research with impact on high energy physics and cosmology will be carefully synthesized. This includes, heavy flavor physics, the state of electroweak physics, progress in QCD, and various aspects of theory.</AbstractNarration>
