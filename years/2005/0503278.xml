<AbstractNarration>Peach State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation &lt;br/&gt;Project Summary &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Peach State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PSLSAMP) is a collaborative &lt;br/&gt;effort  sustained  by  seven  universities  in  Georgia  to  increase  the  number  of  underrepresented &lt;br/&gt;minority  students  statewide  who  complete  undergraduate  degrees  in  science,  technology, &lt;br/&gt;engineering  and  mathematics  (STEM)  fields.    Georgia  is  experiencing  explosive  population &lt;br/&gt;growth  while  embracing  policies  that  favor  economic  development  in  strategic,  technology-&lt;br/&gt;oriented  fields.    There  is  a  compelling  need  for  college  graduates  with  strong  technical  skills.  &lt;br/&gt;There is also wide recognition that underrepresented minorities must participate significantly in &lt;br/&gt;meeting  this  need.    The  current  proposal,  developed  by  the  University  of  Georgia  in  close &lt;br/&gt;collaboration with Bainbridge College, Fort Valley State University, Georgia Perimeter College, &lt;br/&gt;Macon  State  College,  Savannah  State  University,  and  Southern  Polytechnic  University,  is &lt;br/&gt;submitted to the National Science Foundation and requests $1,000,000 per year for five years to &lt;br/&gt;support Alliance-wide and individual campus-based programming.  The primary impacts will be &lt;br/&gt;to  enhance  the  recruitment  and  retention  of  minority  students  and  double  the  number  of  such &lt;br/&gt;students at participating universities overall who earn bachelor.s degrees in STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The  shortage  of  American  college  graduates  with  technical  and  scientific  training  is  well &lt;br/&gt;documented,  and  the  percentage  of  U.S.  students  entering  colleges  and  universities  with  the &lt;br/&gt;intention of majoring in STEM fields has steadily declined.  Strengthening the STEM workforce &lt;br/&gt;and its leadership is a priority concern if the U.S. is to maintain its economic leadership, security &lt;br/&gt;and  quality  of  life.    Preparing  African  Americans,  Hispanic  Americans  and  other &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minorities for careers in these fields is a logical component of most strategies to &lt;br/&gt;address these  needs.    It  has  an  overwhelmingly compelling  logic in a  state like Georgia where &lt;br/&gt;these  minorities  make  up  approximately  34%  of  the  state.s  population.    Improving  minority &lt;br/&gt;involvement in undergraduate STEM fields is a complex problem.  In Georgia, the development &lt;br/&gt;of a dynamic statewide plan to address this problem requires initially that very different types of &lt;br/&gt;institutions cooperate closely to achieve a shared, long-term goal in terms of the production of &lt;br/&gt;minority  STEM  graduates.  The  current  proposal  is  the  result  of  such  inter-institutional &lt;br/&gt;collaboration. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;In addition to its primary impacts, PSLSAMP programs will: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Provide opportunities designed to motivate students to pursue advanced &lt;br/&gt;study, &lt;br/&gt;Prepare students for graduate school, &lt;br/&gt;Emphasize career opportunities in STEM fields, &lt;br/&gt;Engage  faculty  and  staff  in  the  planning  process  and  in  professional &lt;br/&gt;development activities to ensure institutionalization, and &lt;br/&gt;Create a genuine partnership among institutions and organizations within &lt;br/&gt;Georgia. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The University of Georgia will serve as the lead institution and fiduciary agent on behalf of the &lt;br/&gt;Peach State Alliance and President Michael Adams, a research scientist himself, will serve as the &lt;br/&gt;principal investigator and chair of the Governing Board.  The Governing Board, along with the &lt;br/&gt;Steering Committee and research faculty, will provide intellectual leadership to the Alliance.</AbstractNarration>
