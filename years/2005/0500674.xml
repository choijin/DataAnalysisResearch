<AbstractNarration>  DYNAMICS OF NONLINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS (DMS-0500674)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;                        John Mallet-Paret&lt;br/&gt;                Division of Applied Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;                        Brown University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to study fundamental qualitative properties of&lt;br/&gt;various classes of nonlinear dynamical systems, in particular as&lt;br/&gt;they arise from differential and difference equations. The systems&lt;br/&gt;to be considered include those from ordinary and partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations, systems of lattice differential equations (that is,&lt;br/&gt;spatially discrete systems), differential delay equations, and&lt;br/&gt;max-plus operators. Issues such as the existence of equilibria and&lt;br/&gt;their stability, spontaneous formation of spatial patterns and spatial&lt;br/&gt;chaos, the existence and qualitative properties of traveling fronts,&lt;br/&gt;and the appearance of spontaneous temporal oscillations will be studied&lt;br/&gt;for these problems. In addition to the established techniques (both&lt;br/&gt;theoretical and numerical) from differential equations and dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems, a significant portion of the proposed research involves the&lt;br/&gt;development and implementation of new tools and techniques with which&lt;br/&gt;to study these systems. Among the techniques to be employed are those&lt;br/&gt;involving singular perturbations, invariant manifolds, exponential&lt;br/&gt;dichotomies, and topological methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are developing new mathematical techniques for analyzing and&lt;br/&gt;understanding differential equations and difference equations. Such&lt;br/&gt;equations typically arise as models in numerous areas of science. In&lt;br/&gt;broad terms, these types of mathematical systems model time-dependent&lt;br/&gt;or evolutionary behavior, as it occurs in a wide range of scientific&lt;br/&gt;areas, including biology, chemistry, electrical circuit theory, image&lt;br/&gt;processing, and material science. Although this is a very broad scope&lt;br/&gt;of inquiry, the specific problems to be studied exhibit features in&lt;br/&gt;common -- spontaneous formation of patterns, self-sustained oscillations,&lt;br/&gt;regulation by internal feedback (often with time delays) -- which can be&lt;br/&gt;analyzed with some of the basic tools of dynamical systems theory. It is&lt;br/&gt;expected the resulting mathematical advances arising from these studies&lt;br/&gt;will increase the knowledge of, and will provide insight into both the&lt;br/&gt;abstract theory of dynamical systems, as well as the scientific areas of&lt;br/&gt;inquiry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
