    <AbstractNarration>Understanding the response of ecological systems to disturbance is a central&lt;br/&gt;problem in ecology, and is of fundamental importance to management of&lt;br/&gt;ecosystems from local to global scales. Two major theories of disturbance&lt;br/&gt;are stability theory, which describes the rate of return of ecosystems to&lt;br/&gt;pre-disturbance conditions, and multiple state theory, which describes the&lt;br/&gt;transition of ecosystems between alternative equilibrium conditions (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;grassland vs. shrubland, etc.). Because desert streams are subject to&lt;br/&gt;frequent and severe disturbance in the form of both flood and drying, these&lt;br/&gt;ecosystems provide excellent models for understanding the response of&lt;br/&gt;ecosystems to disturbance more generally. Prior to the end of the 19th&lt;br/&gt;century, wetlands (cienegas) were a common feature of the Southwestern U.S.&lt;br/&gt;Erosion of these wetlands left most arid streams as bare, gravelbed channels&lt;br/&gt;(arroyos) that represent an alternative equilibrium. Recent observations of&lt;br/&gt;wetland re-establishment at a long-term ecological study site (Sycamore&lt;br/&gt;Creek, AZ) provides an opportunity to evaluate how the alternative&lt;br/&gt;configurations of desert streams respond to disturbances using the context&lt;br/&gt;of stability theory. Following flash flood disturbance, we will measure&lt;br/&gt;primary production and ecosystem respiration in both wetland and gravelbed&lt;br/&gt;sites to determine whether these alternative stable states differ in their&lt;br/&gt;response to disturbance. The Intellectual Merit of this proposal lies in&lt;br/&gt;this integration of single- and multiple-equilibrium theories of ecosystem&lt;br/&gt;response to disturbance. The Broader Impact of this research will be to&lt;br/&gt;improve conservation and restoration efforts of this formerly-widespread and&lt;br/&gt;now-rare wetland ecosystem, and to provide opportunities for training of&lt;br/&gt;graduate students in the design, execution, and analysis of ecological&lt;br/&gt;studies.</AbstractNarration>
