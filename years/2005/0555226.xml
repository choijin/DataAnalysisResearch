<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Further development of a general and effective program for electron collisions with atoms and&lt;br/&gt;ions using a B-spline approach with non-orthogonal orbitals will be undertaken. The approach is based upon an extended version of the R-matrix method, in which non-orthogonal&lt;br/&gt;orbitals are extensively used for describing both the target states and the scattering functions.&lt;br/&gt;The new approach is essentially free of the three major problems that often arise when the most frequently used suite of R-matrix codes, mostly developed over the past three decades in Belfast and currently used world-wide, is applied to truly complex targets such as heavy noble gases or open-shell transition elements. These problems include i) the difficulties in describing all target states of interest for a given calculation to sufficient accuracy, ii) the likely occurrence of unphysical structures, so-called pseudo-resonances, when an attempt is made to address the former problem, and iii) numerical difficulties due to an ill-conditioned orthogonalization procedure and the need to modify the so called Buttle correction.&lt;br/&gt;The excellent numerical properties of a B-spline basis used for the description of the continuum&lt;br/&gt;states in the inner region allow for high computational accuracy, while the completeness of the basis will ensure that no Buttle correction to the R-matrix elements is required. With the non-orthogonal orbital technique the target states can be generated from independent calculations, with compact configuration expansions.   During the funding period, the following extensions will be undertaken:&lt;br/&gt;1) parallelize the code to allow for the treatment of even more challenging problems;&lt;br/&gt;2) include a sufficient number of pseudo-states to simulate coupling to the ionization continuum,&lt;br/&gt;thereby allowing for accurate results to be generated at intermediate energies;&lt;br/&gt;3) use extention 2) above to generate results for ionization processes;&lt;br/&gt;4) generate the target orbitals by the relativistic Hartree-Fock method;&lt;br/&gt;5) treat charged-particle impact and multi-photon single- and double-ionization;&lt;br/&gt;6) treat electron collisions with diatomic molecules.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
