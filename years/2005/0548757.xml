<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project targets development of an innovative membrane for separation of hydrogen.  These membranes are based on an innovative nanostructured architecture and a unique fabrication process.  The proposed approach enable an ultra-thin Pd separation layer, which can support a 10X or greater increase in hydrogen flux over the state of the art, with no reduction in hydrogen selectivity and superior reliability.  The performance of the prototypes will be thoroughly validated in actual operating environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected result of the proposed work is a viable technology for the production of robust hydrogen separation membranes with advanced performance, superior reliability and lower cost. Such an enabling technology could facilitate a variety of current applications, such as hydrogen separation for fuel cells and point-of-use hydrogen purification. With further research and development, hydrogen could also serve as an alternative source of energy for heating and lighting homes, generating electricity, and transportation. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the Phase II/IIB project was development and commercialization of innovative metal-ceramic composite membranes for separation of hydrogen, with the aim of demonstrating the ability to produce membranes that were overall superior (in terms of performance and total cost) to existing hydrogen separation membranes (palladium foils).  Significant achievements in the project included:  Developed and produced composite membranes that matched or exceeded performance of 15&micro;m Pd foil membranes In combination with partners, developed and demonstrated working systems capable of generating hydrogen in fuel cell and point-of production applications Scaled-up membrane fabrication processes and consequently supplied separation membranes in sizes and formats appropriate for mid-scale (250W) fuel cell applications and industrial production at a rate of 100 lbs./day Determined the strengths and weaknesses of the hydrogen separation technology with respect to the identified applications, and determined the economic feasibility of commercialization beyond the scale implemented in the project   While the project did not attain the objective of launching sales related to commercial devices, it did demonstrate that this objective may be reached with modest additional effort.  While this project focused on the near-term needs of hydrogen supply for fuel cells and hydrogen production from biomass- and coal-derived syngas, the broader results of the project support the long term need for development and exploitation of alternative energy sources to petroleum, with hydrogen serving diverse needs such as heating and lighting homes, generating electricity, and transportation.  The project results add to a growing body of work that will enable breakthrough platforms that can rapidly, reliably, and cost effectively perform gas separations.
