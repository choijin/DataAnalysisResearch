<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0539088&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Jerry E. Vaughan, Alexander Chigogidze&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conferences (STDC) have&lt;br/&gt;been among the most successful and longest running annual&lt;br/&gt;topology conferences in the nation, attracting an international&lt;br/&gt;audience.  The conference for 2006 will be the fortieth annual&lt;br/&gt;meeting of STDC. The conference brings together mathematicians&lt;br/&gt;and graduate students working in the two core areas, and covers&lt;br/&gt;most areas of topology and of topological approaches to dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems.  The conference fosters extensive interactions among&lt;br/&gt;adjacent research areas and their applications.  This contributes&lt;br/&gt;greatly to the advancement of knowledge through communication of&lt;br/&gt;recent results to a broad audience.  Further impact comes from&lt;br/&gt;publication of refereed papers from among those presented. The&lt;br/&gt;conference emphasizes participation by graduate students, young&lt;br/&gt;researchers, women and under represented minority groups. We&lt;br/&gt;expect the conference to attract about 200 participants. The&lt;br/&gt;conference activities feature hour plenary talks and half-hour&lt;br/&gt;talks in two parallel sessions given by leading experts, and four&lt;br/&gt;special sessions of contributed talks. The special sessions are&lt;br/&gt;entitled: Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, General and&lt;br/&gt;Set-Theoretic Topology, and Geometric Topology and Geometric&lt;br/&gt;Group Theory. It is our intention that many of these plenary and&lt;br/&gt;semi-plenary talks emphasize interaction of the research agendas&lt;br/&gt;of two or more conference areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology is a diverse area of mathematics that grew out of&lt;br/&gt;classical geometry and analysis.  Its language and ideas pervade&lt;br/&gt;much of modern mathematics. Topics in topology range from the&lt;br/&gt;classification of surfaces in space to limits of sequences and&lt;br/&gt;approximation of various mathematical objects. A dynamical system&lt;br/&gt;is a physical setting together with rules for how the setting&lt;br/&gt;changes or evolves over the course of time (for example,&lt;br/&gt;population growth and fractals).  The area of Dynamical Systems&lt;br/&gt;studies ways to predict the long-term behavior of such&lt;br/&gt;systems. The language and ideas of topology, which are heavily&lt;br/&gt;used in the area of Dynamical Systems, are often used in many&lt;br/&gt;areas of science such as physics, chemistry, and computer&lt;br/&gt;science. Recently, topological ideas are finding application in&lt;br/&gt;areas such as biology, psychology, sociology, medicine, and&lt;br/&gt;robotics. The meeting of the fortieth annual STDC helps insure&lt;br/&gt;the continued progress, growth and leadership of United States&lt;br/&gt;researchers in topology and topological methods in Dynamical&lt;br/&gt;Systems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
