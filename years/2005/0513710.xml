    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit: Photosynthesis is a fundamental biological process that is essential to the evolution and maintenance of life on Earth. This project will support a Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the "Biochemical Aspects of Photosynthesis" to be held at Bryant University, Smithfield, RI from July 3 to July 8, 2005. The Gordon Research Conferences are the key conferences in the field of photosynthesis and are attended by researchers from around the world. A principal objective of the 2005 meeting is to assemble a diverse, inter-disciplinary group of scientists who use cutting-edge technologies to attack critical problems in the field. There is an emphasis on biology including genomic approaches, biogenesis and assembly, regulation, and stress effects. Leading established researchers, new investigators as well as scientists from other fields have been invited to present lectures on their most recent, unpublished discoveries. The complete program represents an international community of scientists (www.grc.org/programs/2005/photosyn.htm).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The meeting will integrate research and education by encouraging the participation of faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions, Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows. The exchange of information at this meeting is unusually strong. Virtually every participant, from the most junior to the most senior, brings his or her work into the arena for one-on-one discussion. Out of these interactions new collaborations and ideas for new approaches and directions arise.</AbstractNarration>
