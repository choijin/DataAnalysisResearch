<AbstractNarration>AST-0507545&lt;br/&gt;Miller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will make the first measurement of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect (SZE) scaling relations, using a sample of both rich clusters and groups of galaxies to progress toward a resolution of a long-standing problem in structure formation.  Observations suggest that supernova or AGN heating and gas cooling are significant for the formation of clusters and groups of galaxies.  The SZE is a unique way to probe high-redshift low-density objects, complementary to observations of the X-ray luminosity.  This is new and exciting science, from a modest research effort leveraged on existing investment in a nearly-completed interferometric array of telescopes, the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Array (SZA).  Two cluster samples with measured central SZE decrement and total integrated decrement will constrain the linkage of X-ray luminosity to baryon depletion or to increased gas entropy.  Understanding the relationship between cluster observables and cluster mass is invaluable for using clusters as cosmological probes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project primarily supports a graduate student, already involved in construction and deployment of the SZA, to pursue related thesis work and to continue an established relationship between the university laboratory and a local high school teacher and her students.</AbstractNarration>
