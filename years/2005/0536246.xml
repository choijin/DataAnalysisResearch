<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to implement the Student Centered Activities for Large Enrollment University Programs (SCALE-UP) developed at North Carolina State University. The objectives are to increase students' conceptual understanding of physics and astronomy, problem solving abilities, and understanding of the nature of physics and of science in general. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The past fifteen years of Physics Education Research has shown that students learn and retain significantly more in active learning environments when compared to traditional models of teaching, particularly to the traditional lecture in an auditorium. The SCALE-UP program has demonstrated success at increasing students' conceptual understanding of physics, appreciation for the nature of science, problem solving abilities, and increasing retention. SCALE-UP offers a way of teaching introductory physics and astronomy classes in a studio physics format for both small and large-enrollment courses. This effort is consistent with the College's mission statement, the strategic plan of the School of Humanities and Sciences, and the mission and goals of the Physics Department.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is using a variety of physics and astronomy materials already developed and building a SCALE-UP physics and astronomy facility. It is using and developing a combination of Reading Quizzes, Discussion Questions, Mini-Investigations, and Experiments. Development of materials is being done in close collaboration with the SCALE-UP developers to facilitate the inclusion of new materials in the SCALE-UP online curriculum database. A result of the project is the development of instructional materials extending SCALE-UP to include introductory astronomy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is that it significantly improves physics and astronomy instruction at the introductory level where it matters the most, and makes significant contributions to the field of Astronomy Education Research by implementing SCALE-UP techniques. The entire physics and astronomy faculty is participating in implementing the plan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The broader impact of this project is an increase in students' conceptual understanding of physics and astronomy, problem solving ability, and understanding of the nature of science. Additionally, curriculum materials are enhancing faculty development through the adoption of active learning materials that are superior to traditional materials. These methods have also been shown to increase retention of underrepresented groups, including women and minorities. The results of this project lead to an increase in the science literacy of non-science majors, contributing to a more science literate society.</AbstractNarration>
