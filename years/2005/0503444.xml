<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0503444&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Justin T. Moore&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Boise Extravaganza in Set Theory is an annual three day&lt;br/&gt;conference at Boise State University devoted to set theory and&lt;br/&gt;related areas of mathematics such as algebra, analysis,&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, logic, and topology.  It has occurred continuously&lt;br/&gt;since the first conference in 1992.  This proposal is a request&lt;br/&gt;for travel and lodging support for the invited speakers and&lt;br/&gt;participants who attend the conference (particularly students and&lt;br/&gt;junior researchers).  The main goals of the conference are as&lt;br/&gt;follows: (1) Provide the Western US with an annual conference in&lt;br/&gt;set theory; (2) Provide an organized low-cost event accessible to&lt;br/&gt;graduate students and young researchers; (3) Provide an&lt;br/&gt;opportunity for interaction between the leaders in the field and&lt;br/&gt;set theorists early in their careers; (4) Provide a forum for&lt;br/&gt;interactions between set theory and related areas of mathematics;&lt;br/&gt;(5) Represent the many different sub-disciplines within set&lt;br/&gt;theory; (6) Encourage participation by women and minorities when&lt;br/&gt;possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
