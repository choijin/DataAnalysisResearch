    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate superior power-delivery, rapid-charge, and long cycle-life performance of prototype carbon-coated, nanoparticle-based electrodes for use in inherently safe, moderate-to-large sized lithium ion batteries of various commercial designs. The primary innovation is the use of optimally sized, arranged and assembled carboncoated nanoparticles that preserve the intrinsic performance characteristics of the bare nanocrystalline materials when fabricated into thin-film electrode structures for use in advanced power sources. Phase I focused on improving performance of nanostructured aggregates of 20nm lithium titanate (n-LTO, used in anode service) via carbon coating for better electrical and ionic connectivity. Phase II will develop appropriate carbon-coated nanomaterials for cathode service designed to match the n-LTO anode performance; providing matched Li-ion host anode-cathode pairs for next-generation performance &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are demonstrated market for fast-charge, long-life batteries in a broad range of consumer applications. Markets require that it be possible to reliably and economically recharge remote devices, including portable computers; hand tools, lawn mowers and medical devices; electric cars, motorcycles and mopeds in a matter of minutes rather than hours, and faster discharge rates translate immediately to higher power per unit weight.</AbstractNarration>
