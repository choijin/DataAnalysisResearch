<AbstractNarration>Abstract for REU: Site for the Multidisciplinary Development of Environmental Sensing Technologies&lt;br/&gt;Institution: California State University, Los Angeles&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Crist S. Khachikian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU award for a Site for the Multidisciplinary Development of Environmental Sensing Technologies supports 12 undergraduates each year for three years in a 10-week summer research experience at California State University, LA.  Each summer, 12 undergraduates will participate in an intensive training and research program aimed at developing and implementing cutting-edge networks of sensors for the study of environmental processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will be modeled after the successful framework of collaboration fostered &lt;br/&gt;within the existing Center for Environmental Analysis (CEA-CREST, a 10 year $9 million dollar NSF CREST center) which unifies faculty from the departments of Biology, Chemistry, Civil Engineering, Geography and Urban Analysis, and Geology.  Four multidisciplinary teams of students will work within existing CEA-CREST sub-projects in the areas of intertidal ecology, biogeochemistry, primary productivity, and marine ecology.   The REU students will include engineers with the skills to develop and implement sensors and sensor networks and scientists with insight into the underlying biogeochemical concepts in each sub-project. The REU students will work closely with faculty, undergraduates, masters students, and postdoctoral scholars in each CEA-CREST sub-project and will be given the freedom to be innovative and creative in designing engineering solutions to outstanding and exciting questions in environmental science and engineering.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will specifically recruit undergraduates from a pool of traditional underrepresented students in the environmental sciences. These students will receive unparalleled training and research experience, which will inspire them to continue their studies towards advanced graduate degrees.  Two research universities (UC Merced and Los Angeles) and a science institute (Oak Crest) are collaborators on this project.  This should help broaden the academic and research experiences of the REU students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
