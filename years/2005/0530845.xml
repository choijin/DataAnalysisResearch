<AbstractNarration>This project is a new collaboration between geoscientists &lt;br/&gt;and mathematicians at two locations: Norman, Oklahoma and Boulder, &lt;br/&gt;Colorado. The initiative brings scientists new to the atmospheric &lt;br/&gt;science community to aid in the development of parallel, adaptive, &lt;br/&gt;unstructured, high-order methods for atmospheric modeling. Established &lt;br/&gt;atmospheric modelers will guide the effort, offering their experience &lt;br/&gt;with numerical modeling of complex weather systems. The collaboration &lt;br/&gt;also brings together the considerable expertise and resources of the &lt;br/&gt;National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) located in Boulder, &lt;br/&gt;Colorado and the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) located in &lt;br/&gt;Norman, Oklahoma. The NCAR effort will build on its experience of &lt;br/&gt;developing high-order adaptive spectral element solvers for the &lt;br/&gt;shallow water equations, moving to high-order finite-volume adaptive &lt;br/&gt;Discontinuous Galerkin methods for the nonhydrostatic equation set. &lt;br/&gt;The NSSL effort will aid in this development by addressing the &lt;br/&gt;adaptivity and parallel computing issues and testing the methods on a suite of &lt;br/&gt;test problems of increasing complexity with a central long term goal of &lt;br/&gt;modeling tornadoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weather simulation is a complex problem involving many different scales&lt;br/&gt;and requiring high resolution solutions of the equations governing the &lt;br/&gt;Earth's atmosphere. Recently, it has been recognized that localized flow &lt;br/&gt;structures, such as storms, may play an important role in obtaining the best &lt;br/&gt;weather forecast. Higher resolution weather simulations are required in &lt;br/&gt;applications in the atmospheric and air quality communities, at operational centers &lt;br/&gt;around the country attempting to forecast significant weather events, and for &lt;br/&gt;research endeavors that focus on the dynamics of severe storms such as &lt;br/&gt;hurricanes or tornadoes. Recent developments in computational mathematics techniques may be &lt;br/&gt;applicable to these models in order to tailor them to treatment of local &lt;br/&gt;structures such as storms and fronts. This project aims to create a collaboration between  &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians who have developed these methods and meteorologists who &lt;br/&gt;have modeled and studied such events, that will yield more efficient &lt;br/&gt;and accurate models. Across the globe weather modelers are striving to increase resolution &lt;br/&gt;for the models, but are limited in their methodology to only reducing &lt;br/&gt;the spacing, thereby increasing computer time significantly. The US is &lt;br/&gt;already behind in that race. This project would leapfrog that strategy &lt;br/&gt;by developing more efficient models that can automatically hone in on &lt;br/&gt;localized structures with high precision. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
