<AbstractNarration> Auchenorrhyncha (cicadas, leafhoppers, planthoppers, spittlebugs, and treehoppers) is a diverse and economically important but poorly studied group of mostly sap-sucking insects.  Approximately 42,000 species are known, but recent sampling suggests that the true number of extant species may be many times higher.  The number of experts (taxonomists) capable of identifying these insects has declined precipitously in recent decades, and this trend has only recently begun to be reversed through a previous NSF PEET award focused on training new experts in Membracoidea (leafhoppers and treehoppers), the largest of the four main groups of Auchenorrhyncha.  The new project will build on the success of the previous award by training experts in the other three groups: Cicadoidea (cicadas), Cercopoidea (spittlebugs), and Fulgoroidea (planthoppers).  The project represents a partnership between the New York State Museum, Illinois Natural History Survey, University of Connecticut, and an international team of collaborators, including retirees, with expertise covering all major auchenorrhynchan taxa.  Specific goals include: (1) train at least one new expert in the systematics of each of the four Auchenorrhyncha superfamilies; (2) develop Internet-accessible databases for species of Cercopoidea, Cicadoidea, and selected groups of Fulgoroidea to complement those already developed for Membracoidea; (3) obtain Auchenorrhyncha specimens suitable for morphological and molecular study from poorly sampled areas known to harbor diverse faunas; (4) complete species-level morphology-based revisions of species descriptions within each of the four superfamilies; (5) disseminate results (identification keys, descriptions, phylogenies or genealogy trees, geographic distribution maps and nomenclatural data) through traditional publication and the Internet.  Innovative aspects of the project include its coordinated approach to training, involving several experts with complementary expertise; the use of advanced tools for the efficient synthesis of taxonomic information and production of improved classifications and identification tools in electronic and traditional formats; and the applicability of the anticipated phylogenetic results to basic conceptual issues in systematics and evolution.&lt;br/&gt;All biological research depends on accurate species identifications and taxonomic classifications that reflect, to the extent possible, phylogenetic relationships.  By improving the human resources and scientific infrastructure needed to meet these needs for a large and poorly studied group of plant-feeding insects, this project will have lasting impact on many areas of basic and applied biology.  The personnel and products resulting from this project will serve as resources for the basic biological research community, the large community of economic and ecological entomologists working toward improved methods for diagnosing and managing agricultural pests, and the community of conservation biologists interested in conserving threatened species and habitats.  Benefits to society at large include the education of a new generation of biological scientists with specialized expertise, dissemination of improved educational tools via the Internet, improved food security through accurate identification of plant disease vectors and other pests, and improved detection of environmental threats such as invasive species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[PEET--Partnership for Training New Experts on Auchenorrhyncha (Insecta: Hemiptera) (DEB 0529679) Auchenorrhyncha is a diverse and economically important, but poorly studied, group of sap-sucking insects including cicadas (superfamily Cicadoidea), spittlebugs (Cercopoidea), leaf- and treehoppers (Membracoidea), and planthoppers (Fulgoroidea).  Approximately 42,000 species are known, but recent sampling suggests that the true number of extant species may be ten times higher.  The number of experts (taxonomists) capable of identifying these insects has declined precipitously in recent decades and this trend has only recently begun to be reversed.  The goals and objectives of this project (which was a collaborative initiative of the New York State Museum, Illinois Natural History Survey, University of Connecticut, and an international team of collaborators) included the training of new experts in Auchenorrhyncha, the scientific description of new species, the reconstruction of evolutionary (phylogenetic) relationships within Auchenorrhyncha, and the development of new tools to aid in the identification of these insects.  Innovative aspects of the project included its coordinated approach to training, involving several experts with complementary expertise; the use of advanced tools for the efficient synthesis of taxonomic information and production of improved classifications and identification tools in electronic and traditional formats; and the applicability of the phylogenetic results to basic conceptual issues in systematics and evolution.             Now concluded, this successful project involved the efforts of more than 25 researchers at various academic levels (including established scientists, post-doctoral associates, and students at the graduate, undergraduate, and high-school levels).  Thousands of Auchenorrhyncha specimens were collected during fieldwork in more than 10 countries worldwide, and are available for further morphological and molecular study by the broader scientific community.  Project results were disseminated in a variety of ways: (1) in more than 100 publications in scientific journals and edited books; (2) in more than 100 research presentations at scientific conferences; (3) in numerous public educational presentations and outreach programs; and (4) in several freely accessible Internet websites with new taxonomic identification tools for several subgroups within Auchenorrhyncha.  The training aspect of this project was particularly effective, with several new taxonomic experts receiving graduate (M.S. and Ph.D.) degrees based on this research.  Numerous newly discovered Auchenorrhyncha species were scientifically described in the course of this project.             All biological research depends on accurate species identifications and taxonomic classifications that reflect, to the extent possible, phylogenetic relationships.  By improving the human resources and scientific infrastructure needed to meet these needs for a large and poorly studied group of plant-feeding insects, this project will have lasting impact on many areas of basic and applied biology.  The personnel and products resulting from this project will serve as resources for the basic biological research community, the large community of economic and ecological entomologists working toward improved methods for diagnosing and managing agricultural pests, and the community of conservation biologists interested in conserving threatened species and habitats.  Benefits to society at large include the education of a new generation of biological scientists with specialized expertise, dissemination of improved educational tools via the Internet, improved food security through accurate identification of plant disease vectors and other pests, and improved detection of environmental threats such as invasive species.
