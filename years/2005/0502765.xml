<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The collaborative research project between North Carolina A&amp;T State University (NC A&amp;T SU), Drexel University, and the University of Aveiro in Portugal is focused on the development of nanostructured thin film materials in membrane reactors for the high purity oxygen separation and for synthesis of the syngas (CO+H2). Syngas is an important intermediate in the production of hydrogen and in the conversion of methane to a range of paraffins, olefins and alcohols. The primary goal is to achieve the enlarged surface area and enhanced catalytic activity of the membranes and this research will lead to less expensive and robust technology for partial methane reforming. &lt;br/&gt;High school, undergraduate, and graduate students will be involved in the research and will present their results at technical meetings. It is expected that this research will result in high-profile publications and presentations on prestigious conferences. All efforts will be made to attract underrepresented students to careers in materials science and engineering. Two graduate students from NC A&amp;T SU and Drexel University will spend time working at the University of Aveiro. Undergraduate students will participate in research at a government laboratory (ORNL) during the summer months. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this project will have unique opportunity to collaborate with European researchers and students by participating in the project meetings and internship programs thereby providing a globalized learning experience.&lt;br/&gt;This work is support by the Division of Materials Research, the Partnerships for Innovation Program and the Office of International Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: This research is expected to produce fundamental knowledge and understanding of the interrelationships between processing, structure, and catalytic activity of La-Sr-Cr-Fe(Al, Ni)-O based thin films deposited on the dense Sr(Fe, Al)O3 perovskite membranes by pulsed laser deposition technique. It is expected that these newly developed thin films will have excellent catalytic properties to increase the rate of methane conversion at the same time providing the syngas with a required H2/CO ratio close to two. This research will lead to the development of catalytically-active dense perovskite membranes for partial oxidation of methane with an enhanced surface area and excellent structural stability exceeding that of currently used La-Sr-Fe-O ceramics.</AbstractNarration>
