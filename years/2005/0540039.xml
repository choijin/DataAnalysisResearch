<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding that will enable US scholars to participate in the 2005 International Symposium on Nanomanufacturing.  The International Symposium for NanoManufacturing (ISNM) serves as the world's leading forum in which scholars, engineers and members of the business community gather to discuss the future of Nanomanufacturing.  Maintaining US leadership in Nanomanufacturing is important to the national interest and therefore US scholars should be intimately involved in the activities and discussions that take place at ISNM.  Specifically, US scholars need to be able to share their work, learn from other experts in the field, and be present to lead in the discussions that will shape the perspective of the Nanomanufacturing community.  Toward this end, the funding from this grant will be primarily used to defray the cost of travel for US participants that will attend ISNM 2005 (to be held in Cyprus).  Specifically the funds will provide support for:  - US scholars to participate in poster sessions, plenary talks and tutorials&lt;br/&gt;-US young scholars (e.g. students) to participate in a design project competition  - The recruitment of US scholars from under represented groups for ISNM 2005 &amp; 2006  - Travel support for under represented scholars to attend ISNM 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected benefits of this grant include (1) the rapid sharing and dissemination of world-wide Nanomanufacturing science into the US academic/engineering community, (2) the continued recognition of US leadership in the field, and (3) the improvement of US human resources in the following ways:    (1) The training of young researchers in nano-scale engineering via a design competition (2) The dissemination of knowledge via plenary speakers  (3) The creation of tutorials for education of the Nanomanufacturing community (4) The recruitment of scholars from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
