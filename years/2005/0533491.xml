    <AbstractNarration>Imaginary Lines is creating two videos and 2 companion booklets with the aim of encouraging more upper elementary and middle school girls to remain or become engaged in STEM and particularly engineering. There are few programs that focus on middle school girls and engineering interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will leverage two existing projects (funded elsewhere; organized by the proposers): the TOYchallenge national toy design competition, and a movie being produced on TOYchallenge. The two videos will be developed from hundreds of hours of movie footage. One video will show girls from diverse backgrounds involved in designing and engineering toys; the other will feature diverse female engineers describing their work and its application. One booklet, for adults, will describe the engineering design process and include research-based strategies on encouraging girls in STEM; the other will be an engaging career booklet for girls, featuring interviews with 12 female engineers, including those in the video. Dissemination of the videos and booklets will be coordinated with the release of the film and the continuing TOYchallenge competition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit. Research shows that a weak or negative image of engineering is a barrier to girls' interest, and to parental understanding of the career path. This project will change the image that many girls and adults have of engineering. It will advance their understanding of what engineering is and what engineers look like, make it easier for girls to imagine themselves as engineers, and inspire adults to encourage girls in those pursuits. Imaginary Lines has many years of experience producing and delivering materials for girls interested in STEM. Under a separate grant, they are developing a brochure for parents on issues and research on the topic. The company also has 3 years experience running TOYchallenge, and developed the research bases for the concept of the documentary film under a grant from NSF. The award-winning producer of the videos is the producer/director of the film itself. The advisory team brings expertise in engineering, STEM pipeline issues, and informal science materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reasons for focusing on this age group and the adults who influence them, are well grounded in research. The partner's programs will ensure that minority girls are exposed to the materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal leverages research, existing programs and a major film project, and will take full advantage of the film and strategic alliances. Imaginary Lines has effective working relationships with the partners including ITEA, COSI, Sigma Xi, Science Enrichment Program (Girl Scouts), National Coalition of Girls' Schools, and the National Engineers Week Foundation. The videos will be included on the DVD version of the film. Plans for dissemination include special screenings of the film (e.g., film festivals; corporate-sponsored events), showing videos and distributing booklets at programs for girls (e.g., Sally Ride Science Camps, girl scout programs), at science center &amp; Engineers Week events (e.g., COSI camp-ins; eWeek "Family Day"), and at national conventions (e.g., Sigma Xi, ITEA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The goal is to expose large numbers of girls, parents, and teachers to a new image of engineering - one that is welcoming to diverse groups of girls, making them more likely to think about engineering as a viable career. The project will advance both girls' and adults' understanding of engineers and engineering and will promote adults' ability to encourage girls by offering specific strategies to engage them in STEM projects. It will ultimately increase the number of girls who enter and remain in the STEM pipeline.</AbstractNarration>
