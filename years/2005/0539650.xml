<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project explores the innovation of a robot that, like biological creatures, operates by applying and sensing contact forces. Today's position-controlled robots have limited applicability to many manufacturing tasks, especially those related to material removal and surface finishing. Emulating a human's free-hand motion capability greatly advances robot capability. Such a robot could trace part contours to smooth and polish. It could "feel" for part edges to discover a part's location, and compare measured geometry to a modeled ideal to detect finishing requirements. The robot could follow finishing strategies, acquiring needed information by touch as it worked. These capabilities will be applied to turbine blade finishing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications for force capable robots are ubiquitous across industry. Virtually all parts made from casting, forging, machining, or molding require some degree of surface finishing to arrive at a final desired shape and smoothness. Other prospective applications include: mechanical assembly, sorting and packaging irregular objects, and dual-arm manipulation of heavy and bulky items. The hazards to people filling these roles and&lt;br/&gt;performing repetitive motions are well known, with musculo-skeletal injuries costing the U.S. an estimated $15 Billion/yr.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
