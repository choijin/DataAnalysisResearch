<AbstractNarration>This project is concerned with the development of algorithms and&lt;br/&gt;software for the restoration of images degraded by nonlinear and&lt;br/&gt;nonuniform motion blurs.  The problems to be addressed by the&lt;br/&gt;investigator and his colleagues include the development of an&lt;br/&gt;appropriate mathematical model for nonlinear motion blurs, analysis of&lt;br/&gt;the ill-conditioning of the blurring process, development of efficient&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for removing motion blur, and development of software for&lt;br/&gt;specific applications.  Algorithm and software development is needed&lt;br/&gt;for the solution of large scale, severely ill-conditioned linear&lt;br/&gt;systems that arise in the discrete formulation of these problems. For&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear and nonuniform motion, these systems generally have no&lt;br/&gt;exploitable structure; that is, standard deconvolution techniques that&lt;br/&gt;use fast Fourier transforms are not applicable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Images used for surveillance, medical diagnostic, and other scientific&lt;br/&gt;purposes are rarely perfect.  Imperfections in the imaging system and&lt;br/&gt;environmental effects may result in serious degradations, such as&lt;br/&gt;blurring, in the recorded image.  Postprocessing techniques (i.e.,&lt;br/&gt;computational methods) are often necessary to obtain better quality&lt;br/&gt;pictures.  Designing appropriate algorithms requires accurate&lt;br/&gt;mathematical modeling of the image formation process, and development&lt;br/&gt;of robust, efficient computational tools.  One of the most common&lt;br/&gt;causes of blurring in images is motion of either the recording device&lt;br/&gt;or the objects being imaged.  Although linear motion, with constant&lt;br/&gt;speed and direction, is well understood, very little work has been&lt;br/&gt;done to develop mathematical models and efficient algorithms for the&lt;br/&gt;restoration of images degraded by nonlinear and nonuniform motion&lt;br/&gt;blurs.  The investigator and his colleagues consider this difficult,&lt;br/&gt;important problem.  The software developed through this project can be&lt;br/&gt;applied to many important applications, including medical imaging&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., movement of the heart during cardiac imaging processes), aerial&lt;br/&gt;and video surveillance, forensic investigations, and astronomical&lt;br/&gt;imaging.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
