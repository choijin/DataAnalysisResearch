    <AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a dissemination methodology for the GRASP program. GRASP (Gaining Retention and Achievement for Students Program), is designed to increase retention and achievement of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) undergraduates using a semester long faculty development program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GRASP is unique because it can be institutionalized at a university or community college within three years. Research results from previous implementations of the GRASP program show that once a cohort of faculty on a campus have participated in the program and demonstrated improved student retention and achievement, their departments and colleges are likely to absorb the low-cost for faculty to participate in GRASP. Since the program provides documentation for tenure and promotion, faculty are likely to participate and use the program practices as part of their regular teaching practices.</AbstractNarration>
