<AbstractNarration>0547657&lt;br/&gt;Yang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The over-arching objective of the proposed research and educational plan is further utilization of the expertise that the PI has in the area of optical imaging in order to develop better modalities of imaging using contrast agents with OCT, develop a miniaturized, forward looking OCT probe, seek wider application for OCT among biological and biomedical fields and develop a miniature optical microscope that uses microfluidics to move imaged object over an imaging platform. The educational objectives have a focus on development of the student's mind as a whole, by inclusion of intuitive understanding as well as encouragement towards other endeavors such as artistic expression.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
