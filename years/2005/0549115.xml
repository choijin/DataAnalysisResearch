<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports a new graduate training program at Rutgers University in perceptual science.  The past decade of growth in perceptual technologies (automated recognition systems; usable virtual environments) has created the need for a new generation of realistic, comprehensive and innovative perceptual models, applicable to humans and implemented in machines.  This IGERT will train students to develop and apply such models by integrating formal and experimental approaches to human and machine perception, bridging the gaps in language, perspective and knowledge that divide technically and behaviorally oriented disciplines.   Training is organized around a new core curriculum in perceptual science that begins with foundational coursework in human perception and computer science, including bootstrapping courses to fill in gaps in undergraduate backgrounds. A cornerstone is a new one-year laboratory course, Integrative Methods in Perceptual Science, in which students learn to integrate human and computer perception by working on realistic projects in small teams with faculty mentors in a specialized multi-faceted teaching laboratory.  Students will carry out integrative doctoral research, co-advised by faculty in human and computer perception, in one of 6 cross-cutting areas:  animate vision, multi-modal cues for perceiving and grasping 3D objects, scanning and searching, visual-auditory integration, visual language, and visual communication.  Broader impacts include development of novel perceptual devices and technologies usable in home, educational, clinical or industrial settings.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[            Human beings possess remarkable perceptual skills.  Our visual sense, for example, converts the array of light falling on our retinas into coherent representations of a 3-dimensional world that allow us to recognize our friends approaching from far away, or drive cars through dense traffic, or detect the tiniest malformations on a radiographic image.  At the same time we have increasing access to machines (automated systems or robots) that attempt to mimic these abilities, for example, recognizing faces from grainy video images, or delivering objects to people whose mobility is compromised, or understanding and responding to spoken requests.  These new technical developments depend on models of perception, and the best source of these models is unquestionably the human.  The Interdisciplinary Graduate Educational Research and Training (IGERT) program in Interdisciplinary Perceptual Science originated from the need to develop new theories of perception that can be applied to humans and implemented in machines.              The Perceptual Science IGERT developed a novel program that trained students in computational and empirical approaches to perception in humans and computer systems.  A core idea was to begin with shared educational experiences at the earliest levels of graduate training, and continue through novel interdisciplinary research in later years. This goal was achieved by creating new interdisciplinary courses, and initiating new sets of interdisciplinary research projects and community activities.              Among the key educational achievements was the creation of  new foundational courses in Computer Science, Computational Thinking and Computational Modeling, intended for all regardless of prior background in computer science.  The courses introduced students to the formal and logical procedures in Computer Science by working on representative projects in teams.  These foundational courses in Computer Science were gateways to advanced courses and allowed some to complete the requirements for the masterÆs degree in CS in addition to their doctorate in Psychology.  Three foundational courses in human perception and cognition (Sensation and Perception; Computational Cognition; and Mathematical Models of Perception and Cognition) introduced all students to the theories and methods of the study of human perception, including the underlying neuroscience and the most important computational advances.              After completion of the foundational courses, and some introductory research, students took another important course, Integrative Methods in Perceptual Science (IMPS), which was a key achievement of the IGERT.  This year-long course provided a hands-on research experience by having students design and conduct original projects in interdisciplinary teams.    Projects included (a) development of a novel virtual environment of living "agents" that are programmed to compete with one another for resources;  (b) study of how human observers infer intentionality on the basis of visual cues; (c) a study of how haptic perception is affected by adaptation; (d) development of visual avatars that represent the motor activities of people doing complex tasks; (e) studies (still in progress) of how humans "forage" through virtual environments, where optimal decisions depend on the evaluation of cues, distance, time, costs and rewards.  Projects a-d have either been published or presented at conferences.               The Perceptual Science community maintained its coherence through a weekly seminar, with presentations by our own students or outside visitors, followed by intense discussion, as well as an end-of-year poster session in which all students presented their research achievements to the university community.               IGERT students participated in research projects that created novel links between human perception and computer science.  Key interdisciplinary collaborations were:  a study of how to...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
