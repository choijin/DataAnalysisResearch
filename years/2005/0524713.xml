<AbstractNarration>Mems and nano devices such as micromechanisms that can swim, crawl, .y, autonomous&lt;br/&gt;micromanufacturing plants, microrobotic arrays, and next generation data storage, retrieval&lt;br/&gt;and search devices, will all constitute of large arrays (perhaps millions or more) of dynamic&lt;br/&gt;elements operating in unison. In essence these arrays, due to their autonomous features,&lt;br/&gt;adaptability to varying environmental conditions, and their own complex dynamics, will&lt;br/&gt;qualify to be called arti.cial organisms. Empowering them with autonomous control features&lt;br/&gt;will be a necessary task which will be quite di.erent from any of the control design problems&lt;br/&gt;encountered today. This proposal addresses the problem of designing controllers for such&lt;br/&gt;systems. It is argued that pattern formation is the key to controlling these systems. In&lt;br/&gt;contrast to simple electrical engineering circuitry, all organisms seem to be capable of (a)&lt;br/&gt;producing a large number of di.erent patterns, and in addition (b) capable of fast and&lt;br/&gt;graceful transition from one pattern to another. Control methodology sought after here will&lt;br/&gt;be mindful of these requirements. The question of what are appropriate patterns has for the&lt;br/&gt;most part been already addressed by biologists, physicists and mathematicians. However,&lt;br/&gt;there are two associated control challenges; (a) embedding such an equation in the natural&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of a mems or a nano array, and (b) how to design a control system to ensure&lt;br/&gt;quick and graceful transition from one pattern to another. Both these aspects are almost&lt;br/&gt;completely unexplored, and will be the focus of this research project. Among our interests&lt;br/&gt;will be (i) formulating and analyzing appropriate pole placement type problems, (ii) develop&lt;br/&gt;theories to understand how to design switching control laws that will minimize transient&lt;br/&gt;excursions, (iii) enumerate basic building blocks to create dynamic patterns, and .nding&lt;br/&gt;ways to (nonlinearly) superimpose them in order to generate complex dynamic patterns,&lt;br/&gt;(iv) formulate and solve appropriate model matching problems that arise in embedding&lt;br/&gt;pattern forming equations in microacuator/sensor arrays, and (v) asymptotically (at least&lt;br/&gt;practically asymptotically) stabilize dynamic patterns.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits Proposed research will lead to new classes of generic nonlinear control&lt;br/&gt;problems, and hence will impact upon the theory of nonlinear control in general. As far as&lt;br/&gt;we are aware, applicable mathematical theories discussed in the proposal have not previously&lt;br/&gt;been adapted to control theory. Seemingly these theories are at the very foundation necessary&lt;br/&gt;to understand how to control engineering actuator arrays of the future.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts Micro- and nano- actuators are anticipated to play central roles in application&lt;br/&gt;areas such as microsurgery (mimic the hand movement of a surgeon in the micro&lt;br/&gt;scale), crawling, swimming and .ying robots performing tasks ranging from spying to drug&lt;br/&gt;delivery inside veins, audio processing devices that mimic the cochlear, and computing devices&lt;br/&gt;that mimic the brain functions. A concerted e.ort will be made to attract graduate&lt;br/&gt;and undergraduate students from under-represented groups, in particular from the large Hispanic&lt;br/&gt;community in the surrounding areas, to participate in the proposed research. We have&lt;br/&gt;already established a track record for supervising theses and dissertations of female students,&lt;br/&gt;and at least one female PhD student will receive partial funding from this grant. There is&lt;br/&gt;a very high probability that the theory to be developed will .nd a receptive application oriented&lt;br/&gt;and experimental oriented audience, due to our ongoing collaborations with the mems&lt;br/&gt;research group at the Maddox Laboratory at Texas Tech and the Texas Instruments Inc.&lt;br/&gt;through an NSF GOALI grant.</AbstractNarration>
