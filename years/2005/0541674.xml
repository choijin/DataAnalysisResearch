<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[CCMD PROJECT OUTCOMES REPORT &ndash; PHASE I  The Center for Computational Materials Design (CCMD), a collaborative effort between The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) and the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), is a National Science Foundation (NSF) Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC), established in 2005.  Catalyzed by an investment from the NSF providing support for administrative infrastructure and Center development, the CCMD research activities are primarily supported by the Center members.  Penn State and Georgia Tech provides considerable overhead reduction on CCMD research projects to provide further substantial leveraging of member dues.  Research initiatives are developed jointly between CCMD faculty and the Member Advisory Board (MAB) consisting of active CCMD members.  The MAB assists in providing guidance to the Center, giving feedback on current projects, and directly participating in research projects in both mentoring and collaborative roles.  The CCMD fosters long-term partnerships with industry and government laboratories to develop the emerging technology of materials design.  Material design is a new paradigm in which the usual route of selecting existing materials for applications, including prototype design and testing, is replaced or enhanced by concurrent design of material and applications.  Hence, the material is part of the system, with its own design degrees of freedom.  Additional ramifications of this technology include accelerated insertion of new materials, virtual manufacturing/processing, enhanced capabilities of existing materials, and tailoring of multifunctional materials for specific applications.  The vision of the CCMD is to be the premier collaborative entity in computational materials design among U.S. universities, industries and government laboratories.  The mission is to educate the next generation of scientists and engineers with a broad, industrially relevant perspective on engineering research and practice, preparing them to contribute in the emerging field of materials design.  In this regard, the member organizations realize direct benefit from the results of the research projects as well as mentoring students who are uniquely suited to implement computational materials design tools in practice.  Between 2005 and 2012, 36 undergraduate students, graduate students, and post doctoral fellows have participated in CCMD research projects.  Three graduate students earned MS degrees and thirteen graduate students received PhD degrees.  The MS students and six of the PhD studentsÆ theses were supported by the CCMD.   Industrially relevant CCMD research projects performed by Penn State and Georgia Tech graduate students and post doctoral fellows, advised by faculty, have made major contributions to the field.  Over 80 CCMD related manuscripts have been published in peer-reviewed journals, one book has been printed and several chapters of one-time publications.  Seventeen symposia were organized by CCMD faculty in a range of professional society meetings and over 160 presentations were delivered based on the CenterÆs activities.  Several new courses, positively influenced by CCMD and developed by Center faculty, are offered at Penn State and Georgia Tech.  The new curricula breadth spans undergraduate and graduate courses in materials science and engineering majors and computational science minors.  CCMD members have signed multiple software licensing agreements as a product of research projects which they mentored.  Other members have also benefited from mentoring CCMD graduate students.  Success stories generated by two members, the United States Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and The Timken Company, are based on results of CCMD research projects focused on industrial and research needs of the members, faculty collaboration, and mentoring graduate students.  The AFRL states "In this case hundreds of simulated material volumes were analy...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
