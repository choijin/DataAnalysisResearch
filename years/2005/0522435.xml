<AbstractNarration> Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: From Nanoparticles to Porous Silicas:  Understanding the Self-Assembly of Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  CTS-0522435&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:   Raul F. Lobo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution:   University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis (rationale for decision):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate the self-assembly of organic-silica nanoparticles leading to the formation of zeolite crystals and mesoporous M41S type materials under hydrothermal conditions.  The structural evolution of the nanoparticles will be examined using small-angle scattering methods and optical spectroscopy to clarify the effect of the organic cation on the zeolite precursors.   Colloidal interactions between the particles will also be characterized.  The nanoparticles will be deposited on non-porous and porous supports to form silica films. The proposal is innovative and leading edge because of the focus on discovering the missing links between the molecular level chemistry in the solution state and the structural knowledge in the solid state. This elusive link has been one of the fundamental issues in zeolite synthesis.  The synthesis work will demonstrate how to use the fundamental information obtained either to improve the synthesis of existing materials or to serve as a foundation for the design of new materials with novel properties.  Based on these studies, it should also be possible to predict the particle-surface forces that determine the rate of deposition of silica onto growing silica surfaces.   The research will be highly fundamental with broad and important relevance to catalysis, colloid science, and crystallization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the project would be focused on elementary and high school student recruitment for science and engineering.  A connection has been made with regional high schools that have a large minority population.  Undergraduate students will also be involved in the research through a University Scholars Program, which involves the completion of a thesis for a Degree with Distinction.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
