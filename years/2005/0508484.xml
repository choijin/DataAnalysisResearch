<AbstractNarration>This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 04-043, category NER. The objective of this research is to demonstrate a proof-of-principle nanopatterning process with the capability to write periodic patterns of nanometer-scale features of a variety of motives using compact table-top lasers emitting at short wavelengths, about 10 to 50 times shorter than visible light. The approach that will be pursued is multiple beam interferometric lithography. The method will exploit the coherence characteristics of these lasers to generate by interference periodic light patterns of different motives that will be used to write on photoresist. Through further processing these patterns will be transferred to substrates of interest such as ceramics or semiconductors to realize functional devices.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is significant as it promises to realize a nano-patterning scheme of unprecedented resolution thereby extending laser manufacturing to wavelengths only available until now at large synchrotron facilities.  Furthermore, it promises the realization of a versatile table-top patterning tool that could easily be integrated with other processing tools in a laboratory environment. Such tool will enable the engineering of robust templates of controlled feature size for applications such as the growth of artificially engineered nanoscale magnetic materials for data storage, and nanoscale semiconducting and sub-wavelength optical materials for lightwave technologies. It will also impact the biological sciences, by providing scaffolds to immobilize proteins, and arrange DNA strands or molecules thereby enabling novel sensing and diagnostic tools. The proposed research will also offer unique opportunities for the training of students in an innovative and forward looking nano-technology. The combined research and education opportunities of this project will greatly benefit the US nanoscience and nanotechnology initiatives, which in turn have direct impact on electronics, biology, medicine, energy storage and material science among other fields, ultimately beneficiating society.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
