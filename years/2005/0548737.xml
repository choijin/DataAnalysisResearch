    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project will provide hospitals with a way to analyze and prevent hospital-associated infection outbreaks based on integrating a location tracking system with live hospital microbiology data, building on research done in Phase I. The goal is the design, implementation, deployment and clinical validation of two tools: (1) a visualization and analysis tool for investigating propagation dynamics of past and current infection outbreaks; and, (2) a simulation tool for evaluating response measures to potential outbreaks. The research will center on clinical acceptance and usability. The involvement of medical and infection control experts will ensure that the models of infection spread are accurate, the visualization and analysis tools are intuitive, and the simulation tools cover the important infections and scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every year tens of thousands of lives, and billions of dollars, are lost to infections acquired in health care facilities. The envisioned product will give hospitals powerful tools for reducing these numbers, allowing them to better understand why infections happen and what counter-measures are effective. Hospital-associated infections' impact goes beyond the immediate sickness they cause, forcing treatment of the infection in addition to the underlying illness, and dissuading many from seeking necessary care because of the fear of acquiring infections.</AbstractNarration>
