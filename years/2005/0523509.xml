<AbstractNarration>This grant supports theoretical research on fundamental issues related&lt;br/&gt;to the implementation of quantum computation in solid-state&lt;br/&gt;devices. Since the discovery that certain tasks could be performed&lt;br/&gt;with great efficiency by algorithms based on quantum mechanics, an&lt;br/&gt;intense effort has been made to find suitable quantum&lt;br/&gt;hardware. Although several proposed implementations, such as those&lt;br/&gt;based on nuclear magnetic resonance and atomic trapping, have passed&lt;br/&gt;the proof-of-principle, few-qubit phase, the path to achieving a&lt;br/&gt;reliable multi-qubit quantum computer is still undefined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal we investigate the physical limitations to resilient&lt;br/&gt;computation with solid-state quantum bits (qubits), such as&lt;br/&gt;semiconductor quantum dots and superconductor junctions. While&lt;br/&gt;solid-state qubits seem easily scalable from the fabrication&lt;br/&gt;viewpoint, they also present high decoherence rates as compared to&lt;br/&gt;other implementations. One major concern is that such strong &lt;br/&gt;decoherence may lead to errors occurring at a rate too large to &lt;br/&gt;be controlled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, differently from other nuclear, atomic, and optical qubits, &lt;br/&gt;the interaction of solid-state quantum devices with the environment &lt;br/&gt;can introduce strong memory effects. As a result, temporal correlations &lt;br/&gt;may appear during the operation of multi-qubit systems. Current quantum &lt;br/&gt;error correction codes are not designed to cope with this situation, &lt;br/&gt;which may then invalidate any error threshold estimate for solid-state &lt;br/&gt;qubits based on the efficiency of those codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will explore these issues in a comprehensive way. Starting from a&lt;br/&gt;thorough study of the mechanisms of decoherence in single- and&lt;br/&gt;double-qubit systems, we will study a model of multi-qubit systems in&lt;br/&gt;the presence of correlated noise in a variety of realistic&lt;br/&gt;conditions. Our results will help set up new strategies for the&lt;br/&gt;operation of multi-qubit systems. They will also let us understand&lt;br/&gt;what are the constraints that error correction codes will need to&lt;br/&gt;satisfy in order to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation in&lt;br/&gt;large-scale solid state implementations. To achieve our goals, we have&lt;br/&gt;put together a team of researchers with expertise in nanoscale physics &lt;br/&gt;and computer science. The final outcome of our project will be a much&lt;br/&gt;better understanding of how a real solid-state quantum computer would&lt;br/&gt;behave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
