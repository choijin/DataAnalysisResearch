<AbstractNarration>The investigators develop tools and techniques to facilitate the accurate&lt;br/&gt;reconstruction of spectral data from compressed images.  Such reconstruction&lt;br/&gt;typically aims at recreating gray-scale functions from their Fourier or&lt;br/&gt;spectral coefficients, and necessarily requires both precise information&lt;br/&gt;of the location of the jump discontinuities of the images, as well&lt;br/&gt;as an appropriate conversion, usually via projection, so that the image&lt;br/&gt;can be viewed in the regions of smoothness.   Current techniques for edge&lt;br/&gt;detection and projection reconstruction are somewhat successful in avoiding&lt;br/&gt;Gibbs oscillations without compromising the integrity of the the images&lt;br/&gt;around the edges (i.e. smearing).  They also can retrieve information of small&lt;br/&gt;scale features which arise in many scientific applications.  However, the&lt;br/&gt;success is seemingly function dependent, and it is difficult to choose&lt;br/&gt;parameters that are robust to be effective in all cases, especially&lt;br/&gt;when noise is present in the given data fields.    Furthermore, they are&lt;br/&gt;difficult to extend to higher dimensions.  The investigators study new&lt;br/&gt;ways to improve both edge detection and projection methods and ultimately&lt;br/&gt;create an automated robust, user-friendly, computationally efficient, and&lt;br/&gt;inherently multi-dimensional image reconstruction method.  The study tests&lt;br/&gt;the resulting procedures against current image reconstruction methods on a&lt;br/&gt;range of applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Image reconstruction is of critical importance in many scientific fields.&lt;br/&gt;The development of high order reconstruction techniques requires both&lt;br/&gt;mathematical rigor to prove theoretical results and computational&lt;br/&gt;robustness to ensure practical usage.   The proposed activities address&lt;br/&gt;how to obtain images efficiently and with high accuracy when small scale&lt;br/&gt;features are of extreme interest in an increasingly image--oriented society.&lt;br/&gt;These methods can, for example, enhance the diagnostic ability in medical&lt;br/&gt;imaging applications.  They can also be used to better identify the small&lt;br/&gt;scale features in solar activity such as those in connection with Lockheed&lt;br/&gt;Martin's Solar Imaging Suite.  This research is also useful for weather&lt;br/&gt;forecasting models, earthquake and tsunami prediction, and any other&lt;br/&gt;fields in which visualization is critical.  Finally, this study stands to&lt;br/&gt;significantly enhance the ability to compress data, as it it will be&lt;br/&gt;possible to optimize the reconstruction parameters when particular&lt;br/&gt;compression requirements are proposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
