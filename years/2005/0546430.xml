<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiple point contact is common in many manipulation tasks.  Examples&lt;br/&gt;include arrays for distributed or micro manipulation, vehicles, and&lt;br/&gt;traditional robotic grasping.  Although all of these applications have&lt;br/&gt;received a great deal of attention, no previous works have provided an&lt;br/&gt;analytical approach capable of dealing with the inherent uncertainties in&lt;br/&gt;the contact state--the state that represents whether a given contact is&lt;br/&gt;sticking, slipping, or is out of contact. These nonsmooth transitions&lt;br/&gt;between contact states have a dramatic impact on the dynamics; hence, it&lt;br/&gt;is important to systematically mitigate the negative performance these&lt;br/&gt;nonsmooth effects induce.  Moreover, these systems are often overactuated,&lt;br/&gt;so that each contact interface is independently articulated.  This leads&lt;br/&gt;to mechanisms that are nominally kinematically overconstrained--that is,&lt;br/&gt;the kinematic relationships between all the point contacts cannot be&lt;br/&gt;simultaneously satisfied.  Which constraint is broken is sensitive to&lt;br/&gt;details of friction and normal force modeling, so it is necessary to&lt;br/&gt;estimate the current contact state and incorporate the contact state into&lt;br/&gt;the motion planning and control.  The goal of this research is to&lt;br/&gt;produce hybrid estimators, motion planning algorithms, and control&lt;br/&gt;strategies that will work in concert to guarantee performance and&lt;br/&gt;stability in the face of multiple contact interfaces in an unstructured&lt;br/&gt;environment.  An overconstrained multiple point manipulator prototype will&lt;br/&gt;be developed and planning and control methods will be applied to this&lt;br/&gt;system to demonstrate manipulation that is not sensitive to the&lt;br/&gt;particulars of the frictional interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manufacturing often involves the need to reposition and reorient objects&lt;br/&gt;for purposes of assembly.  To accomplish this, multiple actuators are&lt;br/&gt;often used, and these actuators experience stick and slip contact with the&lt;br/&gt;object due to frictional interactions.  The physics of the actuators and,&lt;br/&gt;in particular, their interaction with the object are notoriously difficult&lt;br/&gt;to model accurately. Hence, there is a strong need for manipulation&lt;br/&gt;strategies that are not sensitive to these low-level details.  Moreover,&lt;br/&gt;many vehicles, such as the original Mars rover, have a mechanical design&lt;br/&gt;that guarantees that some of the wheels must slip during operation.&lt;br/&gt;However, which wheels slip is dependent on unknown environmental conditions.  Hence, in this situation as well there is a need to develop motion planning strategies that are guaranteed to work even in the presence of substantial uncertainty arising from the environment.  This project will contribute to these needs by developing&lt;br/&gt;strategies that have guaranteed performance in the face of inherent&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty. In the short term this project will contribute to macro-scale&lt;br/&gt;manufacturing and vehicle control, and in the long-term will likely impact&lt;br/&gt;micro-scale manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
