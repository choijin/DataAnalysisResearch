<AbstractNarration>CAREER: Simulating cosmological galaxy formation with adaptive-mesh refinement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST 0547823  Greg Bryan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Greg Bryan, at Columbia University, will apply the Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) method to the problem of galaxy formation to investigate the actual physical processes that shape the distribution of baryons inside dark matter halos.  Feedback and self-regulation from star formation will be included in the three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations that will investigate the formation of a wide range of galaxy sizes and types. Additional physical processes will also be included, including magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) and a simplified treatment of radiative transfer.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Bryan's educational effort will include: (1) the involvement of astronomy and physics undergraduates in the generation of scientific visualizations, and the creation of short movies that incorporate these visualizations; (2) the construction of a stereoscopic visualization system (the "AstroWall") in the Astronomy Department at Columbia University, to facilitate visualization of multi-dimensional datasets; and (3) bringing local New York high-school students and teachers into the Astrophysics Lab to do short-term research projects involving the analysis of large-dimensional datasets &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Disk galaxies, like our own Milky Way, are collections of stars that exhibit coherent rotation over almost the entire system.  The size and rotation of galaxies has to do both with how structure in the universe collapsed under its own gravity, and with the energetic input from the stars, supernovae and black haloes which form in galaxies.  For example, the fact that disk-like galaxies rotate at a velocity that is nearly constant with radius from the center is thought to demonstrate a remarkable balance between the accumulation of stars and gas in the center and the more massive dark matter "halo", which dominates in the outer part.   While a basic outline of the process exists by which such galaxies form, detailed models have struggled to reproduce the detailed observational properties of these galaxies. In this project, we have used a relatively new simulation technique, called Adaptive-Mesh Refinement to simulate the formation of a disk galaxy.  With this technique, we can focus computational power on just the regions where the galaxy is forming, giving us a better treatment of physics in those regions.  We model the laws of fluid dynamics, gravity, radiative cooling, as well as heuristic prescriptions for star formation and feedback, and applies this to a small section of the universe starting shortly after the big bang, and ending at the present day. One of our primary results is to confirm earlier work using a completely different simulation technique that showed that, in the models, during the formation of the galaxy, clumps of gas and stars lose angular momentum and end up producing a gas disk which rotates too quickly at the center due to the large amount of stars which form there.  We have also demonstrated that simulations including a strong form of energetic feedback from supernovae, coupled with an ad hoc adjustment to the code to prevent that energy from being radiated away too soon (due to limited resolution in the models), are able to prevent this catastrophic loss of angular momentum and produce realistic disks, with the correct size and rotation rate. While promising, this work demonstrates that we are not yet able to model galaxies from first principles, and require somewhat ad hoc "sub-grid" models to account for the limited resolution of the simulations.  In a parallel effort, we have explored idealized galaxy models, which do not form in a cosmological context, but instead begin with an existing gas disk with the correct rotation rate and size, and investigate how that disk evolves with time.  These simulations allow us to apply much higher resolution to the disk itself, and so may permit calibration of the "sub-grid" models discussed earlier.  The result of these efforts has been encouraging, demonstrating that such simulations can reproduce both the small scale density-temperature structure of the interstellar gas in disk galaxies, as well as the large-scale star formation rates, with only a simple and straightforward implementation of star formation and feedback.  In addition to the research work described above, we have carried out a number of activities to improve both our educational and outreach efforts.  These include building the AstroWall, a stereoscopic projection system, in a classroom in Columbia University.  With the AstroWall, we can show three-dimensional visualizations of our models to both students and the general public; we find this clarifies the evolution of the systems in a way that two-dimensional depictions do not.  In addition, we have generated visualizations of our models for research and teaching, and worked with the American Museum of Natural History in New York City on a number of projects, including the space show "Journey to the Stars".
