    <AbstractNarration>Mounting U.S. external indebtedness, the advent of a single European currency,&lt;br/&gt;and the rise of China are fueling discussion of whether the dollar is at risk of losing its&lt;br/&gt;international currency role. The answer matters: recent estimates (e.g. Gourinchas and&lt;br/&gt;Rey 2005) put the annual benefits to the United States of the dollar's key currency role at&lt;br/&gt;2 per cent of GDP. There is also the danger that, if the dollar abruptly loses its position&lt;br/&gt;as the dominant international currency, its exchange rate could fall sharply, with&lt;br/&gt;uncertain consequences for global macroeconomic and financial stability.&lt;br/&gt;The prospects for the dollar as an international currency are not something on&lt;br/&gt;which existing scholarship sheds much light. The theoretical literature is small and&lt;br/&gt;stylized. The empirical literature relies principally on a couple of dozen annual&lt;br/&gt;observations for the share of global reserves held in dollars and other currencies and on&lt;br/&gt;proprietary data available only to researchers at the IMF and national central banks.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the development of new data and&lt;br/&gt;application of new methods to these questions. The investigators' approach is theoretical&lt;br/&gt;and empirical, but also historical. Historical data provide the most obvious route to&lt;br/&gt;expanding the data base. In addition, changes in the identity of the dominant&lt;br/&gt;international currency do not occur very often - over the last three centuries there appear&lt;br/&gt;to have been only two such shifts, from the guilder to sterling and then the dollar -&lt;br/&gt;making any serious investigation necessarily historical. Finally, modern theoretical&lt;br/&gt;models invoke network externalities when explaining the dominance of particular&lt;br/&gt;currencies in international transactions, and where there are network externalities, there&lt;br/&gt;can be lock-in and path dependence, creating a role for history.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will develop two historical data bases for the period prior to&lt;br/&gt;1973, one on the currency composition of official reserves, the other on the actual use of&lt;br/&gt;currencies in foreign exchange markets. The first of these elaborates existing data,&lt;br/&gt;although the work of constructing it will be highly data and source intensive. The second&lt;br/&gt;data base is entirely new; it will be constructed by assembling information on the&lt;br/&gt;currencies that are actually traded in foreign exchange markets. The investigators will&lt;br/&gt;analyze these data using standard regression techniques but also the methods used by&lt;br/&gt;statisticians and sociologists to study social networks - which is precisely the approach&lt;br/&gt;suggested by the theoretical literature emphasizing network externalities.&lt;br/&gt;In this way the investigators hope to establish the roles of current policy (as&lt;br/&gt;manifested in external indebtedness, inflation proneness, and exchange rate instability),&lt;br/&gt;economic structure and past economic performance (as manifested in the weight of the&lt;br/&gt;key-currency country in the international system), and historical path dependence in the&lt;br/&gt;acquisition and loss of international currency status. The broader impact of the&lt;br/&gt;proposal and project will be to shed light on the dollar's prospects as an international&lt;br/&gt;currency, the immediacy of the challenge it will meet from current and future rivals, and&lt;br/&gt;the implications for United States.</AbstractNarration>
