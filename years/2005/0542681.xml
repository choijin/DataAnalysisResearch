<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0542681&lt;br/&gt;Laurie Williams&lt;br/&gt;North Carolina State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A special one-day Academy for Software Engineering Educators &amp; Trainers (henceforth referred to as&lt;br/&gt;the Academy will be offered on the day prior to the start of The Conference on Software Engineering&lt;br/&gt;Education and Training (CSEE&amp;T). The purpose of the Academy is to provide an opportunity for software&lt;br/&gt;engineering educators and trainers to learn from master instructors in a highly dynamic, hands-on,&lt;br/&gt;interactive environment. The Academy will provide a learning opportunity to PhD students who will be&lt;br/&gt;entering academic careers in the near term, new faculty members, and mid-career faculty members who&lt;br/&gt;are beginning to teach software engineering course(s). Subsequent to the Academy, Academy attendees&lt;br/&gt;will participate in CSEET conference sessions, providing further educational opportunity and exposing&lt;br/&gt;them to the software engineering education community and to integrating research and education in their&lt;br/&gt;careers. This purpose of this proposal is to seek funding for two US student and three US new faculty&lt;br/&gt;Academy attendees.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit criteria. The attendees of the Academy will obtain essential knowledge on structuring&lt;br/&gt;software engineering courses. The students of Academy attendees will gain from the attendance of their&lt;br/&gt;instructor. Additionally, attendees will gain exposure to the software engineering education research&lt;br/&gt;community which will help them integrate research and education in the future. NSF is focusing on this&lt;br/&gt;integration. PI Williams is the program chair of the CSEET conference for 2006. She has been on the&lt;br/&gt;program committee for this conference in 2002, 2003, and 2005 and presented a keynote at CSEET&lt;br/&gt;2005. The Academy is an innovative means of instructing and preparing new software engineering&lt;br/&gt;faculty. Students and new faculty interested in obtaining NSF funding for the Academy will apply for&lt;br/&gt;funding. The CSEET steering committee will chose five of these applications for funding. Students will&lt;br/&gt;submit receipts to be reimbursed. Necessary administrative resources for this project will be provided by&lt;br/&gt;North Carolina State University.&lt;br/&gt;Broad impact criteria The purpose of the academy is to improve attendee understanding of software&lt;br/&gt;engineering topics that are taught in university and industry courses. These activities promote teaching,&lt;br/&gt;training, and learning. In our selection process, we will focus on increasing the participation of women&lt;br/&gt;and underrepresented minorities. Additionally, we will focus on the selection of attendees from institution&lt;br/&gt;where alternative funding is less likely to be available. The Academy will enhance the infrastructure for&lt;br/&gt;new faculty to obtain guidance on teaching software engineering courses. Academy instructors will be&lt;br/&gt;encouraged to share resources (presentation slides, webcast) on the conference web site. Additionally,&lt;br/&gt;resources can be cross-posted on the Open Seminar for Software Engineering, a freely-available&lt;br/&gt;software engineering web resource. The Academy will prepare faculty for teaching software engineering&lt;br/&gt;courses. Society will benefit from having better prepared students who are taught by these faculty&lt;br/&gt;members.</AbstractNarration>
