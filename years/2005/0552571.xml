<AbstractNarration>The objective of the REU program in the Department of Mathematics at North Carolina State University is to provide undergraduates with summer university research experiences in Modeling and Industrial Mathematics. Specific topics will include:  biomathematics (blood flow models, cartilage, menstrual cycle, infectious diseases etc.), Material Science (Smart materials and optimal chutes), Financial Math., Symbolic Computation, Data Mining,  Computer Vision, and a new industrial project co-sponsored by Calabazas Creek Research, Inc.  This REU program will provide a rich applied mathematics research  experience to a&lt;br/&gt;diverse population of students that will encourage them to continue their academic programs to the graduate level and will help them in making more informed decisions about their academic or nonacademic careers. Targeted student participants include rising senior and exceptional rising junior mathematics majors who have demonstrated academic excellence.  Particular consideration will be given to under-represented groups. Student recruitment points of contact are Aloysius G. Helminck (loek@unity.ncsu.edu, and 919-515-7720), Hien Tran (tran@math.ncsu.edu, 919-515-8782) and through the REU website http://www.math.ncsu.edu/mathREU.  Fifteen students per year will participate in the ten-week summer REU program. In addition to research, the program includes a workshop on mathematical modeling at the&lt;br/&gt;Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute (SAMSI), a national NSF funded institute, in&lt;br/&gt;the first week. There will also be presentations from industry  representatives on their mathematical&lt;br/&gt;problems. Additionally, joint with other REU programs at NCSU are  workshops on research ethics,&lt;br/&gt;poster presentations, graduate school preparation, as well as a number of social functions. During&lt;br/&gt;the school year, travel to professional meetings is offered for  students with projects that developed&lt;br/&gt;to the point where talks can be given.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
