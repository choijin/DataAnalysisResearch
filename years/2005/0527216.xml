<AbstractNarration>This is a series of two US-Ireland workshops that will examine state-of-the-art developments in coastal mapping and informatics.  The workshops will bring together key research experts from the United States, Ireland and Canada, and they will involve the participation of junior researchers, women and members of underrepresented groups.  The co-organizers of the workshop are Dr. Dawn Wright from Oregon State University and Drs. Valerie Cummins and Liz O'Dea from the Environmental Research Institute at University College, Cork, Ireland. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this workshop is to develop guidelines for coastal/marine mapping professionals and managers in their quest for organizing coastal spatial information. The workshop will provide an opportunity for international experts in coastal/marine mapping to identify problems and difficulties with the present status of the discipline and to develop a strategy and research agenda that will improve and advance the overall efficiency of coastal mapping science. These workshops are also an exceptional opportunities for broadening the participation of underrepresented groups and for junior US scientists and students to meet and share knowledge with experts from the international community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the US, Ireland and Canada to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.</AbstractNarration>
