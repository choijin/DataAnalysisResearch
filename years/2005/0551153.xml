<AbstractNarration>Two recent developments have revolutionized atomic physics: The observation of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), and a series of theoretical and experimental advances in quantum information. Atomic quantum fluids and quantum information theory are now among the most active and exciting areas of physics. Their common denominator is many-body quantum mechanics. Strongly correlated quantum systems realize some of the most fundamental states of matter, which are important for understanding phenomena in cosmology, condensed matter, nuclear and many other areas of physics. Ultracold atoms have become a test bed to tackle old and unresolved, and conceptually new questions in quantum systems of interacting particles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Ultracold Atoms is building on the technical capabilities developed in its first phase and the advent of five new faculty members to focus on these areas. The deep questions that motivate this quest are the nature of high-temperature superconductivity, unresolved basic problems in quantum magnetism (e.g. antiferromagnetic frustration, spin liquids), and the desire to develop a deeper understanding and experimental control of entanglement. The quest is an exploration and control of the quantum world, uncovering and using unknown parts of the vast Hilbert space of possible wave functions. The ultimate pay-off could be the discovery of materials with novel properties, insight into how to increase the transition temperature of superconductors, and major advances towards the realization of quantum information systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To pursue this vision the Center is organizing its research program around two themes, strongly correlated states of ultracold atoms and quantum state control of atoms and photons.  The first theme is centered on many-body physics and strongly overlaps with condensed matter physics. The second involves the interactions of a few or several atoms and photons, their entanglement and quantum state manipulation. These topics will be pursued by a team of eight Senior Investigators. Five of these are new to CUA, and their interests are a major driving force for the new research program. They have joined the vibrant CUA community that consists of approximately 65 graduate students, 15 undergraduates, and 15 postdocs. All the research will be performed on campus in CUA facilities, and will be fully integrated with the teaching and education programs at MIT and Harvard, through research opportunities for undergraduates, lab tours, and by being used in lectures as illustrations for basic concepts in physics. The Center reaches out to the community through the organization of a summer school, sponsorship of workshops, an annual program to recruit new science teachers, the creation of a virtual journal for ultracold atoms, a weekly seminar, and a visitor's program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for the CUA is provided by the Division of Physics through the Physics Frontiers Centers program and the Division of Materials Research through the Condensed Matter Physics program.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Very often, the particles which determine the behavior of materials are the electrons. Materials with weakly interacting electrons, like metals and semiconductors, are well understood. A major challenge is posed by systems of strongly interacting and strongly correlated systems. They are much more difficult to describe, yet they offer the highest potential rewards since they may give rise to completely new phenomena and devices of superior performance.     Advances on this frontier benefit from well-controlled and well-defined systems. In the Center for Ultracold Atoms, the "toolbox" for assembling such materials consists of ultracold atoms. Ensembles of atoms can be controlled and manipulated with the precision of atomic physics, and can be cooled to the lowest temperatures ever achieved, to the nanokelvin range, a billion times colder than interstellar space.     The Center for Ultracold Atoms advances our understanding of quantum mattter by pursuing two themes: (1) Many-body systems and strongly correlated states, and (2) Quantum coherent control of few-body systems.  Within the first theme, large clouds of ultracold atoms are exposed to various laser, radiofrequency and magnetic fields to realize systems with interesting properties for study, including conductors, superfluids, and quantum magnets. The second theme focuses on a small number of atoms and/or photons, which are prepared in novel quantum states. Of particular interest are entangled states due to their importance as building blocks in future quantum computers.     One highlight of the funding period was the realization of a new quantum microscope. Using a specially designed microscope lens, it is now possible to observe individual atoms in a cloud of ultracold atoms. The new level of microscopic observation provides a powerful tool for studying ultracold atoms similar to what the tunneling microscope provided in the area of condensed matter physics.

Such methods have the potential to improve the precision of atomic clocks, which are used for navigation (i.e., for the Global Positioning System) and communication.     Finally, we extended our research from atoms to an atom-like system. CUA researchers showed that certain defects in diamond crystals can capture an electron and have properties similar to isolated atoms.
