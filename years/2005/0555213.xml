<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The International Congresses on Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions (IC-MPMI) have become the major venue for the presentation of the latest research in this area. Topics covered include pathogenic and symbiotic bacteria, fungi, Oomycetes, viruses, and nematodes.  Sessions are also organized on technological advances, biocontrol, functional genomics, evolution of host/pathogen interactions, and biotechnological applications. The format is composed of morning plenary sessions and afternoon concurrent sessions. Poster sessions are held in the evenings. There are also ad hoc workshops on specialized topics, including this year one on professional development of younger scientists. The meeting is traditionally held every other year, alternating between the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, and usually attracts ~1000 participants. Speakers are chosen by an international advisory board composed of the officers of the International Society for Plant-Microbe Interactions (IS-MPMI) and are balanced for age, gender, and country. Like past Congresses, the proceedings of the meeting will be published by IS-MPMI (St. Paul, MN).  This proposal requests funds to defray exceptional expenses incurred for the XII ICMPMI as a result of Hurricane Emily, which forced postponement of the Congress from July to December (2005).</AbstractNarration>
