<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for  collaborative&lt;br/&gt;project led by archaeologist Dr. Anabel Ford and volcanologist Dr. Frank Spera.&lt;br/&gt; By uniting disciplines to address an archaeological problem, they will identify&lt;br/&gt;the source(s) of volcanic ash (glass) used as ceramic temper in everyday pottery&lt;br/&gt;of the ancient Maya in the Late Classic Period. The presence of fresh volcanic&lt;br/&gt;ash more than 350 km from any volcano that is consistently discovered  in&lt;br/&gt;pottery fragments (sherds) from the limestone Maya lowlands is unexpected.  Yet,&lt;br/&gt;since the 1930s, when Anna O. Sheppard identified volcanic ash in Maya pottery,&lt;br/&gt;archaeologists have been aware of the anomaly. The correct identification of the&lt;br/&gt;volcanic ash source(s) will enable these scholars to recover critical evidence&lt;br/&gt;of the cultural, ecological, and environmental influences that contributed to&lt;br/&gt;the rise and fall of the Maya civilization. How did relatively large volumes of&lt;br/&gt;volcanic ash become available for manufacturing ceramic production when all&lt;br/&gt;transport was with human effort?  This question has never been answered and the&lt;br/&gt;implications are significant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use geochemical and volcanological tools to study&lt;br/&gt;the transport, dispersal, and identification of the volcanic glass shards in the&lt;br/&gt;ancient Maya pottery sherds.  Examination will include &lt;br/&gt;1) monitoring the effects of firing on the composition of the glass shards in&lt;br/&gt;the pottery sherds; &lt;br/&gt;2) assessment of the elements (major, minor, and trace) and isotopic ratios&lt;br/&gt;(strontium and lead) of glass shards in pottery fragments for fingerprinting&lt;br/&gt;volcanoes; &lt;br/&gt;3) matching the elemental composition of glass shards and associated minerals in&lt;br/&gt;pottery sherds to candidate volcanoes in the Central American Highlands and&lt;br/&gt;Mexican Volcanic Belt;&lt;br/&gt; 4) simulating patterns of ashfall dispersal to the limestone lowlands for&lt;br/&gt;candidate volcanoes; and &lt;br/&gt;5) exploring the consequences of volcanic ashfall into the Maya lowland soil,&lt;br/&gt;plant, and animal life.  &lt;br/&gt;These data will permit the team to address the implications of volcanic ash on&lt;br/&gt;the cultural development of the Maya and on refining lowland Maya chronology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While it has been generally accepted that volcanic ash was of non-local origin,&lt;br/&gt;the anomaly of the presence of pristine, fresh volcanic ash has never been&lt;br/&gt;explained. Since the best answer is volcanic ashfall from distant volcanoes, the&lt;br/&gt;solution to the problem requires knowledge of both archaeology and volcanology.&lt;br/&gt; The intellectual merit of this collaboration is that it brings knowledge&lt;br/&gt;generated from NSF funding in distinct fields to a joint solution. The&lt;br/&gt;archaeological implications of the volcanological solution has consequences for&lt;br/&gt;understanding the economy of ceramic production as well as the ecology of the&lt;br/&gt;Maya forest where volcanoes are at a distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad impacts of the research results promote an innovative approach to&lt;br/&gt;problem-oriented science requiring the full involvement of distinct fields.&lt;br/&gt;Volcanoes are universally recognized as hazards, but at a distance they can&lt;br/&gt;provide benefits such as temper for pottery and amendments for soil. Thus, the&lt;br/&gt;resolution of this archaeological issue will expand our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;society's interaction with their changing environment.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
