<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0405994&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Ely Kerman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is comprised of three projects which concern the&lt;br/&gt;relation between various invariants of a symplectic manifold and&lt;br/&gt;the periodic orbits of the Hamiltonian flows which it supports.&lt;br/&gt;Recent work by Kerman shows that one of these invariants, the&lt;br/&gt;Hofer-Zehnder capacity, is finite for tubular neighborhoods of&lt;br/&gt;certain symplectic submanifolds. Using a decomposition theorem of&lt;br/&gt;Biran, this implies several new kinds of symplectic intersection&lt;br/&gt;phenomena for compact Kahler manifolds. The goal of the first&lt;br/&gt;project is to study these new intersection results which suggest&lt;br/&gt;that many basic symplectic properties of a compact Kahler&lt;br/&gt;manifold are determined by the Biran decompositions it&lt;br/&gt;admits. The second project is a joint effort with V.L. Ginzburg&lt;br/&gt;and B.  Gurel. It involves the construction of a generalized&lt;br/&gt;version of Hamiltonian Floer homology in which periodic orbits in&lt;br/&gt;different homotopy classes are allowed to interact via a&lt;br/&gt;generalized Floer differential that counts perturbed holomorphic&lt;br/&gt;curves with punctures. The construction is motivated by the&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic Field Theory of Eliashberg, Givental and Hofer. The&lt;br/&gt;resulting theory should also have a rich algebraic structure, as&lt;br/&gt;well as a variety of applications including new calculations of&lt;br/&gt;the Hofer-Zehnder capacity for weakly-exact symplectic&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. The third project is a program to prove a conjecture&lt;br/&gt;which asserts the existence of periodic orbits on all level sets&lt;br/&gt;near a nondegenerate symplectic critical submanifold of a&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian. This is a generalization of some similar conjectures&lt;br/&gt;of Arnold which concern periodic orbits of a charged particle&lt;br/&gt;moving in a magnetic field. The first step is to construct a&lt;br/&gt;Floer-type invariant for the underlying variational&lt;br/&gt;principle. Once it is rigorously defined, this should quickly&lt;br/&gt;lead to many new existence results. It is also hoped that this&lt;br/&gt;invariant can be used to augment Symplectic Field Theory by&lt;br/&gt;allowing one to split a symplectic manifold along certain&lt;br/&gt;hypersurfaces which are not of contact type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian flows are used to model many important physical&lt;br/&gt;systems in which energy is conserved. Such systems include&lt;br/&gt;planets and satellites moving under their mutual gravitational&lt;br/&gt;attraction, a charged particle moving in an electro-magnetic&lt;br/&gt;field, and the flow of an incompressible ideal fluid. These&lt;br/&gt;motions are often quite complex and one way to begin to&lt;br/&gt;understand their global behavior is to look for repeating&lt;br/&gt;patterns, i.e., periodic orbits. While most Hamiltonian flows&lt;br/&gt;have many periodic orbits, it is usually a difficult problem to&lt;br/&gt;establish their existence at a fixed energy level. This problem&lt;br/&gt;is a central theme in the study of Hamiltonian flows and, in&lt;br/&gt;modern times, has been shown to be deeply related to the shape of&lt;br/&gt;the space on which the flow is defined. The projects in this&lt;br/&gt;proposal study various aspects of this relation. In the first two&lt;br/&gt;projects we use Hamiltonian flows to define and compute&lt;br/&gt;symplectic invariants. The last project involves the construction&lt;br/&gt;of a new symplectic invariant which should lead to new existence&lt;br/&gt;results for periodic orbits of Hamiltonian flows which describe&lt;br/&gt;the motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
