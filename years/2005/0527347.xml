    <AbstractNarration>Elser&lt;br/&gt;0527347&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is phase 2 of a US-China joint workshop on ecological complexity and ecosystem services. The first phase of exchange between U.S. and Chinese scientists took place on May 22 and June 7, 2004. Thirteen American scientists plus two program officers engaged in a series of intellectual interactions in China with Chinese scientists interested in studying the complex connections between ecological systems and human societies. The purpose of phase 2 of this workshop is to solidify the connections established during the phase 1 visit and to provide an opportunity for Chinese scientists to have a similar transformative experience with respect to better understanding the situation in the USA. This workshop addresses important topics with global relevance and significance. Results from the proposed meetings have the potential to improve the quality of life for Earth's inhabitants, and the sustainability of natural resources and ecosystems and the benefits and services they provide. This project is jointly supported by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the National Science Foundation of China, and the NSF.</AbstractNarration>
