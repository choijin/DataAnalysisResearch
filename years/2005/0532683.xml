    <AbstractNarration>This is a planning visit to Armenia develop collaborative research on the modeling and study of thin structural systems where electro-magneto-mechanical and aerodynamic field interactions are important. The U.S. Principal Investigator is Pier Marzocca from Clarkson University. The foreign collaborators are Karen Ghazaryan and Mels Belubekyan from the Institute of Mechanics in Yerevan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this evolving research partnership could potentially provide a better understanding of how elastic structures respond to severe environmental conditions (such as high speeds flow, electromagnetic forces and temperature fields) and could lead to a new paradigm for the design of structural systems, classical and biomechanical engineering devises, smart materials and structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project in engineering fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit. This international project will also contribute to the training of a new generation of engineers as it includes the participation of U.S. graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
