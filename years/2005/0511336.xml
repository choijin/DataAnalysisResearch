<AbstractNarration>The solution of large systems of linear equations remains one of&lt;br/&gt;the main bottlenecks in many numerical simulations throughout&lt;br/&gt;computational science and engineering. Despite much recent progress,&lt;br/&gt;there is still a great need for improved iterative solvers in such&lt;br/&gt;areas as fluid dynamics, radiation transport, magnetohydrodynamics,&lt;br/&gt;image processing, computational mechanics, acoustics, and so forth.&lt;br/&gt;The increasingly important area of data mining and information&lt;br/&gt;retrieval also makes heavy use of sparse matrix techniques and&lt;br/&gt;necessitates reliable and scalable algorithms for linear equations &lt;br/&gt;and eigenvalue problems. The PI will investigate efficient iterative&lt;br/&gt;solvers with a focus on preconditioning techniques for nonsymmetric &lt;br/&gt;and indefinite problems. The PI proposes to use a blend of algebraic &lt;br/&gt;and problem-specific techniques to construct robust and scalable&lt;br/&gt;solvers for linear systems arising from discretizations of problems&lt;br/&gt;from fluid dynamics and radiation transport, as well as for solving&lt;br/&gt;large sparse complex symmetric systems and for computing the stationary&lt;br/&gt;vector of Markov chains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of research in computational mathematics is to&lt;br/&gt;provide scientists and engineers the algorithmic and software tools&lt;br/&gt;needed for the solution of challenging scientific and technical problems&lt;br/&gt;of increasing size and complexity. The competitiveness of American science&lt;br/&gt;and technology greatly benefits from (and to a large extent depends on)&lt;br/&gt;the creation of innovative computational methods and software and by &lt;br/&gt;the continuous improvement of existing techniques. Progress in the solution&lt;br/&gt;of the problems targeted by the PI will have a positive impact on science&lt;br/&gt;and engineering by enabling faster and more detailed computer simulations.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, several graduate students (and possibly a few undergraduates)&lt;br/&gt;will be impacted by this research either through direct involvement, or&lt;br/&gt;through the positive effects this research will have on the PI's teaching&lt;br/&gt;of computational and applied mathematics courses at Emory University.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
