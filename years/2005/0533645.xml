<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for establishment of a comprehensive Geographic Information System (GIS) and modernization of the data management system at the Edmund Niles Huyck Preserve and Biological Research Station (HPBRS). In addition, purchases of computer hardware, GPS units, internet equipment, a multi-media projector and a new weather station.  The increasing complexity of scientific research and education activities at the Preserve have led to an increased need for the types of modern communications equipment and related infrastructure to be provided through this award. These improvements will result in a modern field station facility able to foster continued growth in science and education. The HPBRS has supported research and education in the biological sciences since 1937, leading to the production of 350 journal articles, dissertations and theses based on work at the HPBRS.  The station's environmental education programs reach more than 800 students and teachers each year, and more than 3,000 visitors take advantage of the beautiful 2,000 acre Preserve for recreational purposes. Research conducted at the HPBRS includes long-term environmental monitoring, studies of the carbon cycle, work on invasive species, and study of the evolution of behavior. In addition to these research activities, the HPBRS offers unique learning experiences that explore the natural environment in combination with solid methodology in science to diverse groups of students and the public. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
