<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Faced with model uncertainty, model selection methods are commonly employed in applied empirical&lt;br/&gt;research. Improved estimation and inference can be obtained by model averaging, replacing the&lt;br/&gt;discontinuities implicit in selection by smooth averaging. An econometric methodology for model&lt;br/&gt;averaging is undeveloped. Bayesian model averaging methods have been developed, but frequentist&lt;br/&gt;methods are missing, with the notable exception of the recent contribution of Hjort and Claeskens (2003).&lt;br/&gt;The latter contribution is concerned with likelihood-based models. There are no model averaging&lt;br/&gt;methods appropriate for the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), which is arguably the most&lt;br/&gt;common estimation framework in econometrics.&lt;br/&gt;The PIs proposal is to develop model averaging methods for GMM. The PIs follow Hjort and Claeskens (2003)&lt;br/&gt;by using a local-to-zero parameterization to develop an asymptotic mean-square-error calculation which&lt;br/&gt;contains a bias-variance trade-off. Using this framework, the PIs can calculate the asymptotic MSE of modelaveraged&lt;br/&gt;GMM, and propose bias-corrected estimates of the MSE. Estimates of the model average&lt;br/&gt;weights are functions of these MSE estimates, and are computed using quadratic programming. The&lt;br/&gt;result is the PIs proposed GMM model average estimates. In simulations, these estimates are found to possess&lt;br/&gt;good finite sample MSE properties.&lt;br/&gt;The research suggested in this proposal is at a preliminary stage of development. The theory needs to be&lt;br/&gt;fully worked out. Broader conditions and assumptions need to be incorporated to make the analysis more&lt;br/&gt;broadly applicable. Model averaging can be extended to include average over instrument sets (averaging&lt;br/&gt;over moment conditions). The theory should also be extended to incorporate large instrument&lt;br/&gt;asymptotics. A particularly thorny issue will be inference. Similar to model selection, model averaging&lt;br/&gt;produces estimates whose sampling distributions cannot be consistently estimated. Robust inference&lt;br/&gt;methods will need to be developed which are sensitive to this issue. These topics and issues will be&lt;br/&gt;explored in the execution of this proposal.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Model averaging methods are growing in popularity in applied econometrics. The proposed methods will&lt;br/&gt;have broad potential empirical application. It is expected that the theory and methods uncovered by this&lt;br/&gt;research will find productive use by applied economists both in academics and the public sector.</AbstractNarration>
