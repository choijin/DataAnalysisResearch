    <AbstractNarration>This project will develop and analyze new computational methodologies for &lt;br/&gt;generating random variates from high dimensional distributions where the &lt;br/&gt;normalizing constant is unknown. These random variates are then used to &lt;br/&gt;obtain approximations for problems involving high dimensional &lt;br/&gt;integrations. Algorithms employing random variates are known as Monte &lt;br/&gt;Carlo methods. Direct methods often suffer from running times that are &lt;br/&gt;exponential in the dimension of the problem, whereas Monte Carlo &lt;br/&gt;approaches can have a polynomial or even linear running time. &lt;br/&gt;Applications include estimate of parameters arising from probabilistic &lt;br/&gt;models, approximation of exact p-values in statistics, and efficient &lt;br/&gt;algorithms for approximate solutions to NP complete and \#P complete&lt;br/&gt;problems. The new algorithms are in a class of methods known as perfect &lt;br/&gt;sampling algorithms. Existing perfect samplers such as Coupling From the &lt;br/&gt;Past have made an impact on Monte Carlo methods, but suffer from certain &lt;br/&gt;flaws that limit their applicability. Here new methodologies such as the &lt;br/&gt;Randomness Recycler and other modifications and generalizations of &lt;br/&gt;acceptance rejection approaches will be used to solve these problems. As &lt;br/&gt;part of this project, new classes will be developed and undergraduates &lt;br/&gt;and graduate students will have opportunities to work on problems arising &lt;br/&gt;in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today our data collection abilities are better than at any point in&lt;br/&gt;history, but the time needed to analyze data can grow exponentially&lt;br/&gt;in the amount collected. The use of randomness in designing algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for analysis of data can result in enormous benefits in speed and accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;These techniques have been a cornerstone of computational methodology&lt;br/&gt;for the last fifty years. Statistics, finance, signal processing,&lt;br/&gt;physics, and genetics are but some of the areas that have benefited&lt;br/&gt;from the injection of randomness into the design of algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;However, existing methods are not without difficulties. A new class of&lt;br/&gt;algorithms called perfect sampling methods solves many of these problems &lt;br/&gt;in specific cases, but their applicability is limited. The goal of this &lt;br/&gt;project is to extend the reach of these methods by introducing new types &lt;br/&gt;of perfect sampling algorithms. The result will be faster, more accurate &lt;br/&gt;algorithms of the type used by practitioners every day in a wide variety &lt;br/&gt;of fields.</AbstractNarration>
