<AbstractNarration>The Eighth North American Meeting of New Researchers in Statistics and &lt;br/&gt;Probability is a meeting of recent Ph.D. recipients in Statistics and &lt;br/&gt;Probability.   Anyone who has received a Ph.D. since 2000 or expects to &lt;br/&gt;receive a Ph.D. by 2006 is eligible to attend.  The purpose of the &lt;br/&gt;conference is to promote the professional development of  new &lt;br/&gt;researchers primarily by introducing them to each other's research in an &lt;br/&gt;informal setting. All participants are expected to give a short, &lt;br/&gt;expository talk or contribute a poster on their research.  Topics will &lt;br/&gt;range across a variety of areas from theory and methods to &lt;br/&gt;applications.  This will provide a unique opportunity for junior &lt;br/&gt;researchers to exchange ideas and initiate contacts amongst themselves &lt;br/&gt;as well as provide them an opportunity to interact with the invited &lt;br/&gt;senior participants.  The meeting is to be held prior to the 2005 Joint &lt;br/&gt;Statistical Meetings in Minneapolis, MN. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New Researchers conference series is explicitly aimed at training &lt;br/&gt;the future leaders in Statistics and Probability.  At present, &lt;br/&gt;researchers develop contacts with others in their field either through &lt;br/&gt;their own institutions or at meetings of professional societies. It is &lt;br/&gt;often the case that, at their own institutions, junior researchers have &lt;br/&gt;limited contact with senior colleagues.  Also, meetings of professional &lt;br/&gt;societies are rather large and junior researchers often find them &lt;br/&gt;overwhelming. In helping to create networks of new researchers, the &lt;br/&gt;conference will lay the groundwork for future collaboration and the &lt;br/&gt;informal exchange of ideas and knowledge.  It also assists in general &lt;br/&gt;professional development.  Knowing people outside of one's research &lt;br/&gt;specialty area is critical for professional growth, assisting with &lt;br/&gt;making contacts at other universities and industries, and helping with &lt;br/&gt;professional service activities.  In particular, traditionally &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
