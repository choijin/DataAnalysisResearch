    <AbstractNarration>Gamburd Abstract Proposal #0501245&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator plans to pursue two projects devoted to&lt;br/&gt;the study of interactions between random matrix theory, number&lt;br/&gt;theory and combinatorics. In the first project, building on his&lt;br/&gt;recent joint work with Persi Diaconis and with Brian Conrey, &lt;br/&gt;the principal investigator will explore connections between the&lt;br/&gt;distribution of the secular coefficients of random matrices, the&lt;br/&gt;conjectures of Conrey, Farmer, Keating, Rubinstein and Snaith&lt;br/&gt;for moments of L-functions, and some classical problems in &lt;br/&gt;enumerative combinatorics related to counting magic squares. &lt;br/&gt;The second project of the principal investigator is devoted to &lt;br/&gt;studying from a unified point of view one of the main problems in &lt;br/&gt;the theory of expander graphs and one of the basic conjectures in &lt;br/&gt;the theory of quantum chaos. A basic problem in the theory of &lt;br/&gt;expander graphs, formulated by Lubotzky and Weiss, is to what &lt;br/&gt;extent being an expander family for a family of Cayley graphs is a&lt;br/&gt;property of the groups alone, independent of the choice of generators.&lt;br/&gt;For many natural families of groups, in particular, for special linear&lt;br/&gt;group of order two, numerical experiments indicate that it might&lt;br/&gt;be an expander family for generic choices of generators&lt;br/&gt;(Independence Conjecture). A basic conjecture in Quantum Chaos,&lt;br/&gt;formulated by Bohigas, Giannoni, and Shmit, asserts that the&lt;br/&gt;eigenvalues of a quantized chaotic Hamiltonian behave like the&lt;br/&gt;spectrum of a typical member of the appropriate ensemble of random&lt;br/&gt;matrices. Both conjectures can be viewed as asserting that a&lt;br/&gt;deterministically constructed spectrum generically behaves like&lt;br/&gt;the spectrum of a large random matrix: in the bulk (Quantum&lt;br/&gt;Chaos Conjecture) and at the edge of the spectrum (Independence&lt;br/&gt;Conjecture). The principal investigator will work on proving these&lt;br/&gt;conjectures in the context of the spectra of elements in group rings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Random Matrix Theory originated in Wigner's suggestion in the&lt;br/&gt;early fifties that the resonance lines of heavy nuclei might be&lt;br/&gt;modelled by the spectrum of a large random matrix. In the ensuing&lt;br/&gt;fifty years the scope and depth of Random Matrix Theory has&lt;br/&gt;dramatically increased; in the past decade the subject has&lt;br/&gt;undergone explosive growth. The first project of the principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator aims at forging a link between two recent lines of&lt;br/&gt;development in Random Matrix Theory. One is the discovery and&lt;br/&gt;exploitation of the connections between eigenvalue statistics and&lt;br/&gt;the longest-increasing subsequence problems in enumerative&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics; another is the outburst of interest in&lt;br/&gt;characteristic polynomials of random matrices and associated&lt;br/&gt;global statistics, particularly in relation with the moments of&lt;br/&gt;the Riemann zeta function, a function of fundamental importance in&lt;br/&gt;number theory. The second project of the principal investigator&lt;br/&gt;is devoted to studying connections between random matrices and &lt;br/&gt;expander graphs -- highly connected sparse graphs that efficiently&lt;br/&gt;propagate information quickly to many nodes along short paths. Recent&lt;br/&gt;explicit constructions of such graphs have created an explosion of&lt;br/&gt;interest in their potential applications to network design, complexity&lt;br/&gt;theory, coding theory and cryptography. These constructions are algebraic&lt;br/&gt;in nature, and provide a beautiful example of how abstract, seemingly&lt;br/&gt;unrelated topics in number theory, group theory and combinatorics &lt;br/&gt;can be elegantly combined to solve an important real-world problem.</AbstractNarration>
