<AbstractNarration>Workshop: Sino-US Collaborative Research On&lt;br/&gt;Critical Transitions In History Of Life&lt;br/&gt;Conveners&lt;br/&gt;Zhe-Xi Luo (PI), Douglas H. Erwin &amp; Samual A. Bowring&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of Proposed Activity&lt;br/&gt;The history of earth and its diverse life are characterized by several critical transitions.&lt;br/&gt;These include the origins of metazoan animal phyla during the Neoproterozoic, the great&lt;br/&gt;biotic extinction and subsequent recovery through the Permo-Triassic transition, the&lt;br/&gt;Mesozoic origins of flower plants and living vertebrate lineages, and the radiation of&lt;br/&gt;mammals in the early Cenozoic. A critical issue in understanding these transitions is the&lt;br/&gt;relative importance of ecological processes and response to changes in physical&lt;br/&gt;environment. Over the past decade important discoveries and research advances for&lt;br/&gt;understanding these great evolutionary transitions have came from China and the United&lt;br/&gt;States, the two countries with remarkable scientific resources and complementary&lt;br/&gt;strength in geological and paleontological research.&lt;br/&gt;The PI and co-coveners propose to hold a workshop to bring together the US and Chinese&lt;br/&gt;scientists most active in these research areas, to exchange ideas and data, and to nurture a&lt;br/&gt;more effective network of scientists in geochronology, sedimentology, isotope and&lt;br/&gt;organic geochemistry, and paleontology in both countries.&lt;br/&gt;Following preliminary discussion among US and Chinese organizers in the summer of&lt;br/&gt;2005, 10-12 American scientists will meet with Chinese counterparts from major national&lt;br/&gt;research institutes and universities in this proposed workshop on the Critical Transitions&lt;br/&gt;In History of Life in Washington, DC in the fall of 2005. This workshop will explore the&lt;br/&gt;potential for future collaborative studies on the major transitions in history of life and&lt;br/&gt;their associated environmental changes. Particular focus will be given to development of&lt;br/&gt;integrated research in geochronology, isotope and organic geochemistry, sedimentary&lt;br/&gt;geology and paleontology. Long-term plans for collaborative work and a reciprocal visit&lt;br/&gt;by US scientists to relevant institutions and research sites in China will be made.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop has broad implications for the US and Chinese Earth Sciences&lt;br/&gt;community. The major transitions in the history of life are of interest not only to&lt;br/&gt;paleontologists, but also to geochronologists, isotope and organic geochemists, and&lt;br/&gt;sedimentologists, and are most likely to stimulate integrated multidisciplinary research&lt;br/&gt;between the US and Chinese scientists. It is expected that these activities will create a&lt;br/&gt;network of Chinese and American scientists with common goals so as to facilitate the&lt;br/&gt;sharing of knowledge and information. The steering committee will strive to create&lt;br/&gt;opportunity for junior scientists and students to be involved in international collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
