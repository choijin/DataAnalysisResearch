<AbstractNarration>The planned Workshop WOFE-04 is a sequel to WOFE-97 held January 1997 in Puerto de La Cruz, Tenerife, Spain and WOFE-99    held May 31.  June 4 in Villard de Lans, France and to WOFE-2002 in St. Croix, Virgin Islands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the workshop is to bring together leading scientists and engineers who are at the frontiers of electronic device and circuit research and development. Ultra low power digital electronics, microwave power circuits, and optoelectronics have become the foundation of today's electronics technology.  Yet, they emerged from traditionally separated fields and are still largely pursued by specialists trained in different areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the rapid pace of electronic technology evolution is propelling a merger of the traditionally separated fields.  The workshop topics will include: silicon ULSI, nanoelectronics, wide band gap and ferroelectric devices, and advanced device concepts. The workshop will take place on December 17-22 in Aruba. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Proceedings of the WOFE.04 will appear in the Special issue of  International Journal of High Speed Electronics and  Systems (IJHSES) and  will be published as a hard cover book. The Proceeding will include best original papers selected from all oral and poster presentations at the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is in gathering some of the most creative minds and leading experts from academia, industry, and government agencies, in reviewing the most recent and exciting breakthroughs in the fields, the underlying physical mechanisms that link these advancements, and in exchanging views on future trends and directions, the market pulls and the necessary policy and infrastructure changes. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity are in achieving active cross-fertilization of the different fields of electronic and communication research, in bringing together the resources and expertise in these fields, and in producing high quality proceedings that will have a lasting impact on the field. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
