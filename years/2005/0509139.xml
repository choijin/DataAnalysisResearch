    <AbstractNarration>CTS-0509139&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;2005 Laser Diagnostics in Combustion Gordon Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Gordon Research Conference on Laser Diagnostics for Combustion, first held in 1981, has served as the off-the-record forum for scientists from all over the world interested in using laser light to understand combustion problems. Each meeting has been essentially a workshop, and the interdisciplinary discussions of major research issues are a highlight of the meeting. The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) brings together approximately 135 scientists for a week of intense interaction and scientific discussion. The meeting program is advertised in the publication Science, and the attendees are chosen by the meeting chair from the pool of applicants; past GRC meetings on Laser Diagnostics for Combustion attract over 200 well-qualified applicants. This program will provide conference fee and travel support to insure participation in this important forum.&lt;br/&gt; The 2005 Gordon Conference on Laser Diagnostics for Combustion Program features updates on the latest advances in laser-based diagnostics and sensor activities important in combustion emissions from land-based propulsions systems relevant to the NSF mission. New technology in synchrotron sources, fiber lasers, and broadband coherent sources will be featured, along with applications to laser-based particulate analysis and biochemistry applications that serve to broaden the interdisciplinary nature of this meeting. This is the only scientific forum with an interdisciplinary focus on laser-based diagnostics of combustion; therefore, it is crucial to insure the travel funds to provide young and emerging US scientists access to this meeting.</AbstractNarration>
