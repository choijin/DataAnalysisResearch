<AbstractNarration>Special Year in Mathematical Logic, University of Florida, 2006-2007&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The special year in mathematical logic will be devoted to the&lt;br/&gt;exploration of various channels of communication between several&lt;br/&gt;fields of logic as well as the rest of the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical logic is entering a phase of increasingly intense&lt;br/&gt;conversation with other parts of mathematics.  In one workshop, we&lt;br/&gt;will concentrate on the relationship between computability, effective&lt;br/&gt;descriptive set theory and computable analysis on one hand and&lt;br/&gt;numerical methods and analysis on the other, such as the study of&lt;br/&gt;effectively closed sets and effectivity of reals and real functions.&lt;br/&gt;Potential special topics will include algorithmic randomness, quantum&lt;br/&gt;computation, reverse mathematics.  The second workshop will relate the&lt;br/&gt;current trends in definable forcing and determinacy with measure&lt;br/&gt;theory, potential theory and dynamical systems, as well as with the&lt;br/&gt;games used in biomathematics or economics.  Special topics include&lt;br/&gt;Borel equivalence relations and definable forcing.  The third workshop&lt;br/&gt;will further explore the connections between singular cardinals and&lt;br/&gt;inner models.  Recent work on large cardinals and inner models has&lt;br/&gt;helped to advance the frontier of set theory and its applications to&lt;br/&gt;mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The special year will bring together leading scientists from many&lt;br/&gt;areas of mathematical logic, in an effort to advance our understanding&lt;br/&gt;of this fundamental discipline.  Just as mathematics is the language&lt;br/&gt;of science and provides the foundation of science, so logic is the&lt;br/&gt;language of mathematics and provides the foundation of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;The subject of logic has its roots in classical philosophy and today&lt;br/&gt;has branches in many disciplines, including mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;philosophy, as well as computer science, linguistics, and law.  Logic&lt;br/&gt;is used in expert systems which, for example, help doctors diagnose&lt;br/&gt;illness with the aid of computers. Current research on hybrid&lt;br/&gt;algorithms is using logic in the development of software which will&lt;br/&gt;map out the flight plan of an airplane in real time. While the program&lt;br/&gt;is based in the mathematics department, other departments, including&lt;br/&gt;philosophy and computer science, will also participate. The broader&lt;br/&gt;impact of the project includes an emphasis on participation of&lt;br/&gt;graduate students, junior researchers and women mathematicians. There&lt;br/&gt;will also be a focus on participants from the Southeast region.  We&lt;br/&gt;will publish proceedings of the work presented during the special&lt;br/&gt;year.</AbstractNarration>
