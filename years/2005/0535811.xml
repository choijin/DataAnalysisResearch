<AbstractNarration>The entire atmosphere of Mars is modeled from the surface to 300 km. The integrated approach establishes the coupled energetics, dynamics, and chemistry of the atmosphere from the ground to the exosphere. Quantification of the physical processes that couple the lower Martian atmosphere to the upper Martian atmosphere permits quantification of the impact of seasonal and solar-cycle variations of atmospheric dust-loading on the identified coupling processes, and consequently an examination of the of dust storm evolution and impact throughout the Martian atmosphere. The "Whole Atmosphere Climate Model" (WACM) general circulation code currently in use for modeling of the Earth atmosphere is adapted to the upper Martian atmosphere, and is joined to a new finite difference dynamical core originally designed for fine-mesh gridding in the earth's lower atmosphere.  That lower atmosphere methodology is adapted to permit a terrain-following vertical coordinate system to accommodate the significant variations of Martian topology.  Model verification and tuning is provided by Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey neutral and ion atmospheric density profiles, altitude profiles of neutral temperature, and inferred winds - so that a predictive capability of future Martian conditions is established.  The adaptation of circulation models developed for the Earth atmosphere to the Martian atmosphere permits a new examination and evaluation test bed for improved physics-based model development on both planets.</AbstractNarration>

The primary goal of this NSF research has been to develop and validate a Mars Whole Atmosphere Climate Model (MWACM) that extends from the ground to the exosphere of Mars.

The MWACM three-dimensional code presently simulates the following neutral and plasma fields around the planet. Neutral temperatures are solved for self-consistently, but ion and electron temperatures are presently prescribed based upon Viking measurements. Key neutral species include: CO2, CO, O, N2, O2, and Ar.  Key ion species (above    ~80 km) include: O+, O2+, CO2+, N2+ and NO+. Three component neutral winds are calculated globally. Plasma velocities (zonal and meridional ion velocities) are not calculated, but await the coupling with a solar wind interaction (plasma) code.  The MWACM code can be run for various horizontal and vertical resolutions. Typically, production runs are conducted for a 5x5 degree regular horizontal grid, with a constant 2.5 km vertical resolution (~0.25 scale height) above the lowest ~80 km. A "stretched" vertical grid is used at lower altitudes to accommodate the variable Mars terrain.                 The MWACM code can be run for various seasonal and solar cycle conditions (i.e periodic forcing), as well as solar flare and dust events (i.e. transient forcing).  For example, Figure 1 shows model outputs for extreme solar cycle plus seasonal conditions for the Mars upper atmosphere.

This temperature variation, and the underlying neutral and ion density structure, is important to quantify because it regulates the upper atmospheric reservoir available for neutral and ion escape from the planet. Such atmospheric loss may be partially responsible for atmospheric climate change on Mars.     This MWACM code has also been used to investigate thermosphere-ionosphere responses to transient forcing events (i.e. dust storms and solar flares). For example, Figure 2 shows MWACM ionosphere responses to the April 15, 2001 solar flare also observed on Earth. These MWACM electron density results compare favorably with Mars Global Surveyor measurements made corresponding to the same solar flare event [Mendillo et al., 2006]. The electron densities (Figure 2) are modified significantly, much more so than on Earth.  In short, these project simulations are very promising, and demonstrate that the MWACM code c...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
