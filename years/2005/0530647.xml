<AbstractNarration>UNT proposes to establish a new Mechanical and Energy Engineering (M&amp;EE) baccalaureate-level program that provides the intellectual foundation for successful career preparation and lifelong learning for the students. This innovative curriculum is designed with a system-level approach to ME based design, on the core technical fundamentals of undergraduate level mechanical and energy engineering, and provides experiential-oriented approaches for better understanding classical mechanical engineering principles. It also provides a new interdisciplinary ME curriculum approach to the most important energy technology areas. The interdisciplinary nature of energy systems requires a cross-cutting education that draws from the synergy of traditional disciplines of mechanical engineering, materials science and engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science and engineering. UNT plans to take a proactive approach that will restructure the mathematics courses by involving engineering and mathematics faculty jointly in this process, with the intention of making the content of these courses more efficient, interesting, and exciting, while retaining appropriate rigor. Integration of engineering modules in the freshman calculus courses will help reduce high attrition rates in the freshman year of engineering programs. Addition of application of the principles of current relevant mechanical and energy engineering to the emerging technology areas will help the students to appreciate the breadth of discipline. The application of a cognitive approach to the learning process for students in engineering education will be included through curriculum on the basis of the current approach of "Learning to Learn" (L2L) practice in the electrical engineering curriculum at UNT, a project funded by the National Science Foundation, with the addition of a small group team-learning (SGTL) component. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The graduates of this innovative undergraduate curriculum in Mechanical and Energy Engineering will have a unique educational experience with systems integration approach for addressing industrial challenges; working in interdisciplinary teams; and with cognitive learning experiences for responsible lifelong learning, in order to sustain creativity and productivity in leadership positions in their careers. The major features of the approach include: 1) the partnership between industry and the university, 2) the focus on active learning, and 3) emphasis on teams, and 4) laboratory activities based on real-world problems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
