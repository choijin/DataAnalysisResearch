<AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for an REU site at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS), College of William and Mary. The site has been funded by NSF since 1989. From 1997-2005, NSF supported 103 interns, of which 40% were from underrepresented groups and 74% were female. This award provides funding to support ten undergraduate students during a 10-week summer research internship. The program will select new students each summer for five years. The internship program focuses on interdisciplinary coastal marine science, particularly processes operating in the local estuarine environment. Research areas available for students include marine ecology, biological and chemical oceanography, biogeochemistry, geological and physical oceanography, marine fisheries, and marine policy. Students receive a stipend, housing and transportation costs to and from VIMS. They are mentored by VIMS faculty while conducting their independent research project, and they are expected to prepare a final paper and give a final oral presentation of their results. This award will provide a total of 50 students with an in-depth independent research experience and training that will help them succeed in scientific careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site Program at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and School of Marine Science of the College of William and Mary has provided internships for undergraduates from around the US since 1989.  The major objective of the program is to provide meaningful research and training opportunities for a diverse group of academically-talented undergraduates who are considering careers in marine science or a closely allied field. The program focuses on interdisciplinary coastal marine science, particularly processes operating in the local estuarine and coastal environments. The coastal ocean is an accessible natural laboratory, faces significant environmental pressures, and is of high socio-economic and aesthetic value to the nation. Research projects are available for students in the areas of marine ecology, biological and chemical oceanography, biogeochemistry, geological and physical oceanography, marine fisheries, and marine policy.  NSF funds supported 72 interns for the period 2006 &ndash; 2011.  Participating interns came from all major regions of the U.S., especially coastal states and Puerto Rico.  A third of the interns were from demographic groups that are under-represented in marine science (African American, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian, Native Pacific Islander and Asian) and 29% were males.  During the 10-week summer program, each intern writes a hypothesis-driven research prospectus, which must include clearly defined goals and objectives; introduces their research plans to other program participants and their faculty advisors at a prospectus presentation colloquium; conducts a hands-on research project; collects and analyzes data; writes a final research paper; and makes an oral presentation of their findings to the faculty, staff and students of the institute.  Interns participate in weekly meetings, which feature scientific presentations by faculty members and discussions of topics such as experimental design and data analysis, research ethics and career options in marine science.  They also learn about the habitats, biodiversity and human effects on the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem through a series of three field trips to the upper watershed and tidal freshwater estuary, lower estuary and coastal barrier island systems of Virginia.  Interns contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge through independent research projects and participation in ongoing long-term research.  Recent intern projects focused on topics such as juvenile blue crab ecology; seagrass restoration, effects of nutrients on algal growth processes; effects of shoreline development on estuarine food webs; molecular diagnostics of host type of disease species for marine organisms; modeling of shallow- and deep-water waves in an estuary; factors affecting the distribution and abundance patterns of invasive plant and animal species in estuaries; processing affecting the transport of mud in estuaries; and effects of micro-algae on the cycling of trace metals.  A recent survey of 104 alumni who participated in the program between 1997 and 2009 showed that the majority of those surveyed (over 70%) successfully pursued careers in science or engineering or were currently in graduate degree programs in those fields.
