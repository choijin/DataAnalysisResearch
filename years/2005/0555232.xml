<AbstractNarration>It is now understood that neutrons and protons, the constituents of the atomic &lt;br/&gt;nucleus, are themselves composed of quarks. A major question in nuclear &lt;br/&gt;physics is how this quark substructure is manifested in observables in &lt;br/&gt;nuclear physics. To reveal these quark effects, we concentrate on approximate &lt;br/&gt;symmetries. These are symmetries of nature that are nearly, but not completely,&lt;br/&gt;obeyed. Studying how these symmetries are violated, and by how much, allows us &lt;br/&gt;to examine quark effects in nuclear physics. We focus particularly on charge &lt;br/&gt;symmetry; this would be an exact symmetry if there were no differences between &lt;br/&gt;protons and neutrons. We concentrate on effects of breaking charge &lt;br/&gt;symmetry at high energies, where the quark structure of matter is more evident.&lt;br/&gt;We also propose to study details of the strong interaction, the interaction &lt;br/&gt;that holds the atomic nucleus together. We are currently concentrating on &lt;br/&gt;"exclusive" reactions (scattering reactions where all of the final products &lt;br/&gt;are observed). We are trying to determine the most efficient of two equivalent &lt;br/&gt;ways of describing these reactions. Another area of proposed study is an &lt;br/&gt;examination of effects that occur when particles move in extremely small &lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional systems. It has long been known that particles like atoms and &lt;br/&gt;molecules possess both particle and wave properties. In most cases the "wave" &lt;br/&gt;properties of matter are small, subtle effects. In certain systems, the wave &lt;br/&gt;effects can dominate observed properties. These effects are seen in "nanoscale"&lt;br/&gt;systems (with dimensions roughly those between atoms in a solid) with visible &lt;br/&gt;light, or by using microwaves in systems with dimensions in centimeters. We &lt;br/&gt;carry out numerical simulations in collaboration with a physicist who conducts &lt;br/&gt;experiments on microwave systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts involve training of scientists in high-tech fields. We &lt;br/&gt;carry out research with undergraduates, grad students and postdocs, who &lt;br/&gt;become expert in complex systems with applications in technology, pure &lt;br/&gt;research, defense, communications and finance. Recent postdocs have included &lt;br/&gt;several women, and this trains new women scientists. The principal &lt;br/&gt;investigator (PI) provides seminars on recent advances in physics for &lt;br/&gt;non-scientists; these talks increase scientific literacy in the general &lt;br/&gt;population. The PI and his students volunteer for a children's science museum &lt;br/&gt;in Bloomington, Indiana. He is currently a participant in a multidisciplinary &lt;br/&gt;study of "Science and American Public Democracy" at the Indiana University &lt;br/&gt;Poynter Center for Ethics and Public Institutions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
