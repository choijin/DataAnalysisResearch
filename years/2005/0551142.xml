<AbstractNarration>The Physics Frontier Center of the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics (PFC-KICP) brings together an accomplished team of physicists and astronomers, both theorists and experimentalists, within a unique interdisciplinary environment to address three of the most compelling questions in all of science today: (1) What is the nature of the Dark Energy and Dark Matter that dominate the Universe and have shaped its evolution? (2) Was there an inflationary epoch in the first moments of the Universe, and if so, what is the underlying physics that caused it? (3) What clues do nature?s highest energy particles offer about the unification of forces and particles? The answers to these questions have the potential to transform in a fundamental way our view of the origin and evolution of the Universe and the laws that govern it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These three questions were the focus of the Physics Frontier Center for its first four years of existence and remain at the heart of its program. Discoveries and theoretical advances over the last four years, many produced by the PFC-KICP, have sharpened these questions and pointed to new avenues for addressing them. The Center will foster several new research initiatives aimed at seizing these opportunities while continuing a number of efforts begun in the first term of the Center that are now coming to fruition. The new initiatives will make strides toward the detection of inflationary gravity waves in the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), probe the nature of the Dark Energy with a large optical survey, develop a promising, new method for detecting Dark Matter, and provide new pooled resources for the analysis of large experimental and theoretical data sets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integrated, cross-cutting program of research, education, and outreach aimed at fundamental questions in cosmological physics at the PFC-KICP is designed to capture the imagination of the public from K to 99 through its variety of activities with broader impact:  (1) Training and educating scientists to work in teams, cross boundaries in their research, and integrate research and education, particularly through the Fellows program. (2) Disseminating important scientific results whose implications cut across the disciplines of astronomy and physics. (3) Using this exciting area of science to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering, with programs such as Space Explorers, WAP, UPRIDE, and RET. (4) Creating broadly shared infrastructure; e.g., the Sunyaev-Zel?dovich Array (SZA) will become part of the CARMA facility and the Dark Energy Camera will be a user instrument at CTIO; both will be broadly used by the astronomy community. (5) Sharing the excitement of this science and educating the public about the nature of science through a vigorous and diverse outreach program that includes cosmology short courses, museum partnerships, and public talks. (6) Engaging the broader cosmological physics community through a targeted program of workshops, visitors, and symposia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Three questions comprised the intellectual merit of the Physics Frontier Center. What is the nature of the Dark Energy and Dark Matter that dominates the Universe and have shaped its evolution? Was there an inflationary epoch in the first moments of the Universe,and if so, what is the underlying physics that caused it? What clues do nature&Iacute;s highest energy particles offer about the unification of forces and particles?   The broader impact of the center was to carry out this research in an environment consisting of theorists and experimentalistsat all stages of their careers andacross the fields of astrophysics and physics.The research was embedded in a program that included active Visitors, Workshop, and Outreach programs.  For each of the year of the 5 year grant, over 200 peer reviewed papers and over 30 other conference proceedings and bookswere published by PCF members.  Experimental Research highlights which took place within the PFC during this time include:  The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Supernova searchfills in the gap between high and low redshift supernova surveys with 375 spectroscopically confirmed supernova. The South Pole Telescope achieves first lightand begins its Sunyaev-Zeldovich survey of galaxy clusters. Results including the discovery of a new population of high-redshift luminous galaxies, a detection of secondary anisotropy in the CMB at small angular scales, a large number of newly discovered galaxy clusters which begin to constrain models of dark energy, and the detection of a lensing signal in the small-scale CMB anisotropy. The high-sensitivity QUaD measurement of the CMB temperature and polarization spectrum. Limits on polarization anisotropy in the CMB from the QUIET experiment. The long-sought-for detection of the GZK high-energy cutoff for cosmic rays by the Auger array. The first light of the VERITAS gamma ray telescope. Hints of direct matter detections by COUPP and CoGENT experiments.   Theoretical research highlights include:  The resolution of the `missing satellite problem in galaxy studies where numerical simulations generated far too many small satellites to full sized galaxies compared to observation. Models of the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters including detailed modeling of the relationships between cluster observables and fundamental cluster properties. Hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies and galaxy mergers. Studies of Dark Energy models and possible modifications to Einstein gravity. Studies tracking the cold gas in halos of galaxies which provide insight to galaxy growth            Last Modified: 10/15/2012       Submitted by: Stephan S Meyer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
