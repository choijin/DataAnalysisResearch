<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests continued support for a group which has a long and productive record of research in nuclear and particle theory. Over recent years, the range of research interests have evolved in the directions of general relativity and cosmology, following the growing synergy between the these fields and particle physics. Three of the principals have made important contributions which are highly cited and have had impact on problems such as parity violating nuclear forces, chiral perturbation theory, and particle anti-particle mixing in the neutral Kaon and D-meson systems. In addition, two cosmologists work on the gravitational aspects of string theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group has an extensive outreach program with a variety of different projects. These include STEM-ED programs for state high school science teachers, writing educational books on gravity for children, the organisation of a Gordon Conference, and participation in summer schools for students. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
