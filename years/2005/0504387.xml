    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NUMBER.: 0504387&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Rutgers University New Brunswick&lt;br/&gt;NSF PROGRAM: STATISTICS&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR and Co-PI: Shepp, Larry and Zhang, C Hui&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL TITLE: Statistical Methods in Fast Functional MRI&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will further advance and use statistical methods developed by the principle investigators and their collaborators to &lt;br/&gt;sharply improve time-resolution for the functional magnetic resonance imaging. The objective remains to improve the time-resolution of &lt;br/&gt;functional magnetic resonance imaging by sampling only a small fraction of the Fourier transform of the spin density, and using a prolate &lt;br/&gt;wavelet filter to approximately obtain an integral representing the total activity of the difference in susceptibility between task and pre-task, over various regions of interest in the brain at successive time-points. The cost for this is a decrease in spatial resolution. A nearly optimal trajectory will be used for sampling a small cube in three-dimensional k-space about the origin. This sampling region is also nearly optimal. The use of a, again nearly optimal, prolate filter will provide a low spatial but high temporal resolution image of the deoxy-hemoglobin density. An aim of the project is to find one or more consistent locations in the brain where oxygen is consumed during &lt;br/&gt;higher level processing by the brain of the image in the primary visual region. This region would then be scanned in a two-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;experiment where a slice plane is chosen to go through the region which would then give convincing demonstration of feasibility of the &lt;br/&gt;proposed methods.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal focuses on developing statistical methods and related theory for fast functional magnetic resonance imaging, to sharply &lt;br/&gt;improve the time-resolution of present techniques. Fast fMRI is expected to have profound and far-reaching consequences in the &lt;br/&gt;understanding of brain function, a problem of central scientific interest at the present time.</AbstractNarration>
