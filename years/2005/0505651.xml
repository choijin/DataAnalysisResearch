<AbstractNarration> Measures of Dependence and Model Selection in Multiple Regression &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;                   Kjell A Doksum,  DMS-0505651&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;                            Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators approach the dilemma that estimation of curves and&lt;br/&gt;surfaces such as the conditional mean is virtually impossible with high&lt;br/&gt;dimensional data by focusing instead on the estimation of measures of&lt;br/&gt;dependence between a response and a set of covariates. These measures of&lt;br/&gt;dependence take the form of signal divided by noise. They are used to&lt;br/&gt;select the subset of covariates to include in the model, and to choose&lt;br/&gt;tuning parameters. The signal measures the strength of the dependence of Y&lt;br/&gt;on a set of covariates. The noise is a standard error, that is, an&lt;br/&gt;estimate of the standard deviation of the estimated signal. It will be&lt;br/&gt;small when too many variables are included in the model and when the&lt;br/&gt;tuning parameter sacrifices precision for smaller bias. Choosing variables&lt;br/&gt;and tuning parameters that minimize signal to noise leads to procedures&lt;br/&gt;that converge at the traditional root-n rate. The investigators use&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic and Monte Carlo methods to investigate the properties of such&lt;br/&gt;procedures. They also relate them to traditional model and tuning&lt;br/&gt;parameter selection procedures and compare traditional procedures with the&lt;br/&gt;signal to noise approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last few years have seen the establishment of large databases'&lt;br/&gt;containing a large number of variables that are to be related and&lt;br/&gt;compared. A good example is the data produced by the human genome project&lt;br/&gt;where a great number of genes need to be considered as possible&lt;br/&gt;contributers to a certain disease. Dealing with a large number of&lt;br/&gt;variables is difficult because many of them will contribute variability&lt;br/&gt;(noise) that may drown out potential interesting relationships (signals).&lt;br/&gt;The investigators approach this problem by using general flexible model&lt;br/&gt;equations to represent important relationships between variables. Then&lt;br/&gt;variables and aspects of the equations are selected to minimize the ratio&lt;br/&gt;of signal to noise. This procedure automatically weeds out the variables&lt;br/&gt;that contribute mostly noise and selects an equation that emphasizes the&lt;br/&gt;signals present in the data.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
