<AbstractNarration>This proposal is for the acquisition of a new 400 kV, research-grade ion implanter to replace an aging 200 kV commercial unit and to significantly expand capability. In the past 10 years, over 30 research groups, from within the U of M, other universities and industry have used the current ion implanter.  This research has resulted in dozens of publications, some of which are referenced in the project description.  Over 40 graduate students have used the implanter for a significant portion of their thesis research.  The new implanter will be an essential part of 14 research programs across campus, especially in the areas of 1) nanoparticle formation in metals and ceramics, 2) semiconductor nanostructures and heterostructures, 3) atomic and molecular structure modification, and 4) biomedical device materials.  It will also play the lead role in providing surface modification capability to users of the NSF National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) through the Michigan node. This instrument will support research programs of 28 faculty spanning 9 departments across the University (Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences, Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, and Geological Sciences), 5 other universities (Michigan State University, Wayne State University, Ohio State, U. Arkansas, University of Cork) and involving 55 graduate students, undergraduate students and post-docs, not including participation from NNIN. The programs outlined in the proposal narrative are some of the principal research programs at UM relying on ion implantation at MIBL. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ion implantation is a technique of using a beam of charged atoms (ions) to introduce a new atomic type into a material. This method is widely used in the semiconductor industry, where it is a fundamental tool in fabricating all modern electronic devices. The new implanter funded in this proposal will allow researchers in nine different departments to introduce students to research using this instrument. We are replacing an earlier instrument that has been operational for years, and very productive, but which is now obsolete. Dozens of students have been trained with the earlier instrument and a very broad set of research programs started. We will extend that work to an even wider audience, including collaborations with 5 other universities, and have research programs underway that involve 55 graduate, undergraduate and postdoctoral students. The new implanter will be used in several educational programs specifically aimed at undergraduate and high schools students trhough the NASA Summer High School Apprenticeship Program (SHARP).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
