<AbstractNarration>his project aims to study interior-point methods for conic&lt;br/&gt;programming problems. Improvements will be considered &lt;br/&gt;to allow these methods to easily detect when &lt;br/&gt;such problems are infeasible or unbounded, as often happens when&lt;br/&gt;new models are developed.  The most efficient interior-point methods &lt;br/&gt;in most cases are primal-dual methods, but in certain cases, dual &lt;br/&gt;methods are expected to be faster as long as a suitable barrier function&lt;br/&gt;can be found: the project will study ways to construct such&lt;br/&gt;efficient barrier functions. These two themes can be studied in a&lt;br/&gt;unified way by considering a general conic problem &lt;br/&gt;and a related problem associated with unboundedness. &lt;br/&gt;Several topics will be investigated from this viewpoint:&lt;br/&gt;the relationship between optimal solutions, central paths,&lt;br/&gt;and Newton steps for the two formulations,&lt;br/&gt;and the development of so-called self-concordant barrier&lt;br/&gt;functions for faces and recession cones of convex sets for&lt;br/&gt;which such barriers are known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will continue investigations into interior-point&lt;br/&gt;methods for conic optimization problems. These methods have proved the&lt;br/&gt;most efficient for solving truly large-scale linear programming problems,&lt;br/&gt;as arise in resource allocation problems in industry, government, and the&lt;br/&gt;military. More recently, they have been extended to a range of&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear problems, in particular to second-order cone and&lt;br/&gt;semidefinite programming, which have applications in structural&lt;br/&gt;optimization, antenna array design, filter design, &lt;br/&gt;and portfolio optimization, and in obtaining tight&lt;br/&gt;bounds for hard combinatorial optimization problems.&lt;br/&gt;The project will extend the capabilities of these methods to&lt;br/&gt;detect when such problems have been poorly formulated&lt;br/&gt;so that optimal solutions do not exist.  Improved methods &lt;br/&gt;for very large-scale problems will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;Advances will be tested in the software package SDPT3 developed in&lt;br/&gt;a previous NSF project with two former graduate students, and&lt;br/&gt;available to other users over the internet. Improvements&lt;br/&gt;in the code will be made available to practitioners and other code&lt;br/&gt;developers. Graduate students will be trained to become experts in &lt;br/&gt;the modelling and computational power of conic programming.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
