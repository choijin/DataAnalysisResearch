    <AbstractNarration>This award will facilitate support for a Gordon Research Conference on inorganic geochemistry that addresses the geochemistry of metal-rich ore-forming systems, and serves as one of the premier conferences for international researchers to gather and discuss issues concerning metal transportation and deposition. The theme for this year's Gordon Conference is "Metals in ore-forming systems: Sources, transport, and deposition," that was selected to focus on process, rather than metal or ore deposit type. By focusing on process, the participants will seek to highlight the linkages among the numerous factors involved in ore formation, deposit environment, and the resultant economic processing of ore. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding will support the attendance of students, post doctorate fellows, assistant professors, and other junior level scientists at this Gordon Research conference. The attendance of junior level scientists at these meetings is important because they bring new and innovative ideas to the science, and because they are responsible for future research in this field. The conference provides a venue for these researchers to interact with and learn from more senior scientists about the important and relevant areas for future research. The conference, furthermore, provides excellent opportunities for junior level scientists to develop collaborative projects with scientists at all levels of experience. Financial support for junior scientists is necessary as it is often difficult for researchers in these positions to garner the funds necessary to defray their expenses.</AbstractNarration>
