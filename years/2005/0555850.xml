    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Wainger expects the primary focus of his research to be on l(p) &lt;br/&gt;estimates for discrete analogues of a family of continuous operators. In the &lt;br/&gt;continuous situation one is given for each point, x, in n-dimensional space a &lt;br/&gt;variety, V (x), of positive codimension passing through x. Given a function, &lt;br/&gt;f , on n-dimensional space one considers maximal or singular averages of f &lt;br/&gt;where the average of x is over the variety V (x). We then seek L(p) estimates &lt;br/&gt;for these averages. In the discrete analogue we consider functions defined &lt;br/&gt;over the lattice points, m, in n-dimensional space, and the average is over &lt;br/&gt;an arithmetic set containing m. In the continuous problem alluded to above, &lt;br/&gt;most of the work assumes the variety V (x) has finite order of contact with &lt;br/&gt;its tangent plane. Professor Wainger also plans to continue his investigation &lt;br/&gt;into the case that V (x) has infinite order of contact with its tangent plane. &lt;br/&gt;Professor Wainger plans to study averages of functions defined on lattice&lt;br/&gt;points in n-dimensional space. (Lattice points are points with integral &lt;br/&gt;coordinates.) For each lattice point, m, one considers averages over an arithmetic &lt;br/&gt;subset containing m. The goal is to relate analytical properties of &lt;br/&gt;these averages to arithmetic properties of these subsets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of this type have applications to problems of Ergodic theory. A corresponding &lt;br/&gt;contin uous problem has received a great deal of attention in the last forty years. &lt;br/&gt;In this problem one averages functions defined on n-dimensional space over &lt;br/&gt;submanifolds of n-dimensional space. The goal is to relate analytical esti mates&lt;br/&gt;for these averages to geometric properties of the submanifold. This &lt;br/&gt;work largely assumes that there is only finite order of contact between the &lt;br/&gt;submanifold and its tangent plane. Professor Wainger plans to continue his &lt;br/&gt;study of the situation in which the submanifold has infinite order of contact &lt;br/&gt;with its tangent plane.</AbstractNarration>
