<AbstractNarration>Quantile regression, as introduced in Koenker and Bassett (1978), is gradually evolving&lt;br/&gt;into a comprehensive approach to the analysis of statistical models for univariate response.&lt;br/&gt;By supplementing the exclusive focus of least-squares-based methods on the estimation&lt;br/&gt;of conditional mean functions with a general approach to estimating conditional quantile&lt;br/&gt;functions, it expands the scope of both parametric and non-parametric statistical methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact of the Proposed Research: Since Quetelets work in the 19th century&lt;br/&gt;social science has iconified the average man, that hypothetical man without qualities who&lt;br/&gt;is comfortable with his head in the oven, and his feet in a bucket of ice. Conventional&lt;br/&gt;statistical methods, since Gauss, seek to estimate the effects of policy treatments on this&lt;br/&gt;average man. But such effects are often quite diverse: medical treatments may improve&lt;br/&gt;life expectancy, but also impose serious short term risks; reducing class sizes in schools&lt;br/&gt;may improve academic performance for good students, but not help weaker ones. Quantile&lt;br/&gt;regression methods helps to explore these heterogeneous effects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Research: Koenker (2005a) offers a comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;view of the current state of play, but inevitably any such monograph constitutes no more&lt;br/&gt;than an interim progress report. This proposal sketches several prospective research topics&lt;br/&gt;that the PI would like to explore over the next three years Among these include:&lt;br/&gt;1. Penalty methods play an increasingly important role in non-parametric statistics. With&lt;br/&gt;the notable exception of some recent work in image processing, virtually all of this work&lt;br/&gt;employs L2 roughness penalties and related Hilbertian machinery. But a compelling case&lt;br/&gt;can be made for complementary methods based on total variation roughness penalties for&lt;br/&gt;functions in spaces of bounded variation. Such !1 penalties are better suited to estimating&lt;br/&gt;functions with sharply defined features. In addition to continuing work on nonparametric&lt;br/&gt;regression, the PI anticipates a major effort directed toward density estimation.&lt;br/&gt;2. Panel data methods in econometrics are still predominantly the provence of Gaussian&lt;br/&gt;random effects models, however there is often a strong motivation in applications for also&lt;br/&gt;estimating conditional quantile models. Growth curve data is a leading example in biostatistics,&lt;br/&gt;and program evaluation offers numerous examples in econometrics. Expanding upon&lt;br/&gt;the close relationship between random effects estimation and penalty methods in Gaussian&lt;br/&gt;settings, research is proposed on a penalty approach to quantile regression estimation for&lt;br/&gt;longitudinal data.&lt;br/&gt;3. Although there is already quite an extensive literature on quantile regression methods&lt;br/&gt;for time-series, most of the attention has focused on models in which lagged response exert&lt;br/&gt;a pure location shift effect on the distribution of the current response. With Zhijie Xiao,&lt;br/&gt;the PI has begun to investigate more general specifications, focusing initially on a class of&lt;br/&gt;models that exhibit some features of persistent random-walk behavior, while also exhibiting&lt;br/&gt;a sporadic form of mean reversion. The PI believes that these models offer considerable potential&lt;br/&gt;for broadening the scope of applied time series analysis.&lt;br/&gt;4. Estimation of mean effects in linear structural models with endogonous covariates lies at&lt;br/&gt;the foundation of econometrics as a discipline. Significant progress has been made in recent&lt;br/&gt;years to expand the scope of such models to incorporate heterogeneous treatment effects.&lt;br/&gt;Building on work of Chesher (2003), Koenker and Ma (2005) compare two approaches&lt;br/&gt;to quantile regression for recursive structural models; expanding this inquiry from both&lt;br/&gt;theoretical and empirical perspectives would be highly desirable.</AbstractNarration>
