<AbstractNarration>Nonlinear media host a wide variety of localized coherent structures&lt;br/&gt;(solitons, wavetrains, vortices, spirals, etc.) with complex intrinsic&lt;br/&gt;properties and interactions that, in turn, give rise to emergent patterns&lt;br/&gt;with nontrivial dynamics. The theme of the proposed research is a detailed&lt;br/&gt;examination of vortices generated in dispersive nonlinear media.&lt;br/&gt;The main focus is to extend and deepen the understanding of vortex&lt;br/&gt;structures, their existence and dynamical stability as well as their&lt;br/&gt;interactions and mesoscopic lattices in nonlinear media such as&lt;br/&gt;Bose-Einstein condensates and related fields (such as nonlinear optics).&lt;br/&gt;We propose to follow a step-by-step methodology in studying the&lt;br/&gt;generation, stability and dynamics of vortices in a progression of&lt;br/&gt;scenaria of increasing complexity, extending from single vortices, &lt;br/&gt;to few vortices, to vortex lattices. Specifically, we plan to study:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Vortex generation through dynamical instabilities and external&lt;br/&gt;manipulations such as phase imprinting and via instabilities driven by&lt;br/&gt;rapidly moving impurities (focused laser beams).&lt;br/&gt;(2) Dynamics and stability of single vortices (a.k.a. atoms) in the&lt;br/&gt;presence of external traps and manipulation of vortices by translating the&lt;br/&gt;external traps or by using localized optical "tweezers".&lt;br/&gt;(3) Interactions between vortices and formation, stability and dynamics&lt;br/&gt;of vortex dipoles (a.k.a. molecules/dipoles).&lt;br/&gt;(4) Finally, we intend to investigate, by cross-fertilizing ideas from&lt;br/&gt;material science, large arrays of vortices, their crystallization and&lt;br/&gt;structural phase transitions into regular vortex lattices (a.k.a. crystals).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 1920's Bose and Einstein predicted that a gas at low density and&lt;br/&gt;ultra-cold temperatures undergoes a transition towards what is nowadays&lt;br/&gt;called a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The most important characteristic&lt;br/&gt;of a BEC is that all atoms occupy the same quantum state creating a macroscopic&lt;br/&gt;lump of coherent matter. BECs are to matter what laser is to light. BECs allow&lt;br/&gt;for direct manipulation and observation of quantum effects at the macroscopic&lt;br/&gt;level, providing ultimate control over matter. Since their recent&lt;br/&gt;experimental realization (for which the 2001 Physics Nobel prize was&lt;br/&gt;granted), BECs have been at the focus of an intensive and ever growing&lt;br/&gt;experimental and theoretical effort. Vortices are fundamental coherent,&lt;br/&gt;topologically charged, nonlinear excitations that emerge in BECs; but&lt;br/&gt;which also play a profound role in exciting and important fields such as&lt;br/&gt;superconductivity and superfluidity (which were the theme of the 2003&lt;br/&gt;Physics Nobel prize). Interestingly enough, they also arise in our daily&lt;br/&gt;life in the form of hydrodynamic vortices in water or in air. There are&lt;br/&gt;strong parallels (as well as differences) between such fluid vortices and&lt;br/&gt;these ultra-cold, superfluid vortices that we plan to examine and&lt;br/&gt;delineate. The outcome of this research will shed light into the pattern&lt;br/&gt;formation and interaction of such vortex structures in Bose-Einstein&lt;br/&gt;condensates. Since the underlying equation that describes the BECs also&lt;br/&gt;describes the behavior of coherent light embedded in a nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;material, the research hereby proposed will also be applicable to&lt;br/&gt;problems of optical waveguides and fiber bundles, photonic crystals, and&lt;br/&gt;light storage in optical traps, all of which are active research areas at&lt;br/&gt;the forefront of optical technologies. The proposed research has&lt;br/&gt;potential applications to quantum-optical storage&lt;br/&gt;and quantum computing for the next generation of computers.&lt;br/&gt;The research effort is part of an ongoing collaboration between&lt;br/&gt;the PI and Co-PI and involves more than a dozen coworkers that blend in&lt;br/&gt;expertise in fields as diverse as dynamical systems, nonlinear optics,&lt;br/&gt;condensed matter, materials science and scientific computing. Specially&lt;br/&gt;attractive is the prospect that our results will be partially driven and&lt;br/&gt;could be relevant to current experimental research conducted in BEC&lt;br/&gt;experiments. This highly inter-disciplinary research program will also&lt;br/&gt;involve a major educational component through the direct involvement of&lt;br/&gt;graduate research assistants and postdoctoral fellows.</AbstractNarration>
