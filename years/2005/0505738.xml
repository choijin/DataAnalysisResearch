<AbstractNarration>     The investigator takes up three projects.  In the first&lt;br/&gt;project, the emphasis is the analysis and the design of efficient&lt;br/&gt;numerical methods for the simulation of recent models proposed for&lt;br/&gt;the dynamics of the magnetization coupled to the spin accumulation&lt;br/&gt;in multilayers when a current perpendicular to the plane of the&lt;br/&gt;layers is applied.  The dynamical equation for the spin is a&lt;br/&gt;diffusion equation with discontinuous coefficients, and the&lt;br/&gt;magnetization dynamics is described by the Landau-Lifshitz&lt;br/&gt;equation from ferromagnetism.  In the second project, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator studies a new model for liquid crystals based on&lt;br/&gt;Inhomogeneous Density Functional Theory.  The model can describe&lt;br/&gt;the isotropic, nematic, smectic A, and crystalline phases. &lt;br/&gt;Finally, in the third project, the investigator studies the&lt;br/&gt;formation of aggregates in polymer  mixtures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Ferromagnetic materials are widely used in the magnetic&lt;br/&gt;recording industry, which continues to be the dominant technology&lt;br/&gt;for the storage of digital data.  The project addresses some of&lt;br/&gt;the technological difficulties found in the design of magnetic&lt;br/&gt;devices such as magnetic memories (MRAMs).  Liquid crystals have a&lt;br/&gt;wide range of applications.  Their optical properties are highly&lt;br/&gt;sensitive to electric and magnetic fields, which has made liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystals ideal candidates for optical-switching devices, such as&lt;br/&gt;video displays and optical memories.  They are very sensitive  to&lt;br/&gt;temperature changes as well, which makes them useful in&lt;br/&gt;applications involving sensors.  More generally, polymers appear&lt;br/&gt;in most aspects of our life, from the amniotic fluid inside&lt;br/&gt;biological cells, to plastics and shampoos used on a daily basis. &lt;br/&gt;Understanding the dynamics of biological membranes and transport&lt;br/&gt;through them is of fundamental importance in the development of&lt;br/&gt;efficient methods for the delivery of medicines.  Understanding&lt;br/&gt;the process of aggregation in polymer mixtures can have a&lt;br/&gt;significant impact in the design of new products.  This study of&lt;br/&gt;polymers and liquid crystals addresses some of these technological&lt;br/&gt;and biological issues.</AbstractNarration>
