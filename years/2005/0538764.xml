<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to conduct research on the erosion properties of electrode materials under high-current pulsed operation. This research will allow extended lifetime for a new pulsed lamp, making it economically practical. The new lamp can become the industry standard for Ultra-Violet (UV) water treatment and enable a new photolytic paint stripping process. Materials used for pulsed power electrodes were formulated for continuous or alternating current at low peak current. Under pulsed high current, preliminary research shows that these materials degrade through grain growth, leading to void formation at the grain boundary. The research objective is to develop a better understanding of how material properties affect grain growth and erosion, and show the feasibility of enhancing and developing low erosion electrode materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will enhance scientific understanding of the degradation and erosion of electrode materials that undergo repeated high-current pulsed cycling. Also, new electrode materials will enable the expanded use of pulsed power and provide an alternative to thoriated tungsten, which is banned in Europe because of its radioactivity. The primary goal is to enable a new commercial pulsed lamp with many applications. The lamp is a potential replacement for mercury lamps, which would eliminate mercury use and exposure of the public. The lamp also will enable commercial photolytic paint removal, replacing chemical and abrasive techniques that are labor intensive, create dust and debris, and generate toxic byproducts. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
