<AbstractNarration>In recent years, it has become clear that many interesting problems,&lt;br/&gt;in particular problems in arithmetic, quantum chaos and the theory of&lt;br/&gt;L-functions, may be profitably reduced to questions concerning&lt;br/&gt;equidistribution of points or measures on homogeneous spaces. These&lt;br/&gt;questions regarding equidistribution can be approached from many&lt;br/&gt;angles. Two theories which have proved to be particularly well-suited&lt;br/&gt;to study such questions are the spectral theory of automorphic forms,&lt;br/&gt;which is closely related to the theory of L-functions, and the theory&lt;br/&gt;of dynamical systems, particularly the study of unipotent and more&lt;br/&gt;general flows on these homogeneous spaces. Recently there has been&lt;br/&gt;considerable progress involving tools such as special value formulae&lt;br/&gt;for L-functions, and (partial) classification results for measures&lt;br/&gt;invariant under higher rank torus actions. Particularly exciting is&lt;br/&gt;the possibility, already realized in some instances, of combining&lt;br/&gt;these techniques. The purpose of the proposed FRG is to investigate&lt;br/&gt;further this circle of ideas, which we believe has the potential to&lt;br/&gt;impact many other problems related to the above. The result of these&lt;br/&gt;investigations will be a deeper understanding of the dynamics of group&lt;br/&gt;actions on homogeneous spaces, of the analytic theory of automorphic&lt;br/&gt;forms, and the (sometimes unexpected) applications to problems of&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present project is concerned with a surprising link between two&lt;br/&gt;classical fields of mathematics of quite disparate origin: number&lt;br/&gt;theory and dynamics. The study of number theory began thousands of&lt;br/&gt;years ago, motivated, in significant part, by questions about prime&lt;br/&gt;numbers.  On the other hand, ergodic theory and dynamics are&lt;br/&gt;mathematical fields of more recent provenance, which arose from&lt;br/&gt;studying the long-term evolution of complicated deterministic&lt;br/&gt;processes -- such as planetary motion. It is a striking fact (which&lt;br/&gt;has only recently begun to be heavily exploited) that, in certain&lt;br/&gt;contexts, ideas from ergodic theory interact very deeply with classical&lt;br/&gt;problems in number theory.  This project will enhance our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of this inter-relation and how we can combine knowledge&lt;br/&gt;from both of these fruitful disciplines effectively.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
