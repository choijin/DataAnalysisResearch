<AbstractNarration>Nationally and at The University of Arizona, far too few women seek--and succeed in faculty careers in science and engineering fields. The destructive role played by subtle discrimination is becoming well-understood. Without intervention, an overly homogeneous culture tends to reproduce itself through the operation of unsuspected biases.  Even well-intentioned interventions may be thwarted by subtle discrimination. The University of Arizona seeks not just to diversify its science and engineering faculty but to permanently eradicate subtle discrimination, building programs to counteract its effects while cultivating new practices and new ways of thinking. The Provost, academic Vice Presidents, and Deans will join in developing and implementing strategies on three fronts. First, new programs will be launched to increase the number of stars among women scientists by fostering the development of social capital through networking, collaboration, and mentoring with local, national, and international scientific communities. Second, new expectations will be set for the stewardship of faculty careers through programs aimed at leaders, administrators, and departmental groups, including inquiry-based learning.  Third, inequitable practices will be eradicated through development of technology with a dual function of gradually changing attitudes while directly changing the way business is done at the university: software implementations of personnel processes will have built-in mechanisms for evaluating the impact of every&lt;br/&gt;decision on overall equity. Eradicating subtle discrimination against women faculty will produce healthier science and engineering disciplines, and it will inevitably elevate awareness of all other forms of subtle discrimination.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ADVANCE program at the University of Arizona (UA) sought to further the research and scientific excellence of the institution by promoting faculty diversity and the equitable treatment of faculty. This mission aimed to benefit scientists, students, and citizens of the state of Arizona by promoting discovery and innovation and ensuring all scientists, regardless of gender, had the opportunity to excel and to be recognized for their achievements.  Promoting equity, and gender equity specifically, is not just about being fair. The manner in which science is accomplished and the subsequent rewards it brings are shaped by those who are involved. Unconscious bias in the academy limits the direction science takes and the application of the findings. In recognition of this and with funding awarded by the National Science Foundation's ADVANCE Institutional Transformation (IT) program, the UA developed initiatives based on findings from the research on equity and the advancement of scientific careers.  A three-tiered strategy for improving the representation and advancement of women faculty in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields aimed to do the following:  Increase the number of female scientists in leadership positions by fostering the development of social capital through networking, collaboration, and mentoring with local, national, and international scientific communities. Define new expectations for the stewardship of faculty careers through programs aimed at faculty leaders, administrators, and departmental groups. Eradicate inequitable practices through development of persuasive transformational technologies to gradually change attitudes while directly changing the way business is done at the university.   Each tier of this strategy was represented by a workgroup of faculty and campus leaders and an associated set of interventions.  These interventions raised awareness about unconscious bias, and further, inspired changes in practices because of the demonstrated negative effects of unconscious bias on the careers of women and underrepresented minorities in both STEM and non-STEM fields.  Promoting responsibility and accountability among academic leaders and administrators for the success of women and minority faculty will continue with support from the Executive Office of the President and the Office of the Provost.  The development of extensive training resources and practical tips on creating positive departmental climates, providing effective mentoring, and reducing or eliminating unconscious bias in evaluation and hiring, positioned the ADVANCE program for institutionalization.  The reach of these ADVANCE resources will grow in the future to assist in attracting and retaining women and underrepresented faculty at all career levels.
