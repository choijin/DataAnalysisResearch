<AbstractNarration>The proposed work is a meteorological investigation of the structure of the antarctic boundary layer with the goal of improving existing, or formulating new stable boundary layer parameterizations for mesoscale atmospheric models, using a combination of innovative approaches, such as large-eddy simulations, statistical analyses of field measurements, and next-generation modeling techniques.  The specific objectives are to investigate and improve the capabilities of existing large-eddy simulation (LES) subgrid-scale modeling techniques in simulating strongly stratified atmospheric boundary layers; systematically validate the LES results against available antarctic field observations, and propose improved and physically based flux parameterizations for mesoscale models based on LES-generated databases in conjunction with field observations.&lt;br/&gt;Large-eddy simulation is a modeling technique that has become an important tool for simulating the detailed structure of turbulent flows in various applications, including the boundary layers in the lower atmosphere and the upper ocean.  LES is used to study in detail how boundary layers transfer heat, momentum and trace chemical constituents, and how to represent these processes in weather prediction and climate models. Essentially it is a high resolution model embedded within a lower resolution model that solves numerically the Navier-Stokes equations for three-dimensional fluid flow, so that it can represent the important turbulent motions, or eddies in the flow. The proposed work would make fundamental contributions to the study of stably stratified flows, which extend well beyond the immediate application to antarctic meteorology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
