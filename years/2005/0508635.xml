<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0508635&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Charles D. Frohman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will extend and interpret quantum&lt;br/&gt;invariants of three-manifolds utilizing the geometry of character&lt;br/&gt;varieties. The ideas he is exploring will combine tools from&lt;br/&gt;gauge theory, representation theory, homological algebra, and&lt;br/&gt;three-manifold topology. This entails work on several&lt;br/&gt;problems. With Kania-Bartoszynksa he will define a quantum&lt;br/&gt;invariant of three-manifolds which will be a real analytic&lt;br/&gt;function on the open interval (-1,1). The invariant will be&lt;br/&gt;obtained by heat kernel regularization of the divergent formula&lt;br/&gt;for the Turaev-Viro invariant. The power series expansion at 0,&lt;br/&gt;will be in terms of weighted signed counts of surfaces carried by&lt;br/&gt;a spine of the manifold. The normalized limit as you approach 1,&lt;br/&gt;will yield the total Reidemeister torsion of the SU(2)-character&lt;br/&gt;variety of the fundamental group of the manifold. Using ideas&lt;br/&gt;from matrix models he will develop an analogous invariant based&lt;br/&gt;on the SL(2,C)-character variety of the three-manifold.  With his&lt;br/&gt;students he will continue to study the connection between the&lt;br/&gt;A-polynomial and quantum invariants, and explore the knot and&lt;br/&gt;link homology theories of Khovanov and Khovanov-Rozansky. With&lt;br/&gt;Oliver Dasbach and Marta Asaeda he is looking at homology&lt;br/&gt;theories underlying the Alexander polynomial. Finally, given a&lt;br/&gt;three-manifold and a Heegaard splitting there is an algebra which&lt;br/&gt;is the Kauffman bracket skein module of the Heegaard surface and&lt;br/&gt;a bimodule over that algebra built from the skein modules of the&lt;br/&gt;two handle-bodies. With Mike McLendon, he will study whether this&lt;br/&gt;homology is a three-manifold invariant, and if it is, what its&lt;br/&gt;relation to Khovanov homology is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rational understanding of the path integrals of Richard&lt;br/&gt;Feynman stand as one of the major unresolved problems of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. Using his integrals Feynman was able to make&lt;br/&gt;computations in quantum electrodynamics that far exceeded&lt;br/&gt;previous work. The tools he developed allowed the construction of&lt;br/&gt;modern integrated circuits. The rules that physicists use for&lt;br/&gt;computing path integrals have never been made completely&lt;br/&gt;rigorous.  The major thrust of Frohman's work in recent years has&lt;br/&gt;been about these integrals in a simplified setting where things&lt;br/&gt;can actually be computed. Specifically, the Yang-Mills measure in&lt;br/&gt;the Kauffman bracket skein module assigns to a gauge field on the&lt;br/&gt;space of flat connections on a surface a number. The formula for&lt;br/&gt;the measure coincides with an asymptotic expansion that appears&lt;br/&gt;throughout the physical literature. However, in this situation it&lt;br/&gt;is actually a convergent series.  Frohman is using this formula,&lt;br/&gt;and the estimates he used to prove it converged, to pursue the&lt;br/&gt;analytic study of three-manifold invariants that were before only&lt;br/&gt;computable using algebraic and combinatorial methods. The goal of&lt;br/&gt;the project is to reveal the geometric and toplogical nature of&lt;br/&gt;quantum invariants of three-manifolds to the end of increasing&lt;br/&gt;the understanding of three-manifolds, representation theory and&lt;br/&gt;quantum gravity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
