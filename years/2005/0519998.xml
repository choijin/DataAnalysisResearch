<AbstractNarration>0519880 &lt;br/&gt;0519998&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the early days of the ARPAnet to today's global Internet, most research on network protocols has focused on traditional performance metrics such as delay, loss, and throughput.  However, it is becoming increasingly important that a network not only provides good performance, but also do so in the face of a complex, uncertain, error-prone, and ever-changing environment.  In today's networks, operating conditions may change as a result of user behavior (e.g., a shift in traffic to a newly popular Web site) or the underlying infrastructure (e.g., an equipment failure).  In all such cases, the network and its operators must respond in a robust fashion, continuing to provide good performance despite changing conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need for "robust" network operation leads to a set of design considerations that the principal investigators (PIs) refer to as the "X-ities" (since they all end in "ity"): non-fragility, manageability, diagnosability, optimizability,  scalability, and evolvability.  Intuitively, we know that these X-ities are crucially important if we are to design and analyze robust networks and protocols.  Yet, compared with standard performance metrics, these X-ities often lack theoretical foundations, quantitative frameworks, or even well-defined metrics and meaning.  The goal of this project is to build a rigorous, quantitative foundation for explicitly considering the X-ities in the design and analysis of network protocols.   The PIs consider a number of specific problems, broadly in the area of routing protocols, that concretely address several of the X-ities---with particular emphasis on non-fragility and manageability---and to begin to draw larger lessons from commonalities among the problems studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research focuses on the X-ities in the context of the routing protocols that ensure that each computer has paths through the network to send data to other computers.  There are several reasons for this choice.  First, routing protocols are a crucial part of the network architecture---they are the very glue that holds the disparate parts of the Internet together. Second, the X-ities of IP routing have not received significant formal attention.  Third, routing protocols expose key issues of incomplete information (e.g., across networks run by different institutions) and interacting levels of control (e.g., between applications and the underlying network)---concerns that should arise in any thorough treatment of network X-ities.  Finally, routing provides a compelling context in which the X-ities can be quantitatively studied. For example, we can quantify the performance trade-off between a fragile routing solution that has been optimized for narrow, well-defined operating conditions, versus a solution that will perform well of over variety of operating conditions.  The contributions of the proposed research are three-fold:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A first quantitative study of X-ities: The intellectual challenges in rigorously understanding the X-ities are many. The PIs define specific metrics and develop mathematical models to quantitatively study each X-ity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Solutions to specific problems: To make the study of the X-ities concrete, the PIs consider a set of research problems broadly in the area of routing that are of interest in their own right. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The beginnings of a foundation for studying X-ities: The PIs believe that the study of network X-ities is a crucially important area for long-term research in networking.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-ity research will lead to a deeper quantitative understanding of how to develop robust network architectures and protocols---technology that is playing an increasingly crucial role  in our daily lives.  The broader impacts of the research will include enhanced teaching, training, and learning for our students, development and dissemination of new educational materials, and dissemination of X-ity research results throughout the technical community.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
