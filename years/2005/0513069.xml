<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop a mathematical framework&lt;br/&gt;for the modeling and analysis of images in two and three dimensions&lt;br/&gt;based on certain basis functions.  The foundation of this framework is&lt;br/&gt;a class of band-limited functions (that is, functions that have&lt;br/&gt;compactly supported Fourier transforms) which are also locally&lt;br/&gt;concentrated in the spatial domain.  Although images are seldom truly&lt;br/&gt;band-limited, they are generally considered piecewise smooth, and are&lt;br/&gt;frequently modeled so locally (or piecewisely) by smooth functions&lt;br/&gt;such as polynomials and trigonometric functions.  Since common images&lt;br/&gt;contain many features such as edges and textures that are usually&lt;br/&gt;locally compact in the Fourier domain and simultaneously limited in&lt;br/&gt;the spatial (or image) domain, functions of this type are an ideal&lt;br/&gt;choice of basis for image representations.  The PI will develop&lt;br/&gt;numerical methods for the construction of the band-limited basis&lt;br/&gt;functions, as well as efficient methods for the analysis and synthesis&lt;br/&gt;of images in such bases.  Furthermore, algorithms for targeted image&lt;br/&gt;analysis problems such as restoration and texture analysis will be&lt;br/&gt;implemented.  The PI will also investigate the adaptive construction&lt;br/&gt;of optimal (or near-optimal) representations of images, and test the&lt;br/&gt;effectiveness of such techniques on a realistic collection of 2D and&lt;br/&gt;3D images.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential applications of the mathematical theory and image analysis&lt;br/&gt;algorithms developed in this project include satellite imagery, remote&lt;br/&gt;sensing, and image-based diagnoses in fields such as medicine, and&lt;br/&gt;material science.  For example, in satellite imagery where data are&lt;br/&gt;acquired with limited resolution, one central task is to magnify or&lt;br/&gt;interpolate the images so that the faintest details embedded can be&lt;br/&gt;reliably enhanced.  Since the methods proposed in this project provide&lt;br/&gt;highly adaptive, localized image representation mechanisms, and&lt;br/&gt;therefore are likely to produce advanced image enhancement techniques&lt;br/&gt;with fewer artifacts than traditional methods, information may be more&lt;br/&gt;readily and reliably extracted.  Research proposed in this project&lt;br/&gt;also comprises methods and techniques that have been studied in&lt;br/&gt;several disciplines: the theory of band-limited functions in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, fast algorithms in numerical computation, edge detection&lt;br/&gt;and texture analysis in computer vision.  Thus, the project affords&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for cross-pollination between researchers and students&lt;br/&gt;in mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering and&lt;br/&gt;statistics, and will particular benefit the participating students by&lt;br/&gt;providing a fertile ground for them to make connections between&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
