    <AbstractNarration>The project involves four tightly coordinated strategies for outreach to high school students and for retention of college freshmen. The resulting activities are attracting qualified Appalachian high school students, particularly women and underrepresented minorities, to engineering and science-oriented programs, retaining them during their first year in engineering, and encouraging the improvement in math scores for all students. The first strategy trains 25 teachers per year with a set of teaching tools, referred to as TIME (Tools for Integrating Math and Engineering) kits, ultimately reaching 125 teachers who will impact 12,500 students annually. Developed by West Virginia University faculty from engineering, mathematics, math education, and physics, working with master mathematics teachers, the TIME kits are authentic problem-based engineering lessons designed to increase student achievement in math and interest in science and engineering. Math concepts are tied to the curriculum requirements of the West Virginia Department of Education Content Standards and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) standards. The second strategy is a summer experience program designed to encourage minority and female students to participate in a science or engineering field and to mentor students without a support system at home. This program provides intensive instruction for 80 -100 underrepresented minority students and women each year. Students attend in cohort groups of 20 for one week and maintain contact with the program during the subsequent academic year through engineering student mentors. The curriculum consists of introductory engineering training; basic math, science and technology skills; ACT/SAT preparation; and study skills necessary to survive on a large college campus. The third strategy, an on-line, college-credit course for high school students, is drawn from the existing first-year curricula. This course provides capable high school students a chance to better understand engineering career options before entering a college program and gain college credit that will reduce the time needed to complete their degree. The fourth strategy is a first-year engineering retention program that emphasizes mentorship and coaching. The investigators anticipate that engineering enrollment and graduation will grow by four percent annually during the five-year grant period, with improvements expected in all STEM programs. Dissemination is being achieved through presentations at professional education and engineering education meetings and by publications in professional journals.</AbstractNarration>
