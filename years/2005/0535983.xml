<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project creates modular, interdisciplinary educational materials for use in both introductory physics and upper-division biology courses.  These activities increase student understanding of both disciplines' content and the interplay between them.  The modular nature of these materials allows them to be easily integrated into existing courses with little to no modification necessary.  In the introductory physics courses, the biology content is introduced via the laboratory component, and includes biology-oriented capstone activities.  The physical concepts learned in these physics laboratory courses are then reinforced in later biology courses with activities that refer back to the original modular activities, but expand and broaden their application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Curricular reform approaches in the past have shown that connecting content materials within a course improves student learning of the material.  The approach of this project expands upon these successes by creating modular activities that not only thread and tie together content through courses within a single discipline, but between two separate disciplines.  The project team of two biologists and two physicists has experience in creating such interdisciplinary materials for a project of this size and magnitude (for example, the "Environmental Science Activities for the 21st Century" project being used at a host of institutions across the U.S.; http://esa21.kennesaw.edu).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The materials created for this project are used in biology and physics programs at two participating institutions, one that is predominantly minority (50.1% African American).  The success of the project is evaluated by measuring the impact of the materials on student learning, skills, and attitudes.  The assessment is done using standardized instruments that have been developed and used by other curricular reform initiatives.  The creation of the textbook-independent materials based upon standard labs and courses, and the modular nature of the materials, means that the project is very portable to other institutions.  The results of this project are planned to be disseminated via articles in peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, and a project website that is listed with archival libraries.</AbstractNarration>
