<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for a Workshop on "Integrated Risk Management in Operations and Global Supply Chain Management: Risk, Contracts and Insurance". The workshop will feature several lectures, given by the leading researchers and practitioners in the areas of Risk Management and Supply Chain Management.  In addition, the workshop will include technical, theoretical and practice-oriented presentations, each one followed by a discussion led by designated discussants.  Panelists, session presenters and discussants will be determined by the workshop chairs.  In order to ensure participation from a wide range of attendees, the workshop will be advertised through OR/MS Today and the mailing lists of Manufacturing and Service Operations Management Society of Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS), Production and Operations Management Society (POMS), Professional Risk Managers' International Association (PRMIA), Financial Services Section of INFORMS, and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the workshop is to facilitate the interactions between academia and industry, expand the horizons of the Risk Management and Supply Chain Management fields through cross-functional knowledge sharing, enhance our understanding of Operations Management theory and practice, and enrich the Operations Management solutions toolbox.  At the end of the workshop, a set of panelists will discuss future research directions that are likely to have the highest impact and identify collaboration opportunities between industry and academia. This discussion will be distilled into a cohesive report, highlighting the most challenging and the most significant problems in theory and practice of Risk and Supply Chain Management and providing a roadmap for the development of this interdisciplinary field.  By sponsoring travel expenses for the nominated students, the workshop organizers hope to encourage interest Integrated Risk Management in Operations among future researchers.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
