<AbstractNarration>This project will develop tools and materials that address the need schools have to implement results-oriented teacher learning programs that ensure highly qualified science teachers in every classroom.  The project will (1) develop and disseminate the Building Systems for Quality Teaching and Learning in Science Simulation and Facilitator Guide, and (2) develop and disseminate three Building Systems for Science Learning Modules.  The three modules are titled:  1. Knowledge and Beliefs Guiding Effective Science Instruction, 2. Assessing Science Instruction and Results, and 3. Enhancing Science Teaching &amp; Learning.  The intended audience for these products will be science leaders who support teacher professional development in science, including science teacher leaders, professional development providers, department chairs, curriculum coordinators, and university faculty in science, science education and educational leadership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project products will use a simulation as a vehicle for teacher change and student improvement. The simulation will contain multiple scenarios drawn from authentic experiences with schools/districts involved in the process of implementing change in science education.  In the simulation, participants will encounter many of the complex issues that confront schools/districts that are implementing change, and develop knowledge and skills to address those issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development process will involve a three year period of development, trial testing and revisions that will involve increasing numbers of trainers and teachers.  In the final year 50 facilitators will train between 1,250 and 1,500 teachers.  A team of three external experts will review the materials prepared.  Corwin Press has agreed to publish the materials.  A plan of formative and summative evaluation is included in the project.  Dissemination will be through the publisher, national conferences, NSTA bookstore, NSDL, TE-MAT, MSP-Net and LSC-Net. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
