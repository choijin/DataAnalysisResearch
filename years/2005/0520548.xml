<AbstractNarration>The successful adaptation of land plants relied on mechanisms that prevent water loss while allowing efficient gas exchange between plants and the atmosphere.   Gas exchange takes place through a stomatal complex, which consists of a pair of guard cells that operate as a turgor-driven valve.  Isolation of Arabidopsis mutants with elevated stomatal density and stomatal clustering reveals that stomatal patterning is under genetic regulation.  This research project focuses on the cell-cell signaling mechanism regulating stomatal patterning and differentiation.  A complete loss of three ERECTA-family receptor-like kinases (RLKs) leads to the generation of high-density stomatal clusters.  Further analysis of different erecta-family mutant combinations shows that the three RLKs possess overlapping but distinct functions in two critical steps of stomatal differentiation: (1) the initial decision of protodermal cells to enter proliferative division or asymmetric division to generate stomatal complexes; and (2) the decision to maintain stomatal stem cell activity and prevent terminal differentiation of guard cells.  Genetic interactions with a known stomatal patterning mutant, too many mouth (tmm), reveals stoichiometric epistasis and combination-specific neomorphism.  These findings suggest that negative regulation of ERECTA-family RLKs by TMM receptor-like protein, is critical for proper stomatal differentiation.  The specific aims are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) to determine the roles of three ERECTA-family receptor kinases during epidermal differentiation.&lt;br/&gt;2) to investigate interactions of three receptor kinases with known players of stomatal differentiation.&lt;br/&gt;3) to identify novel regulators of stomatal patterning and differentiation by taking advantage of a sensitized mutant background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research may lead to important agricultural applications, since the ability to manipulate stomatal distribution and patterning may influence photosynthetic efficiency and hence the biomass production of crop plants.  A postdoctoral associate, a graduate student and undergraduates, many of whom are women and of diverse ethnic backgrounds, will have excellent opportunities to obtain broad training in plant biology and molecular genetics. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
