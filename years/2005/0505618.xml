<AbstractNarration>This project deals with the mathematical and computational modeling of&lt;br/&gt;light as it propagates in photonic micro and nanostructures. In one example,&lt;br/&gt;a new and improved model will be proposed and used to describe novel optical&lt;br/&gt;pulse propagation in photonic crystal fibers such as the recently observed &lt;br/&gt;phenomena of supercontinuum generation which cannot be well understood with &lt;br/&gt;the existing slowly varying envelope approximation. A second component of &lt;br/&gt;this project studies light localization and steering in optical fiber arrays &lt;br/&gt;and in particular the role imperfections in the manufacturing of such devices &lt;br/&gt;have in enhancing or suppressing light localization. The model considered &lt;br/&gt;here is a set of coupled stochastic differential equations. Finally, we will &lt;br/&gt;begin to address the question of which optical phenomena that has been &lt;br/&gt;observed in micro-devices can also happen in the nano-devices. In all &lt;br/&gt;instances, the mathematical and computational outcomes will be presented to &lt;br/&gt;and compared with leading experimentalist efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research effort is of interdisciplinary nature and the use of &lt;br/&gt;mathematical modeling will help improve performance of optical devices&lt;br/&gt;used in medical applications such as coherent tomography and in advanced fiber&lt;br/&gt;lasers aimed at producing powers in the multi-kilowatt regime. &lt;br/&gt;State of the art lasers based on the model studied here, will likely prove to be relevant for &lt;br/&gt;homeland security. This project will support the advancement of  two women &lt;br/&gt;(a PhD student and a junior faculty) in their careers as Applied &lt;br/&gt;Mathematics professionals.</AbstractNarration>
