<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Center for e-Design creates and develops new design paradigms and electronic design tools that will assist in generating high quality products and systems at a reduced cost while also reducing the time associated with designing complex engineering products and systems.  Center Mission and Rationale  The mission of the Center for e-Design is to serve as a nationally recognized center of excellence in design where innovation and creativity are integrated with fundamental principles of science, mathematics, and engineering in the development, testing, and implementation of new methods and technologies for the design of products and systems focused on faster time-to-market, better product quality, and significantly reduced costs.   The Center for e-Design focuses its efforts in three major areas to deliver value to its industry/government partners:   1. Fundamental Research focuses on creating methods, tools, and technologies to address industry relevant needs in e-tools-enabled product development and realization including: enabling information infrastructure; new design paradigms and processes; design optimization; visualizing and virtual prototyping.   2. Research Test-bed focuses on integration of interdisciplinary research activities to validate developed tools, methods, and technologies.   3. Engineering Education and Technology Transfers focus on educating a new generation of engineers and scientists proficient in e-design and rapidly transferring results into usable applications for industry and government.  The Center as a whole is alive and well. It is a collaboration of seven universities and currently 23 industry and government members. Current Center for e-Design information can be found at http://www.centerforedesign.org  The Virginia Tech research site has concluded its participation at this time and is reporting these outcomes:  Design processes and methods useful to industry members and the general public were developed and reported at Industrial Advisory Board meetings and in design journals and engineering conferences which will contribute to the body of knowledge of engineering and engineering design.  Three graduate student researchers received PhD degrees working on Center research. Twelve middle school and high school teachers were trained and received valuable experience in how to teach spatial visualization and use 3-D printing in their classrooms as a result of a Research Experience for Teachers. Three undergraduate engineers and scientists worked on a summer research project as a result of a Research Experience for Undergraduates. Positioning them well for graduate school and being effective in the workplace. These graduates and teachers have had and will continue to have a significant impact on students and society.
