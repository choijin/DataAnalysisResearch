<AbstractNarration>Device drivers are operating system components that are typically developed independently by hardware vendors and third parties, often under the assumption that the driver is the only time-critical component in the operating system.  Device drivers execute with full kernel privileges and can circumvent the system's scheduling mechanisms to meet their own requirements. This, in turn, interferes with the execution and timing of other applications and device drivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to improve the state-of-the-art in device driver support for embedded real-time applications.  The approach involves fitting the scheduling of device driver execution within the operating system via paradigms for which model-based schedulability testing can be performed. The research studies representative examples of existing device drivers to determine how they fit well-understood formal models for schedulability analysis.  It explores how the drivers, the operating system's device driver scheduling mechanisms, and formal models can be improved to achieve more predictable performance for real-time applications. The research activities include formal analysis, prototype implementation of new architectural features, and performance testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research strives to address problems that the device drivers in current operating systems pose for real-time analysis. Besides disseminating results through conventional meetings and publications, and training graduate and undergraduate students, this project seeks to advance real-time computing practice through the dissemination of real-time kernel code and benchmark programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
