<AbstractNarration>Project Summary - CMS 0540024&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the proposed International Symposium is to bring together an&lt;br/&gt;international group of experts on mechanical waves in solids to present and discuss recent&lt;br/&gt;research and development in diverse fields, for the purpose of cross-fertilization by, and&lt;br/&gt;exchange of, ideas, methodologies, theories, and experimental and computational&lt;br/&gt;techniques.&lt;br/&gt;Two broad classes of wave problems will receive attention: direct and inverse&lt;br/&gt;problems. In the direct problem, the configuration, material constitution, and external&lt;br/&gt;excitation are known, and the response of the body must be determined. In the inverse&lt;br/&gt;problem, the external excitation, the response, and perhaps the configuration, are known,&lt;br/&gt;while the material constitution (mechanical properties, defects) must be determined.&lt;br/&gt;Solutions of the inverse problem are essential for measurement to determine the state of a&lt;br/&gt;material, but no inverse problem is solvable without a good understanding of the direct&lt;br/&gt;problem. Hence, direct and inverse problems should both be considered.&lt;br/&gt;The Symposium will bring together an international group of workers from different fields for an exchange of information via presentations, subsequent discussions, and comments, in the informal setting of a relatively small meeting. Another objective will be to bring in younger researchers who may not yet have achieved an international reputation, but who would greatly benefit from interaction with more experienced colleagues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
