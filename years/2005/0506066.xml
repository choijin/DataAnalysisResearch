<AbstractNarration>Morgan State University (MSU) will implement a five-year project to increase the number of students participating in undergraduate research and to enhance the mathematics courses through technology and active learning.  The project includes the acquisition of an X-ray powder diffractometer, an important piece of equipment for improving the quality of STEM education and increasing research productivity at MSU.  The undergraduate research program will target STEM freshmen and sophomores in order to prepare them for research programs for upper-class STEM students.   This activity will create a continuous undergraduate research program (from freshman to senior) for students that are committed to completing a doctoral program.  In order to improve retention and increase graduation rates the MSU mathematics courses will be enhanced using WeBWorK in conjunction with faculty development and training activities.  WeBWorK will be incorporated into the mathematics classroom for precalculus, calculus and differential equations.  WeBWorK is an online web based teaching and assessment system that is designed to make homework a more effective and efficient learning tool in the educational process. The goal is to increase the academic success and student interest in mathematics courses at MSU, which will, as a consequence, increase  the  retention  and  graduation rates of students in the  STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual  merit: The proposed activities are based on models used at other institutions of higher education which have been shown to improve retention and academic performance.  The undergraduate research experiences and acquisition of lab equipment will lead to an increase in scientific presentations and publications by students and faculty.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader  Impact.  The research activities will result in increased numbers of STEM students pursuing graduate education and the number who successfully complete their graduate programs.  The faculty collaborations developed with other institutions will help to sustain the increasing amount of research activity at MSU.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
