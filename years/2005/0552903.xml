<AbstractNarration>Abstract for REU Site: Program in Function Materials&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Colorado at Boulder&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Daniel K. Schwartz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU award for a 3 year Site will focus on Functional Materials research. The program supports 15 undergraduate students per year for three years in a 10-week summer research program. The participants will pursue fundamental investigations of the synthesis and characterization of novel materials designed to have specific properties. Examples include nanocomposites, biomaterials, catalysts, polymers, gels, ceramics, thin films, and membranes. Functional Materials has been recognized as a critical area of research in an National Science Foundation (NSF) Workshop, several National Research Council (NRC) reports, and the text of the National Nanotechnology Initiative. The program involves participation by 80% (16 out of 20) of the faculty in Chemical &amp; Biological Engineering. &lt;br/&gt;The research interests of the principal investigators are wide-ranging and interdisciplinary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program includes the following features: (1) a focus on a forward-looking area of research, Functional Materials, (2) a Student Poster Competition to encourage students to present their research at technical meetings; (3) funds to pay for travel expenses for these presentations; (4) a proactive recruiting strategy to improve student diversity; (5) a seminar that focuses on preparing students to do research; (6) social and cultural activities that enhance the research activities; and (7) an effective program evaluation plan. The principal objective of this REU site program is to encourage promising students, in particular women, underrepresented minorities, and students from primarily undergraduate institutions to go on to graduate school in order to pursue careers in engineering research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
