<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0555730&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Kent E. Orr&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Graduate Student Topology Conference will provide graduate student&lt;br/&gt;training and create opportunities via student talks, via communication&lt;br/&gt;of recent advances, and by introducing students to others within their&lt;br/&gt;field.  We accomplish this with the participation of established&lt;br/&gt;research leaders who will give plenary talks and interact with&lt;br/&gt;students, and through graduate student talks. Vaughan Jones from UC&lt;br/&gt;Berkeley and Dusa MacDuff from SUNY Stony Brook will give keynote&lt;br/&gt;presentations. A winner of the 1990 Fields Medal, Jones is a member of&lt;br/&gt;the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and&lt;br/&gt;Sciences.  After celebrated work in von Neumann algebras, Jones&lt;br/&gt;established a new paradigm for knot theoretic research with his&lt;br/&gt;breakthrough discovery of the Jones Polynomial.  Dusa McDuff is a&lt;br/&gt;member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, the American&lt;br/&gt;Academy of Arts and Sciences, and is a fellow of the Royal Society of&lt;br/&gt;London. She has numerous honors including the Satter Prize of the&lt;br/&gt;American Mathematical Society in 1991.  Graduate students will present&lt;br/&gt;a range of topics from elementary introductions of fundamental topics&lt;br/&gt;to ongoing research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology is an abstracted form of geometry studying the aspects&lt;br/&gt;of geometric objects which are unchanged through continuous&lt;br/&gt;deformation.  Of particular interest to geometric topology is the&lt;br/&gt;classification of manifolds, that is, spaces which near each&lt;br/&gt;point look Euclidean.  One often solves a geometric topology&lt;br/&gt;problem by relating it to other algebraic problems that are more&lt;br/&gt;tractable.  The algebraic tools so developed have substantial&lt;br/&gt;independent interest within algebraic topology.  Topology is a&lt;br/&gt;central field of theoretical mathematics having broad&lt;br/&gt;applications to physics and other sciences.  The conference takes&lt;br/&gt;place at the Bloomington, Indiana campus of Indiana University on&lt;br/&gt;April 1 - 2, 2006, and will encourage essential communication and&lt;br/&gt;collaboration among graduate students working in the area of&lt;br/&gt;topology, and pertaining to their research initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The conference web page is http://www.indiana.edu/~gstc/.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
