<AbstractNarration>Migration is a widespread occurrence among species of birds. While there are many hypotheses to explain the factors that cause migration to evolve, few have been rigorously tested. Evaluating these hypotheses in an evolutionary framework examines whether common factors can account for the evolution of migration across bird species. Geographical hypotheses predict that there is a relationship between whether species are found in seasonal environments and a species' propensity to evolve migratory behavior. This study tests geographical hypotheses in a widespread and speciose genus of flycatchers (Ficedula), by first reconstructing a molecular phylogeny, then examining the evolutionary relationship (correlation) between migration and geography. &lt;br/&gt; In terms of scientific importance, many migratory birds have shown rapid declines in numbers that seem to be tied to human-induced habitat loss - this is especially a problem in Southeast Asia where Ficedula flycatchers are found.  We must understand these systems, and how they have changed over evolutionary time, as this study attempts to do, to better protect them in the face of rapid environmental change. With regard to the educational community, the University of Memphis, where the proposed research is being conducted, has a diverse student body. It is a major goal of the investigators to recruit and train underrepresented undergraduate students in molecular systematic techniques. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
