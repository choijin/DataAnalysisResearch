<AbstractNarration>0532762&lt;br/&gt;Bergman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The explosive growth in data centric traffic and demand for diverse services are driving the migration of&lt;br/&gt;optical communication systems toward packet switched networks. Optical packet switched (OPS)&lt;br/&gt;networks offer the unique combination of encompassing the enormous capacity of the optical domain&lt;br/&gt;while providing versatile connectivity afforded by individual packet routing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key performance metrics of OPS networks at the logical layer, including throughput, latency,&lt;br/&gt;scalability, and packet-loss-rates have been studied extensively for various architectures. However, the&lt;br/&gt;physical layer performance, a critical measure of the feasibility of packet switched networks intended for&lt;br/&gt;implementation in the optical domain, is not well understood in this context. In OPS networks optical&lt;br/&gt;packets are typically self-routed through a complex web of interconnection topologies. The exact path any&lt;br/&gt;packet may take is not often known, as the routing mechanism may be performed statistically to achieve&lt;br/&gt;fairness and load balancing. Furthermore, the data structure carried within the packet may be diverse and&lt;br/&gt;include data encoded in different bitrates and modulation formats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus, whereas it may be shown that the logical topology scales in terms of the network layer performance&lt;br/&gt;metrics, it does not necessarily follow that the physical layer with complex optical packet propagation&lt;br/&gt;also scales in terms of maintaining end-to-end signal integrity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposed exploratory research the PI will aim to achieve a methodology for evaluating the&lt;br/&gt;integrated physical/logical layers performance in OPS networks that truly encompasses the diverse set&lt;br/&gt;of scaling metrics and captures the complex nature of optical signal propagation in these networks. To&lt;br/&gt;accomplish these goals an experimental investigation will be performed employing a unique, integrated&lt;br/&gt;system of a fully connected 12-port OPS network containing 36 switching elements. This experimental&lt;br/&gt;test-bed will enable direct coupling between numerical and analytical modeling with realistic data&lt;br/&gt;propagated end-to-end through a complete implemented OPS network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed exploratory research will establish a novel methodology for bridging&lt;br/&gt;the gap between the network logical and physical layers in OPS communication systems. These activities&lt;br/&gt;will create the groundwork for an emerging field of research that integrates two currently separate&lt;br/&gt;disciplines. The merging of the logical and physical layers will enable an integrated systems approach to a&lt;br/&gt;new understanding of the critical performance metrics for OPS networks. Unlike electronic systems, the&lt;br/&gt;physical layer of optical communication systems is subject to numerous impairments arising from the&lt;br/&gt;interactions (linear and nonlinear) of the optical field with the transport medium, switching elements, and&lt;br/&gt;amplifiers. Thus, the total complex system performance cannot be decoupled into its physical and logical&lt;br/&gt;component layers and must be studied in an integrated fashion. The tools to perform this investigation&lt;br/&gt;however do not yet exist. In this proposed exploratory research program the PI will perform realistic traffic&lt;br/&gt;routing experiments in a completely implemented optical packet switched network element. These&lt;br/&gt;experiments will stress the physical layer scalability as incoming packets to each of the ultra-high&lt;br/&gt;capacity ports may contain payload data that spans the WDM C-band. The entire payload is transparently&lt;br/&gt;routed end-to-end through the network element and thus may include a diverse set of modulation speeds&lt;br/&gt;and formats encoded along the multiple payload wavelengths. These experimental investigations by&lt;br/&gt;directly coupling the physical and logical layers, will enable the creation of a truly integrative systems&lt;br/&gt;model for the performance of OPS networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Clearly, the migration of optical communication systems is headed toward dynamic&lt;br/&gt;networks driven by the explosive growth of packetized data centric traffic. OPS networks offer the&lt;br/&gt;potential of exploiting the enormous capacity of lightwave communications while delivering fine grained&lt;br/&gt;connectivity to a multitude of traffic destinations via individual packet routing. The diverse set of data&lt;br/&gt;structures, encoding, and modulation schemes enabled by the transparent end-to-end payload path creates&lt;br/&gt;a network element that can potentially seamlessly evolve with many new network generations. Test-bed&lt;br/&gt;experiments and modeling employed to demonstrate the integrated physical/logical layers performance&lt;br/&gt;scalability will enable intelligent design of future ultra-high capacity packet switched systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
