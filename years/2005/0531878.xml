<AbstractNarration>This project is an innovative partnership of the California State University San Marcos (CSUSM) Colleges of Science and Math, feeder community college bridging programs, CSUSM College of Education, North San Diego County Secondary Schools, Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), and the greater Rochester area middle and high schools. It provides tuition support for both prerequisite and professional education courses to increase the number of math and science teacher candidates by recruiting from two different geographical pools of candidates. The project: 1) addresses the shortage of highly qualified high school math and science teachers by recruiting and retaining 14 math or science teacher candidates each year of the project for a total of 56 teachers over a 4 year period, 2) improves the quality of science and math teaching in underserved high schools by educating teacher candidates to use research-based effective practices, and 3) retains project participants in teaching careers in underserved schools by providing beginning teacher support for two years. There are three methodology phases: 1) Recruitment of highly qualified science and math undergraduates and graduates from RIT, CSUSM, and surrounding colleges through active informational sessions in classrooms and open presentations on both campuses by the PIs. Qualified students are tracked through the two prerequisite courses that emphasize the connection of theory to exemplary practice by integrating beginning observation/field experiences at school sites. 2) Education of teacher candidates to use exemplary teaching methods. 3) Placement and retention of graduates in positions in local schools identified as meeting grant criteria. Graduates are supported through existing Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA) programs at each site as well as follow up support through seminars for two years.</AbstractNarration>
