<AbstractNarration>The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference has provided a general forum for disseminating the latest developments in bioinformatics on an annual basis for the past 12 years. ISMB is a multidisciplinary conference that brings together scientists from computer science, molecular biology, mathematics and statistics. The venue for the ISMB meeting usually alternates between North American and non North American sites. ISMB 2005 will be held in Detroit, Michigan. The goal of the ISMB meeting is to bring together biologists and computational scientists in a focus on actual biological problems, i.e., not simply theoretical calculations. The combined focus on "intelligent systems" and actual biological data makes ISMB a unique and highly important meeting, and 12 years of experience in holding the conference has resulted in a consistently well organized, well attended, and highly respected annual conference. &lt;br/&gt;This grant request is for funding for student, young scientist, and presenter travel and expense to attend the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference. In a highly international and interdisciplinary field such as computational biology, it is important for students to gain experience with a variety of approaches and viewpoints. From the Tutorial program, which provides an excellent way for students and senior researchers to quickly come up to speed in new areas, through to the final keynote address, students will have ample opportunity, in many cases for the first time, to present their work as posters or as formal presentations and meet with fellow researchers from other institutions around the globe. The contacts that they form and the directions they choose may last their professional lives. This proposal seeks to assist them at this critical but resource-limited stage in their careers.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
