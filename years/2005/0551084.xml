<AbstractNarration>The PIs propose to collaborate in developing new techniques for measuring the state of the solar atmosphere and for solving the physical equations governing its evolution. The proposers plan to combine these capabilities so that numerical simulations might be directly driven by observed solar data. To accomplish this, they intend to develop new methods of reducing solar vector magnetogram sequences, optimized for input into simulations as a self-consistent set of boundary conditions for a numerical solution. A semi-implicit code will be used to solve the compressible, time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations subject to those initial conditions and boundary conditions. The end-to-end capability provided by these new methods will be demonstrated by performing data-driven simulations of at least three solar active regions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decades of high-quality observations from ground-based and space-based instruments have led researchers to propose several different models for the origin and evolution of coronal mass ejections. Three-dimensional, time-dependent simulations can demonstrate the viability of these models, provided they are appropriately driven. However, only driving these simulations directly with data can identify the model that best describes reality. This proposal will develop the necessary techniques to perform such a test, and will contribute to the development of a national space weather forecasting capability, which will assimilate ongoing observations into large-scale computer simulations that solve the governing equations. All tools developed under this effort will be made available to the solar physics community and to the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of our long-term goals is the development of computer models of the Sun's atmosphere that can be used to understand and predict the occurrence of violent events (such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections) that can affect the Earth's space environment.  Before that can be done, a number of technical problems have to be solved, and the objective of this research was to address two of these technical problems: (1) Figuring out some way to determine the Sun's electric field from the observed time evolution of its remotely-sensed magnetic field, and (2) Figuring out how to input the observed magnetic field and inferred electric field into such a computer model in a stable way that works robustly.  To summarize our progress in lay terms, we were very successful in tackling problem (1), but only partly successful in solving problem (2).  There were many other scientific accomplishments that were partly supported with this particular funding.  We intend to continue working on problem (2) with support from other funding sources, as we regard this as an extremely important goal.  Our solution of the first problem will have, we believe, broader impacts that include applying our new electric field techniques to new magnetic field observations from NASA's SDO Mission to predict likely locations for solar flares to occur.  These techniques should also prove valuable in understanding long-term scientific questions such as the origins of the energy that heat the Sun's corona or that accelerate the solar wind.  The PI and CoIs of this award gratefully acknowledge the support of this work by the US taxpayers.       Last Modified: 07/30/2011       Submitted by: George H Fisher]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
