<AbstractNarration>The goal of the proposed research and education is to search for dark matter particles &lt;br/&gt;in the halo of our galaxy, and to increase the number of female physics students at the &lt;br/&gt;University of Florida (UF). The motivation for the search for dark matter comes from our &lt;br/&gt;current understanding of the universe. Over the last ten years, a variety of cosmological &lt;br/&gt;observations have led to the construction of a concordance model of cosmology. In this very &lt;br/&gt;successful model, the universe is made of 4% baryons, which constitute the ordinary matter, &lt;br/&gt;23% nonbaryonic dark matter, which formed all the structures observed today, and 73% &lt;br/&gt;dark energy, a smooth component revealed by its effect on the geometry of the universe. &lt;br/&gt;Understanding the nature of the dark matter and dark energy are the most important &lt;br/&gt;challenges to cosmology. The dark matter could be made of so-called Weakly Interacting &lt;br/&gt;Massive Particles (WIMPs), which could have been produced in a very early phase of the &lt;br/&gt;universe. These Big Bang relics are particularly interesting because they are also predicted &lt;br/&gt;in particle physics theories going beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. They &lt;br/&gt;can be detected in the laboratory by searching for nuclear recoils produced when WIMPs &lt;br/&gt;scatter off nuclei in a target detector. Because the predicted event rates are very low &lt;br/&gt;(smaller than one event per kg detector material and day), and the deposited energies &lt;br/&gt;are tiny, massive, ultra-low background experiments are needed in order to detect these &lt;br/&gt;hypothetical particles. Liquid xenon has many advantages as a dark matter detector. The &lt;br/&gt;high-density and high atomic number allow to build a compact and self-shielded detector, &lt;br/&gt;while the simultaneous measurement of the charge and light signal after a WIMP scatters &lt;br/&gt;off a Xe-nucleus provides an efficient method to discriminate against background noise from &lt;br/&gt;natural radioactivity and cosmic ray interactions. The proposed research has the ultimate &lt;br/&gt;goal of building a large liquid Xe dark matter experiment in an underground laboratory. &lt;br/&gt;A first, 10 kg liquid Xe dark matter prototype has been approved and will be installed at &lt;br/&gt;the Gran Sasso Laboratory in 2006. At the University of Florida, we have built a smaller, &lt;br/&gt;3 kg prototype, with the goal of calibrating the light and charge output of the detector and &lt;br/&gt;establishing its discrimination power at low energies by using a neutron beam at the UF &lt;br/&gt;tandem accelerator. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main focus of the educational part of the proposal is to mentor female students in &lt;br/&gt;bridging the transition from high school to college and from college to a PhD program on &lt;br/&gt;physics. A series of talks will be given at local high schools with the goal of recruiting female &lt;br/&gt;students to UF and to a yearly 7 week summer program in which they are actively involved &lt;br/&gt;in research in a physics lab. A mentoring program for female undergraduate and graduate &lt;br/&gt;students at UF will be established. It will be organized both as small-group tutoring, by &lt;br/&gt;pairing one undergraduate and one graduate student and having them meet regularly, as &lt;br/&gt;well as in large group activities, such as monthly meetings with a female professor from &lt;br/&gt;UF or abroad, and social events. Such meetings, along with office hours for female physics &lt;br/&gt;students have been offered since fall 2004, and so far were very well attended. The ultimate &lt;br/&gt;goal of the educational component will be to increase the number of women who obtain an &lt;br/&gt;advanced degree in physics, and who will continue to have a successful career in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
