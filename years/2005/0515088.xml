    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on NP-hard optimization problems arising from the rapid development of Computer&lt;br/&gt;Networks. This research proposes to investigate the development of efficient combinatorial algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for wired and wireless networks. The project also involves improving the existing algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;fundamental graph optimization problems that have direct applications in networking. The PI proposes&lt;br/&gt;to concentrate on fast generation of approximate solutions. In addition, the algorithms for wireless&lt;br/&gt;networks must use only local information.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the PI intends to accomplish the following research items in this project:&lt;br/&gt;.. devise efficient approximation algorithms to increase bandwidth utilization in quality-of-service&lt;br/&gt;multicasting.&lt;br/&gt;.. devise efficient distributed algorithms for maintaining connectivity in ad hoc wireless networks&lt;br/&gt;and sensor networks, while minimizing the energy consumption and extending the network's&lt;br/&gt;lifetime. The PI will analyze the communication complexity of the algorithms and their behavior&lt;br/&gt;with imprecise input data and node failure. The research will start by concentrating on static&lt;br/&gt;networks, while always considering extensions to mobile networks. Once the problems arising&lt;br/&gt;from static ad-hoc wireless networks are better understood, the PI will concentrate on mobility.&lt;br/&gt;.. devise efficient approximation algorithms for several graph connectivity problems.&lt;br/&gt;.. identify and solve new optimization problems arising in the next generation of computer networks.&lt;br/&gt;The new methods will be grounded on provably good algorithms with guaranteed worst-case performance,&lt;br/&gt;and extensive empirical studies that thoroughly test the algorithms' efficiency in simulations&lt;br/&gt;on available industrial data. The developed algorithms and their implementations will be widely distributed&lt;br/&gt;to practitioners in order to enable a more complete understanding of the optimization problems&lt;br/&gt;in these application areas. The intelectual merit of this proposal consists of advances in the techniques&lt;br/&gt;of design and analysis of algorithms and the understanding of the underlying combinatorial structure&lt;br/&gt;of several graph optimization problems.&lt;br/&gt;The main educational goal of this project is to improve the preparation of graduate and undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;CS majors at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in theoretical computer science. The grant would&lt;br/&gt;be used to support a research group of graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;The project's impact will be increased by supporting seminars and workshops which benefit a diversity&lt;br/&gt;of students and researchers. The PI's service agenda is centered on recruitment of talented students&lt;br/&gt;for theoretical research, as part of the broader impacts of the proposed research.</AbstractNarration>
