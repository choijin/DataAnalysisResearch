<AbstractNarration>The effective operation of power systems in the present and the future depends to a large extent on how well several emerging challenges are met today. Power systems are experiencing increasing stress as they are operated in many instances at or near their full capacities. At the same, addition of new transmission lines to relieve this stress is often very difficult and is mired in slow regulatory procedures. The blackout on August 14th, 2003 in the Northeastern US clearly showed that the stressed power system is clearly vulnerable to cascading failures and can result in widespread outages that can affect millions of people and bring modern day life to a stand still.  This two-day workshop will bring together invited speakers whose research interests lie in the areas of power system dynamics and control associated with the analysis of large disturbances in power systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This workshop will: one, create a venue in which engaging discussions among researchers can take place; two, present new research ideas in understanding and preventing cascading outages in power systems; and three, outline the challenges and future research needs in this area. Broader impact: The workshop funded by this proposal will generate technical issues for research relating to preventing cascading outages in large power systems. This is a topic of critical importance to the economic viability of the nation. The results of this workshop will identify new directions for research to harden the electric supply system and improve the reliability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
