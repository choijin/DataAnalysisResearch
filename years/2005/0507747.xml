<AbstractNarration>AST 0507797&lt;br/&gt;Jay Holberg&lt;br/&gt;University of Arizona&lt;br/&gt;The Local Degenerate Star Population: Calibrating a Vast New Domain&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;A program to comprehensively study the local white dwarf population will be undertaken&lt;br/&gt;to address fundamental questions concerning the Galactic origin (thin disk, thick disk or halo) of&lt;br/&gt;both individual white dwarfs as well as the spectroscopic subpopulations of these stars. This&lt;br/&gt;study will also provide important details on the thermal and chemical evolution of white dwarfs&lt;br/&gt;and link the local white dwarf population with larger more distant samples such as the white dwarf&lt;br/&gt;population in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The population for this study is the 2000 to 2500 white&lt;br/&gt;dwarfs listed in the Villanova Catalog of Spectroscopically Identified White Dwarf. These goals are&lt;br/&gt;achieved through the use of newly available photometric, spectroscopic and proper motion data&lt;br/&gt;to augment existing data on this population of predominantly local white dwarfs. A fundamental&lt;br/&gt;aspect of this proposal is the maintenance and upgrading of the existing Villanova Catalog of&lt;br/&gt;Spectroscopically Identified White Dwarfs and the (Arizona) White Dwarf Database, in which all these data&lt;br/&gt;sets will reside. Finally, a modest observing program will be conducted to deepen and expand&lt;br/&gt;the existing spectroscopic and photometric data for known white dwarfs that will fill key gaps as well&lt;br/&gt;as validate the classifications for all stars in the catalog and database.&lt;br/&gt;The database contents (both observed and parameters derived through this work) will&lt;br/&gt;be made publicly available via the internet and used by astronomers across several disciplines&lt;br/&gt;(Galactic structure, formation, compact object physics, etc.). Multiple undergraduate students will&lt;br/&gt;be involved with aspects of the work at both Arizona and Florida Tech. They will participate&lt;br/&gt;in the design of the database, its population, and analysis and will have the opportunity to experience&lt;br/&gt;scientific research with large data sets.</AbstractNarration>
