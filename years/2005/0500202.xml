<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;  The first main theme of the proposal is the study of points on curves &lt;br/&gt;of genus 1, more particularly points which are defined over solvable &lt;br/&gt;extensions of the ground field. This is joint work with Ciperiani and aims &lt;br/&gt;to prove that for genus 1 curves defined over a totally real number field there &lt;br/&gt;are always points defined over a solvable extension of the base field. In &lt;br/&gt;the first instance we are aiming to prove the existence of such points &lt;br/&gt;while assuming that there exist points over all p-adic fields, but this &lt;br/&gt;condition should be easy to remove. We note that we do not wish to assume &lt;br/&gt;anything about the rank of the Jacobian of the curve. The second theme of &lt;br/&gt;the proposal is to continue a study of the problem of non-solvable base &lt;br/&gt;change. For the moment the intent is to restrict attention to the case of &lt;br/&gt;holomorphic forms on GL(2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  There are two main problems being investigated in this project. The &lt;br/&gt;first problem is to try to extend the ideas used in the nineteenth &lt;br/&gt;century to understand equations. For equations of one variable it was &lt;br/&gt;shown by Abel and Galois that those of degree five or more do not &lt;br/&gt;have easy general formulas like the ones for quadratic equations. The reason &lt;br/&gt;for this was that the solutions to equations of degree four or less &lt;br/&gt;always live in what are called solvable extensions i.e. those extensions &lt;br/&gt;obtained by successively extracting square roots, cube roots etc. &lt;br/&gt;Surprisingly it is not known whether the same is true for equations with &lt;br/&gt;more than one variable. The first aim of this project is to show that &lt;br/&gt;many of the simpler kinds of equations in two variables do in fact have &lt;br/&gt;these simple kinds of solutions. Many constructions in number theory at &lt;br/&gt;the moment require the assumption that the equations involved do have &lt;br/&gt;such simple solutions. The second part of the project is an attempt to extend a &lt;br/&gt;particular and very important one of these constructions to the situation&lt;br/&gt;where the equations involved do not have any simple solutions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
