<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0505557&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Matthias Weber&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project aims to combine two powerful new methods to&lt;br/&gt;investigate moduli spaces of complete, properly embedded minimal&lt;br/&gt;surfaces in euclidean space and their limits: Flat cone metrics are a&lt;br/&gt;geometric way to represent Riemann surfaces together with a (possibly&lt;br/&gt;multivalued) meromorphic 1-form, giving immediate information about&lt;br/&gt;the periods of the form. In combination with Teichmuller theory, cone&lt;br/&gt;metrics have been applied to existence and classification problems of&lt;br/&gt;mimimal surfaces. Noded surfaces are natural limits of  Riemann&lt;br/&gt;surfaces under conformal pinching of curves. They have been used to&lt;br/&gt;construct families of minimal surfaces that degenerate to a suitable&lt;br/&gt;noded limit, using the implicit function theorem. We aim for a&lt;br/&gt;description of the noded limits of minimal surfaces as geometric&lt;br/&gt;limits of flat cone metrics. This adds a third type of limit to the&lt;br/&gt;formerly considered geometric and conformal limits. The conformal&lt;br/&gt;limits ignore the minimal surface information and consider only the&lt;br/&gt;Riemann surface limit, while the geometric limit retain the minimal&lt;br/&gt;surface nature but loose conformal and topological information by&lt;br/&gt;rescaling the surfaces in space. The new cone metric limit will&lt;br/&gt;incorporate both types of information. We hope that this description&lt;br/&gt;will lead to new examples and classification results. This research&lt;br/&gt;will be backed by numerical and graphical experiments based on a&lt;br/&gt;minimal surface library currently under development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minimal surfaces are mathematical abstractions of 2-dimensional shapes&lt;br/&gt;that arise at different scales in nature: We are all familiar with&lt;br/&gt;soap film experiments, but such surfaces also have been observed at&lt;br/&gt;the nano scale as interfaces between block copolymers. Their&lt;br/&gt;mathematical properties are important for understanding the physical&lt;br/&gt;nature of new fabrics. The physical goal to minimize surface tension&lt;br/&gt;translates into a mathematical equation which has been of interest for&lt;br/&gt;over 250 years: The minimal surface equation is just at the border&lt;br/&gt;between what we understand by general theory and what we only can&lt;br/&gt;analyze numerically. Any advance at this point will most likely have&lt;br/&gt;its effects on other equations from mathematical physics and&lt;br/&gt;engineering. The methods which are being used to investigate  minimal&lt;br/&gt;surfaces range from geometric analysis to numerical mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;Recent theoretical advances from partial differential equations and&lt;br/&gt;Teichmuller theory allow us to study 'extreme' minimal surfaces which&lt;br/&gt;comparable to soap films that nearly break under deformations.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding these extreme surfaces not only helps us to analyze the&lt;br/&gt;examples we have by breaking them apart into simpler pieces but also&lt;br/&gt;allows the construction of exciting new surfaces by putting suitable&lt;br/&gt;pieces together. The computer experiments we conduct require elaborate&lt;br/&gt;symbolic manipulations of the formulas involved, high-precision&lt;br/&gt;numerical computations to get accurate 3-dimensional surface data, and&lt;br/&gt;high performance computer graphics to visualize the actual surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
