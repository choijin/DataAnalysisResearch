<AbstractNarration>Cheuk-Yiu Ng of the University of California-Davis is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to perform high-resolution photoionization efficiency (PIE), pulsed field ionization-photoelectron (PFI-PE), and PFI-photoion (PFI-PI) or PFI-PE-photoion coincidence (PFI-PEPICO) studies of small carbon clusters and selected transition metal-clusters and transition metal-ligated species using unique vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) synchrotron-based and VUV and infrared laser-based instrumentation and experimental schemes.  Characterization of the structures, stabilities, and reactivity of chemically significant carbon clusters, transition metal clusters, and transition metal-ligated compounds and their ions continue to elicit much interest in the scientific community.  Despite much prior experimental and theoretical effort, energetic and spectroscopic information such as ionization energies, bond dissociation energies, and vibrational frequencies for many of these species and their cations is still not well determined.  Such data are important for understanding the physical and chemical properties of these compounds.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small carbon clusters and their cations are of great interest for the chemistry of carbon stars, comets, interstellar molecular clouds, and hydrocarbon flames.  Transition metal clusters and transition metal-ligated molecules attract attention because of their fundamental importance to catalysis.  Outcomes from this research will lead to new and useful insights into these molecular systems. As well, this project will assist in the education and training of the next generation of researchers in the development of VUV lasers and their chemical applications.  The VUV region of the electromagnetic spectrum is recognized as a key component for the development of nanoscale technologies and biomedical research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
