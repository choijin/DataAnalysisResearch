<AbstractNarration>Project Summary: The Signing Science Dictionary Project&lt;br/&gt;Summary of Work. With this RDE-FRI project, TERC and Vcom3D will use the SigningAvatar&lt;br/&gt;accessibility software to develop an interactive 3D dictionary of science terms and definitions to support&lt;br/&gt;access to standards-based science content among elementary and middle-grade students who are deaf or&lt;br/&gt;hard of hearing and whose first language is sign; evaluate the extent to which use of the dictionary&lt;br/&gt;furthers understanding of science content, interest in science, and the ability to study independently; and&lt;br/&gt;create a more robust sign/facial expression/body space library for use in developing subsequent volumes&lt;br/&gt;of the dictionary or in SigningAvatar-enabling other science materials. At the end of two years,&lt;br/&gt;products will include:&lt;br/&gt; robust 3D interactive SigningAvatar-enabled dictionary of at least 1,300 key science terms&lt;br/&gt;identified from instructional materials used in elementary and middle grade classrooms;&lt;br/&gt; report of findings from analysis of qualitative and quantitative student and teacher field-test data&lt;br/&gt;about the effectiveness of the dictionary;&lt;br/&gt; addition of new vocabulary of technical signs to the Avatar characters' sign/facial expression/body&lt;br/&gt;space lexicon in the areas of life, physical, earth and space science, and scientific inquiry.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits. The project represents a third collaboration between TERC and Vcom3D and&lt;br/&gt;leverages findings from two existing collaborations. Founded in 1965, TERC is a not-for-profit education&lt;br/&gt;research and development organization dedicated to the improvement of science, mathematics, and&lt;br/&gt;technology teaching and learning for all students. Vcom3D is a female owned and managed small&lt;br/&gt;business, founded in 1997, and the developers of the SigningAvatar accessibility software. In 2001,&lt;br/&gt;working together, the partners combined forces for the first time to SigningAvatar-enable the web&lt;br/&gt;activities for three of the elementary and middle-grade science curriculum units called EnViSci Network.&lt;br/&gt;(Development of the SigningAvatar software, EnViSci Network, and this first collaboration were&lt;br/&gt;funded, in part, by NSF.) Findings show all students who completed the signed units had significantly&lt;br/&gt;higher post-test scores compared to those on matched pre-tests; post-test scores were also similar to those&lt;br/&gt;for hearing students. Realizing the benefits of the Avatar and that cost and time preclude one-by-one&lt;br/&gt;signing of even the most widely used instructional materials, the partners explored alternative means for&lt;br/&gt;integrating the SigningAvatar software into science materials on a broader scale. What emerged was the&lt;br/&gt;need for an interactive 3D dictionary of signed science terms and definitions that could be used as a&lt;br/&gt;universal tool for teaching and learning independent of the curriculum in place or materials being used.&lt;br/&gt;With funding from NEC Foundation of America, the partners embarked on a second collaboration and&lt;br/&gt;developed a 300-term prototype of such a dictionary. The Signing Science Dictionary project, and third&lt;br/&gt;collaboration between the partners, builds on their collected knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The proposed dictionary is designed to serve the approximately 50,000 students in the&lt;br/&gt;target population who require services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and&lt;br/&gt;are required by it and the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 to have access to the same content as&lt;br/&gt;students with disabilities. The dictionary will offer members of this target population greater access to the&lt;br/&gt;same opportunities as hearing students for rigorous science study that can potentially lead to careers in&lt;br/&gt;STEM and expand over a lifetime. It will also offer teachers a library of recognized signs for studying&lt;br/&gt;scientific ideas with students. Unlike existing dictionaries, this first-of-its kind product will allow users to&lt;br/&gt;select from a range of characters with different personalities and facial expressions, to alter the speed of&lt;br/&gt;signing, and to sign a selected term and its definition in American Sign Language (ASL) or Signed&lt;br/&gt;English (SE). Delivered as a single CD-ROM for use with a Windows operating system, this complete&lt;br/&gt;assistive tool will require low bandwidth and can be used with and without an Internet connection.&lt;br/&gt;Publication by a major publisher will result in dissemination of the dictionary nationally. Terms in the&lt;br/&gt;lexicon will be available through Vcom3D to publishers, developers, and educators to sign other&lt;br/&gt;dictionaries or science materials.</AbstractNarration>
