<AbstractNarration>Researchers in the solid-Earth sciences tend to work on highly specific projects in specialized sub-disciplines.  The fundamental research questions underlying these projects are often implied or stated in highly detailed, technical terms.  It will be a significant challenge to think beyond these sub-disciplines and identify a short list of "big" questions driving the field as a whole.  The present study by the National Research Council would seek to overcome this challenge by careful choice of a committee of experts in the solid Earth science and related disciplines.  Committee members will be well-respected individuals who have a reputation of thinking broadly and beyond their individual specialties.  Some will be members of the National Academy of Sciences.  Others will be young scientists (including members of under-represented groups) with new ideas on how the field should evolve.  A science writer will be included to ensure that the results are understandable to scientists outside of the field as well as to the interested public. This activity is aimed at communicating the excitement of basic research in the solid-Earth sciences to non-specialists, including members of Congress and the general public. The research questions driving the field are broad, and require a strong program of basic research to be answered.  If the questions can be stated in an inspiring way and with a minimum of jargon, they may help attract students to the field and/or assist agency managers to describe and promote their Earth-science programs to Congress, the administration, and the public.   This action, combined with wide print and electronic dissemination of the NRC report, could ultimately lead to increased visibility of the field.</AbstractNarration>
