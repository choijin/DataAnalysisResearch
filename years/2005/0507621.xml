    <AbstractNarration>AST-0507621&lt;br/&gt;Terrence Rettig&lt;br/&gt;University of Notre Dame&lt;br/&gt;Structure of Exoplanetary Atmospheres&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Experimental and analytical tools will be developed to detect and characterize exoplanetary&lt;br/&gt;atmospheres during transits. Particular attention will be paid to HD 209458B (for which only atomic&lt;br/&gt;species have been observed to date) and the detection of infrared H3 molecular absorption lines&lt;br/&gt;using high resolution high signal-to-noise near infrared spectroscopy. As one of the dominant&lt;br/&gt;regulators of thermal balance in gas giant ionospheres, this molecule is of interest as a diagnostic of&lt;br/&gt;the atmospheric interface and will yield valuable information on the thermodynamic conditions in&lt;br/&gt;the outer atmosphere. Analysis and statistical modeling of molecular absorption lines of H3 will&lt;br/&gt;enable a direct probe of the temperature, column density and structure of the thermosphere of Hot&lt;br/&gt;Jupiters and constrain current models. To meet the project goals, sophisticated data reduction and&lt;br/&gt;analysis methods will also be formulated and employed.&lt;br/&gt;The work here will provide input into the design and development of future instruments for the&lt;br/&gt;detection of molecular absorption in exoplanetary atmospheres. The algorithms developed here will&lt;br/&gt;also be made publicly available. Graduate students and undergraduates (through the NSF sponsored&lt;br/&gt;Research Experiences for Undergraduates at Notre Dame) will play a significant role in the research&lt;br/&gt;and subsequent dissemination.</AbstractNarration>
