<AbstractNarration>Over the past two decades, low dimensional topology has seen a great&lt;br/&gt;deal of studies in two types of invariants: gauge theory type invariants &lt;br/&gt;in dimension four and combinatorial type invariants in dimension three.  &lt;br/&gt;While both sides have deep connections with physics, they share little &lt;br/&gt;common techniques and have rather different flavors. This picture could &lt;br/&gt;change though, with recent work due to Khovanov and Ozsvath-Szabo.&lt;br/&gt;In 1999, Khovanov introduced a graded homology theory for knots,&lt;br/&gt;and proved that its graded Euler characteristic is the Jones polynomial.&lt;br/&gt;This has turned out to be a far reaching generalization of the Jones &lt;br/&gt;polynomial.  Furthermore, there is strong evidence that Khovanov theory, &lt;br/&gt;along with the Ozsvath-Szabo theory, could bridge the connection between &lt;br/&gt;gauge theory type and combinatorial type invariants.&lt;br/&gt;Motivated by Khovanov's work, the PI, with his student Laure &lt;br/&gt;Helme-Guizon, has established a graded homology theory for graphs which &lt;br/&gt;yields the chromatic polynomial when taking Euler characteristic. &lt;br/&gt;The PI intends to further his investigation on these homology theories, &lt;br/&gt;both for knots and for graphs. Some of the specific problems are: &lt;br/&gt;understanding their geometric meanings, studying their behavior under &lt;br/&gt;various cut and paste operations, constructing homology theories for &lt;br/&gt;various other polynomials of knots and graphs, and investigating &lt;br/&gt;relations with other invariants in low dimensional topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low dimensional topology studies the shapes of three and four dimensional &lt;br/&gt;spaces. These dimensions are of particular interests to mankind because &lt;br/&gt;of the dimensions of our space and our space-time.  A specific subfield &lt;br/&gt;in low dimensional topology is knot theory, which studies the knottedness &lt;br/&gt;in our three dimensional space. Knots are worthwhile to study not only &lt;br/&gt;because they are fundamental in 3-dimensional spatial structure, but &lt;br/&gt;also because of its connection to areas outside mathematics. For example, &lt;br/&gt;biochemists have discovered knotted DNA molecule (1980s) and knotted &lt;br/&gt;proteins (2004). It is also intimately related to the study of graph &lt;br/&gt;theory, an area interesting to mathematicians, computer scientists, and &lt;br/&gt;others. Over the past two decades, there have been a flourish of new &lt;br/&gt;invariants in low dimensional topology, boosted by ideas from gauge theory, &lt;br/&gt;quantum algebras, and mathematical physics.  In particular, a new &lt;br/&gt;invariant for knots, developed by Khovanov using ideas in homological &lt;br/&gt;algebra, has sparked a great deal of interest recently. An analogous &lt;br/&gt;theory for graphs has since been developed by the PI and his student. &lt;br/&gt;This project aims to investigate these new invariants, with a particular &lt;br/&gt;emphasis on the homological algebra methods for knots and graphs.</AbstractNarration>
