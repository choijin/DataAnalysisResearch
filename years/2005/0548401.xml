<AbstractNarration>Following a four-year self-study to explore equity, diversity, and inclusiveness, UNC Charlotte is poised for transformation into an institution where all faculty perceive that access to power, rewards, promotions, and leadership opportunities are equitably distributed.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project goals are focused on the recruitment, retention, and advancement of women in STEM faculty positions and women in university-wide leadership positions. Strategies for change focus on structural reform, broad faculty awareness and engagement, and decision-maker accountability. A Faculty Affairs Office (FAO) will serve as a sustainable structural focal point for policy revision and a portfolio of programs designed to foster awareness, seek solutions, and disseminate project actions and outcomes. A competitive awards program will engage academic units to examine the status of women, including women faculty of color, and develop creative approaches for the specific needs of the unit. The FAO will be located in the Provost's Office to facilitate administrative accountability for making gains towards ADVANCE goals.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Through five-year grant period and no-cost extensions, the FADO has completed important initiatives and transitioned from a grant-funded to institution-funded office. The institutionalization of the UNC Charlotte ADVANCE FADO will continue facilitating recruitment and growth of UNC Charlotte?s diverse faculty.  The focus of UNC Charlotte ADVANCE FADO is based on five primary goals:  Goal 1: Recruitment: To increase the number of female faculty - including women of color - interviewed and hired in STEM disciplines at all ranks.  Goal 2: Retention and Advancement: To increase the number of female faculty, including women of color, retained and promoted in STEM disciplines at all ranks.      Goal 3: Climate: To improve and ensure gender equity in salary, workload, resource allocations, and recognition at the university.  Goal 4: Institutional Transformation: To catalyze organizational change that will intentionally attract, retain, support and advance women in STEM disciplines.  Goal 5: Dissemination: To communicate resources, findings and best practices of gender equity recruiting, retention, and climate initiatives, particularly among STEM disciplines  Programming to produce positive changes in line with these goals have included:      Program    Participants since beginning      Faculty Recruitment Training (2007  Present)       342      New Faculty Mentoring Initiative  (2007 &ndash; Present)    125      Mid-Career Mentoring Initiative (2008-Present)    69 associate professors      Faculty Forum (2008 to present)    86 associate professors      New Faculty Orientation (2012 &ndash; Present)    43      New Faculty Transitions (2009 - Present)    81      COACh Workshops (2009 &ndash; Present)    166      Leadership (2007 - Present)    137      New Chairs Orientation (2009 &ndash; Present)    44      Chair Development Programs (2009 - present)    133      Bonnie Cone Fellowships (2007-2012)       2006-2008:  18 grants to female junior STEM faculty  2008-2009:  6 grants  2009-2010: 7 grants  2010-2011: 6 grants to female junior STEM faculty      Solutions Team Awards (2007 &ndash; 2009)    2 awards      Climate Survey    Alternate years         ADVANCE FADO programming has positively impacted culture and climate for women at UNCC.
