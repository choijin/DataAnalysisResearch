<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history is hurricane Katrina which made&lt;br/&gt;landfall on August 29, 2005 at 7:10 a.m. in Plaquemines Parish, LA. Tragically, Katrina&lt;br/&gt;caused widespread damage and loss of life in several states but has also provided an&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to collect data which may be useful for design engineers and building code&lt;br/&gt;officials in order to design safe and strong buildings in the future. The objective of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed study is to gather and process perishable data on residential woodframe&lt;br/&gt;structures in non-flooded regions of Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi that can&lt;br/&gt;be used by the research and design code development community to improve the&lt;br/&gt;performance of woodframe structures to strong wind (lateral) loading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) proposal is requesting funding to&lt;br/&gt;support the acquisition of perishable data on damage to and performance of woodframe&lt;br/&gt;structures immediately following hurricane Katrina by a multi-institutional post-disaster&lt;br/&gt;team made up of members from academia and industry. Such data is perishable in that&lt;br/&gt;once repairs begin and clearing of woodframe debris is underway it is no longer available&lt;br/&gt;to the engineering community in order that we may learn how to improve the&lt;br/&gt;performance of woodframe structures during very high winds. The vast majority of the&lt;br/&gt;residential building stock in the U.S. is light-frame, or woodframe, construction including&lt;br/&gt;the affected areas in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds requested for this SGER grant will be used for (1) travel to and around the&lt;br/&gt;affected area in mid to late September for the post-disaster team of structural wood and&lt;br/&gt;wind experts, and specifically to (2) record damage to residential woodframe structures&lt;br/&gt;for 4 days systematically working from the edge of the hurricane path and inland toward&lt;br/&gt;the coast. A small amount of support costs is also requested for materials such as film,&lt;br/&gt;gasoline, etc. No personnel time is requested, and only minimal travel-related&lt;br/&gt;expenses for the university team members are being requested. All industry&lt;br/&gt;personnel participating with the team have agreed to pay their own expenses. These&lt;br/&gt;include the "APA-The Engineered Wood Association" team organized by the APA Vice&lt;br/&gt;President Tom Williamson and Steven Pryor, the lateral force resisting systems manager&lt;br/&gt;at Simpson Strong Tie. Thus the proposed effort is a collaboration of academics, code&lt;br/&gt;developers, professional engineers, and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed SGER project will be mainly the use of real-time&lt;br/&gt;GIS applications, correlation of severe and moderate wind damage with NOAA wind&lt;br/&gt;speed data, the later of which will help with development of performance-based wind&lt;br/&gt;engineering concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed research includes the dissemination of data that&lt;br/&gt;can be used to improve the performance of woodframe structures through design code&lt;br/&gt;development, thus decreasing risk to families living in woodframe houses, as well as reducing damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
