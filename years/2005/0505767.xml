    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0505767&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Anda Degeratu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variety of questions in geometry arise from&lt;br/&gt;physics. Consistency requirements in superstring theory suggest&lt;br/&gt;that we live in a 10-dimensional world, where the extra six&lt;br/&gt;dimensions must take the shape of a Calabi-Yau geometry. For the&lt;br/&gt;past 20 years, this has led to a tremendous effort on the part of&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians and physicists to understand Calabi-Yau spaces,&lt;br/&gt;and the various questions which emerge from their role in string&lt;br/&gt;theory. On the other hand, more classical areas of physics such&lt;br/&gt;as general relativity continue to motivate interesting questions&lt;br/&gt;in Riemannian geometry. In particular, extending the Positive&lt;br/&gt;Mass Conjecture has important implications for geometric analysis&lt;br/&gt;and string theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first two projects in this proposal examine the geometry of&lt;br/&gt;Calabi-Yau spaces. In studying such objects, one has to take into&lt;br/&gt;consideration singular Calabi-Yaus. One way to deal with&lt;br/&gt;singularities is to resolve them. As a result, the geometrical&lt;br/&gt;structure undergoes changes. The goal of the first research&lt;br/&gt;project is to give a complete characterization of the changes&lt;br/&gt;which can occur under crepant resolutions. In contrast to more&lt;br/&gt;traditional algebraic methods, the proposed techniques for this&lt;br/&gt;study involve an interplay between algebraic and analytical&lt;br/&gt;methods. Another way to deal with Calabi-Yau singularities is to&lt;br/&gt;analyze them from the perspective of various string theory&lt;br/&gt;dualities. In the second project, the PI proposes to study the&lt;br/&gt;taxonomy of Calabi-Yau spaces for which heterotic/F-theory&lt;br/&gt;dualities hold. Along the way, it is hoped that this study will&lt;br/&gt;give a geometrical interpretation to a new conjecture of McKay&lt;br/&gt;which relates the exceptional simply-laced Dynkin diagrams to the&lt;br/&gt;Monster group and its offspring. The focus of the third project&lt;br/&gt;is the Positive Mass Conjecture. In the context of general&lt;br/&gt;relativity it has been proved that the total mass of an isolated&lt;br/&gt;system is never negative, provided that the sources of the&lt;br/&gt;gravitational field consist of matter with nonnegative local mass&lt;br/&gt;density and that spacetime is asymptotically flat. Witten's proof&lt;br/&gt;is based on the analysis of the Dirac operator along&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional spacelike submanifolds in spacetime. The goal&lt;br/&gt;of this research is to extend Witten's approach to prove the&lt;br/&gt;Positive Mass Conjecture in any dimension, in particular for&lt;br/&gt;non-spin manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To summarize, an assortment of questions in mathematics lie at&lt;br/&gt;the interface between geometry and physics. This proposal focuses&lt;br/&gt;on geometry problems which do not fit nicely into one particular&lt;br/&gt;field, but require a variety of techniques from different&lt;br/&gt;branches of geometry. Many of these problems come from physics,&lt;br/&gt;where ad-hoc methods need further development.</AbstractNarration>
