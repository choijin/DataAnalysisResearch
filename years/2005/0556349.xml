<AbstractNarration>The University of New Mexico's branch campus in Gallup, New Mexico (NM) is located within the Four Corners region, an area of abundant uranium (U) ore deposits.   The PI and her students will study how the diverse sedimentary rocks in this semi-arid landscape contribute to background levels of radionuclides, including metallic radioactive isotopes, in airborne particulates, soils, and water and how extraction, processing, transport, and disposal of radioactive material and waste may contribute to concentrations of potentially harmful levels in the environment.  They will test rocks, sediments, soils, water, and plants for radiation concentrations through the use of a sensitive liquid scintillation counter.  They will test specific areas of concern in the field for anomalously high radiation levels using hand-held Geiger counters. The Four Corners region, which includes the Gallup area and the adjacent Grants Mineral District, is the site of many historic U prospects, mines, mills, and remediated and unremediated tailings piles, and hosts more than 40% of current U.S. uranium reserves. Trace-element and radionuclide concentrations in this district are also of very significant environmental concern to local residents. The college has a very unique population of 2600 students, 88% of which are minorities.  The student body is composed of 77.3% Native American students, the largest such population of any U.S. university.  The majority of the students come from the Navajo and Zuni Reservations in the Four Corners area, and typically have had very limited exposure to math and science prior to attending college.  In order to engage these students in scientific professions, the research will be integrated into geology, chemistry, natural science, and environmental science classes.  The instruments provided through this award will allow involvement of the students in projects that encourage participation from the initial planning and sampling stages, through sample preparation and analyses, to data collection and interpretation, and finally written and graphical presentations.  The PI will also employ the instruments in projects in environmental geology, chemistry, geochemistry, and biochemistry that have direct, relevant and significant importance to the population.  These projects would include sampling soils, sediments, ground and surface water, plants and livestock for environmental pollution which may be related to elevated background levels of U, extraction and processing of U, or to disposal of mine waste and accidental releases of radionuclides in the area. Early involvement by students in research projects related to problems impacting the reservation and its families are effective tools in encouraging students to pursue science education.</AbstractNarration>
