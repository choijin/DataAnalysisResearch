<AbstractNarration>The effects of depositing large amounts of energy into matter within an ultra-short time window, which is the key process in high-energy-density physics, are intimately related to the wavelength of the light carrying the energy. At the most fundamental level the interaction of an isolated atom with an intense electromagnetic field is the building block for future advances and thus a major thrust area in modern atomic, molecular and optical physics. At the same time, the interaction of an intense pulse with bulk matter poses more complexity but has far-reaching impact for everyday life, e.g. energy production, medicine and national security. The rapid progress of science and technology in high-energy-density physics has evolved into a symbiotic relationship where new discoveries fuel the need for additional technology and innovative laser concepts open the path to unexpected physical behavior. This project specifically addresses the technology needs for driving these new scientific developments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The beginning of the 21st century marks the emergence of a novel hybrid laser architecture, optical parametric chirppulse amplification (OPCPA). OPCPA represents a quantum jump in ultra-fast amplifier technology that will have an equivalent scientific impact to that of chirp-pulsed amplification (CPA). This project will develop a unique ultra-fast mid-infrared OPCPA facility operating at 2 micron wavelength at Ohio State University. This represents the first OPCPA university-based program in the US and the first TWOPCPA (TeraWatt Optical Parametric Chirppulse Amplification) system operating at 2 micron. This unique system will open new opportunities in strong-field science that will be enabled by an intense long-wavelength source. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OPCPA system is designed to have maximum impact on the science interests of a number of faculty at the university while providing cutting edge laser development that extends beyond a specific institutional bound. The proposed 2 micron OPCPA will have a high-average power kilohertz section for addressing important problems in strong-field atomic physics while providing a superior driver for generating high harmonics in the x-ray regime and the production of unprecedented attosecond pulse durations. The kilohertz section will also serve as a preamplifier for a 10 Hz high-powered (10 TeraWatt) OPCPA section for performing investigations in the relativistic regime of intense laser-atom interaction and high-energy-density physics studies in bulk material. Furthermore, the design will allow simultaneous usage of both sections for science application. This facility should allow the university to become a national center of excellence in the development of new technologies for the next generation of ultra-fast studies, as well as the destination school for training in high-energy-density physics and Inertial Confinement Energy. The facility will have a lasting influence on scholarship and teaching traditions within physics at the university. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
