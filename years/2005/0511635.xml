<AbstractNarration>Electrical Engineering (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to improve the electrical engineering (EE) student experience in the systems area: signal processing, communications and control. The goals are to enhance student learning of theory and connections to practice, to increase interest in EE and in the systems area and foster diversity in the student body, and to expand student participation in cross-disciplinary projects. The general approach involves introducing collaborative lab experiences and team projects based on realistic applications, and to include cross-disciplinary and remote collaboration. Since today's undergraduates are increasingly familiar with technologies such as digital music, photography, and video from everyday life, early and pervasive connection to the technology can aid in understanding of fundamental theoretical concepts. Thus, the program will embrace cutting-edge technology, both in terms of exposure of students to applications and in the use of this technology in teaching.  The specific plans impact the undergraduate curriculum at three levels: development of a new freshman introductory EE course, revision of an existing EE core course in signals and systems, and expansion of senior capstone design opportunities. Necessarily, the course developments will involve improvements to laboratory equipment used in teaching, as well as development of new course materials and teaching strategies. The proposed curriculum developments build on specific course material developed elsewhere, as well as results in the literature on collaborative learning. The evaluation of the proposed work with respect to the learning objectives and diversity goals will include both formative and summative efforts, including standard course evaluation forms, focus groups, attitude surveys, analysis of students' responses to specific exam questions, and quantitative analysis of inter-student classroom interactions, being conducted with assistance form the college's center for learning and teaching.  Dissemination is being accomplished through the Connections website, a site that hosts course modules, and through presentations and papers at both education and technical conferences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
