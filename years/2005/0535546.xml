<AbstractNarration>The focus of this conference, which is being organized by the American Society of Plant Biologists, will be on the nature and mechanisms of genetic variation and their effects on evolution of plant form and function, as well as on plant speciation and crop domestication. The proposed meeting is intended to bring together scientists working on a number of different areas, from population genetics and evolutionary genomics to chromosome biology, epigenetics and developmental biology, to achieve a synthesis of ideas and approaches. There will be seven sessions of oral presentations on the following topics: Evolutionary Genetics and Genomics, Origin of Genetic Variation, Epigenetics and Epigenomics, Chromosome Dynamics, Genetic Mechanisms in Plant Development, Genetic Mechanisms in Plant-Microbe Interactions. In addition, there will be poster sessions and a keynote lecture. The number of participants will be limited to 250, with the expectation that a high percentage of these will be graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Poster sessions and talks selected from abstracts will provide opportunities for students, postdoctoral fellows and young investigators to present their own research. The secluded setting and schedule are designed to facilitate ongoing interaction between presenters and attendees. All meals will be on-site and the invited speakers will be in attendance throughout the entire meeting. The funds requested will be used exclusively to support the registration costs of students, postdocs and young investigators. Therefore, it is expected that this gathering will provide a unique opportunity for young researchers to learn about the latest developments in this rapidly growing research area and to interact and exchange ideas with leading researchers for the duration of the conference.</AbstractNarration>
