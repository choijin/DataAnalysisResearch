<AbstractNarration>Minmax relations for graphs&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graph is a mathematical model for various networks, including&lt;br/&gt;communication networks, transportation networks, and social networks. Many&lt;br/&gt;important network parameters, like the capability, flexibility, and&lt;br/&gt;reliability, are often very difficult to compute. The goal of this project&lt;br/&gt;is to identify graphs for which some of these parameters are efficiently&lt;br/&gt;computable. To accomplish this, the PI proposes to study the structure of&lt;br/&gt;optimal solutions. These structural results are fundamentally important&lt;br/&gt;and they will have numerous applications on computing many related graph&lt;br/&gt;parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To be precise, the PI proposes to study the following three fundamental&lt;br/&gt;problems in combinatorial optimization:&lt;br/&gt;      1. To characterize graphs for which the clutter of (edge-sets of)&lt;br/&gt;         odd st-paths is ideal/Mengerian. This problem generalizes the&lt;br/&gt;         ordinary matching problem as well as the ordinary edge-disjoint&lt;br/&gt;         paths problem.&lt;br/&gt;      2. To characterize graphs for which the clutter of (vertex-set of)&lt;br/&gt;         odd circuits is ideal/Mengerian. This is a problem very closely&lt;br/&gt;         related to the t-perfect graph problem, which arises naturally&lt;br/&gt;         in the study of stable sets in graphs. One of the goals of this&lt;br/&gt;         project is to discover the connections between these two&lt;br/&gt;         problems.&lt;br/&gt;      3. To characterize perfectly 2-edge-connected graphs. This is a&lt;br/&gt;         problem originated from the study of the Traveling Salesman&lt;br/&gt;         Problem. One of its attractive properties is that being&lt;br/&gt;         perfectly 2-edge-connected is preserved under the "dual" of the&lt;br/&gt;         induced-minor relation, which is a graph containment relation&lt;br/&gt;         preserved by many important graph properties.&lt;br/&gt;All the proposed problems are fundamental and attractive. They resemble&lt;br/&gt;the perfect graph problem in many ways: they all involve beautiful minmax&lt;br/&gt;relations, they all have polyhedral and algorithmic implications, and they&lt;br/&gt;all generalize many known results.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
