<AbstractNarration>This award to Charles Drain of Hunter College has as its goal to develop the supramolecular chemistry of porphyrinoids.  Porphyrins, phthalocyanines and porphyrazines are part of a family of ring systems referred to as porphyrinoids. They are very robust with a broad range of physical, chemical, and photonic properties that can be fine-tuned in a number of different ways and as a result are ideal for materials in real-world applications.  Materials containing multiple types of these ring systems will be constructed and there will be special emphasis on the 3-dimensional structures of these systems.  The PI has proposed three research objectives: self-assembly of heterogeneous mixtures of porphyrinoids, self-organization of porphyrinoids into colloids and films, and deposition of self-assembled arrays and self-organized nanoparticles on selected surfaces. The photonic properties of these materials will be examined and this will allow study of the fundamental principles of self-organization and self-assembly of multiple components into multifunctional hierarchical systems. Ultimately, this will lead to a better understanding of these processes in natural systems, and will afford a roadmap for the construction of complex supramolecular materials with designed functionality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. In addition to the benefit of the science, the PI will train students using a "vertically integrated" approach where the students will each examine a problem from beginning to end.  This includes synthesis, characterization, surface science and evaluation allowing for the students to be extremely broadly trained.  Further, the PI will bring students from underrepresented groups, including both women and minorities, into the research setting.  The PI has a vigorous, proactive recruiting program for minority students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
