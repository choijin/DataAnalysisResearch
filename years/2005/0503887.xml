<AbstractNarration>     The Ginzburg-Landau model serves as a basic paradigm for a&lt;br/&gt;broad spectrum of subjects in pattern-forming systems in general&lt;br/&gt;and in superconductivity in particular.  The investigator studies&lt;br/&gt;several fundamental theoretical problems related to this model. &lt;br/&gt;Some of the specific problems that he examines lie at the heart of&lt;br/&gt;the Ginzburg-Landau formalism.  These include the understanding of&lt;br/&gt;time-dependent formulation and of thermal fluctuations, together&lt;br/&gt;with the elucidation of the behavior of superconductors near the&lt;br/&gt;sample's boundary.  Other problems studied are related to&lt;br/&gt;transport phenomena in thin wires with Joesphson junctions.  Such&lt;br/&gt;structures are crucial in several basic superconducting devices. &lt;br/&gt;The investigator suggests a research direction that leads to the&lt;br/&gt;introduction of novel junctions.  Finally, he analyzes the&lt;br/&gt;existence of stable patterns in different systems (including&lt;br/&gt;liquid crystals and superconductors with impurities) where the&lt;br/&gt;stability is not generated by an acting external force, but by the&lt;br/&gt;topology of the sample. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     One aspect of the project is to enhance the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;understanding of superconductivity.  A second aspect of this&lt;br/&gt;project is to study transport in extremely narrow networks.  While&lt;br/&gt;the main motivation is to consider such transport processes in&lt;br/&gt;superconductors, these types of problems are relevant to many&lt;br/&gt;areas.  For example, quantum wires are among the current leading&lt;br/&gt;models for quantum computers, microchannel chips are developing&lt;br/&gt;into fast and efficient tools in chemical analysis, etc.  The work&lt;br/&gt;in this area will have an impact on certain directions in&lt;br/&gt;nanotechnology.  A major theme of the project is to exploit the&lt;br/&gt;similarity between the mathematical methods used in different&lt;br/&gt;applications, such as optics, liquid crystals, and&lt;br/&gt;superconductivity, in order to apply techniques developed in one&lt;br/&gt;of these areas to another one.</AbstractNarration>
