<AbstractNarration>CMS 0547471&lt;br/&gt;CAREER:  An Integrated Framework for Infrastructure Management: Exploiting Advanced Inspection Technologies to Support Condition Assessment, Forecasting and Decision-Making &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pablo L. Durango-Cohen, Northwestern University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses the development of an integrated analytical framework to support the management of infrastructure systems.  The research approach recognizes the complex nature of the management process, and provides a comprehensive, system-level framework to simultaneously address data processing, performance and optimization modeling.  The research links a general class of sophisticated optimization tools (stochastic optimal control theory) with rigorous statistical methods (state-space specifications of time series models).  This integration allows the proposed framework to serve as a practical tool exploit the extensive capabilities of advanced inspection technologies to support management needs, as well as to aid in the selection and deployment of inspection technologies. The research consists of the formulation and estimation of state-space specifications of time series models to support condition assessment and forecasting, and the formulation and analysis of optimization models to support maintenance and rehabilitation decision-making.  The development of state-space specifications of time series models represents a significant contribution to study infrastructure deterioration and inspection.  These models provide an innovative approach to study the effect of factors related to location, environment, design and construction, traffic volume and mix, and maintenance activities on the performance of infrastructure systems.  The seamless link with the optimization component means that the framework can then be used to evaluate and optimize decisions that determine these exogenous factors based on economic criteria.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of effective and efficient policies to allocate resources for the preservation and improvement of civil infrastructure, e.g., pavement networks, is crucial to the nations continued social and economic prosperity and growth. This is due to both the far-reaching and serious negative impacts of deteriorating/deficient infrastructure, as well as the scale of management expenditures, which are on the order of tens of billions of dollars per year.  The proposed research is motivated by advances in sensing and communications/information technologies that have resulted in the proliferation of sophisticated instruments to evaluate and measure infrastructure condition and the factors that cause its degradation, and by the need to address fundamental computational and statistical challenges in order exploit the abundance and breadth of newly available information.  The proposed research is one facet of a long-term, large-scale effort to develop modeling, analysis and methods of control that can be applied to networks in fields as diverse as telecommunications and logistics.  In addition, the proposal describes how the research efforts will be integrated into an educational plan aimed at bridging the gap that separates academic research from state-of-the-art practice through the development and dissemination of educational materials, outreach and student research involvement, and efforts to build diversity in engineering.  A noteworthy feature of the proposed plan is to build on established collaborations with transportation agencies and leading service providers in order to ensure that the research and educational activities address significant problems, as well as to ensure that the results are practical and implementable.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
