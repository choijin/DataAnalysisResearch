<AbstractNarration>The project focuses on the development of a mathematical foundation&lt;br/&gt;for interaction-based computer simulations that can be &lt;br/&gt;represented as deterministic, discrete-time dynamical systems on&lt;br/&gt;finite state sets.  Here, an interaction-based simulation is&lt;br/&gt;considered to be a collection of variables, each equipped with an &lt;br/&gt;update function or a set of rules which is used to compute the state&lt;br/&gt;of that variable at the next time step, based on the states of all&lt;br/&gt;the other variables.  Thus, the description of the system is given&lt;br/&gt;via local interactions, and global dynamics is generated through&lt;br/&gt;the simultaneous iteration of all local update functions.  Cellular automata&lt;br/&gt;and Boolean networks are examples such simulations.  An important&lt;br/&gt;question, that has been studied extensively in the framework of&lt;br/&gt;cellular automata is how one can predict global dynamical features of&lt;br/&gt;such systems from the structure of the local update functions.  &lt;br/&gt;By assuming that the state set for each variable is a finite field,&lt;br/&gt;such as the field with two elements used typically for cellular&lt;br/&gt;automata,this problem can be addressed within the framework of computational&lt;br/&gt;algebra.  The algorithms developed in this project will become part of&lt;br/&gt;a symbolic computation software package for finite dynamical systems,&lt;br/&gt;implemented in the computer algebra system Macaulay2.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interaction-based simulation is becoming increasingly important in the&lt;br/&gt;analysis of large biological, epidemiological, and socio-technical &lt;br/&gt;networks, such as the immune system, the spread of infectious diseases&lt;br/&gt;in urban areas, or road traffic and wireless communications networks.  &lt;br/&gt;Typically, such networks are understood at the level of individual&lt;br/&gt;interactions, but global information tends to be sparse.  The software&lt;br/&gt;design of such systems is very challenging, and so is the&lt;br/&gt;analysis of simulation output, due to the size and complexity of the&lt;br/&gt;simulated systems.  A mathematical foundation for such simulations&lt;br/&gt;will provide tools for the design of large-scale simulations.  It&lt;br/&gt;will also help to systematically answer questions about&lt;br/&gt;biological and other systems, such as optimal ways to treat infectious &lt;br/&gt;diseases,or how to contain their spread in large populations.</AbstractNarration>
