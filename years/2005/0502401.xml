<AbstractNarration> The goal of this project is to enhance the education of students &lt;br/&gt;in the areas of geometry and topology at Stanford by providing them with &lt;br/&gt;interactive forums in which to broaden their knowledge and by providing &lt;br/&gt;them with the time, through financial support, to participate in those &lt;br/&gt;forums.  Stanford has a broad and active research group in geometry and &lt;br/&gt;topology with researchers in geometric analysis, differential geometry &lt;br/&gt;and minimal surfaces, symplectic geometry and topology, low-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;topology and hyperbolic geometry, geometric and algebraic topology, and &lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry.  Aside from the breadth of fields covered, the &lt;br/&gt;Stanford research group in geometry and topology  is connected by a &lt;br/&gt;network of overlapping interests and activities.  The purpose of this &lt;br/&gt;project is to attract students into this group and to allow them to more &lt;br/&gt;fully benefit from the broad expertise it represents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In order to facilitate the interaction between students and &lt;br/&gt;faculty representing these varied interests, specific seminars are &lt;br/&gt;planned.  These will be run by senior faculty members and will involve &lt;br/&gt;graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and, in some cases, advanced &lt;br/&gt;undergraduates, who are interested in these fields.   Examples of such &lt;br/&gt;seminars include the following:&lt;br/&gt;1) Classics seminar:  Students will present, under the supervision of a &lt;br/&gt;faculty member, various ``classical papers" that transformed their &lt;br/&gt;respective areas of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;2) Progress seminar:  More advanced graduate students and postdoctoral &lt;br/&gt;researchers will discuss their work in detail, as they are working on it.&lt;br/&gt;3) Physics for mathematicians seminar: Geometry/topology students will study &lt;br/&gt;a relevant area of Physics under the joint supervision of the Mathematics &lt;br/&gt;and Physics faculty.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is designed to bring more US citizens/permanent &lt;br/&gt;residents to the Stanford graduate program in mathematics.  Special &lt;br/&gt;attention will be given to attracting more women and minorities to the &lt;br/&gt;program. The activities proposed here should also increase the size and &lt;br/&gt;improve the quality of the pool of Stanford undergraduates who go to &lt;br/&gt;graduate programs at US universities; the majority of these students &lt;br/&gt;are US citizens or permanent residents.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
