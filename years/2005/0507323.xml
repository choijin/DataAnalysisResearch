<AbstractNarration>AST-0507323&lt;br/&gt;Sellwood&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lambda cold dark matter (LCDM) model currently enjoys great success in accounting for most aspects of the large-scale structure of the universe, although it still faces difficulties on smaller scales.  This project will address many of the issues that currently frustrate a direct comparison between the observed properties of galaxy halos and the predictions from LCDM.  Barred galaxies are essential for this study, since the non-axisymmetric forces exerted by the bar affect the dynamics of the gas and of the dark matter, enabling much more information to be extracted than is possible from nearly axisymmetric systems.  The research includes analysis of new integral-field velocity maps for a range of morphological types of barred galaxy, to be made with the Southern African Large Telescope, and new theoretical work on dynamical friction in barred galaxies.  This will sharpen the confrontation between theory and observation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work includes front-line research experiences for students, both in the US and in South Africa, and including under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
