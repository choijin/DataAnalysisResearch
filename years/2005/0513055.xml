<AbstractNarration>This project is designed to investigate the contribution of biomass and biofuel burning to the overall air quality of Mexico City as part of the MIRAGE-Mex (Megacity Impact on Regional and Global Environment) campaign. Urban-rural sources of pollution will be characterized by deploying airborne and ground-based Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) trace gas measurement systems. The compounds measured by these systems include carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, ammonia, ozone, oxygenated volatile organic compounds, and hydrocarbons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To facilitate measurements of biomass burning sources, both forest and domestic fires, one of the FTIR systems will be mounted on a van for rapid deployment to off-road sources. Another FTIR is mounted on a cart and can be brought directly to the emission sources. Signature emission factors and emission ratios will be measured for these sources, while corresponding plume samples will be recorded from a small aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recorded emissions will be combined with available biofuel use inventories to create a new, speciated emissions inventory for cooking fires in the Mexico City area and nationwide. Integration with measurements in Zambia and Brazil will update the recommended emission factors for global biofuel use, and an improved assessment of the health effects of these fires will result from the first-ever comprehensive measurement of the emissions. The award will provide training opportunities for a postdoctoral associate, and enhance collaborations with a Mexican University.</AbstractNarration>
