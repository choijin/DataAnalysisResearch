    <AbstractNarration>The simulation of fluid flow in bones has received considerable attention &lt;br/&gt;in the field of biomechanics. Limited studies have been conducted up to &lt;br/&gt;date to investigate the deformation and fluid pressure of bone under well &lt;br/&gt;controlled conditions. A series of experimental studies is proposed to &lt;br/&gt;investigate the response of bone specimens under monotonic followed by &lt;br/&gt;cyclic loadings. In the experiment, the bone specimen is confined in a &lt;br/&gt;rubber membrane using an all-around pressure enclosed in a newly developed &lt;br/&gt;device. The induced deformation and fluid pressure are measured under &lt;br/&gt;drained and undrained conditions, respectively. The development of plastic &lt;br/&gt;strains and accumulated fluid pressure under cyclic loading will be &lt;br/&gt;revealed for different stress amplitudes and frequencies. The study is &lt;br/&gt;undertaken as a cross-disciplinary and cross-institutional research &lt;br/&gt;between applied mechanics (geomechanics) and medical science. The &lt;br/&gt;understanding of mechanisms of load-induced fluid flow would lead to a &lt;br/&gt;better interpretation of mechanosensory function in bones that has &lt;br/&gt;significant clinical implications.</AbstractNarration>
