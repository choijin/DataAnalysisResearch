<AbstractNarration>The study of Cambrian soft-bodied faunas has greatly enhanced our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;some key events in metazoan evolution. However, enigmas and incompletely described&lt;br/&gt;Cambrian Burgess Shale-type soft-bodied faunas still remain, as does the question of why and&lt;br/&gt;how Burgess Shale-type preservation occurs. The immediate objectives of the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;for which funding is requested are: 1) to prepare, describe, monograph, and fit into a&lt;br/&gt;phylogenetic and paleobiogeographic framework new taxa from the Middle Cambrian softbodied&lt;br/&gt;faunas of the Spence Member and the Wheeler and Marjum Formations using recent&lt;br/&gt;collections made from Utah; 2) to use microanalytical techniques to determine the taphonomy of&lt;br/&gt;the fossils at the specimen-level; and 3) to place the soft bodied organisms and the taphonomic&lt;br/&gt;processes involved in their preservation into a detailed paleoenvironmental framework using&lt;br/&gt;newly developed microstratigraphic techniques.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research is to address some enigmas in Cambrian&lt;br/&gt;paleontology and geology, allowing multiple objectives to be attained. First, identifying and&lt;br/&gt;characterizing the elements of the Utah faunas will help establish which taxa are shared between&lt;br/&gt;these formations and other Cambrian soft-bodied faunas distributed throughout the globe. Thus,&lt;br/&gt;the stratigraphic and geographic ranges of these species and genera can be determined. Second,&lt;br/&gt;in conjunction with pre-existing information, the phylogenetic relationships of the various&lt;br/&gt;arthropods in the Spence, Wheeler, and Marjum can be evaluated. These objectives will increase&lt;br/&gt;our understanding of Cambrian biogeography and also the nature and topology of important&lt;br/&gt;early episodes in animal evolution. Additionally, intensive taphonomic and microstratigraphic&lt;br/&gt;study of three of the principal Burgess Shale-type localities will lead to a refined understanding&lt;br/&gt;of the paleoenvironmental factors and taphonomic processes that controlled the preservation of&lt;br/&gt;Burgess Shale faunas in the Cambrian, and will contribute to our understanding of why this type&lt;br/&gt;of preservation is unique to the Cambrian. Due to the richness and significance of these poorlyknown&lt;br/&gt;faunas, the excellent exposure across the study areas and the relatively low metamorphic&lt;br/&gt;grade of mudstones hosting the soft-bodied faunas, this project also provides a rare opportunity&lt;br/&gt;to address phylogeny, paleoecology, and preservation in Burgess Shale-type deposits in an&lt;br/&gt;interrelated context.&lt;br/&gt;Some of the faunas that will be studied are in collections housed at the University of&lt;br/&gt;Kansas (KU), and they are accompanied by precise locality data. There is also an emeritus&lt;br/&gt;professor at the University of Kansas, Dick Robison, with significant expertise in areas related to&lt;br/&gt;this grant. Sue Halgedahl and Richard Jarrard, professors at the University of Utah, have also&lt;br/&gt;agreed to make their extensive collections of soft-bodied, Cambrian Burgess Shale-type faunas&lt;br/&gt;from Utah available to us for study; again, these are accompanied by precise locality data. Each&lt;br/&gt;of these factors will greatly facilitate this proposed research.&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, this project will contribute to the training of two graduate&lt;br/&gt;students, one at KU and one at the University of California, Riverside, who will participate in the&lt;br/&gt;proposed research activities and attend scientific meetings. Through the RUI program, this&lt;br/&gt;project will also contribute to the field and analytical training of multiple undergraduates from&lt;br/&gt;Pomona College, an undergraduate-only institution and member of the Keck geology&lt;br/&gt;consortium.</AbstractNarration>
