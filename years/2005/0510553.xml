<AbstractNarration>Funds for a four-year, third and final phase of a GPS-based study of the&lt;br/&gt;Colima-Jalisco region of western Mexico are requested. Since early 1995,&lt;br/&gt;two large magnitude earthquakes (M=8.0 and M=7.6) have ruptured the Middle&lt;br/&gt;America subduction interface directly offshore from a 30-station GPS network,&lt;br/&gt;most recently in January of 2003. These earthquakes have afforded an exceptional&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to study the coseismic and postseismic effects of large&lt;br/&gt;subduction earthquakes, including the gradual decay of postseismic fault&lt;br/&gt;afterslip and viscoelastic flow and re-emergence of interseismic elastic&lt;br/&gt;strain accumulation. Studying these earthquakes and their after effects&lt;br/&gt;have numerous intellectual merits, outlined below. Specific goals for&lt;br/&gt;the proposed project are as follows: (1) Continue annual measurements of the&lt;br/&gt;regional velocity field to characterize spatial variations in viscoelastic&lt;br/&gt;flow and afterslip triggered by the Mw=8.0 Oct. 9, 1995 Colima-Jalisco and&lt;br/&gt;M_w=7.6, 1.22.2003 Tecoman earthquakes, (2) Construct a six-station continuous&lt;br/&gt;GPS network to better characterize the temporal evolution of these viscoelastic&lt;br/&gt;and afterslip responses and better separate them from the underlying linear&lt;br/&gt;elastic strain accumulation. Continuous measurements will enable determine of&lt;br/&gt;whether the Cocos/Rivera subduction interfaces accommodate downdip transient&lt;br/&gt;aseismic slip events similar to those recently described for Cascadia, Japan,&lt;br/&gt;and southern Mexico. (3) Complete modeling of the coseismic and post-seismic&lt;br/&gt;effects of the 2003 Tecoman earthquake using existing and new observations,&lt;br/&gt;including a joint inversion of the geodetic and seismic constraints,&lt;br/&gt;collaborative analysis of local seismic data for aftershock relocations, and&lt;br/&gt;sensitivity analysis for our assumed elastic constants, layer thickness,&lt;br/&gt;and subduction interface geometry. (4) Employ measured variations in&lt;br/&gt;the direction and magnitude of interseismic strain accumulation to&lt;br/&gt;both estimate the degree of locking along the Rivera and Cocos plate&lt;br/&gt;subduction interfaces and relate onshore strain accumulation to&lt;br/&gt;the oceanic plate motion. (5) Determine how the 1995 Colima-Jalisco earthquake&lt;br/&gt;and subsequent processes altered stress levels in the adjacent Tecoman earthquake&lt;br/&gt;rupture zone. (6) Extract information about upper plate deformation associated&lt;br/&gt;with the continental rifts in our field area from GPS, seismic, and Shuttle&lt;br/&gt;Radar Topographic Mission data. As has been the case in previous stages of&lt;br/&gt;this project, the present phase of the project will have numerous broader impacts.&lt;br/&gt;Three Mexican scientists will participate as official collaborators: Osvaldo Sanchez&lt;br/&gt;of UNAM, Bertha Marquez of the Universidad de Guadalajara, and Gabriel Reyes of&lt;br/&gt;the University of Colima, as well as Mexican undergraduate and graduate students&lt;br/&gt;from three universities. In addition, support is requested for a UW graduate student&lt;br/&gt;to continue his finite element modeling of the geodetic data for his dissertation,&lt;br/&gt;a Caltech graduate student who will work with Gabriel Reyes on local seismic data,&lt;br/&gt;and two REU undergraduates who will work under Stock's guidance. Data from the new&lt;br/&gt;continuous sites will constitute a useful legacy for other investigators, particularly&lt;br/&gt;for detecting and characterizing transient signals related to aseismic slip along&lt;br/&gt;the subduction interface.</AbstractNarration>
