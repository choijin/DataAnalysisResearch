<AbstractNarration>This award supports three Frontiers of Engineering (FoE) Symposia through the National Academy of Engineering (NAE). The U.S. Frontiers of Engineering (September 22-24 in Niskayuna, NY) will cover the topics: Detection and Destruction of Pathogens, and Pure Water Technologies. The US FoE themes involve Engineering for Extreme Environments, Designer Materials, Multiscale Modeling, and Engineering and Entertainment. The German-American Frontiers of Engineering (May 5-7 in Potsdam, Germany) will be held in cooperation with the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation). The themes selected are Visual Communication, Air Transportation, Energy Byproducts: Control and Remediation Technologies, and Micro-reactors in Chemical Synthesis/Drug Development. The Japan-America Frontiers of Engineering Symposium (November 3-5, 2005 in San Jose, CA) will be jointly supported by the Engineering Academy of Japan and Japan Science and Technology Agency. The topics include Humanoid Robots, Semiconductor R&amp;D, Biotechnology: &lt;br/&gt;The FoE activity is designed to bring together select groups of engineers from industry, academia, and government labs to discuss pioneering technical work and leading edge research in various engineering fields and industry sectors. All in all about 100 outstanding young engineers, 30 from each country, will participate in the meeting. Speakers are asked to address issues such as what the frontiers in their field are; what experiments and prototypes are in progress; what new tools and instruments are available; what the major impediments to progress are; and what the theoretical, commercial, societal, and long-term significance of the work is. Invitees are accomplished engineers from both industry academia who have made recognized contributions to advancing the frontiers of engineering. The primary benefit of the workshop is that it fosters new interactions between the best junior U.S., Japanese, and German engineers from different fields and sectors. Today's most exciting and powerful engineering developments occur at the intersection of disciplines. By creating the opportunity for sharing of research insights and techniques across a range of fields, this workshop facilitates leaps in knowledge and applications that might otherwise take much longer to achieve.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
