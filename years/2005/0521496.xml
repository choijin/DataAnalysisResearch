<AbstractNarration>The need for research into the properties of nonlinear optical materials and education about them has never been greater. These materials have properties, such as absorption coefficient and index of refraction that depend upon the intensity of the light incident upon them. Applications of these materials, such as sensor protection and all-optical switching, are important for telecommunications and optical imaging systems. The many practical uses of nonlinear optical materials make an early introduction to their physics and chemistry all the more imperative to prepare today's students in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal consists of two complementary parts: experimental and computational. The experimental part of this work investigates the optical properties of nonlinear capillary waveguides and two-dimensional capillary waveguide arrays. These systems are potentially compatible with fiber optic devices, making this project particularly relevant. The waveguides and waveguide arrays are constructed from small, glass capillaries filled with nonlinear optical materials. The computational component of the proposal will contribute to a fundamental understanding of the electronic structure and properties of the nonlinear materials that are being considered in the design of these systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal represents an interdisciplinary, collaborative effort that is being undertaken at Pacific University. Pacific is a small, liberal arts institution that prides itself on the education of its students. The undergraduate student population is composed of 25% "first-generation" college students, 62% women, and nearly 20% from governmentally-recognized underrepresented groups, the majority of these students being Pacific Islanders. This investigation will serve as a model for these students of how collaborations between science disciplines can advance our fundamental understanding of nature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need for research into the properties of nonlinear optical materials and education about them has never been greater.
