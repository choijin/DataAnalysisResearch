<AbstractNarration>This conference is held at the University of Florida, from &lt;br/&gt;March 9th through the 11th, 2006.   It is referred to as Ord06/UF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is the ninth in a series initiated in 1998; these&lt;br/&gt;conferences have involved some aspect of Ordered Algebraic Structures. &lt;br/&gt;Ord06/UF concentrates on the role of frame theory in the subject. &lt;br/&gt;Ord06/UF, like its predecessors in the series, brings &lt;br/&gt;together 25 to 30 mathematicians from various parts of the globe, &lt;br/&gt;including graduate students and those who have recently received &lt;br/&gt;their PhD degrees. A published proceedings of Ord06/UF is planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For as long as there has been academic training of &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians, research and instruction have sought to abstract &lt;br/&gt;as a means towards understanding of the concrete and the particular. &lt;br/&gt;Thus, the arithmetical properties of numbers became abstracted to &lt;br/&gt;the theory of groups and rings, these being algebraic constructs &lt;br/&gt;invented to ``explain'' why the real numbers, for example, behave &lt;br/&gt;the way they do. Another school of researchers seized upon the &lt;br/&gt;geometric notion of distance between numbers or points in space to &lt;br/&gt;develop the abstract concept of a topological space, which establishes&lt;br/&gt;a sense of proximity without measurement of distance. In both of these &lt;br/&gt;generalizations the aim has consistently been to capture a greater &lt;br/&gt;catalogue of phenomena by the act of abstraction, and not to create &lt;br/&gt;an esoteric replica of the instance that prompted the abstraction. &lt;br/&gt;In this spirit the Ordered Algebraic Structurist has taken the &lt;br/&gt;natural ordering of real numbers, together with its arithmetical &lt;br/&gt;and topological aspects, and developed the lattice-ordered group &lt;br/&gt;and ring. The contributors to Ord06/UF, broadly, have in common &lt;br/&gt;an interest in how a lattice-ordered group may best be described by &lt;br/&gt;functions which take on most of their values in the real numbers, and &lt;br/&gt;in which features of the construct are carried over to the algebra of &lt;br/&gt;functions. In this tracking of properties, topological spaces and &lt;br/&gt;their generalization to frames have increasingly played an important &lt;br/&gt;role. The notion of an algebraic frame, in particular, has a dual &lt;br/&gt;identity, enabling one to simultaneously capture topological and &lt;br/&gt;arithmetical properties, and, moreover, how one set of properties &lt;br/&gt;influences the other.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
