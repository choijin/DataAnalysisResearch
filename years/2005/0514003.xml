<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0514003&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Jacob Sturm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main themes of this proposal - critical exponents of&lt;br/&gt;holomorphic functions, the Kaehler-Ricci flow, canonical metrics&lt;br/&gt;and stability of algebraic varieties, are well established in&lt;br/&gt;classical analysis and differential geometry, with fundamental&lt;br/&gt;results dating back to the nineteenth century. The principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator will continue his research with D.H. Phong in these&lt;br/&gt;areas: The first project will use techniques developed in earlier&lt;br/&gt;work to understand the critical exponent set (i.e., the set of&lt;br/&gt;log canonical thresholds) in n-dimensions. Of particular interest&lt;br/&gt;are the applications of this structure to problems in algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry. The second project concerns the Kaehler-Ricci flow, and&lt;br/&gt;addresses the convergence properties of this flow and the&lt;br/&gt;question of when the positivity of the Ricci curvature is&lt;br/&gt;preserved under the flow. The third project is motivated by the&lt;br/&gt;basic question: When can a Kaehler metric on a compact complex&lt;br/&gt;manifold be deformed into one of constant scalar curvature? It is&lt;br/&gt;believed that the key to this problem lies in the relationship&lt;br/&gt;between the finite geometry of the general linear group and the&lt;br/&gt;infinite geometry of the space of Kaehler metrics. Techniques&lt;br/&gt;from pluri-potential theory, developed in earlier work, will be&lt;br/&gt;applied to elucidate this relationship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The laws of nature are written in the language of mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;and conversely, much of the research in modern mathematics is&lt;br/&gt;spawned by fundamental discoveries in science. Prime examples of&lt;br/&gt;this interplay are seen in the theory of general relativity and&lt;br/&gt;in quantum field theory, which were derived with the help of the&lt;br/&gt;tensor calculus of differential geometry. On the other hand, the&lt;br/&gt;equations which govern our universe (which include the Einstein&lt;br/&gt;equation and the Yang-Mills equation) have a beautiful structure&lt;br/&gt;which, for some mysterious reason, has helped elucidate&lt;br/&gt;fundamental questions in abstract mathematics. The problems&lt;br/&gt;outlined in this proposal fall into this very productive and&lt;br/&gt;beautiful interplay between the understanding of our physical&lt;br/&gt;universe and the abstract realm of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
