<AbstractNarration>The Institute of Ecosystem Studies (IES) will offer an undergraduate research opportunity through the Ecology in Context program. Ten students will be selected to join the unique IES research community to carry out cutting-edge investigations of their own design, working closely with a mentor scientist. The program emphasizes the community nature of the scientific enterprise. As participants design and complete their independent research projects they consult with other scientists, present their plans for critique, and then speak in the annual Undergraduate Research Symposium and write a paper for the peer-reviewed on-line IES Occasional Publication. The program provides students many opportunities to reflect upon and think about the process of science and its place in the world, and to develop their skills in doing science. Through a case study of a regional environmental issue, a career forum, and a day spent teaching high school students from a nearby city; students explore the social, political, intellectual and personal dimensions of being an ecologist. The twelve-week program is open to undergraduate freshmen, sophomores, juniors or first semester seniors. Applicants must be citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or its possessions. Participants receive a stipend, a meal allowance, free housing, and assistance with travel to and from the program. More information is available at http://www.ecostudies.org/reu.html, or by contacting Heather L. Dahl (Coordinator) at (845) 677-7600 x326 or dahlh@ecostudies.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit  The program contributed to the field of ecology, with 65 peer reviewed publications over 26 years (9 in 2006-2010 plus 40 (74%) final papers for the Undergraduate Research Reports (http://www.caryinstitute.org/publications/307)).

David Seekell (2007), working      with Michael Pace, described long term warming trends in water      temperatures in the Hudson River and produced important publications in the      Journal of Environmental Monitoring and      Currents.   Jessica Vitale (2008) worked with William Schlesinger to analyze      local data on spring arrival of song birds and published in the Northeastern      Naturalist.

The 54 selected students was even more diverse, with 25% underrepresented minorities and 73% female.  Cary REU students have gone on to diverse post-undergraduate pursuits (Figure 5). We have information within 3 years for all but one of the 54 2006-2010 students; 32 (54%) were in or had completed graduate school (13 masters, 14 Ph.D. and 2 veterinary programs).
