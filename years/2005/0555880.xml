<AbstractNarration>The project focuses on the study of combinatorial structures arising&lt;br/&gt;in algebra and geometry, with an emphasis on the theory and applications&lt;br/&gt;of cluster algebras. Cluster algebras, discovered by the investigator in&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with A.Zelevinsky, are a class of commutative rings which&lt;br/&gt;have found applications in several mathematical disciplines, including&lt;br/&gt;representation theory, Teichmueller theory, discrete dynamical systems,&lt;br/&gt;total positivity, Lie theory, tropical geometry, and enumerative and&lt;br/&gt;geometric combinatorics. The investigator develops general structural&lt;br/&gt;theory of cluster algebras and related combinatorial constructions, and&lt;br/&gt;applies it to the study of concrete classes of cluster algebras arising&lt;br/&gt;in various applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original motivation for this project comes from several classical&lt;br/&gt;areas of mathematics listed above. The main tools come from combinatorics,&lt;br/&gt;including combinatorial topology, algebraic and geometric combinatorics, &lt;br/&gt;and the theory of root systems. Combinatorics deals with discrete objects &lt;br/&gt;such as finite sets, graphs, permutations, partial orders, etc. Many &lt;br/&gt;continuous phenomena allow for a discrete representation, lending &lt;br/&gt;themselves amenable to combinatorial methods of study. It is often the &lt;br/&gt;case that identical or similar combinatorial structures underlie &lt;br/&gt;seamingly unrelated mathematical entities, revealing hidden connections &lt;br/&gt;between them and allowing to transport insights and techniques from one &lt;br/&gt;discipline to another. One case in point is the theory of cluster &lt;br/&gt;algebras, which are the main focus of this project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
