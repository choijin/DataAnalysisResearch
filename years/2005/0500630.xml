    <AbstractNarration>Title: Ergodic Theory of Dynamical Systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes several research problems in Ergodic Theory of &lt;br/&gt;Dynamical Systems. The theory is in a period of great activity, fueled &lt;br/&gt;by both the necessary internal coherence and its many interactions with &lt;br/&gt;other domains of mathematics or of mathematical Physics. The projects &lt;br/&gt;anticipates developments on three topics. One is parabolic dynamics. The &lt;br/&gt;precise problems of interest here are the characterization of infinite &lt;br/&gt;invariant measures for horocyclic flows on cover spaces, the new &lt;br/&gt;theorems of convergence in average along orbits which appear in &lt;br/&gt;connection with these measures, the speed of convergence in these &lt;br/&gt;theorems and the possible applications of all these results. The second &lt;br/&gt;topic is almost hyperbolic dynamics. This covers questions where the &lt;br/&gt;lack of hyperbolicity is precisely localized. Some of the previous &lt;br/&gt;questions are related to frame flows, or more generally compact group &lt;br/&gt;extensions of hyperbolic flows. Another example is the geodesic flow on &lt;br/&gt;rank one manifolds, where the nonhyperbolicity is concentrated on a &lt;br/&gt;singular invariant closed set. There is some ongoing progress about the &lt;br/&gt;Martin boundary and the geometry at infinity of the universal cover of a &lt;br/&gt;rank one manifold. The third topic concerns several ergodic theoretic &lt;br/&gt;questions related to Quantum Chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In general, the evolution of a dynamical system is represented by the &lt;br/&gt;action of a one parameter group -the time- over a space of &lt;br/&gt;configurations. Ergodic theory is the study of global statistical &lt;br/&gt;properties of such actions. The two extreme cases have been flourishing &lt;br/&gt;successes of last century mathematics. On the one side, the elliptic &lt;br/&gt;case, when the motion is periodic or quasi-periodic gave rise to KAM &lt;br/&gt;theory. The algebraic simple model is the translations on a compact &lt;br/&gt;group. On the other extreme, the hyperbolic case is the one where the &lt;br/&gt;trajectories diverge exponentially. It is also well understood now, with &lt;br/&gt;extraordinarily precise statistical results. The standard models are &lt;br/&gt;the geodesic flow in negative curvature or the algebraic action of an &lt;br/&gt;integer matrix on the torus, when no eigenvalue has modulus one. Many &lt;br/&gt;interesting programs today try to develop new tools to understand the &lt;br/&gt;vast territory between the two extreme cases. As summarized above, the &lt;br/&gt;propositions of this project explore some possible paths. In spite of &lt;br/&gt;their apparent diversity, they have common threads. An unexpected one &lt;br/&gt;is the role of invariant distributions, which appear for different &lt;br/&gt;reasons in several of these a priori unrelated questions.</AbstractNarration>
