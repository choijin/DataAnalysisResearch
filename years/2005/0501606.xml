<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Research Plan: A networked dynamic system is a collection of dynamical units that interact via an information&lt;br/&gt;exchange network during their operation. These systems have found many applications in diverse&lt;br/&gt;areas such as multiple space, air, and land vehicles, energy systems, physiology, and medicine. Currently,&lt;br/&gt;there is an active research effort underway in the control and systems community to formalize these systems&lt;br/&gt;and lay out a foundation for their analysis and synthesis. The objective of this project is to carry out foundational&lt;br/&gt;studies on a network-centric input-output and robustness analysis framework for distributed dynamic&lt;br/&gt;systems. The approach adopted for this purpose is based on algebraic graph theory on one hand, and random&lt;br/&gt;and random geometric graphs, on the other. In this direction, we will address problems associated&lt;br/&gt;with probabilistic moments of system-theoretic objective functionals over uncertain networks, as well as&lt;br/&gt;the important phenomena associated with time-scales and phase transitions in robustness and performance&lt;br/&gt;measures of the corresponding networked systems. An existing computational testbed at the University of&lt;br/&gt;Washington will be augmented for the purpose of validation and evaluation of the proposed methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;Education Plan: Distributed dynamic systems provide an ideal venue to engage control and systems graduate&lt;br/&gt;students in the elegance and power of system ideas, not only as they pertain to engineering problems,&lt;br/&gt;but also in their relation to biology and information sciences. The education program of this project is&lt;br/&gt;implemented through a graduate course offering and curriculum development, graduate mentoring, and promoting&lt;br/&gt;research collaboration venues via in-class seminars and a workshop. The proposed course, Networkcentric&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic System Theory and Applications, will be developed and offered as a two quarters graduate&lt;br/&gt;level course in the controls curriculum of the University of Washington. The course will cover aspects of&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial theory that, in conjunction with system theory, have proved instrumental in the analysis of&lt;br/&gt;network-enabled dynamic systems. The second quarter of the course provides a rigorous bridge between&lt;br/&gt;system theory and networked dynamic systems as encountered in a wide array of disciplines such as in biology&lt;br/&gt;and physiology. The workshop on network-centric dynamic systems during the final year of the project&lt;br/&gt;will not only serve as an exceptional educational outlet for the graduate students, but also as a vehicle to&lt;br/&gt;further enhance opportunities for interdisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of the proposed research and education program consists of:&lt;br/&gt;(1) foundational contributions to a new sub-discipline in control theory referred to as network-centric dynamic&lt;br/&gt;system theory (2) applying novel graph and system theoretic techniques for the analysis of networked&lt;br/&gt;dynamic systems as encountered in life and physical sciences and engineering systems (3) providing a significant&lt;br/&gt;impetus for collaborations between system and control theorists, combinatorialists, biologists, and&lt;br/&gt;physicists, at the University of Washington, and (4) development of a new curriculum for graduate program&lt;br/&gt;in systems and control education.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Our project will lay a fertile ground work for future collaborations between system and&lt;br/&gt;control researchers, graph theorists, and the biological science community. By doing so, it will also bring&lt;br/&gt;into the horizon a host of new career options for system and control graduate students. Our contributions to&lt;br/&gt;the emerging field of networks will be well publicized via: (1) a well-organized workshop on the third year&lt;br/&gt;of the project, bringing researchers from across disciplines, from local computer science, engineering, and&lt;br/&gt;biomedical industries (2) presenting research results, often by graduate students, in professional conferences&lt;br/&gt;and research institutions, and (3) frequent seminars in the educational institutions that are non-Ph.D granting&lt;br/&gt;and/or serve underrepresented groups. These more public seminars will highlight the common complexities&lt;br/&gt;of networked dynamic systems across various disciplines, and how control and system theory is providing&lt;br/&gt;novel theoretical and algorithmic tools for their analysis and synthesis. These seminars will also be actively&lt;br/&gt;used as a recruitment tool, particularly for attracting potential graduate students from underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;groups in engineering.</AbstractNarration>
