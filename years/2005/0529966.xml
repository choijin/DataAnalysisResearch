<AbstractNarration>This award supports a continuation of research in the area of condensed&lt;br/&gt;matter theory.  The research is done in collaboration with T. R. Kirkpatrick at the University of Maryland.  The research uses advanced techniques to try to understand the behavior of strongly interacting electron systems in low dimensions.  These type of systems are common at the nanoscale and provide challenges to theory due to the failure of conventional methods to describe matter on this scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of the project is to further the understanding of many-electron systems at very low temperatures, and especially of phase transitions and other collective phenomena in such systems. The methods employed consist of general field-theoretic techniques and the renormalization group. A particular goal is the development of effective field theories which allow for a description of universal aspects of very complex systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific systems for which this project is relevant include magnets, superconductors, and doped semiconductors. A successful completion of the project will contribute to the understanding of an important area of condensed matter physics, and will train technical personnel with expertise in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
