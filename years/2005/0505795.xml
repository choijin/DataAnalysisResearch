    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0505795&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Gregory J. Galloway&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Isaac Newton Institute for the Mathematical Sciences is&lt;br/&gt;running a semester long program on Global Problems in&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Relativity (GMR) in Cambridge, England from August&lt;br/&gt;to December, 2005. The purpose of this award is to provide&lt;br/&gt;partial travel and subsistence support for U. S. participants.&lt;br/&gt;The general aim of the GMR program is to bring together experts&lt;br/&gt;in the field, along with early career researchers and graduate&lt;br/&gt;students, to discuss recent striking advances in mathematical&lt;br/&gt;aspects of general relativity and related theories of gravity,&lt;br/&gt;and to address existing problems and challenges. The program&lt;br/&gt;consists of three focused conferences: (1) New Directions in&lt;br/&gt;Numerical Relativity, (2) Global General Relativity, and (3) The&lt;br/&gt;Constraint Equations, together with a series of thematic&lt;br/&gt;workshops that will run throughout the course of the program. The&lt;br/&gt;GMR program coincides with the 100 year anniversary of Einstein's&lt;br/&gt;Special Theory of Relativity. General Relativity, Einstein's&lt;br/&gt;geometric theory of gravity, which incorporates the special&lt;br/&gt;theory, has proven to be an extraordinarily accurate theory of&lt;br/&gt;gravity at both the local astrophysical and cosmological&lt;br/&gt;scales. The results of the collaborative research and analysis to&lt;br/&gt;be carried out during the program will have a significant bearing&lt;br/&gt;on various fundamental physical problems, such as the issue of&lt;br/&gt;the final state of gravitational collapse, and its implications&lt;br/&gt;for the detection of gravitational radiation. Participation of&lt;br/&gt;graduate students and recent PhD's is a key component of the&lt;br/&gt;program, and is crucial to the continuing vitality of the area.</AbstractNarration>
