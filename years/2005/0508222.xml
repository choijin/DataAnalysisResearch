<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to explore the formation of Er2O3-like and noble-metal (e.g., Ag or Au) nanoparticles in crystalline silicon as well as their effects on the 1.54-um luminescence of Er ions. The PI will establish correlation between the structural and optical properties of resultant Si structures for various materials processing including ion implantation and thermal annealing. The approach is based on an interesting phenomenon associated with the generation of nanometer-sized voids/cavities in hydrogen or helium ion implanted Si and the strong interaction of such cavities with impurities, and is completely compatible with current semiconductor fabricating/processing technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research would lead to breakthroughs in the development of Si-based photonics and optoelectronics, having great impacts on the semiconductor industry that is striving for innovative solutions to continue the exponential gain in cost/performance benefits.  The research will advance knowledge in novel materials and nanostructure fabrication, and will provide students with advanced research and learning experience in nanoscale science and technology. Furthermore, the proposed research will help the PI develop research-based curricula for effective teaching of graduate- and undergraduate-level physics courses. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
