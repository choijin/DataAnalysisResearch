<AbstractNarration>A major objective of post-genomics research is to unravel the transcriptional networks that control complex morphological changes. The research described in this proposal will provide a comprehensive approach to dissecting the transcriptional circuitry involved in Arabidopsis petal organogenesis. Previous work has resulted in the identification of transcription factors that coordinately control many aspects of petal development as well as a number of candidate genes involved in various aspects of petal organogenesis. Several complementary approaches, including molecular, biochemical, genetic and computational analyses will be used to characterize the transcriptional regulatory networks controlling petal organogenesis.  Experiments will be carried out in order to define the extent to which the petal identity pathway intersects genetically with the petal outgrowth pathway; coordination of growth and specification is a necessary prerequisite for normal organogenesis. Computational approaches will be used to elucidate conserved sequence features and the intersection of identified regulatory networks.  Petals are ideally suited for such analyses, since petals are simple laminar organs that are dispensable for growth and reproduction.  Since petals can serve as a simple model for studying other, more complex plant organs, the work described here should provide a paradigm for understanding the dynamics of organogenesis in more intricate systems. Part of the described work will be carried out by undergraduates from minority and underrepresented backgrounds; this will expose promising young students to scientific research in the sciences.  Training such students in the methodologies and approaches of basic research will facilitate their involvement in future scientific endeavors.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
