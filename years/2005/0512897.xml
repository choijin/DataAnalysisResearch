    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will deliver an experimental setup capable of studying the machining of germanium boules with a wire-EDM process in great detail. The research collaboration with the University of Utah will allow the use of wire-EDM for machining of germanium to be explored at a very fundamental level. The outcome of this collaboration will be the identification of critical machining parameters such as voltage, current, pulse-on time, etc. on the quality of the machined surfaces as measured by flatness, depth of subsurface damage, etc. The proposed research activities will advance the knowledge of electro-discharge machining that will lead to even more enhanced manufacturing capabilities in the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful the proposed research will contribute new knowledge and manufacturing capabilities for semiconductor materials. As a direct result a possible outcome of this project will the elimination of U.S. dependency on foreign suppliers for high precision germanium wafers which are used as substrates for GaAs multi-junction solar cells that power virtually all U.S. space-based defense, civil, and commercial satellites. The result of this project will enable the company to supply the American manufacturing industry with an alternative method to shape brittle semiconductor materials that will result in higher productivity, more reliable products, and a competitive advantage over its low-tech, low-wage competitors. If performed economically, this "green" process will reduce waste and further reduce manufacturing cost.</AbstractNarration>
