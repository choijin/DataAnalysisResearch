<AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Mostafa El Sayed of Georgia Institute of Technology. Prof. El Sayed and his students will study the origin of the correlation between the catalytic activity and the fraction of atoms located on the corners and edges of catalytic nanoparticles.   The research team will study the mechanism of changes in size and shape of nanocatalysts during catalytic processes and determine whether the observed shape and size changes are general for all types of reactions.  The research team will also investigate the stability and recycling potential of nanocatalysts such as self-assembled nanoparticles, nanoparticles adsorbed on supports, nanoparticles encapsulated in dendrimers of different generations, and lithographically fabricated nanocatalysts.  The study could lead to development of greatly improved catalysts.  It will provide excellent training opportunities to undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the research field of catalysis, which is of great importance to the US economy.</AbstractNarration>
