<AbstractNarration>This project is devoted to the study of three inverse quadratic&lt;br/&gt;eigenproblems with their pertinence to physical and engineering&lt;br/&gt;applications. The aim is to develop theoretic understanding and&lt;br/&gt;derive numerical algorithms for the quadratic model reconstruction&lt;br/&gt;so that the inexactness and uncertainty inherent in the model due&lt;br/&gt;to the limitation of current technologies are reduced while certain&lt;br/&gt;specific mathematical conditions are satisfied. The most difficult&lt;br/&gt;task in the quadratic model reconstruction is to satisfy the associated&lt;br/&gt;constraints which could be inherited intrinsically from the physical&lt;br/&gt;feasibility of a certain mechanical structure or could be driven&lt;br/&gt;extrinsically by the desirable property of a certain design parameter.&lt;br/&gt;The greatest challenge, which is also an imperative requirement in&lt;br/&gt;practice, is that the reconstruction must be carried out using only&lt;br/&gt;partial eigeninformation which are available by the state-of-the-art&lt;br/&gt;computational techniques. The inverse problem of constrained model&lt;br/&gt;reconstruction is essential for the understanding and management of&lt;br/&gt;complex systems, yet many questions on the solvability, sensitivity,&lt;br/&gt;and computation remain unanswered.  The investigators have made&lt;br/&gt;significant contributions to the quadratic model construction problems&lt;br/&gt;individually and now intend to extend their investigation and join&lt;br/&gt;expertise to these challenging inverse problems. This proposed work&lt;br/&gt;therefore should be of compelling independent interest within both&lt;br/&gt;the engineering and mathematical sciences communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In mathematical modelling, techniques of inverse problems that validate,&lt;br/&gt;determine, or estimate the parameters of the system according to its&lt;br/&gt;observed or expected behavior are critically important. This research&lt;br/&gt;concentrates on the inverse model reconstruction problems with their&lt;br/&gt;pertinence to physical and engineering applications. These problems have&lt;br/&gt;been strongly motivitated  by scietific and industrial applications,&lt;br/&gt;including structural mechanics such as vibration control and stability&lt;br/&gt;analysis of bridges, buildings and highways, vibro-acoustics such as&lt;br/&gt;predictive coding of sound, biomedical signal and image processing,&lt;br/&gt;time series forecasting, information technology, and others. Thus this&lt;br/&gt;project will impact a wide variety of industries utilizing these&lt;br/&gt;applications, including aerospace, automobile, manufacturing and&lt;br/&gt;biomedical engineering. The greatest challenge facing these industries&lt;br/&gt;is to manufacture increasingly improved products with limited engineering&lt;br/&gt;and computing resources. A great deal of money and efforts have been spent&lt;br/&gt;in these industries to satisactorily perform the model updating task.&lt;br/&gt;However, the lack of proper theory and computational tools often force&lt;br/&gt;these industries to solve their problems in an ad hoc fashion. An improved&lt;br/&gt;analytical model that can be used with confidence for future designs is&lt;br/&gt;an essential tool in achieving this obejective. The propsed research has&lt;br/&gt;not only strong mathematical foundation but also significant matematical&lt;br/&gt;modelling and experimental aspects using idustrial data which should be&lt;br/&gt;instantly welcome by the industries. Furthermore, the students working&lt;br/&gt;on this project for four years will receive a valuable interdisciplnary&lt;br/&gt;training blending mathematics and scietific computing with various areas&lt;br/&gt;of engineering and applied sciences.  Such expertise is rare to find,&lt;br/&gt;but there is an increasing demand both inacademia and industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
