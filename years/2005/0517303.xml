<AbstractNarration>Brain Myosin5 and synaptic plasticity&lt;br/&gt;Abstract of project&lt;br/&gt;The human brain is a flexible structure that changes in response to experiences but it is&lt;br/&gt;not fully understood how experience changes the brain at the cellular level and results&lt;br/&gt;in learning and memory. The question posed in this proposal is "what is the role of&lt;br/&gt;the actin-dependent molecular motor, brain myosin5, in experience-driven synaptic&lt;br/&gt;plasticity, i.e how does myosin5 participate in synaptic strengthening?" Brain&lt;br/&gt;myosin5 (Myosin-Va) has multiple functions that link it to synaptic plasticity. It&lt;br/&gt;transports vesicles as well as other kinds of cargo at axon terminals and dendritic&lt;br/&gt;spines. In addition, it is a constitutive component of the postsynaptic density.&lt;br/&gt;Previous studies have shown that myosin5 binds to kinesin (heteromotor complex)&lt;br/&gt;and functions as a molecular motor for the transport of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&lt;br/&gt;vesicles. Those studies led to the following specific question to be addressed in this&lt;br/&gt;project: How is transport of ER vesicles by myosin5 and kinesin coordinated. The&lt;br/&gt;specific aims are as follows: The PI and his research group will isolate brain-specific&lt;br/&gt;binding partners of myosin5 using affinity-based biochemical methods and identify&lt;br/&gt;the proteins using proteomic approaches (brain-specific myosin5 proteome). The&lt;br/&gt;results from this proteomics screen will be used to determine which proteins&lt;br/&gt;constitute the myosin5/kinesin heteromotor complex. From the list of proteins&lt;br/&gt;identified by proteomics, they will identify signaling proteins that associate with the&lt;br/&gt;myosin5/kinesin motor complex and determine which of these signaling proteins&lt;br/&gt;function to coordinate kinesin and myosin5 activity during transport of ER vesicles&lt;br/&gt;using an in vitro motility assay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activities: The broader impacts will&lt;br/&gt;include mentoring by the PI of minority students through the Ernest Everett Just&lt;br/&gt;Program at Dartmouth, sponsoring undergraduate students engaged in independent&lt;br/&gt;research projects and honor's theses research in his laboratory and working with&lt;br/&gt;students from Spelman College and Morehouse College (2 HBCUs) who come to&lt;br/&gt;Dartmouth as exchange students. In addition, the PI will continue to sponsor&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students in his laboratory at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods&lt;br/&gt;Hole MA. Each summer he gives lectures on his research and provides mentoring to&lt;br/&gt;minority graduate students enrolled in the SPINES (Neuro) course at the MBL.</AbstractNarration>
