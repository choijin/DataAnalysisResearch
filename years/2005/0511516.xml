<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Science (21).  Fundamental to this project is the development of a framework for pre-service teachers to enable them to construct a meaningful understanding of the impact of curriculum on teaching and learning.  In addition, research is being conducted by the project team to determine if the participation of pre-service teachers in a particular research initiative (with a focus on the algebra strand) improves their content and pedagogical knowledge.  The research being conducted by the pre-service teachers in this project includes a cycle of curriculum investigation, experiencing (as learners) lessons adapted from the materials, and observing (as future teachers) classroom teachers and students experiencing the lessons. Particular research initiatives for which the pre-service teachers are engaged involve adapting and modifying standards based K-8 student curriculum materials originally designed to be used to support teaching of K-8 in-service teachers.  Adaptive tasks and instrumentation are being developed by the project leaders, and students use these as the basis for their curriculum investigation.  An assessment instrument NSF-MSP #0335411 is being adapted to assess student (pre-service teacher) learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit related to this project is substantial. Pre-service teachers are conducting research on the impact of curriculum on teaching and learning, and the project team, in turn, is conducting and evaluating research on the effects the students' (pre-service teachers') research projects have on their content and pedagogical knowledge.  Among the broader impacts of the project is the development of a research informed model for K-12 teacher preparation programs in mathematics as well as other disciplines. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
