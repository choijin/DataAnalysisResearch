<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an increasing interest in the vibration data-based detection, localization, and&lt;br/&gt;quantification of damage in civil engineering structures exposed to earthquake, wind, and other&lt;br/&gt;loads. Early motivation for this was provided by the discovery of hidden damages in steel&lt;br/&gt;structures caused by the 1994 Northridge and 1995 Great Hanshin (Kobe) Earthquakes, and also&lt;br/&gt;by the fact that structural element are usually inaccessible after construction. Several analytical&lt;br/&gt;methods have been proposed in the literature and still more are being developed for this.&lt;br/&gt;Currently simulated data are being used to check the effectiveness of these methods; however,&lt;br/&gt;their validation and comparison on actual experimentally obtained data is yet to be done.&lt;br/&gt;In this exploratory project, it is proposed to experimentally study and validate the&lt;br/&gt;effectives of the autoregressive with exogenous input model, wavelet transform, eigensystem&lt;br/&gt;realization algorithms (ERA), and subspace identification (SSI) approaches for comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;modal and damage identification of civil engineering structures. For damage localization and&lt;br/&gt;quantification the flexibility and rotational flexibility matrices with and without and damage locating&lt;br/&gt;vectors will be used. Further analytical improvements in these methods will also be made for&lt;br/&gt;more reliable damage quantification. The tests will be conducted on a scaled three-story, nine&lt;br/&gt;degrees-of-freedom structure model prepared such that its stiffness properties can be changed&lt;br/&gt;by planned changes in one or more braces, by sudden removal of one or two braces in real-time&lt;br/&gt;using magneto-rheological dampers, and by loosening the connecting hardware at few selected&lt;br/&gt;joints. The major cost of preparing this changeable scaled model will be borne by the PIs&lt;br/&gt;institution. The scaled model will be excited at its base by the 5' by 5' shaking table at Virginia&lt;br/&gt;Tech. The model would also have the capability of being excited by shakers installed at any of&lt;br/&gt;the three levels. The dynamic measurements of the acceleration response will be made using&lt;br/&gt;ten accelerometers, three placed at each floor level in two orthogonal directions plus one on the&lt;br/&gt;table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SGER funding is being sought to identify validated damage localization and&lt;br/&gt;quantification methods which will be needed in a more comprehensive follow-up study. This&lt;br/&gt;follow-up study to be proposed later will develop an integrated system consisting of the validated&lt;br/&gt;damage identification techniques with online consequence prognosis followed by online&lt;br/&gt;actuation, if necessary, of a control system to maintain the performance of the structure at an&lt;br/&gt;acceptable level. The successful outcome of this exploratory work will also be a very useful tool&lt;br/&gt;for direct practical implementation in structural diagnostics and health monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual merit of this study is in the development of experimentally verified&lt;br/&gt;damage identification (detection, localization, and quantification) schemes for a comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;structural health monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this research will occur at two levels: the&lt;br/&gt;education and training of graduate and undergraduate students and the availability of a much&lt;br/&gt;needed tool and data to researchers and practitioners involved in structural health monitoring. A&lt;br/&gt;graduate student and an undergraduate student will work on this project. The undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;student will be supported through the REU program. She/he will be selected through the Center&lt;br/&gt;for the Enhancement of Engineering Diversity (CEED) at Virginia Tech from the pool of available&lt;br/&gt;African American, Hispanic, American Indian, and women students. The dissemination of&lt;br/&gt;information and data generated in this research to other students, researchers and practitioners&lt;br/&gt;will be done through class room teaching, website creation, presentations in conferences, and&lt;br/&gt;publications in archival journals and conference proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
