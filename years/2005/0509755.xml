<AbstractNarration>0509755&lt;br/&gt;Zhu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks renewal of a NSF-sponsored integrated research and education program in&lt;br/&gt;field, microscopic, and modeling studies of silicate reaction kinetics in a groundwater aquifer the&lt;br/&gt;Navajo sandstone aquifer at Black Mesa, Arizona. One of the fundamental problems in modern&lt;br/&gt;hydrogeology and geochemistry is the orders of magnitude discrepancy between silicate dissolution&lt;br/&gt;rates derived from watersheds and soil profiles versus those derived from laboratory measurements.&lt;br/&gt;This large discrepancy indicates our lack of basic understanding of the fundamental physical and&lt;br/&gt;chemical processes controlling silicate dissolution kinetics in nature.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study will test two hypotheses to explain this discrepancy: (1) A large part of the&lt;br/&gt;discrepancy between in situ and laboratory rates results from different saturation states under which&lt;br/&gt;feldspars dissolve in natural systems and in most laboratory experiments. While most laboratory&lt;br/&gt;experiments attempt to measure the rate of a single congruent dissolution reaction far from equilibrium,&lt;br/&gt;field studies measure in situ rates amid a complex web of reaction networks and at a condition very&lt;br/&gt;close to equilibrium with respect to feldspars. Among these reactions is the precipitation of clay, which&lt;br/&gt;removes solutes from groundwater and hence promotes continued feldspar dissolution. However,&lt;br/&gt;contrary to the prevailing assumption that clays are at equilibrium with groundwater, we believe that&lt;br/&gt;clay precipitation is much slower than feldspar dissolution, and hence groundwater chemistry is&lt;br/&gt;constrained to be close to equilibrium with feldspars. Over time, a steady state of groundwater&lt;br/&gt;chemistry is reached with near constant rates of feldspar dissolution and clay precipitation; and (2) A&lt;br/&gt;leached layer forms on weathered feldspar surfaces, which is an important part of how silicate&lt;br/&gt;dissolution occurs in nature and must be considered in rate laws that properly describe reaction&lt;br/&gt;kinetics.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study will test the first hypothesis by analyzing dissolved Al3+ concentrations in&lt;br/&gt;the aquifer, evaluating saturation indices and their variations along a flow path, and numerical&lt;br/&gt;geochemical modeling to elucidate the complex network of reactions associated with feldspar&lt;br/&gt;dissolution in aquifers. We aim to establish a theoretical framework for interpreting laboratory&lt;br/&gt;experiments and field data. To test the second hypothesis, we will characterize microstructures and&lt;br/&gt;detailed chemistry at the feldspar-clay interfaces using an atomic scale Field Emission Gun&lt;br/&gt;Transmission Electron Microscope. The overall objectives are to advance our understanding of the two&lt;br/&gt;key possibilities for discrepancies between laboratory and field rates: the diminishing thermodynamic&lt;br/&gt;drive and the characteristics of weathered feldspar surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will integrate the research activities into undergraduate and graduate-level geology&lt;br/&gt;courses. A summer mentorship program will sponsor undergraduate students, particularly from&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups, to conduct research in the PI's laboratories. Partnerships with the National&lt;br/&gt;Energy Technology Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory will be developed to facilitate&lt;br/&gt;dissemination and applications of the research results to the carbon sequestration and environmental&lt;br/&gt;restoration programs.&lt;br/&gt;Groundwater is a key source of drinking water and is essential to life on Earth. Groundwater&lt;br/&gt;also represents 98% of fresh water readily available to humans. Therefore, reaction rates in aquifers are&lt;br/&gt;critical to water resource and water quality management, waste disposal, and global warming&lt;br/&gt;mitigation strategies. The findings from this project will therefore contribute to our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the environment, and help to build a scientific basis for environmental policies and strategies.</AbstractNarration>
