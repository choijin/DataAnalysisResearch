<AbstractNarration>0543257&lt;br/&gt;Perera&lt;br/&gt;This project supports a U.S.- Sri Lanka Workshop: Quantum Well Infrared Photo Detector 2006 (QWIP 2006), June 2006, Kandy, Sri Lanka.  The US organizers are Dr. Unil Perera, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Georgia State University (GSU), Athens and Dr. Kirti Tennakone, Director, Institute of Fundamental Studies (IFS), Kandy, Sri Lanka.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is planned to encourage students, post-doctoral associates, and senior researchers to engage in scientific discussions related to developing infrared detectors.  The focus will be on intersubband transitions, specifically quantum well (QWIP) and quantum dot infrared photodetector (QDIP) structures. A second aim is to encourage scientists and students from the south Asian region to be involved in these novel developments. This would initiate new collaborations and enhance ongoing collaborations there by providing a better prepared graduate student pool for the US higher education institutions. Following rapid developments in the past 15 years, QWIP has become a technology for infrared imaging. Despite this rapid advance, some areas are not yet completely resolved and potentials are not fully exploited.  Several world experts in the QWIP/QDIP research &amp; development, government sponsors, industrial engineers, instrument technologists and end users will meet to discuss the current issues, formulate future directions, and propose collaborations. This effort could resolve some basic scientific issues not yet addressed such as low background operation and also could lead to the development of new types of nanostructure sensors. New materials form another focal point including quantum dots (e.g., QDIPs) and novel materials systems (e.g., Indium Arsenate/Gallium Antimonide/Aluminum Antimonide (InAs/GaSb/AlSb), Gallium Indium Nitride (InGaN) Quantum Wells (QWs), and dilute nitride InGaNAs QWs) will also be discussed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since QWIP technology is a critical emerging technology that can impact on the US strengths in infrared detection, this workshop is designed to keep the U.S. scientists abreast of its latest developments around the globe. This project will support participation by 3 junior scientists, 12 graduate students and 2 undergraduate students, all in U.S. institutions.  Nano-structures and novel materials are of widespread interest to the solid-state physics and engineering community, with possibility for the development of new advanced materials. Recent advances in terahertz detection using quantum well and dot structures would be another area of interest.  The workshop will generate communications, mutual understanding and collaborations between U.S. scientists and students and those in foreign countries, especially within the Asian region.  In addition the QWIP device knowledge among US students and young scientists will also be broadened especially among minority and women. This training of the next generation of high technology workforce will be critical in maintaining US strengths in novel nanotechnology focus areas. Current GSU-IFS collaborations will be extended to the QWIP device area and support will be provided for exchange visits between the two research laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
