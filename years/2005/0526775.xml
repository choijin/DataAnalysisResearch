<AbstractNarration>Funds are requested for the acquisition of an integrated high homogeneity magnet and dilution refrigerator system with radio frequency components for research of quantum phenomena and student training at Brown University. This system will be used to study the microscopic properties of quantum magnets, novel highly correlated electron systems including unconventional superconductors, and metal doped with paramagnetic ions (for applications to high energy detectors). The radio frequency components will be optimized for magnetic resonance applications. NMR as a low energy probe has the potential to provide crucial information about the ground state of the system. The study of the ground state and its behavior in a magnetic field puts important constraints on the theoretical understanding of Condensed Matter systems. Understanding novel quantum effects in electronic and magnetic materials may lead to technological advances. A group of experimentalists at Brown University and their collaborators at other institutions conduct research at the frontier of fundamental material properties. Many of their research projects require a combined low temperature and high magnetic field environment. The requested system will greatly increase significance and productivity of their research and open up new and exciting research directions. Furthermore, it will have a major impact graduate and undergraduate education at Brown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funds for the acquisition of a state-of-the-art dilution refrigerator and magnet system, allowing the access to the near absolute-zero temperature and high magnetic field environment. Ultra low temperature conditions are essential in revealing the quantum nature of novel electronic materials. A strong magnetic field in these low temperature conditions can be effectively used to manipulate the quantum states in such systems. Non-invasive microscopic techniques such as magnetic resonance (successfully used for medical imaging as well) can be very powerful in elucidating nature of these new states of matter.
