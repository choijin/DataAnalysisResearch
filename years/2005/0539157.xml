    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project includes the development of an innovative, remote sensor using a Rayleigh/Mie laser radar to sample the air well ahead of an aircraft to monitor wind speed and detect turbulence. This sensor can, in effect, sense the atmosphere in the region of an aircraft and provide sensor data to mitigate turbulent event effects on the aircraft. The primary research objective is to develop an incoherent laser radar capable of providing range-resolved wind profiles in a small highly efficient and rugged package. This entails a requirements analysis, a trade study of sensor designs, and a complete sensor design for Phase II including a laser radar signal and a noise model estimate. A laboratory proof-of-concept demonstration is also proposed. The anticipated results include a Phase II prototype sensor design and a validation of the concept in the laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This incoherent laser radar sensor will provide an additional air sensing tool for the atmospheric research community and for the commercial aviation industry with three-dimensional wind profiles even in clear air conditions (without atmospheric aerosols).Atmospheric researchers can more precisely characterize the atmosphere and potentially increase the understanding of the earth's climate and weather patterns.</AbstractNarration>
