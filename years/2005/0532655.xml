<AbstractNarration>The National Center of Excellence for High Performance Computing Technology (NCEHPCT) helps prepare community college students for employment as technicians and administrators of "high performance" computer (HPC) systems - a group of networked servers or computer cluster whose combined resources can provide the power of a supercomputer. In this one-year extension the NCEHPCT is establishing a set of national skills standards and a national certification program for HPC technicians, expanding outreach to community colleges, working closely with industry that uses high-performance computing, and encouraging expanded commercial use of HPC technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The skills standards and certification ensure that students who seek to work with HPC systems are well-educated and skilled in the proper areas.  The programs already established at four community colleges have brought together curricular material in new ways to support the networking of off-the-shelf computer technology. The NCEHPCT is also playing a vital role in introducing HPC to businesses and industries that are not yet fully aware of the efficiency and productivity advantages of this technology. At the same time, the NCEHPCT is helping industry to understand that community colleges are a practical and reliable source of well trained HPC technicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;If the United States is to compete effectively in the global economy, American business must take advantage of cutting edge technology in order to continually improve efficiency and productivity. HPC technology can support the continuing innovation that is needed in order to strengthen the country's economy. The NCEHPCT is helping to accelerate the deployment of this vital technology by disseminating information to industry about the advantages of HPC and by preparing the trained technicians who will be needed to operate, maintain and administer HPC systems. The NCEHPCT is maintaining current high levels of minority program enrollment and is working to increase the percentage of female students enrolled through intensive recruiting efforts that include cooperative working relationships with a wide range of minority and female professional organizations.</AbstractNarration>
