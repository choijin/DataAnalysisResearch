<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;A hybrid sensor/actuator network, which consists of a large number of static sensors and relatively&lt;br/&gt;small number of mobile robotic sensors, opens new frontiers in a variety of civilian and military&lt;br/&gt;applications and in some scientific disciplines. The combination of a wireless sensor network and&lt;br/&gt;a multi-robot system reduces the cost but significantly enhances each other's capability. The static&lt;br/&gt;wireless sensor network provides collaborative sensing, communication, coordination and navigation&lt;br/&gt;to a multi-robot system and human operators. The mobile robots augment sensor networks'&lt;br/&gt;capability by their mobility and advanced sensing, communication and computation capability.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to address two challenging research issues in a hybrid sensor/&lt;br/&gt;actuator network: autonomous sensor/actuator coordination algorithms and self-configuring&lt;br/&gt;communication protocols. The specific goals of this research project include: (i) dynamic modeling&lt;br/&gt;and organization of hybrid sensor/actuator networks; (ii) sensor/actuator coordination algorithms to&lt;br/&gt;reallocate sensing, networking and computing resources to provide required coverage and specified&lt;br/&gt;sensing accuracy; (iii) self-configuring protocols to provide information for environmental sensing,&lt;br/&gt;communication, robot coordination and navigation; (iv) robot navigation algorithms in sensor&lt;br/&gt;networks; and (v) a perceptive reference frame for the analysis and design of the coordination&lt;br/&gt;algorithms and communication protocols.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will develop an effective education program in sensor networks and multi-robot systems&lt;br/&gt;at Michigan Technological University, with the objective to foster creative thinking and analytical&lt;br/&gt;skills. The PI will promote competition-motivated learning by the development of a senior level&lt;br/&gt;one-year design course and an Enterprise program using the concept of networked systems of mobile&lt;br/&gt;robots and sensors. The outreach activities to K-12 education include: (i) participating in two of the&lt;br/&gt;summer youth programs, woman in engineering and explorations in engineering, which encourage&lt;br/&gt;women and underrepresented groups to pursue engineering careers; (ii) providing leadership in&lt;br/&gt;professional development for teachers, especially for teachers in local school districts.&lt;br/&gt;Major Intellectual Merits and Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is the understanding of the control and self-organization of a complex hybrid&lt;br/&gt;sensor/actuator networks. The accomplishment of this project will have substantial intellectual merits&lt;br/&gt;in three areas: (i) multi-robot systems: understanding how to model a dynamic and distributed large&lt;br/&gt;scale system, as well as how to coordinate and navigate multiple mobile robots in sensor networks;&lt;br/&gt;(ii) sensor networks: understanding how to enhance sensing and communication using mobility,&lt;br/&gt;as well as how to cluster a sensor network for energy efficient routing and tracking; (iii) other&lt;br/&gt;frontiers: application of the algorithms in safety control of Intelligent Transportation Systems, and&lt;br/&gt;research in ecosystems and environmental monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project is a natural outcome of the innovative research and education&lt;br/&gt;programs. The results of this research activity provide systemic design approaches for&lt;br/&gt;rapid deployment of hybrid sensor/actuator networks, which will impact research in environmental&lt;br/&gt;monitoring and ecosystems, and find myriad applications such as battlefield surveillance. The&lt;br/&gt;educational plan will directly benefit the anticipated education activities in robotics and networks.&lt;br/&gt;The educational plan will strengthen our educational objectives by enhancing the content of graduate&lt;br/&gt;and undergraduate classes, and by providing meaningful experiences to undergraduate researchers.&lt;br/&gt;Every year, the outreach programs help hundreds of pre-college students, many of whom are women&lt;br/&gt;or minorities, to improve scientific understanding and interest in engineering and technology.&lt;br/&gt;A-1</AbstractNarration>
