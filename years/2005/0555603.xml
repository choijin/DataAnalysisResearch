<AbstractNarration>This proposal request support for a continuing research program on an unusual combination of topics in field theory. They include non-Hermitian Hamiltonians which are in invariant under parity and time reversal, biorthogonal quantum mechanics, Nambu dynamics, and nonrelativistic strings and branes. While these topics have considerable intrinsic interest, it is not clear that they have a significant impact on the field of particle physics. The PI's are well-known mathematical physicists whose work is of good quality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposal include the training of students at a research university in a relatively under-represented geographical region in terms of federal funding. They also involve the wide dissemination of the research results in the form of standard publications, web pages, and talks at conferences and seminars. They also help to continue the well-known "Miami Conferences" in particle physics.</AbstractNarration>
