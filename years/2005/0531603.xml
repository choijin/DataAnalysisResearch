<AbstractNarration>Estimated to contain more than 15,000 species, the decapods are the most&lt;br/&gt;species rich and economically important group of Crustacea, including&lt;br/&gt;shrimp, crabs, crayfish, and lobsters.  Furthermore, many extant families&lt;br/&gt;have well-documented fossil records. Accordingly, the decapods have been the&lt;br/&gt;subject of more published papers than have all other crustacean groups&lt;br/&gt;combined, due in part to their species richness, economic importance, and&lt;br/&gt;morphologic diversity.  Given the prevalence of decapods in the public and&lt;br/&gt;scientific mind, understanding the evolutionary history of this significant&lt;br/&gt;crustacean group is crucial. Five principal investigators, K. Crandall, D.&lt;br/&gt;Felder, J. Martin, C. Schweitzer and R. Feldman, will lead an international&lt;br/&gt;group of decapod researchers in a collaborative effort to resolve&lt;br/&gt;higher-level decapod relationships by integrating developmental,&lt;br/&gt;morphological, molecular, and paleontological evidence. This international&lt;br/&gt;research team, including both lead investigators and collaborating team&lt;br/&gt;members, has collectively published on every major lineage of decapods, and&lt;br/&gt;includes expertise in comparative morphology, systematic paleontology,&lt;br/&gt;molecular, morphological (adult and larval), and combined data phylogenetic&lt;br/&gt;analysis, as well as systematic theory. This group will collect molecular (~&lt;br/&gt;20 genes) and morphological (~200 characters) data from nearly all 153 extant&lt;br/&gt;families of decapods and morphological data from all 16 fossil families.&lt;br/&gt;Data will be rigorously analyzed to estimate evolutionary relationships.&lt;br/&gt;The resulting phylogeny will be used to test outstanding hypotheses&lt;br/&gt;concerning decapod evolution and dates of divergences. Taxonomic schemes&lt;br/&gt;will be accordingly revised.  In addition, principal investigator N.&lt;br/&gt;Hanegan, a science educator, will establish collaborative university and&lt;br/&gt;school projects to integrate effective professional development for teachers&lt;br/&gt;with classroom activities for students, centered on state biology content&lt;br/&gt;standards through inquiry-based learning. High school students will be&lt;br/&gt;engaged in research including question development, data collection, and&lt;br/&gt;analysis while interacting with university researchers and other schools in&lt;br/&gt;the Project Crawfish network. Undergraduates, graduate students, and&lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral associates will be trained across the spectrum of techniques as&lt;br/&gt;applied to decapod systematics.  Project Crawfish will train teachers from&lt;br/&gt;15 schools across Utah and Louisiana, impacting 22,500 high school students&lt;br/&gt;(with high minority representation) concepts through experiential learning.&lt;br/&gt;Both the educational and research components will utilize web-based&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of research results and both will strive to produce extensive&lt;br/&gt;peer-reviewed publications, including comprehensive monographic revisions.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
