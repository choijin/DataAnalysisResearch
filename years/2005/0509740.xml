<AbstractNarration>Project Description for"The micromechanics of the lateral line system of zebrafish."&lt;br/&gt;Fish have a sixth sense that detects the flow of water around their bodies. This ability, known as&lt;br/&gt;"distant touch" or the lateral line sense, allows fish to find the direction of flow in a stream, detect obstacles&lt;br/&gt;in the dark, coordinate schooling, locate prey, and avoid predators. Despite the broad importance of the&lt;br/&gt;lateral line sense to the behavior and ecology of fish, it is not understood what mechanical information the&lt;br/&gt;lateral line organ extracts from its environment. The work proposed by Dr. McHenry will examine the&lt;br/&gt;mechanics of individual lateral line structures in order to understand how they filter the mechanical signals&lt;br/&gt;that facilitate flow sensing.&lt;br/&gt;The lateral line detects water movement with an array of microscopic, finger-like structures that&lt;br/&gt;project from the surface of the body. Each structure, known as a superficial neuromast, is composed of a&lt;br/&gt;gelatinous cylinder that is anchored at its base to a group of hair cells, which is the type of mechanosensory&lt;br/&gt;cell found in the human ear. Water movement over the body's surface causes a deflection in the neuromast&lt;br/&gt;that is transduced into a nervous signal by the hair cells. The properties of this signal depend of how much&lt;br/&gt;the neuromast deflects in response to flow, which depends on its shape and material stiffness.&lt;br/&gt;In order to examine the mechanics of superficial neuromasts, McHenry and collaborators will use&lt;br/&gt;larval zebrafish because their transparent bodies allow superficial neuromasts to easily be observed and&lt;br/&gt;manipulated. By measuring the deflection of neuromasts in response to a push by a force probe, they will&lt;br/&gt;calculate their material stiffness. The shape of neuromasts will be measured from a series of high-resolution&lt;br/&gt;images at varying distance away from the body's surface. These measurements will provide the basis of a&lt;br/&gt;mathematical model that treats the neuromast as a flexible beam anchored to a stiff spring.&lt;br/&gt;This model will allow investigators to consider how flow speed affects the signals filtered by the&lt;br/&gt;neuromasts and how different neuromast shapes and their position on the body affects the signals that they&lt;br/&gt;detect. With this understanding for the mechanics of superficial neuromasts, neurobiologists and&lt;br/&gt;behavioral biologists may consider what mechanical signals the lateral line system uses for schooling,&lt;br/&gt;obstacle avoidance, and predator/prey interactions.</AbstractNarration>
