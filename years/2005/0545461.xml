<AbstractNarration>In this CAREER award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Carlos Meriles of the City University of New York -- City College and his postdoctoral and graduate research students will develop a general strategy for high-sensitivity detection of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) for use in micro-imaging and micro-spectroscopy of organic and biological materials.  This will be achieved by detecting the change in nuclear polarization, via long-range dipolar interaction, of a hyper-polarized semiconductor tip as it interacts with a sample.  Prof. Meriles will also develop a new course on imaging methods for graduate students and will further develop his science course for non-science undergraduates.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to its low sensitivity, the spatial resolution of conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is limited.  Scanning microscopy techniques have much better spatial resolution than MRI, but these techniques do not have the superb chemical contrast achievable with MRI.  Prof. Meriles' group hopes to develop a technique that combines strengths of both MRI and scanning microscopy so that scientists may ultimately be able to obtain meaningful MRI images of single biological cells.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Among the advantages are its exquisite chemical selectivity and its non-invasive nature. Despite considerable effort to push the spatial resolution of conventional MRI into the realm of high-resolution microscopy, one invariably confronts fundamental limitations, especially detection sensitivity. Our approach uses a lattice defect in crystalline diamond&mdash;the so-called "NV center" &mdash;as a probe to monitor the minute magnetic field created by neighboring atoms. The NV center behaves as a tiny, atomic-size compass whose orientation&mdash;prepared and read-out using pulses of green light&mdash;changes depending on the local magnetic field. Thus, valuable information on the composition and dynamics of an a-priori unknown sample can be obtained by exposing a NV-center-hosting diamond nanostructure to the local magnetic fields created by electrons and nuclei in a material system (see Fig. 1).

II. Recent research highlights To carry out our experiments we have developed æin houseÆ a state-of-the-art system that integrates a purpose-built high-resolution optical microscope with an atomic force microscope. The former is used to optically initialize and read-out the NV center orientation while the latter allows us to simultaneously characterize and position the host diamond nanostructure. To encode sample information in the NV center signal, it is necessary to apply various sequences of microwave and radio-frequency pulses at more than one frequency. For this purpose we assembled a customized magnetic resonance system that allows us to simultaneously manipulate the alignment of the NV center as well as that of electrons and nuclei of different species present in a typical target sample.

Fig. 2 shows recent work where we address an individual NV center within a single diamond nanocrystal; through microwave manipulation we manage to extend the NV coherence time up to thirty times, bringing it to values comparable to those found in bulk crystals.
