<AbstractNarration>CCF-0546844&lt;br/&gt;Zhendong Su&lt;br/&gt;University of California -Davis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Reliability and Security of Database and Web Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Database and web applications contain many critical faults, seriously undermining the security and reliability of our national information system infrastructures.  Many such errors are introduced because of&lt;br/&gt;these applications' dynamic and complex interactions with outside environments such as dynamically constructing queries to access a database.  Thus, it is important to automatically enforce the correctness of these interactions, but no such technique or tool exists. Consequently, these applications are susceptible to serious failures and security threats.  This project proposes a novel, systematic analysis framework to address this problem.  With static analysis and runtime checking as its foundation, this framework will&lt;br/&gt;offer a rigorous and comprehensive approach to validate and enforce large classes of high-level properties specific to database and web applications.  The additional educational component includes the development of an interdisciplinary course integrating concepts from databases, programming languages, software engineering, and computer security to address the educational need of engineering robust database-intensive applications.  This project is expected to impact both industry and academia.  Analysis tools developed in the project&lt;br/&gt;will be distributed for teaching, research, and experimental evaluation at other institutions and by industry.  This project will also produce publicly available instructional materials including web sites and courseware that help people write more reliable and secure database and web applications, and serve as a clearing house for development tools such as the ones from this project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Our work has equipped application programmers with techniques and tools to write reliable database and web application. The conducted research and education activities have advanced our understanding regarding vulnerability detection and prevention, helped to discover many serious vulnerabilities in widely-deployed software, and trained next generation computer scientists and engineers. More specifically,  - We have devised general and elegant formalizations for both injection and access control vulnerabilities/attacks in web applications.  - We have developed practical techniques to prevent injection attacks at runtime and to detect injection vulnerabilities statically.  - We have developed novel, practical techniques to infer program properties by monitoring a program's execution and to validate the inferred properties by systematic program transformation and testing.  - We have developed effective testing and analysis techniques that have been used to uncover serious vulnerabilities in popular open-source web applications, thus significantly improving the reliability and security of existing software and systems.  - We have substantially advanced our knowledge regarding software reliability and security by formalizing common vulnerabilities and inventing new detection techniques.  - We have disseminated our research results through publications in top outlets such as highly-competitive conferences and premium journals, public tool releases, and research exchanges.  - We have successfully trained the next generation computer scientists (four PhD graduates) through graduate student mentoring and capable software developers through undergraduate- and graduate-level education.
