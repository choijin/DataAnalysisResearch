    <AbstractNarration>The PI proposes to continue work on several problems in set theory, using the&lt;br/&gt;methods of set and class forcing, infinite combinatorics, infinitary logic,&lt;br/&gt;and fine structure. Previous work has shown that certain combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;characterization problems do not have first-order solutions. For example, in&lt;br/&gt;general there is no first-order definition of the set of subsets of omega-2&lt;br/&gt;that, in some omega-1 and omega-2 preserving outer model, have a closed&lt;br/&gt;unbounded subset. Other examples regarding subsets of other cardinals,&lt;br/&gt;branches through trees of certain sorts, and large homogeneous subsets for&lt;br/&gt;certain partitions are known. One line of work concerns settling some further&lt;br/&gt;cases. Another line of work concerns a more fundamental question. Can this&lt;br/&gt;phenomenon can be mitigated by working relative to some reasonable extension&lt;br/&gt;of ZFC, for example, one that is consistent with all large cardinal axioms.&lt;br/&gt;The logically most simple case of incompleteness of the third kind lies&lt;br/&gt;(necessarily) just beyond the scope of Woodin's celebrated generic&lt;br/&gt;absoluteness theorem: Assume CH. Consider Sigma-2-1 sentences of analysis&lt;br/&gt;with sets of reals as parameters. In general the set of such sentences that&lt;br/&gt;are satisfiable in some outer model having the same reals is not first-order&lt;br/&gt;definable. Does there exist an extension of ZFC that is consistent with all&lt;br/&gt;large cardinal axioms and relative to which this set is (lightface) Delta-2-2&lt;br/&gt;definable? Finally, the PI is interested in several questions regarding class&lt;br/&gt;forcing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work centers on incompleteness of a "third kind" in set theory.&lt;br/&gt;Incompleteness in set theory is important because all mathematics can be&lt;br/&gt;formalized in set theory. Propositions that are neither provable nor&lt;br/&gt;refutable from the axioms of set theory cannot be settled&lt;br/&gt;mathematically, at least in our current understanding. Goedel's famous&lt;br/&gt;Incompleteness Theorems show that such propositions exist. Sentences&lt;br/&gt;demonstrating this first kind of incompleteness formalize metamathematical&lt;br/&gt;statements. For example, the formalization of "ZFC is consistent" is neither&lt;br/&gt;provable nor refutable from the axioms of set theory (ZFC), provided those&lt;br/&gt;axioms are, in fact, consistent. Even though "ZFC is consistent" is not&lt;br/&gt;provable from ZFC, there is an obvious reason to favor it over its&lt;br/&gt;negation---studying mathematics within ZFC presupposes that ZFC is consistent.&lt;br/&gt;Incompleteness results proved using Cohen's method of (set) forcing represent&lt;br/&gt;a second kind of incompleteness. Typically, given a "standard" model of ZFC,&lt;br/&gt;one constructs an outer model in which a given statement is true and one in&lt;br/&gt;which it is false. In the case of this&lt;br/&gt;second kind of incompleteness, there is often no reason to favor a statement&lt;br/&gt;or its negation. Deep work by Woodin, Steel, Martin, Foreman,&lt;br/&gt;and a number of others has suggested reasons to favor certain statements up&lt;br/&gt;through a certain level of logical complexity. Just beyond this level of&lt;br/&gt;logical complexity lies incompleteness of a third kind. Here it is not&lt;br/&gt;possible even to say which statements are satisfiable in some outer model.&lt;br/&gt;"Characterization problems" are the combinatorial form of this phenomenon.&lt;br/&gt;Past work of the PI has highlighted that, in general, it is not&lt;br/&gt;possible to characterize in set theory the "satiable objects" of certain&lt;br/&gt;sorts. Precise statements are technical, but an analogy gives the general&lt;br/&gt;idea. In this analogy, the "objects" correspond to equations. An object is&lt;br/&gt;"sated" if the corresponding equation is solvable. An object is "satiable" if&lt;br/&gt;the corresponding equation is potentially solvable, that is, either solvable&lt;br/&gt;or solvable in some larger number system. In elementary mathematics, there is&lt;br/&gt;no reason to distinguish solvable and potentially solvable equations because&lt;br/&gt;typically there exist maximal number systems in which every potentially&lt;br/&gt;solvable equation of a particular sort is actually solvable. Such "maximal&lt;br/&gt;standard models" do not exist in set theory. The analog of an&lt;br/&gt;anticharacterization result in set theory would be a type of equation for&lt;br/&gt;which there cannot be a good criterion for potential solvability.&lt;br/&gt;Anticharacterization is troubling for two reasons. First, in mathematics one&lt;br/&gt;expects that anything that is true is true for a good reason---so there ought&lt;br/&gt;to be a criterion for insatiability. Secondly, in their strongest form, these&lt;br/&gt;anticharacterization results hold only if the universe fails to be&lt;br/&gt;"sufficiently non-minimal". To some extent this threatens the well established&lt;br/&gt;thesis that all of mathematics is formalizable in first-order set theory,&lt;br/&gt;because non-minimality cannot be expressed in this language. The PI&lt;br/&gt;seeks to explore three aspects of anticharacterization. First, he seeks to&lt;br/&gt;determine whether some specific cases of characterization problems are&lt;br/&gt;solvable. Secondly, he seeks to discover whether adding auxiliary axioms to&lt;br/&gt;the usual axioms of set theory might allow satiable objects to be&lt;br/&gt;characterized. This could be construed as evidence in favor of these axioms.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, he seeks to continue work on abstract class forcing with an eye&lt;br/&gt;towards understanding general outer models, at least in the presence of&lt;br/&gt;conditions that render models highly non-minimal.</AbstractNarration>
