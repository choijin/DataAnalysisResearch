<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator and his collaborators will address&lt;br/&gt;several groups of problems  in areas of algebraic geometry,&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, and computational algebraic geometry, with emphasis&lt;br/&gt;on syzygies and their relevance in geometry and combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry at large deals with geometric objects&lt;br/&gt;described by systems of polynomial equations. The area is central to&lt;br/&gt;mathematics since such geometric objects include certain&lt;br/&gt;fundamental examples in the most diverse disciplines&lt;br/&gt;of mathematics.Its importance in the applications&lt;br/&gt;of mathematics comes from the fact that such algebro-geometric&lt;br/&gt;objects provide models often used when representing fundamental&lt;br/&gt;geometric forms via equations and also on a computer.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will study the geometry and algebra&lt;br/&gt;of polynomial ideals in close relation to their complexity,&lt;br/&gt;will investigate several combinatorial aspects related to&lt;br/&gt;his proposed complexity bounds, and will extend the use of&lt;br/&gt;exterior algebra methods to projective geometry.&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator's activity will also include the&lt;br/&gt;development of various fundamental algorithms in computational&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry and their implementation in the Macaulay2&lt;br/&gt;package written by Grayson and Stillman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
