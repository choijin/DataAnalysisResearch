<AbstractNarration>P.I.: Anne Aghion &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0537954&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emmy Award winning filmmaker, Anne Aghion will create a film that explores the human experience of being a scientist in the extreme environment of Antarctica. Her film project entitled, Works and Days: An Antarctic Chronicle, will focus on the stories of several research teams and their relationships to their work, the environment, to each other, and themselves. Specifically, "the film will examine the combination of urgency, patience, arrogance, and humility that enables the scientist to endure the slow reality of routine in the quest for new answers, new data, and more questions." The film will be character-driven, rather than story-driven and firmly anchored in the daily reality of scientific research. With her crew of two people, she will spend 16 weeks living alongside research teams at their field camps in the Dry Valleys and at McMurdo Station. &lt;br/&gt;The film is intended for a wide general audience with the anticipated release of the film in late 2007. To coincide with International Polar Year, the film will be shown in the U.S. on the Sundance Channel. Several distributors have also expressed an interest in acquiring theatrical and DVD rights.
