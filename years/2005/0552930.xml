<AbstractNarration>The Kansas State University's (KSU) REU Site on Ecology and Evolutionary Biology of a Temperate Grassland provides 8 undergraduate students each summer an exciting opportunity to conduct independent, field-based research projects on topics in conservation biology and ecology. The 10-week program has three components that contribute to the professional development of undergraduate participants: i) a weekly research seminar that educates students about the conservation issues related to grassland ecosystems, ii) an independent research project that trains students in field methods and experimental design, and iii) a research symposium that develops student presentation skills. Research activities of this REU Site are centered on the Konza Prairie Biological Station, a 3487 ha tallgrass prairie preserve. Konza Prairie is a key research site in the Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) Program and is internationally recognized for preserving unique biological resources, including species of conservation concern. The site is subdivided into 60 experimental units with different grazing (native bison or domestic cattle) and fire treatments (annual to 20 years). Additional resources for this REU site includes access to university facilities, a range of laboratory and field equipment for specialized ecological research, and mentors selected from a pool of experienced research scientists who are leaders in the fields of conservation and grassland ecology. Integration of the REU Site with the LTER program allows students to participate in new and ongoing field experiments and to utilize long-term data sets that provide context for summer projects. The theme of the program emphasizes applications of ecological knowledge to the preservation of the biota of the tallgrass prairie, and efforts that predict the effects of changing land-use patterns, invasive species and global change on economically valuable grasslands. This REU site welcomes applications from students of underrepresented groups (minority, first-generation or non-traditional), and students at smaller colleges where research opportunities may be limited. Prospective applicants are invited to obtain further information and application forms from the Program Coordinator (Gail Wilson, PH: 785-532-2892, EM: gwtw@ksu.edu) or by visiting the program website (http://www.ksu.edu/bsanderc/reu). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
