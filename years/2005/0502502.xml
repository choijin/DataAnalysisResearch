<AbstractNarration>AST-0502502&lt;br/&gt;Kocevski, Daniel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Kocevski is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of California, Berkeley.  Dr. Kocevski will investigate calibrations to the prompt gamma-ray burst (GRB) emission using data from the upcoming Swift spacecraft, with the primary goal of discovering additional corrections to GRB energies that would allow Swift data to be used in conjunction with upcoming supernovae surveys to constrain cosmological parameters. The distances at which GRBs are observed make them ideal candidates to probe the transition between a decelerating universe to the current accelerating, cosmological-constant-dominated universe. If sufficiently calibrated, GRBs may also place constraints on the recent equation of state of dark energy and its time evolution.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Kocevski will also develop and teach introductory, pre-algebra physics and astronomy courses through the Prison University Project at San Quentin State Prison. This program offers an array of courses leading to an Associate of Arts degree in liberal arts. Dr. Kocevski will additionally work with various graduate and undergraduate student organizations at UC Berkeley to organize volunteer recruitment programs to assist the prison education program as instructors, teaching assistants and guest lecturers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
