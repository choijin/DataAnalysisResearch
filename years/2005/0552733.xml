<AbstractNarration>The REU Site: Interdisciplinary Research on Aging at Washington University Center for Aging (WUCFA) project extends meaningful research opportunities in aging to 10 talented undergraduates for eight weeks each summer.  The majority of the students' time is spent with their mentor in the laboratory setting. Researchers in the fields of anthropology, economics, computer science, civil engineering, psychology, and graphic design serve as mentors. The students work on a hands-on project during the eight-week session and present their project with their mentor during a research symposium the final week of the program. Students also participate in seminar sessions, informal discussion sessions, lab tours, and brown bag "lunch and learn" ethics in science sessions. Intellectual Merit - Most undergraduates have limited opportunities to gain information about, and experience with, current issues in aging. This REU site in aging has been designed to address this problem by providing an opportunity for extensive collaboration between an established investigator in aging and students interested in one or more aspects of the discipline. Participants increase their familiarity with the extant literature, gain general research skills, obtain experience with investigations in aging, and understand some of the ethical considerations specific to aging research. An important aspect of this project is developing an appreciation for the multidisciplinary nature of aging research in the next generation of aging investigators. Broader Impacts - This REU site has a number of broader impacts for the participants, faculty, WUCFA, and Washington University. First, the intensive collaboration between faculty and participants provides an ideal model for integrating discovery and teaching. By contributing to state-of-the-art research projects, REU participants and faculty have the opportunity to make important contributions to different fields of aging. At the same time, faculty provide intellectual and professional role models for participants and thereby encourage and support the next generation. Second, a strong emphasis is placed on recruiting underrepresented groups and individuals with limited opportunities to conduct research. With the average age of the population increasing for the foreseeable future, the ability to provide opportunities for gifted students with limited research opportunities to enter the field is essential to optimize research leading to productive and healthy aging. Moreover, attracting highly qualified individuals from underrepresented groups will serve to strengthen already strong ties between WUCFA and underserved groups within the community.</AbstractNarration>
