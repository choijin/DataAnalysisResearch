<AbstractNarration>Each year this project selects 10 outstanding undergraduates from across the country to participate in  student research projects mentored by faculty in environmental geology, biology, sociology and  economics.  The cohort of students work with W&amp;M faculty mentors to determine the impacts of  changing watershed land use in scientific and socio-economic contexts.  Within local watersheds,  students complete research projects in aquatic and associated upland habitats under increasing  pressures from urbanization.  Investigations of current hydrogeologic and ecological status in  watersheds are completed by analyzing riparian corridor impacts associated with channel  incision, stormwater management effectiveness, spatial variation in water quality, lake-wide  budgets for water, sediment and nutrients, and population/community structure in aquatic and  terrestrial portions of the watershed.  Because the status of any watershed system is the result of  historical changes in land use, sociologic and economic surveys of residents' perception of  development, environmental protection and water and property rights are used to determine the  current direction and strength of population and market forcing functions.  Student teams seek to tackle many fundamental issues in watershed impacts  and protection in developed areas: population and community structure changes in altered  aquatic and terrestrial environments; evolutionary responses of populations to habitat alteration;  water, sediment, and nutrient budgets; riparian corridor function following urbanization-induced  channel incision; and the effectiveness of retention ponds in managing stormwater. Each of these  issues requires communication among students and faculty working in different disciplines.  The  research program provides training in interdisciplinary cooperation that is essential for resolving  complex environmental issues.  The impacts of the study include the promotion of environmental research  training and learning for undergraduates (including underrepresented groups), toward the goal of  enhancing environmental science literacy across relevant disciplines.  The products of research  contribute to a more comprehensive understanding and identification of opportunities for  successful watershed management by participant government and community interest groups.</AbstractNarration>
