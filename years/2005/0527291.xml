<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The first "materials education symposium" from the Materials Research Society was held in 1996 as the Workshop on Materials Education and since then a further seven education-related symposia have been held. These symposia have become the major opportunity where materials educators can present results of innovative curriculum development, the use of new educational and pedagogical methods, lab and multimedia modules, and methods of learning assessment related to materials science.&lt;br/&gt;The topics discussed in these meetings have also included increasing the public awareness and understanding of materials as well as outreach methods.  The goals of the fall 2005 forum are to advance the science, techniques, and effectiveness of materials education through discussion and the exchange of ideas and new approaches to teaching.  The organizers will strive to have a diverse set of speakers from around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: The forum will focus on several key issues concerning materials science education: (i) nanoscience and nanotechnology education, (ii) links to high school and community programs, (iii) materials science and engineering as a tertiary "educational" experience, (iv) educational media, (v) undergraduate research in materials science, (vi) funding for educational innovations in materials, and (vii) accreditation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
