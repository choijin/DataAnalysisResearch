<AbstractNarration>This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports Professor David L. Tierney at the University of New Mexico to investigate a library of model compounds, encompassing 4-, 5- and 6-coordination, by a combination of x-ray absorption spectroscopy and paramagnetic resonance (PMR).  An integrated approach to PMR would be used simultaneously applying mutli-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).   PMR would be used to define the field- and temperature-dependence of electron-nuclear hyperfine interactions in a broad array of hs Co(II) systems. Electronic relaxation will be examined by field- and temperature-dependent NMR relaxation and by NMR dispersion (NMRD).  The behavior of the model systems will guide spectroscopic studies of systems of unknown structure, where x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) will provide additional, critical structural constraints.  The systems for initial focus mimic two key structural elements in the metallobiochemistry of cobalt - Co-Nhistidine and Co-Scysteine. To emulate metal-histidine interactions, we will study a series of bis- (Bp) and tris- (Tp) pyrazolylborate complexes.  Efforts to model Co-Scys interactions will involve common alkyl- and arylthiolate small-molecule chemistry. To bridge the gap between small-molecule and metalloprotein studies, a set of de novo metal-binding peptides, designed to present four cysteine or penicillamine thiolates as potential ligands, will be examined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The application of ENDOR spectroscopy to hs Co(II) systems will help lay the foundation for the full development of Co(II) as a spectroscopic probe of Zn(II) metalloenzymes.  Professor Tierney has re-developed a senior-level, undergraduate "Synthesis and Characterization" laboratory, with experiments developed from his current research.  The student body of The University of New Mexico has a large minority enrollment with a high fraction of undergraduate chemistry majors coming from traditionally under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
