<AbstractNarration>This special meeting will bring together people from the Computational&lt;br/&gt;Statistics and Numerical Linear Algebra communities with people from the&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical Computer Science community to promote cross-fertilization of&lt;br/&gt;ideas.  This will hopefully lead to a better understanding of modern&lt;br/&gt;massive data sets as well as invention of new techniques and algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for their modeling and analysis.  Most conferences and workshops on&lt;br/&gt;information retrieval and data mining are dominated by studies of&lt;br/&gt;traditional data sets and traditional algorithmic techniques.&lt;br/&gt;Nevertheless, modern data sets have become extremely complex and have&lt;br/&gt;rendered traditional approaches for processing them ineffective in many&lt;br/&gt;instances.  The difficulties occur primarily in two ways: modern data sets&lt;br/&gt;are often high-dimensional and massive, and thus novel dimensionality&lt;br/&gt;reduction or sampling-based techniques have to be employed in processing&lt;br/&gt;them, and modern data sets often have complicated nonlinear structures,&lt;br/&gt;and must be modeled with appropriate mathematical objects such as tensors,&lt;br/&gt;symmetric spaces, Lie groups, etc.  This special meeting will study data&lt;br/&gt;sets with such complex structures and explore novel techniques for&lt;br/&gt;analyzing such data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The techniques that will be discussed at the meeting have applicability in&lt;br/&gt;numerous fields of practical and important interest. For example:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Applications in Bioinfomatics and the Medical Sciences include&lt;br/&gt;improved methods to analyze large microarray and high-throughput chemical&lt;br/&gt;data sets for developing new medications, identifying novel gene products,&lt;br/&gt;elucidating protein folding pathways, and the improved detection and&lt;br/&gt;classification of cancer.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Applications in the Social Sciences include improved methods to model&lt;br/&gt;the combinatorial structure of large social networks; this has been used&lt;br/&gt;and will continue to be used to, e.g., identify potential terrorist cells&lt;br/&gt;hidden in a communications network.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Applications in the Geosciences include remote sensors in air-and&lt;br/&gt;spacecraft that produce more data than can currently be stored, but which&lt;br/&gt;must be analyzed for environmental planning, weather forecasting, and&lt;br/&gt;public health contamination issues.&lt;br/&gt;(4) Applications in Computer Vision include novel ways to identify noisy&lt;br/&gt;images of targets and faces for improved target identification and&lt;br/&gt;individual identification in more realistic settings.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
