<AbstractNarration>CTS-0521173&lt;br/&gt;M. Olsen,  Iowa State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is to acquire a high-speed particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) system for fluid mechanics research.  The team of principal investigators collectively has a vast amount of experience in laser-based flow measurement techniques such as PIV and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF). This experience includes contributions in the development and advancement of novel PIV and PLIF techniques, the application of PIV and PLIF to challenging flow conditions and complex flow geometries, and the integration of experimental and computational fluid dynamics into coordinated research programs.  While the acquisition of a high-speed PIV system will benefit a number of ongoing fluid mechanics research projects at ISU, two research projects have been selected for immediate implementation of the high speed PIV system, with the system later made available to other laboratories. These two programs are the turbulent reactive mixing program and the Wind Engineering and Experimental Aerodynamics (WEEA) program. These two programs have been chosen because the research facilities for these programs are already fully operational, and the faculty and students working on these programs have experience in performing PIV and PLIF measurements in these facilities. The acquisition of the high-speed PIV system will complement ongoing efforts to enhance undergraduate education. For example, to integrate classroom instruction and research in the WEEA program, the project's tornado and microburst simulators have been designed to facilitate classroom presentation of laboratory results. With these simulators and with the high-speed PIV system, research results can be directly demonstrated in undergraduate classes, highlighting the relevance of fluid mechanics in real-life applications, and introducing students to the cutting-edge tools used in fluid mechanics research.  The PIs also have a history of providing research opportunities to undergraduate students and of recruiting students from underrepresented groups.   The research advances that will be made possible with the high-speed PIV system will lead to direct benefits to society.. In the WEEA program, the benefits to society are minimizing the loss of human lives and mitigating the damage to ground-based structures. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
