<AbstractNarration>Numerical simulations have suggested that a stable (non-reversing) &lt;br/&gt;geodynamo may be more efficient at generating stronger dipole fields, &lt;br/&gt;and that this condition can arise from a favorable pattern of &lt;br/&gt;laterally varying heat flux across the core-mantle boundary. Thus it &lt;br/&gt;is important both for understanding how the geodynamo works and for &lt;br/&gt;inferring past lower-mantle conditions to find out whether or not the &lt;br/&gt;average field strength really was unusually high during the &lt;br/&gt;Cretaceous Normal Superchron (CNS), the span of time from around 121 &lt;br/&gt;to 83 Ma during which the geodynamo stopped reversing. The &lt;br/&gt;investigators propose a major effort to characterize the &lt;br/&gt;paleomagnetic field intensity and directional dispersion during CNS. &lt;br/&gt;They plan field work to collect lava samples in Madagascar, Korea, &lt;br/&gt;Costa Rica, N. Greenland, and Svalbard erupted during, just before, &lt;br/&gt;and just after the CNS. They will also collect basalt of mid-Miocene &lt;br/&gt;age (a time of high reversal rate) from the Columbia River Plateau. &lt;br/&gt;This research seeks answers to the following important questions that &lt;br/&gt;are still unresolved: (i) whether the average intensity during the &lt;br/&gt;CNS was unusually high, low or unexceptional, (ii) whether there were &lt;br/&gt;long-term intensity trends within the CNS, and (iii) whether the &lt;br/&gt;fluctuation of intensity on time scales of order 104 yr resembled &lt;br/&gt;that of the recent field or was distinctly different. An alternative &lt;br/&gt;conjecture for the occurrence of the CNS is that the geomagnetic &lt;br/&gt;field can switch abruptly into and out of a non-reversing state, &lt;br/&gt;simply by virtue of the highly nonlinear geodynamo processes &lt;br/&gt;operating in the core. The investigators will test this hypothesis by &lt;br/&gt;seeing whether there is an identifiable temporal trend in &lt;br/&gt;paleointensity or dispersion leading up to the beginning or end of &lt;br/&gt;the CNS. This international collaborative project includes bringing &lt;br/&gt;senior scientists, postdocs and students to work together and share &lt;br/&gt;their knowledge and ideas. The scientific results will be made &lt;br/&gt;available in the comprehensive paleomagnetic database currently under &lt;br/&gt;development with NSF support and will be disseminated in journal &lt;br/&gt;articles. The character of the geomagnetic field during the &lt;br/&gt;Cretaceous Normal Superchron also has societal relevance and &lt;br/&gt;interests a broad scientific community trying to understand mantle &lt;br/&gt;behavior and determine potential causal relationships between plumes, &lt;br/&gt;large igneous provinces formation and climatic changes.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
