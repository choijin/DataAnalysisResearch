    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the development of solid state ultraviolet/blue light emitting diode (LED) using novel approaches for ptype doping of ZnO. The proposed concepts offer a solution to current p-type doping problem, which is the main obstacle in the development of all ZnO LED. ZnO has the distinct advantage of having three times the exciton binding energy than that of GaN, leading to potentially much more efficient light emitters. By alloying with other elements, ZnO-based LED can emit light from ultraviolet to the visible. The proposed project will focus on p-type doping and epitaxy growth optimization leading to the realization of all ZnO LED. Understanding gained from the proposed work will benefit and spur the development of other UV devices such as laser diodes, modulators and detectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful the outcome of this project will find widespread applications in civilian and military markets. The applications include general room lighting, traffic lights, outdoor displays, automotive application, and ultrahigh density optical storage systems. The proposed devices will enable unique high power and high temperature operation. This development would provide enabling technology for achieving light emitters based on p-n junctions. Novel emitters with improved performance will expand SVTA's optical product portfolio.</AbstractNarration>
