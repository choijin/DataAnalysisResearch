<AbstractNarration>The investigator studies the problem of finding groups in data&lt;br/&gt;("clustering"). Most existing clustering methods make implicit or&lt;br/&gt;explicit assumptions about the shapes of the groups, for example that&lt;br/&gt;the groups are roughly spherical or Gaussian, and they will fail if&lt;br/&gt;these assumptions are violated. The goal of the project is to develop&lt;br/&gt;(i) nonparametric clustering methods capable of finding groups of&lt;br/&gt;arbitrary shape; (ii) methods for assessing the statistical validity&lt;br/&gt;of the clusters; (iii) tools for visualizing the results. Clustering&lt;br/&gt;is cast as a statistical rather than a purely algorithmic problem. The&lt;br/&gt;observed data are regarded as a sample from some underlying&lt;br/&gt;population, and the goal is to estimate a well defined target&lt;br/&gt;characteristic of the population - the cluster tree - from the&lt;br/&gt;sample. Adopting a statistical view of clustering has two benefits:&lt;br/&gt;(i) it allows comparing the performance of different methods; (ii) it&lt;br/&gt;gives meaning to the notion of "cluster validity". Without a sampling&lt;br/&gt;model and a target characteristic of the population the question&lt;br/&gt;whether clusters are valid or spurious is meaningless. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;method for estimating the population cluster tree is based on&lt;br/&gt;analyzing a graph over the sample but, unlike most other graph-based&lt;br/&gt;clustering methods, it is motivated by the underlying statistical&lt;br/&gt;estimation problem. Assessing cluster validity - determining the&lt;br/&gt;number of distinct groups, with "one" as a possible answer - has&lt;br/&gt;proven a vexing problem, especially in the absence of prior knowledge&lt;br/&gt;or assumptions about group shapes. The investigator proposes a novel&lt;br/&gt;approach to this problem based on resampling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding groups in data is a problem that occurs in many areas, from&lt;br/&gt;genomics (identifying groups of genes with similar function based on&lt;br/&gt;gene expression levels measured by DNA microarrays) to information&lt;br/&gt;retrieval (spotting topics in document collections) to marketing&lt;br/&gt;(determining distinct groups of customers with similar&lt;br/&gt;characteristics). Clustering is an exploratory tool, and there&lt;br/&gt;typically is little or no prior information about the shapes or the&lt;br/&gt;number of groups. It is therefore important to have methods that&lt;br/&gt;automatically determine the number of groups and do not rely on&lt;br/&gt;assumptions about their shape, and visualization tools that help in&lt;br/&gt;understanding the shapes of the groups, their arrangement in feature&lt;br/&gt;space, and the influence of parameters of the clustering method on the&lt;br/&gt;results. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
