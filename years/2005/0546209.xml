<AbstractNarration>This CAREER proposal includes problems related to algebraic and enumerative&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics and its applications to geometry of polytopes, representation&lt;br/&gt;theory, inverse boundary problems, and algebraic geometry.  The proposal&lt;br/&gt;discusses permutohedra and their generalizations, which are certain convex&lt;br/&gt;polytopes related to Coxeter arrangements.  The PI suggests three different&lt;br/&gt;approaches to calculation of volumes and Ehrhart polynomials of such polytopes.&lt;br/&gt;He introduces new mixed Eulerian numbers with remarkable combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;properties.  Various generalizations of permutohedra include Stasheff's&lt;br/&gt;associahedra, Pitman-Stanley polytopes, polytopes related to wonderful&lt;br/&gt;compactifications of De Concini-Procesi, etc. There are intriguing parallels&lt;br/&gt;between these polytopes and generalized associahedra related to&lt;br/&gt;Fomin-Zelevinsky's theory of cluster algebras.  The next part of the proposal&lt;br/&gt;is related to Schur positivity.  The PI with collaborators have recently&lt;br/&gt;resolved several open Schur positivity problems that attracted a lot of&lt;br/&gt;attention, including Fomin-Fulton-Li-Poon's conjecture and Okounkov's&lt;br/&gt;conjecture.  They plan to apply their techniques to prove several other&lt;br/&gt;prominent conjectures.  The proposal mentions a general Schur positivity&lt;br/&gt;conjecture involving a mysterious polytope, which might have relations with the&lt;br/&gt;Klyachko cone and lead to new interesting combinatorics.  The proposal&lt;br/&gt;discusses the inverse boundary problem for networks and its relations with&lt;br/&gt;total positivity.  Networks parametrize the totally positive cells on the&lt;br/&gt;Grassmannian.  This construction has links with Fomin-Zelevinsky's results on&lt;br/&gt;double Bruhat cells and with their theory of cluster algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER proposal describes new initiatives in research and education in the&lt;br/&gt;area of combinatorics.  Combinatorial techniques play an increasingly important&lt;br/&gt;role in other fields such as algebra, geometry, computer science, probability&lt;br/&gt;theory, physics, biology, cryptography, etc. Both the research and the&lt;br/&gt;educational components of the proposal aim on applications of combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal discusses several important combinatorial problems on the&lt;br/&gt;frontiers of modern mathematical research.  These problems involve counting or&lt;br/&gt;enumerating various discrete mathematical objects, say, vertices of a polytope&lt;br/&gt;or pieces in a decomposition of a complicated geometrical object into simpler&lt;br/&gt;objects.  These problems would help to understand, clarify, and simplify&lt;br/&gt;nontrivial mathematical concepts and constructions.  The proposed research&lt;br/&gt;project would have impact in several fields, including algebraic geometry&lt;br/&gt;(which studies geometrical objects using algebra), representation theory (which&lt;br/&gt;studies symmetries), theory of convex polytopes, and theoretical physics.  The&lt;br/&gt;educational part of the proposal includes plans for a new course on modern&lt;br/&gt;applications of combinatorics.  The PI is planning to encourage graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate research.  Combinatorial problems are appealing for undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students because these problems are intuitive and easy to formulate but yet&lt;br/&gt;quite challenging.  The proposal describes plans for using interactive visual&lt;br/&gt;tools and demos, applets, and animations in teaching future combinatorics&lt;br/&gt;courses.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
