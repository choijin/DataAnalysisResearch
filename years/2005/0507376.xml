    <AbstractNarration>AST-0507376&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Columbia University&lt;br/&gt;PI: Fernando Camilo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Collaborative Research: Massive Surveys for Pulsars and Radio Transients Using the Arecibo L-band Feed Array&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Fernando Camilo (Columbia University), Dr. James Cordes (Cornell University) and Dr. Donald Backer (University of California, Berkeley) will undertake a collaborative survey for pulsars and radio transits, using the Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) at the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC) Arecibo Radio Astronomy Observatory. Arecibo1. The survey is expected to reveal a large number (~1500) pulsars and objects that will serve as "laboratories" for a variety of research areas in physics and astrophysics, including studies of the equation of state of nuclear matter, gravity in compact, high-mass binaries, and gravitational-wave backgrounds. Additional serendipitous discoveries are also anticipated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The survey will have broad impact, by revealing sources that will be useful for studies in a variety of areas. Additionally, data management techniques will serve as prototypes for future data-intensive surveys in astronomy. The project will also contribute to the training of graduate students, and outreach to high school and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. NAIC is operated by Cornell University under a Cooperative Agreement with the National Science Foundation.</AbstractNarration>
