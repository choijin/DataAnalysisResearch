<AbstractNarration>Macroecology is the branch of ecology that seeks to identify, and understand the origin of patterns in the distribution and abundance of species across multiple spatial scales.  Numerous metrics of pattern exist, including the dependence of species richness on area censused, the dependence of range size on abundance, and the dependence of species turnover on plot area and inter-plot distance.  Many macroecological theories and models have been proposed and shown to fit specific patterns at specific spatial scales, but a mechanism-based theory that explains the full array of metrics available today, with few adjustable 'fitting parameters', is lacking.  We have recently developed a macroecological model that accurately predicts patterns across spatial scales.  The model is purely statistical in that it is not based on information about birth, death, dispersal, competition, or predation.  The primary goal of this research is to develop a  mechanism-based theory that generates the outcomes of the statistical model.  A secondary goal is to extend, and test against plant and animal data sets from numerous habitats around the world, its range of predictions.  The research will incresase knowledge of the mechanisms underlying complex biodiversity patterns, adding to the fundamental knowledge base of ecology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.   Knowledge of macroecological patterns is critical to formulating local, national and global conservation and land use policies.  Theoretical understanding of species turnover will contribute to our ability to estimate species richness in regions too large to thoroughly census;  developing and testing a technique for reliably estimating species abundance from sparse presence-absence data will aid in estimation of the conservation status of species. Thus our work will contribute to the solution of pressing problems in the worldwide effort to conserve biological diversity.   This project will also broaden representation in the field of quantitative ecology, providing training opportunities for women transferring from the physical sciences to ecology.    &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
