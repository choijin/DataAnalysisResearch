    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prop ID: DMS-0505201 &lt;br/&gt;PI: McKeague, Ian W.&lt;br/&gt;NSF Program: STATISTICS &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Columbia University &lt;br/&gt;Title: Hybrid likelihood methods &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Empirical likelihood is being extended in three directions: to allow &lt;br/&gt;for plug-in estimates of nuisance parameters in estimating equations, &lt;br/&gt;slower than root-n rates of convergence, and settings&lt;br/&gt;in which there are a relatively large number of estimating equations&lt;br/&gt;compared to the sample size. This work is motivated in part&lt;br/&gt;by the need to more effectively compare survival distributions in &lt;br/&gt;clinical trials and cohort studies.&lt;br/&gt;Methods of finding confidence intervals for split points, as &lt;br/&gt;represented by jumps in parametric regression models within&lt;br/&gt;broader semiparametric models, are also being investigated. This &lt;br/&gt;involves developing cube-root asymptotics for hybrid likelihood &lt;br/&gt;methods. A new confidence set is constructed by inverting a&lt;br/&gt;hybrid likelihood ratio statistic. This part of the project is &lt;br/&gt;motivated by an application to the development of a phosphorus &lt;br/&gt;threshold standard for the Everglades. Finally, hybrid likelihood &lt;br/&gt;techniques are being developed for use in HIV vaccine efficacy trials &lt;br/&gt;in which it is important to take into account dependence of the &lt;br/&gt;relative risk of infection on the divergence of infecting HIV viruses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hybrid likelihood provides a unified way of looking at techniques&lt;br/&gt;that adapt a nonparametric likelihood based approach in some way, for &lt;br/&gt;example through the use of plug-in estimates for nuisance parameters, &lt;br/&gt;or by the use of a likelihood derived from a working (but not "true") &lt;br/&gt;model. The use of hybrid likelihood has become increasingly&lt;br/&gt;common in recent years and is attractive in many applied areas because &lt;br/&gt;it combines the power of likelihood based methods with a pragmatic &lt;br/&gt;sense of the need to find tractable and easily implemented&lt;br/&gt;solutions to complex statistical problems. The investigator is &lt;br/&gt;extending the scope of hybrid likelihood methods in a variety of &lt;br/&gt;settings. Methodological work is conducted on three specific topics:&lt;br/&gt;empirical likelihood with applications in survival analysis,&lt;br/&gt;confidence intervals for split points with application to the &lt;br/&gt;estimation of pollution thresholds, and comparison of mark-specific &lt;br/&gt;relative risks with application to the detection of&lt;br/&gt;viral divergence in HIV vaccine efficacy trials.</AbstractNarration>
