<AbstractNarration>This proposal investigates quantum algorithms based on quantum physical processes.The goal&lt;br/&gt;is to identify quantum processes that can be reformulated to serve as quantum algorithms,and to&lt;br/&gt;identify the types of errors that can disrupt these processes.The main focus is on NP-intermediate&lt;br/&gt;problems,which are problems in NP that are neither NP-complete nor in P.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit .One main focus of this research is the study of graph isomorphism,an NP-&lt;br/&gt;intermediate problem that is a central problem in complexity theory.A many-particle random&lt;br/&gt;walk process that may be particularly well-suited to solve this problem will be investigated.Since&lt;br/&gt;the quantum dynamics of many-particle systems can often be e .ciently simulated on quantum&lt;br/&gt;computers but not on classical computers,understanding the performance of the many-particle&lt;br/&gt;random walk may yield new insight into inherently quantum algorithms for this problem.Speci .c&lt;br/&gt;graphs known as strongly regular graphs (already shown to be useful to test critically algorithms&lt;br/&gt;proposed for solving graph isomorphism)will be investigated in detail numerically to test the&lt;br/&gt;many-particle quantum random walk algorithm,and fully characterize its complexity.In addition,&lt;br/&gt;an e .ort will be made to make progress by characterizing the algebraic graph invariants that are&lt;br/&gt;accessible to quantum computers.&lt;br/&gt;Other related problems and methods will also be investigated,including integer factorization,&lt;br/&gt;the discrete logarithm,and .nding short vectors in lattices.It will also be investigated whether&lt;br/&gt;classical algorithms that depend on the birthday paradox can be used to devise new quantum&lt;br/&gt;algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;A complementary research thrust is to analyze the sensitivity of the multi-particle dynamical&lt;br/&gt;algorithms to errors,focusing speci .cally on the scaling of errors as the number of particles increases,&lt;br/&gt;and to understand the connection of the physical processes utilized by the algorithms to the physical&lt;br/&gt;processes that actually occur at the hardware level and use this to improve the e .ciency of quantum&lt;br/&gt;computations.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to extend the limits of computation to qualitatively new problems.&lt;br/&gt;For example,at present one cannot reliably test for the isomorphism of graphs with more than a&lt;br/&gt;few hundred vertices.A quantum computer could,however,accurately compute the dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;quantum particles on graphs of this size.If it is possible to use the information so obtained to test&lt;br/&gt;isomorphism,this would be a signi .cant step forward in conquering complex problems.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts .The proposed work will have broad impact because of the insight it will yield&lt;br/&gt;into hard computational problems.Further broad impact will be through the training of graduate&lt;br/&gt;and undergraduate students with substantial interdisciplinary experience with both computer sci-&lt;br/&gt;ence and physics.In addition to web-based dissemination of research results,an interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;workshop will be held that will help improve communication between computer scientists and&lt;br/&gt;physicists working on problems of common interest.</AbstractNarration>
