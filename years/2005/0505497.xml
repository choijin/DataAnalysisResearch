<AbstractNarration>     The investigator focuses on a mathematical issue in the&lt;br/&gt;description of nanocrystal growth: how to properly resolve the&lt;br/&gt;ill-posedness inherent in dynamic models involving crystalline&lt;br/&gt;surfaces with strong anisotropy.  Strong anisotropy in the surface&lt;br/&gt;energy manifests itself physically in the formation of corners on&lt;br/&gt;a crystal.  Traditional mathematical models applied to the&lt;br/&gt;formation of corners are mathematically ill-posed and thus&lt;br/&gt;intractable.  Because the formation of corners during crystal&lt;br/&gt;growth is ubiquitous, the ill-posedness of corner formation is a&lt;br/&gt;problem inherent in simulations of both industrial and naturally&lt;br/&gt;occurring crystal growth.  Moreover, it is of critical importance&lt;br/&gt;to modeling crystal growth of nanoscale materials because of the&lt;br/&gt;dominant role of surface effects at small length scales.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator characterizes and evaluates different methods&lt;br/&gt;proposed to remove or regularize the ill-posedness.  A widely&lt;br/&gt;employed regularization is a singular perturbation.  A significant&lt;br/&gt;mathematical challenge is to characterize the behavior of the&lt;br/&gt;singularly perturbed corner.  The investigator studies separately&lt;br/&gt;the role of the regularization in three dimensions and its effect&lt;br/&gt;in the presence of elastic stress.  Another important scientific&lt;br/&gt;issue is to determine which of many regularization procedures is&lt;br/&gt;true to the atomic-scale behavior of different materials.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator also considers this question by studying the dynamic&lt;br/&gt;behavior of regularizations in relation to experimental&lt;br/&gt;observations and the relation of regularizations to atomic-scale&lt;br/&gt;models.  Overall, the project has the potential for significant&lt;br/&gt;impact on the understanding of a key mathematical issue regarding&lt;br/&gt;regularization of ill-posedness in a classic moving boundary&lt;br/&gt;problem, and the impact of the work in a broader scientific&lt;br/&gt;context is that it contributes to the understanding of how to&lt;br/&gt;model the growth of crystalline solids in materials science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In the growth of crystals for nanotechnology and other&lt;br/&gt;materials applications, the formation of structures with corners&lt;br/&gt;(as on a grain of salt) is a natural occurrence.  The physical&lt;br/&gt;effects responsible for the existence of a corner are well&lt;br/&gt;understood and a mathematical description of an existing corner&lt;br/&gt;can be accomplished with a classical mathematical model.  However,&lt;br/&gt;the classical model is incapable of describing the actual dynamics&lt;br/&gt;of corner formation.  This problem is present in all mathematical&lt;br/&gt;simulations of crystal growth in which corners form.  Moreover, it&lt;br/&gt;is of magnified importance in the simulation of the growth of&lt;br/&gt;nanoscale structures:  when the crystal decreases in size, corners&lt;br/&gt;become an increasingly dominant part of the overall structure. &lt;br/&gt;Thus, to correctly describe the growth of nanostructured&lt;br/&gt;materials, it is essential to have a correct model for corner&lt;br/&gt;formation.  To obtain tractable models for corner formation,&lt;br/&gt;different "regularization" ideas have been proposed to make the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical problem of corner formation solvable, but there are&lt;br/&gt;many different approaches and no universally accepted procedure. &lt;br/&gt;One aspect of this project is a critical comparison of the&lt;br/&gt;different regularization approaches and how they behave in&lt;br/&gt;relation to actual material systems.  A second aspect of the work&lt;br/&gt;relates to the fact that some of these models are "singular&lt;br/&gt;perturbations," which means that the results obtained when the&lt;br/&gt;regularization effect approaches zero can be different than if the&lt;br/&gt;regularization is not present at all.  This type of unexpected&lt;br/&gt;behavior can mean that a small regularization that is added to&lt;br/&gt;allow for corner formation might give a different corner shape in&lt;br/&gt;simulations than should be present from the accepted classical&lt;br/&gt;model.  Thus, understanding such singular perturbation behavior is&lt;br/&gt;an important part of validating such regularization methods to&lt;br/&gt;ensure that they give the correct overall behavior when used in&lt;br/&gt;large-scale crystal growth simulations.  Taken as a whole, the&lt;br/&gt;project has the potential for significant impact as a building&lt;br/&gt;block in our ability to simulate the fabrication of nanomaterials,&lt;br/&gt;and by extension could contribute to the creation of&lt;br/&gt;purpose-specific materials, especially those with nanoscale&lt;br/&gt;features, in electronics and other applications.  In addition, the&lt;br/&gt;project involves the training of a graduate student and includes&lt;br/&gt;two undergraduate students, for whom the experience may serve as&lt;br/&gt;stimulus to pursue graduate degrees in the mathematical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
