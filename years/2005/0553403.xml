    <AbstractNarration>The investigator studies two topics: statistical&lt;br/&gt;hydrodynamics, and various combinatorial models with their&lt;br/&gt;connections to random matrix theory. With regard to infinite&lt;br/&gt;dimensional stochastic equations and statistical hydrodynamics,&lt;br/&gt;the investigator focuses on three questions. The first concerns&lt;br/&gt;the structure of typical solutions for nonlinear stochastic&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations such as the two-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;stochastic Navier-Stokes equations and the stochastic Burgers&lt;br/&gt;equation. The second concerns the uniqueness of steady states for&lt;br/&gt;inviscid randomly forced equations on unbounded domains. The&lt;br/&gt;third concerns the mechanism of energy transfer from high to low&lt;br/&gt;modes in stochastically forced formally conservative systems. For&lt;br/&gt;each of these questions new analytic approaches and new phenomena&lt;br/&gt;have been described. A goal of this work is to more completely&lt;br/&gt;analyze these phenomena. In combinatorics, growth models, and&lt;br/&gt;random matrix theory the investigator studies basic questions of&lt;br/&gt;Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) random matrix theory, focusing&lt;br/&gt;on the connection of symmetrized combinatorial models to limiting&lt;br/&gt;distributions of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. The questions&lt;br/&gt;considered include problems of random tiling that arise in&lt;br/&gt;physics, polynuclear growth models that arise in the study of&lt;br/&gt;random interfaces, and percolation models that arise in condensed&lt;br/&gt;matter physics and electrical engineering. A goal of the work is&lt;br/&gt;to prove new central limit theorems in the context of GOE random&lt;br/&gt;matrix theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Understanding the small-scale structure of stochastically&lt;br/&gt;forced hydrodynamic equations is related to turbulence theory and&lt;br/&gt;statistical mechanics. The small-scale structure of solutions is&lt;br/&gt;of both theoretical and experimental importance. It is this&lt;br/&gt;structure that matters in turbulent flows arising in many concrete&lt;br/&gt;problems of aerodynamics and fluid mechanics. The particular&lt;br/&gt;questiuons studied here contribute to the current understanding of&lt;br/&gt;this small-scale structure. It has recently become clear that&lt;br/&gt;random matrix theory techniques answer a wide range of questions&lt;br/&gt;in a variety of seemingly unrelated fields. Essentially, random&lt;br/&gt;matrix theory affords a model that captures the fluctuations of&lt;br/&gt;many distinct processes. The questions studied in this project&lt;br/&gt;widen this class of problems and processes and improve the current&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the various phenomena that lead to random matrix&lt;br/&gt;statistics.</AbstractNarration>
