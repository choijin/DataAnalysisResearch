<AbstractNarration>For 34 years, the MBL squid program, with invaluable support from NSF, has enabled neurobiologists, physiologists, and biochemists to study fundamental properties of the nervous system. Over 60 investigators, post-doctorates, and students come to the MBL from May through September specifically to conduct basic and biomedical research using the North Atlantic Long-Finned Squid Loligo pealei.  Another 60 students participate in summer courses using squid as model preparations for learning about the nervous system. The giant axon, stellate ganglia and eye are unique features of squid that make them a premiere biological model for neurobiology, and one that continues to provide vital breakthroughs into mechanisms of synaptic transmission, nerve impulse propagation, cell repair, axonal transport and organelle motility, and ion channel distribution and function. Many of these studies, published in over 100 journal articles in the last 4 years, simply could not be accomplished in any other species.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MBL squid collection program has a broad impact by promoting a cross-exchange of research and education between independent investigators, fellows and the summer courses. The program fosters networking and partnership between independent labs that could not otherwise afford to fund the collection of live squid to conduct their research. Ultimately, the program will have its broadest impact in unlocking the genetic and molecular basis for physiological data gathered from squid neurons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past, NSF has supported about 50% of the cost of squid collection in the summer, with the investigators and the MBL covering the remaining costs. The nature of this grant is similar to support for a highly expensive instrument that many investigators depend on but no individual laboratory or even group of laboratories can afford. This award will allow a continuation of this vital NSF support which will help maintain the services of a research trawling vessel, and provide live squid to researchers from May through September.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
