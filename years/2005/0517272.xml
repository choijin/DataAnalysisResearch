<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second Conference on Indigenous Languages of Latin America (CILLA-II) will be held at the University of Texas at Austin on October 27-29, 2005.  The objectives of the conference are to bring together linguists who work on any aspect of the linguistics of Latin American indigenous languages to exchange the most recent results of their research.  Roughly three groups of scholars form the core of this conference:  Latin American nationals who work on the indigenous languages of their countries and other countries in Latin America, linguists who are native speakers of indigenous languages, and other scholars who work on Latin American indigenous languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference provides a forum for researchers from many different countries and with similar interests to meet. It facilitates an examination of common factors that have resulted from similar sociolinguistic situations of Latin American languages and of areal features among language families that are distributed across more than one country or that have arisen through significant diffusion across language families.  The conference also contributes to the continuing education of speakers of indigenous languages who are engaged in linguistic research, and to the integration of linguists from different countries and different language backgrounds in common research efforts.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
