<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the Basic Plasma Science Facility (BaPSF) at the University of California, Los Angeles. The purpose of BaPSF is to provide the general plasma community access to a frontier level research device (the LAPD-U) that permits the exploration of fundamental plasma problems that cannot be pursued in small devices or in the large fusion facilities. Qualified researchers from universities, national laboratories and industry can perform experiments, free of charge, upon approval of their proposals by a Scientific Council composed of senior scientists broadly representative of the plasma community. The plasmas and equipment available at BaPSF allow the detailed study, under controlled conditions, of processes involving a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. The studies at BaPSF address contemporary topics at the frontier of basic plasma, space and fusion science research. The studies span microscopic phenomena on the&lt;br/&gt;fast electron time scales (e.g, electron plasma waves, cyclotron radiation) to the slow&lt;br/&gt;transport scales characteristic of drift-wave turbulence and long wavelength magnetic&lt;br/&gt;fluctuations. New thrusts include plans to coordinate and implement new community-driven  campaigns in research areas of major impact to fusion and space researchers and a theory driven  mode. The major campaigns will be led by a scientist from outside UCLA who will organize and  steer the experimental campaign with assistance from the BaPSF staff. The theory driven mode is designed to satisfy the pressing need for detailed data to benchmark major results of the  theoretical and modeling communities. These experiments will involve collaborations between  scientists from the theoretical and modeling community and an experimentalist from the BaPSF  staff.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

To illustrate the type of data one can acquire we present the example of  a set of experiments that have revealed three dimensional magnetic field line reconnection triggered when a dense plasma expands in to background magnetized plasma. Reconnection is a processes that can convert the energy in magnetic field to energized particles and flows. This unique, highly reproducible experiment will lead to a deeper understanding of the phenomena of magnetic field line reconnection.  Reconnection is one of the main candidates to explain thehigh temperature of the solar corona (The corona is one million degrees C while the surface of the sun only 8000). It also has been observed by satellites in the plasma that surrounds the earth and has fundamental importance in a host of astrophysical processes.

The figure blow is a analglyph (you need red/blue glasses to see it properly) of measured three dimensional magnetic fields in a plasma undergoing reconnection.   The LAPD plasma is highly reproducible and this experiment ran for 21/2 weeks round the clock to acquire this data set.   The BaPSF has been very successful and was renewed for five more years of operation (starting Jan 1, 2011) by NSF/DOE who co-sponsor its operations with a collaborative research award.
