<AbstractNarration>Summary and Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;A group led by the PI will develop a highly sensitive adhesion experiment designed to assess&lt;br/&gt;the interactions between well characterized model surfaces in water. The measurement is based&lt;br/&gt;on the contact between a synthetic polymer membrane and a quartz crystal resonator. The&lt;br/&gt;membrane consists of an elastic layer at the air/water interface, and is an excellent model for a&lt;br/&gt;variety of materials ranging from synthetic polymer gels to living tissues. The membrane&lt;br/&gt;surface and the surface with which it interacts will both be coated with molecules that are&lt;br/&gt;designed to eliminate non-specific background adhesion between the two surfaces. Specific&lt;br/&gt;adhesion molecules will then be added to both surfaces, and the adhesion energy will be related&lt;br/&gt;to the interaction potential of the individual bonds, and to their surface concentration. The&lt;br/&gt;experiments are conceptually similar to dewetting experiments, with contact of the membrane&lt;br/&gt;and the surface corresponding to a region where water has been largely excluded from between&lt;br/&gt;the contacting surfaces. The experimental geometry is designed to give sensitivity to very small&lt;br/&gt;contact angles, and hence to very small adhesive interactions. Membrane elasticity serves two&lt;br/&gt;important functions. The first of these is to extend the range of adhesive interactions that can be&lt;br/&gt;probed so that the molecular origins of mechanical toughness of soft, highly deformable&lt;br/&gt;materials can be thoroughly investigated. The second function of membrane elasticity is to&lt;br/&gt;provide a means for fixing the adhesive molecules in place while isolating the system from the&lt;br/&gt;surrounding air environment so that the surfaces remain hydrated, even while in mechanical&lt;br/&gt;contact with one another. A detailed mechanical analysis will be developed for cases where the&lt;br/&gt;adhesion energy is large enough so that elastic effects must be taken into account. Additional&lt;br/&gt;information about the nature of the mechanical contact will be obtained by monitoring the&lt;br/&gt;frequency shift and dissipation of the quartz crystal resonators in the vicinity of a mechanical&lt;br/&gt;resonance of the crystal. The experimental methodology can be applied to a wide variety of&lt;br/&gt;adhesion problems in polymer physics and in biology, but experiments will begin with studies&lt;br/&gt;utilizing adhesive molecules that are very well characterized at the single molecule level.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The PI has developed a unique online multimedia text in polymer science that will undergo&lt;br/&gt;continued revision during this funding cycle. Additional contributions to undergraduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate education will result directly from the proposed work, with three Ph.D. students&lt;br/&gt;and between 6 and 8 undergraduate students being trained in various aspects of mechanics,&lt;br/&gt;polymer physics and polymer synthesis. International experience will also be obtained as part of&lt;br/&gt;a collaboration with Prof. Diethelm Johannsmann at the University of Clausthal in Germany.&lt;br/&gt;Two Ph.D. students will conduct research in the Johannsmann laboratory during the course of&lt;br/&gt;this project, and two students from the Johannsmann laboratory will visit the PI's lab at&lt;br/&gt;Northwestern. Existing outreach activities will continue at local high schools and middle schools&lt;br/&gt;in Evanston and Chicago. The enhancements in mechanical characterization capabilities&lt;br/&gt;resulting from the proposed work will benefit a variety of research groups at Northwestern, in&lt;br/&gt;addition to scientists and engineers at local companies who utilize the micromechanics lab&lt;br/&gt;supervised by the PI. The broader scientific impact of the work will be felt most strongly in the&lt;br/&gt;biomaterials community, by providing a means for quantifying adhesion in practically relevant&lt;br/&gt;biological systems that are amenable to the membrane geometry.</AbstractNarration>
