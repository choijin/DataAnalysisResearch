<AbstractNarration>Absract &lt;br/&gt;The research deals with an integrated research and education plan to evaluate and develop a durable bridge system for use in cold regions. The bridge system consists of glass fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composite deck and precast/prestressed concrete I-girders. The primary  objectives are: (1) understanding the synergistic effects of low temperature and low-temperature thermal cycling combined with fatigue loading on the performance of FRP composite bridge decks in cold regions, and (2) quantifying the horizontal shear stiffness of typical deck-to-girder connection systems and developing the connection design criteria based on the shear stiffness rating of the connection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the technical barrier to the use of composite materials in infrastructure applications is lack of data on environmental durability specific to typical infrastructure environments and for the types of composite materials that are likely to be deployed in the infrastructure. This project could potentially provide a basis for making long-term predictions about FRP composite material properties behavior under cold environmental conditions.&lt;br/&gt;The basic knowledge obtained is likely to be of long-lasting value. It can especially advance the knowledge base for application of structural materials, including effects derived from interaction with a natural environment. By using the appropriate materials and structural forms, the research will ultimately extend beyond Alaska and will benefit other regions.&lt;br/&gt;This project will enhance graduate student education through curriculum development and give undergraduate students an opportunity for research experience in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) by involving them in the research project. Another objective of the educational program is to involve K-12 students through UAF Alaska Summer Research Academy. These students will be exposed to structural engineering, and especially women and minority students in high schools will be mentored to encourage careers in structural engineering and to improve enrollment of traditionally underrepresented groups in engineering fields. With enrollments down and retirements up, what will our future engineering look like? A key part of the answer lies in the underrepresented majority, as pointed out in the recent ASEE 2003 Annual Conference &amp; Exposition. This project also involves the development of a seminar series accessible through the World Wide Web (WWW) for remotely located professional engineers in the area of structural composite and precast concrete as alternative construction materials, which can extend the construction season in Alaska.&lt;br/&gt;This research will improve engineering research, education, and, ultimately, the engineer resource pool in cold regions. This project is congruent with the mission of UAF in that it will advance knowledge of natural and technological systems and include a northern perspective on research and education. The PI is a member of the engineering faculty at an EPSCoR institution, and this project will support the development of advanced material testing facilities at UAF, thus enhancing our infrastructure for future research and education goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
