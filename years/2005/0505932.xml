<AbstractNarration>In one-period risk measurement, the risky objects are future&lt;br/&gt;net worths modelled by elements of a linear space of real-valued random variables&lt;br/&gt;and a risk measure is a mapping from this space of random variables to the real numbers.&lt;br/&gt;Typical examples of future net worths are the accounting value of a&lt;br/&gt;firm's equity, the surplus of an insurance company or the market&lt;br/&gt;value of a portfolio of financial securities.&lt;br/&gt;In a dynamic setup one can model the future evolution of net&lt;br/&gt;worths with stochastic processes and risks can be calculated at&lt;br/&gt;initial and later times. A process of risk measures is called time-consistent if&lt;br/&gt;it assigns to a future financial position the same risk irrespective of whether it is&lt;br/&gt;calculated directly or in two steps backward in time. The purpose of this project&lt;br/&gt;is to understand the structure of time-consistent processes of monetary risk measures,&lt;br/&gt;find good examples and study their implementation on a computer. It involves methods&lt;br/&gt;from the general theory of stochastic processes, locally convex vector spaces as&lt;br/&gt;well as techniques from linear and convex optimization.&lt;br/&gt;Monetary risk measures are formally strongly related&lt;br/&gt;to pricing in incomplete markets, hedging under constraints,&lt;br/&gt;maxmin expected utility functionals,&lt;br/&gt;exact games in cooperative game theory as well as to&lt;br/&gt;coherent lower previsions in the theory of imprecise probabilities.&lt;br/&gt;Since in most of these theories the dynamical aspects are not elaborated&lt;br/&gt;yet, research on the dynamics of monetary risk measures will&lt;br/&gt;also produce new results in other areas of mathematics and economics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work is expected to lead to a new class of risk&lt;br/&gt;measures and algorithms for their numerical calculations. The new&lt;br/&gt;risk measures will be time-consistent and have good properties for the purposes&lt;br/&gt;of pricing, allocation of risk capital and fair premium calculation. This will lead&lt;br/&gt;to better methods for the regulation of the banking and insurance&lt;br/&gt;industry, the internal risk management of corporations and a&lt;br/&gt;realistic assessment of risks the society bears through federal&lt;br/&gt;agencies like the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which&lt;br/&gt;guarantees pension benefits promised by insolvent pension plans.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
