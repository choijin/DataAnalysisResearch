    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is for support of continuing research on problems in computational complexity theory. It presents detailed plans of attack on the following specific topics:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algorithmic Randomness: Recent progress in the field of derandomization gives tools to convert randomized algorithms into deterministic ones. This yields new connections between \Algorithmic Information Theory" (or \Kolmogorov Complexity") and circuit complexity as an unexpected side-product. This may yield novel and useful characterizations of complexity classes; some initial theorems of this sort have been obtained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Constant-Depth Circuits: The complexity class ACC0 (consisting of problems computed by bounded-depth circuits of And, Or, and Modm gates) is of great interest to theoreticians, because (a) it is the smallest class of circuits not known to be unable to compute every problem in NP, and (b) in contrast, it seems to be very closely related to classes of circuits known to be unable to compute some very simple functions. Because&lt;br/&gt;of recent results that give new graph-theoretic characterizations of ACC0, and because of new results that relate arithmetic complexity to Boolean complexity, it is proposed that renewed attention be placed on the problem of trying to prove lower bounds for ACC0, and on the problem of extending the recent characterizations to more complexity classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Constraint Satisfaction Problems: Many important problems in artificial intelligence and in database theory (and elsewhere) can be expressed as constraint satisfaction problems. One of the fundamental theorems about these problems is that, up to polynomial-time equivalence, there are only two kinds of problems. Either they are in P, or they are NP-complete. Recent work with collaborators suggests that if one considers&lt;br/&gt;the natural reducibilies that are used to investigate subclasses of P, then there is no longer a dichotomy, but instead a partition into six classes of equivalent problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit of the proposed activity: The goal of this activity is to clarify the relationship among complexity classes, which is the best tool currently available for understanding the computational complexity of real-world computational problems. Some of these problems are notoriously dificult, but recent progress justifies some optimism that additional useful insight about these complexity classes can be obtained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity: An important part of this proposal is a request for support for a graduate student. In addition to helping obtain research results, this support would have the effect of training a new researcher and educator. This support would also help the student to participate in professional meetings and workshops, and help strengthen those institutions, which are the principal forums for dissemination of these research results. The long-term goals of research in computational complexity, if finally achieved, will have profound impact on society (for instance, by providing firm mathematical underpinnings to public-key cryptography, which currently rests upon many unproven conjectures). The proposed research offers concrete plans for incremental progress toward this long-range goal.</AbstractNarration>
