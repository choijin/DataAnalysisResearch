<AbstractNarration>The study of individual-level public opinion and behavior has flourished in recent&lt;br/&gt;decades. But understanding of the dynamics of mass opinion prior to the 1950s has&lt;br/&gt;been undermined by the absence of high-quality, individual-level data. Over 450 national&lt;br/&gt;opinion polls were conducted from 1935-1945. However, these surveys have not been&lt;br/&gt;exploited by the social science community because they are not easily usable. The data&lt;br/&gt;often contains numerous miscodings and other errors. In addition, the surveys employed&lt;br/&gt;now-discredited quota sampling procedures. The principal investigators  recode the&lt;br/&gt;datasets and implement and disseminate methods appropriate for analyzing this historical&lt;br/&gt;public opinion data. By applying methods that make quota sample data usable, this&lt;br/&gt;project opens up a new realm for public opinion research in the U.S. and other&lt;br/&gt;countries, such as England, that have used quota-sampling methods.&lt;br/&gt;Recovering this early opinion data promises to illuminate critical questions&lt;br/&gt;concerning the role of the mass public in the political system. The public opinion polls&lt;br/&gt;from this time contain a plethora of valuable items measuring attitudes concerning&lt;br/&gt;economic policy, World War II, and racial relations. The principal investigators  use&lt;br/&gt;the polling data on attitudes toward international intervention to determine how the mass&lt;br/&gt;public guided and reacted to foreign policy decisions during the Second World War,&lt;br/&gt;thereby expanding the systematic study of public opinion and war to include the most&lt;br/&gt;significant international conflict in American history. The principal investigators also&lt;br/&gt;use the opinion data on domestic policy as a resource for examining the relationship&lt;br/&gt;between the mass public and both the programmatic accomplishments and limitations of&lt;br/&gt;the New Deal.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity&lt;br/&gt;This project makes available to the social science research community a trove&lt;br/&gt;of public opinion data that has largely been ignored in the past. The principal&lt;br/&gt;investigators  compile and produce readily usable computer files for roughly 450&lt;br/&gt;opinion polls undertaken in the United States from 1935 to 1945. These files are&lt;br/&gt;available through the Roper Center in Storrs, CT. However these data are almost&lt;br/&gt;impossible to use in their existing condition. The principal investigators  recode the&lt;br/&gt;individual files, prepare documentation, and make available a series of weights to&lt;br/&gt;mitigate the biases resulting from quota-control sampling. The investigators  also&lt;br/&gt;compile the individual polls into a series of cumulative datasets. These efforts make&lt;br/&gt;the data more easily accessible to the larger social science research community.&lt;br/&gt;The project also promises to expand the field of political behavior by promoting&lt;br/&gt;the study of historical public opinion. It  provides to the community of scholars a&lt;br/&gt;wealth of individual-level opinion data in the pre-1950 era, allowing researchers to gain&lt;br/&gt;new insights into an array of substantively important topics, such as changes in&lt;br/&gt;Americans' racial attitudes and public support for the early American welfare state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
