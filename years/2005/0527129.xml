<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;We are submitting this proposal to request NSF support for a Quantum Control Summer&lt;br/&gt;School, to be held 8-14 August 2005 at the California Institute of Technology. This&lt;br/&gt;school is being organized in response to burgeoning interest among physicists, engineers&lt;br/&gt;and applied mathematicians in exploring the principles and applications of control in&lt;br/&gt;systems whose behavior is manifestly quantum mechanical. The lectures will be addressed&lt;br/&gt;mainly to graduate students and senior researchers who are just getting started in the&lt;br/&gt;field, but will include some advanced presentations to provide some perspective on&lt;br/&gt;research frontiers. We have already secured seed funding for the summer school from&lt;br/&gt;Caltech's initiative in Information Science and Technology, but we are seeking additional&lt;br/&gt;support from government agencies including the NSF and AFOSR.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Control theory is a central discipline in modern engineering, but so&lt;br/&gt;far there has been only preliminary research on extending its constitutive methodologies&lt;br/&gt;to incorporate quantum dynamics and measurement. Applications areas for quantum control&lt;br/&gt;theory range from protein structure determination to precision measurement and metrology,&lt;br/&gt;and deep connections have been identified with the field of quantum computation. We&lt;br/&gt;anticipate that this summer school can play a critical role in stimulating the development&lt;br/&gt;of quantum control, as it has the enthusiastic support of important constituencies in&lt;br/&gt;control theory, mathematical physics, atomic physics, quantum optics and condensed matter&lt;br/&gt;physics.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: This summer school will provide a unique educational experience for both&lt;br/&gt;students and senior researchers who attend. Its topic is inherently interdisciplinary and&lt;br/&gt;has sufficiently strong intellectual appeal to draw the attention of leading researchers&lt;br/&gt;in both engineering and pure physics. It seems reasonable to hope that events of this&lt;br/&gt;kind will spur a synthesis of quantum physics, dynamical systems theory and probability&lt;br/&gt;theory in the same way that early workshops on quantum computation facilitated the&lt;br/&gt;development of a common language for physicists and computer scientists.</AbstractNarration>
