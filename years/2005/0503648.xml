<AbstractNarration>                             ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prop ID:  DMS-0503648  &lt;br/&gt;PI:  Hobert, James P.  &lt;br/&gt;NSF Program: STATISTICS    &lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of Florida  &lt;br/&gt;Title:  Exact and Approximate Markov Chain Sampling Algorithms   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The disadvantages of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods (relative&lt;br/&gt;to classical Monte Carlo techniques) can sometimes be overcome via&lt;br/&gt;perfect sampling, which is a method of converting the underlying&lt;br/&gt;Markov chain into an algorithm that produces independent and&lt;br/&gt;identically distributed samples from its stationary distribution.&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, perfect sampling algorithms have not lived up to their&lt;br/&gt;expectations for handling intractable distributions whose support is&lt;br/&gt;unbounded and continuous.  The investigator develops a wide-ranging&lt;br/&gt;perfect sampling algorithm that is particularly well-suited to such&lt;br/&gt;distributions.  The basic idea is to exploit a mixture representation&lt;br/&gt;of the a stationary distribution.  The investigator also studies&lt;br/&gt;techniques for Bayesian analysis of the market model, which is a&lt;br/&gt;multivariate regression model used by financial economists to analyze&lt;br/&gt;data on asset returns.  Empirical evidence and theoretical arguments&lt;br/&gt;suggest that the errors in this model should be from a heavy-tailed,&lt;br/&gt;elliptically symmetric distribution.  However, the Bayesian&lt;br/&gt;methodology that has been developed for making inferences via the&lt;br/&gt;market model is based on the assumption of multivariate normal errors.&lt;br/&gt;This disconnect is presumably due to the fact that the posterior&lt;br/&gt;distributions corresponding to the heavy-tailed alternatives are&lt;br/&gt;highly intractable.  The PI develops and analyzes Monte Carlo and MCMC&lt;br/&gt;methods for exploring such posterior distributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bayesian statistical methods of analyzing data often require the user&lt;br/&gt;to deal with intractable probability distributions.  The investigator&lt;br/&gt;develops sampling algorithms that facilitate the use of such Bayesian&lt;br/&gt;methods.  These algorithms enhance infrastructure for research and&lt;br/&gt;education by providing scientists from many different disciplines with&lt;br/&gt;better techniques for making inferences from their data.&lt;br/&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
