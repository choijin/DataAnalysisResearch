<AbstractNarration>Workshop Proposal:&lt;br/&gt;Crossings: Applying Research Findings to&lt;br/&gt;Cross-Border Security Cooperation&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;A team of academic researchers, public officials, and industry leaders in southeastern Michigan&lt;br/&gt;and southwestern Ontario propose to conduct a workshop on the cultural and institutional&lt;br/&gt;challenges of cross-border security cooperation, and the application of research findings in&lt;br/&gt;disaster management and organization research to issues of cooperation. We observe that a&lt;br/&gt;growing class of disasters are those that observe no political boundaries, including international&lt;br/&gt;frontiers: certain of these, particularly those involving biohazardous events, can be compounded&lt;br/&gt;by the differences in cultural values and institutional assumptions (for example: accessibility of&lt;br/&gt;health care) on different sides of a border.&lt;br/&gt;To create a research agenda for understanding these issues, and for applying the findings of basic&lt;br/&gt;research, we propose to bring together researchers and disaster management practitioners from&lt;br/&gt;both Canada and the United States for an intensive, one-day discussion of the challenges posed by&lt;br/&gt;these new problems in crisis management and the new opportunities for solving them afforded by&lt;br/&gt;current academic research. In the scope of an intensive, well-staffed discussion between&lt;br/&gt;academics and practitioners, we will be able to identify specific opportunities for applying the&lt;br/&gt;research results of multiple projects, and to identify critical areas for future research collaboration&lt;br/&gt;between Canada and the United States.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be jointly sponsored by institutions in Canada and the United States.&lt;br/&gt;Contributions to Theory and Method&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will be an agenda-setting workshop, building a consensus among leading&lt;br/&gt;academics in the United States and Canada, and practitioners at the state, provincial, and&lt;br/&gt;municipal levels, for applied research in crisis management. It will give particular focus to the&lt;br/&gt;application of simulations and modeling, particularly agent-based models of cooperation, to&lt;br/&gt;issues of improving organizations' response to disasters.&lt;br/&gt;Broad Social Impact&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together the users of crisis management research findings with the&lt;br/&gt;producers of that research. Numerous areas that we have already identified where research could&lt;br/&gt;improve practice  in the design of drills and scenarios for improved learning, in the&lt;br/&gt;implementation of communication technologies for improved coordination, and in the&lt;br/&gt;improvement of organizational learning from crises  can be quickly implemented following this&lt;br/&gt;important meeting of researchers and practitioners.</AbstractNarration>
