<AbstractNarration>"Researching Mathematics Leader Learning (RMLL)" is a five-year research project to study mathematics professional development leaders' understandings and practices associated with developing mathematically rich learning environments.  Using quantitative and qualitative research methods, RMLL investigates this issue by considering:  How can leaders cultivate professional development environments in which teachers have a greater opportunity to grapple with and deeply understand mathematics?  Working with four groups of mathematics leaders (75 to 100 total), RMLL studies how explicit attention to the cultivation of sociomathematical norms influences leaders' understanding of the process of creating mathematically rich environments and the impacts on their practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ What leaders of PD actually need to know and be able to do in their practice has been under-defined and understudied. Designed to begin to fill this gap, the six-year Researching Mathematics Leader Learning (RMLL) research project studied mathematics professional development leadersÆ understandings and practices associated with developing mathematically rich learning environments for teacher learning. Working with 72 leaders from several sites, the project used quantitative and qualitative research methods to investigate this issue by considering: How can leaders cultivate professional development environments where teachers have a greater opportunity to grapple with and understand mathematics deeply?       The Intellectual Merit of the project includes the following: 1) leaders developed a new awareness of attending to mathematical purposes in PD (specialized content knowledge), shifting attention to consideration of the nature and substance of mathematical conversations (sociomathematical norms) as opposed to a focus only on politeness; and 2) leaders embraced and employed a set of practices designed to lead to rich mathematical conversations.     This project has also identified a set of critical needs within the researcher and leader community to: 1) more clearly articulate goals for teacher learning; 2) design tasks for teachers that align with these learning goals and 3) identify videocases, or other artifacts of practice that exemplify how the mathematical work one does with teachers is different than the mathematical work with students.  Each of these central ideas has implications for future preparation of mathematics PD leaders.     The Broader Impacts of the project are that findings from this research can help leaders to better understand how to keep the mathematics at the core of their work with teachers, to increase the chances that teachersÆ content knowledge (the knowledge needed for teaching mathematics) is deepened and enriched.  These findings have been shared in over 30 research papers as well as in numerous presentations at professional meetings.
