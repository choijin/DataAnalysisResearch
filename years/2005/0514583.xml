<AbstractNarration>Within the past 15 years the status of the Welsh language in Wales has changed dramatically: where Welsh was once banned from public use, it now shares co-official-language status with English. Where Welsh speakers recently faced discrimination, they are now sought out for positions in high-prestige fields such as the government and media. In the wake of these changes, a record number of people are choosing to learn the language. This dissertation research by a cultural anthropologist at Washington University in St. Louis explores the socialization of adult Welsh language learners in Cardiff, Wales. Using field techniques that include participant observation, media reception studies, and extensive interviews, the project addresses how these learners deal with often conflicting normative signals during their socialization as 'legitimate' or 'authentic' Welsh speakers. These signals include both explicit and symbolic commentary on aspects of the Welsh language in the media, and cues from language instructors and native speakers in interaction. Research objectives include documenting macro- and micro-level normative signals aimed at learners; exploring how these signals inform learners' language attitudes, behaviors, and definitions of what a Welsh speaker is; and understanding the extent to which the 'Welsh learner' label amounts to a new category of social identification. This research will contribute to cultural and linguistic anthropology by bridging macro- and micro-level factors behind new ideologies and social categories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Welsh represents a rare potential example of successful language revitalization. Members of other endangered-language communities, such as the Maori, Irish, Basque, and Cornish, pay close attention to developments in Welsh language policy and education. Research into the experiences of Welsh language learners will therefore provide valuable insights to groups attempting to preserve their native languages. In addition the project advances the education of a young social scientist. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
