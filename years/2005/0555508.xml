<AbstractNarration>This project represents a continuation of a long series of experiments that pose ever-increasingly more stringent tests of fundamental quantities and symmetries, including:&lt;br/&gt;1. the electron magnetic moment (often called its g value)&lt;br/&gt;2. the fine structure constant alpha&lt;br/&gt;3. most stringent test of CPT (charge-parity-time) invariance with leptons&lt;br/&gt;4. the ratio of the masses of the proton and electron&lt;br/&gt;5. the proton and antiproton magnetic moments&lt;br/&gt;Technological spinoffs of this research have been incorporated into ion cyclotron resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging, and the improvement of promising new detectors continues, demonstrating broader applicability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A better value of alpha is crucial to determining a number of the set of fundamental constants that are needed by a technological society. Quantum electrodynamics (QED) incorporates alpha into its description of the interaction of matter and light. It is the prototype quantum field theory, serving as the model which theoretical efforts to describe strong interactions and gravity seek to emulate. An outstanding achievement of QED is the predicted relationship between the electron magnetic moment g and alpha,  which allows alpha to be determined by measuring g,  Given the success of calculating the parameters describing this relationship, QED theory now contributes 43 times less uncertainty to g than do previous measurements. A sufficiently improved measurement of g will thus determine alpha 43 time more accurately. An independent measurement of alpha, along with the measurement of g, will test QED to an unprecedented level of accuracy  the most precise comparison of any theory and experiment.  The experimental precision, with the theoretical accuracy expected in calculations underway, should allow distinguishing between inconsistent values of alpha measured from the quantum Hall effect, the ac Josephson effect, and from a neutron measurement.  An iodine clock and optical comb developed for this work, technologies of much broader applicability for communications, will make possible absolute frequency measurements and more accurate measurements of frequency intervals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The most accurate measurements of the property of an electron, in fact the most accurate measurement of the property of any elementary particle building block of our universe, were an outcome of this research program.  The intellectual merit is that these measurements probe more precisely and deeply than ever before our mathematical description of the fundamental nature of the electrons that make up so much of ourselves and our universe, along with the interactions of electrons with their environment.   Testing this fundamental mathematical description, called quantum electrodynamics (or QED for short), is extremely important since even small deviations could potentially lead to large changes in our fundamental understanding of reality and for the physics, chemistry and technological devices whose properties we predict and describe using this mathematical description.   Currently, these precise measurements of the electronÆs magnetism and QED together determine the fundamental fine structure constant. This constant gives the strength of the electromagnetic interaction in the low energy limit and it characterizes the size of a wide variety of phenomena, ranging from the energy scales in atoms, to the ac Josephson effect, to the quantum Hall effect. In addition, the fine structure constant is one of the crucial measured constants (along with the Rydberg and Planck's constant) for accurately determining the system of basic units that are important to a technological society rooted in science.   The devices and methods that made these unusually precise measurements possible are interesting and important in their own right.  They include a cylindrical Penning trap cavity cooled to 100 mK, quantum nondemolition observations of one-quantum transitions of a single electron, self-excitation of a one-particle oscillator, feedback cooling, inhibition of spontaneous emission, quantum jump spectroscopy of one electron's spin and cyclotron levels and cavity sideband cooling.   Substantial progress has also been made towards realizing the first one-electron qubit as a possible building block for quantum computing applications.  These methods and devices are now part of the scientific base from which others will, over time, construct new technologies.  Without such a fundamental science base a technological society cannot progress. The broad impact of this work is illustrated by secondary reports on these measurements (e.g. in Physics Today, Science, Nature), many scientific talks, and many citations. The American Institute of Physics selected these measurements as the Physics Story of the Year when the first measurement was reported. Junior participants who learned their craft doing this work, one of whom won the DAMOP thesis prize, are engaged in successful research and industrial careers related to various subfields of physics. Undergraduates who participated were admitted into leading graduate programs.         Last Modified: 09/08/2011       Submitted by: Gerald Gabrielse]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
