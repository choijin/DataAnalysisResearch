<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Civil (54)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the need for teaching tools and strategies for creating connections between the physical world and the more abstract physical and mathematical models. The project's goal is to improve student learning of dynamics and vibrations by bridging the disconnect between mathematical expressions and both representation/models of physical elements and response of real life systems. Specific project objectives include: (1) addressing preconceptions by making students more aware of their learning; (2) developing physical models for critical dynamic components that address fundamental concepts; (3) developing a visual simulation environment that allows the interactive construction, instrumentation, and visualization of the performance of schematic 2D analytical models; and (4) linking mathematical, physical, and computer models to the real world.   The approach is rooted in existing knowledge about student learning and is designed to address typical student misconceptions and develop a metacognitive approach to solving dynamics problems. By making explicit links between physical and simulated models, abstraction capabilities will be strengthened so that more complex systems can be investigated. The simulation software will serve as a virtual laboratory, where students can create their own systems and place sensors to monitor system responses.  Effectiveness of the approach is being evaluated using a concept inventory on dynamics, specifically designed problems that require connections between real-world situation and models representing them, and transcripts of student interviews on the problem-solving process.  Dissemination will be through conference and journal papers, by posting material on the web, and by directly contacting specific individuals at other institutions.  Regarding broader impacts, the project addresses diversity by promoting pedagogies which research has shown to be effective in the retention of underrepresented groups in engineering. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
