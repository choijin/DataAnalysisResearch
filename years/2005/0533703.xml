<AbstractNarration>Prior work by others has established a correlation between static seated postures and back discomfort, so that as sedentary jobs become more prevalent in the workplaces (e.g., with prolonged sessions of computer use), the incidence of musculo-skeletal problems, in particular lower back pain, is also on the rise. Physical movement has been shown to be a key preventative measure for back pain; individuals are better able to sit for prolonged periods when they can change their posture throughout the day.  The potential benefit of introducing healthy movement into daily computer use has led the PIs to fundamentally rethink current desktop computer design, with the goal of transforming its static nature to one that moves and invites movement.  In this project, the PIs will explore how movement-related benefits can be achieved in human-computer interaction, by designing and fabricating a prototype physically animated computer wherein the desktop monitor possesses the ability to move in subtly expressive ways that respond to its user.  Through a human subject study designed to investigate the ergonomics of a moving screen, the PIs will evaluate whether the user's movement can be increased while sitting at a computer without negatively impacting task performance or quality of experience.  Can the reciprocal movement of human and computer be designed to promote back health, without being distracting or annoying to the user?  Can such movement, and its interaction with affect and cognition, be designed to improve the efficacy of computer use?  The PIs believe this is possible in light of new theories in the literature that link physical posture and its influence on cognition and affect.  The outcome of this work will be a set of design principles for how to introduce healthy movement into effective desktop computer usage, as well as an initial theory for ergonomic movement in human-computer interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This work will establish a proof of concept for a novel technology, and will lay an initial and important theoretical foundation for new lines of research in HCI that explore the intriguing possibilities of incorporating ergonomic movement in human-computer interaction both for health benefits and also as a potential means to foster performance and learning gains.</AbstractNarration>
