<AbstractNarration>The Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is now at its target sensitivity. Researchers at a number of institutions, including Carleton College, are vigorously analyzing the data in search of gravitational radiation events. An initial detection could come at any time. All events seen by LIGO will produce a wealth of astrophysical information. Faculty and students at Carleton will be running their signal search programs. In addition, the Carleton team will play a&lt;br/&gt;significant role in finding how noise from the environment (such as seismic activity) can corrupt the search.&lt;br/&gt;Carleton College is a leader in producing future scientists. This project provides research opportunities to motivated students with interests in physics and statistics, and helps to train them to become the next generation of scientists. The exciting and dramatic results expected by LIGO stimulate students, and attract them to the world of science. Carleton students are eager to participate in exciting research, and their interest in gravity wave astronomy is large. The statistical methods developed by the Carleton group and collaborators will also have a significant influence in other areas of physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
