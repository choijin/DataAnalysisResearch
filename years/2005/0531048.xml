<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Prairie Analysis Seminar, an ongoing joint project of Kansas State&lt;br/&gt;University and the University of Kansas, has had four very successful&lt;br/&gt;annual meetings in 2001-2004. The 2005 meeting will be held at Kansas&lt;br/&gt;State University on October 14-15.  The main speaker is Carlos Kenig of&lt;br/&gt;the University of Chicago who will give two one-hour lectures.  Professor Kenig's work is broad and far reaching in the field of harmonic analysis and the application of harmonic analysis and analysis techniques to partial differential equations, including non-linear evolution equations and free boundary problems. Professors James Colliander of the University of Toronto and Alexandru Ionescu of the University of Wisconsin will each give a one-hour lecture on topics related to Kenig's lecture. Contributed talks will be solicited and the conference will include a session on discussion and open problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Differential equations provide mathematical models in physics,&lt;br/&gt;engineering, and indeed throughout the sciences. Solutions or an&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the behavior of solutions can give insight into the&lt;br/&gt;physical system being modeled and can be used to predict behavior. The&lt;br/&gt;main lecturers invited are known for their uses of analysis and harmonic analysis techniques to study a variety of equations that arise in mathematical models, making this conference of interest to researchers in several fields:  differential equations and their models, analysis, and harmonic analysis. This annual conference has become important in the geographical area, due to the quality of the meeting and the lack of other conferences and meetings in analysis in this region, especially in the fall.  The Prairie Analysis Seminar is now quickly becoming a tradition with a national and even international reputation. The seminar is structured so as to keep costs for the host university and participants to a minimum, allowing a wide range of mathematicians to attend. The main speakers chosen are at the forefront of their field, giving all in attendance the opportunity to learn of their recent work. Equally important is that the conference will allow participants to give contributed talks. This is critically important for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and those early in their careers, to increase their visibility and awareness of their work in the mathematical community. The first four editions attracted a number of researchers from small universities and colleges throughout the region, in addition to those attending from major research institutions.  Many of thesefaculty maintain research careers in spite of geographical isolation and welcome the rare opportunity to meet with other mathematicians. Strong connections with these small universities and colleges are mutually beneficial, as these schools produce many excellent undergraduate students who can be attracted to graduate education in mathematics and sciences.  Social events planned will increase the scientific interaction and foster useful personal connections among the participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
