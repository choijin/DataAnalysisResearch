<AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this project is establishing a comprehensive program in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Science Technology.  GIS is a discipline that endeavors to spatially analyze, study, and critically research aspects of our world with the use of innovative tools and techniques that organize and display large amounts of site-specific data.  Because San Diego County is home to a large number of companies that utilize GIS Technology, a significant need exists within the workforce of the County for personnel trained in the theory and use of GIS software and hardware, particularly for spatial analysis applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GIS Technology program is promoting the intellectual development of a community of learners in desperate need. Incorporation of real-world, discipline related critical topics and GIS industrial standards into existing courses, and the implementation of four new courses is at the core of the program. Using state-of-the-art hardware and software, the project is also conducting the following activities: 1) Professional development workshops for college and high school faculty; 2) Placement of students in undergraduate research projects and baccalaureate programs; 3) Placement of students in professional, paid internships; and 4) GIS training for professionals in need. The GIS Technology program is a collaborative effort among faculty from disciplinary divisions across the campus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a student enrollment of greater than 80% ethnic minorities, this project is also making a significant contribution to bringing marketable GIS skills to underrepresented students. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
