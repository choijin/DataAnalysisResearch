<AbstractNarration>The investigator studies mathematical problems involving&lt;br/&gt;shock waves in nonlinear conservation laws and related applications,&lt;br/&gt;along with the analysis and development of efficient new nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;techniques. Shock waves often occur in solutions of nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;conservation laws of hyperbolic type, mixed elliptic-hyperbolic type,&lt;br/&gt;and mixed parabolic-hyperbolic type. The proposed work is in three&lt;br/&gt;interrelated topics corresponding to the nonlinear conservation laws&lt;br/&gt;of three types:&lt;br/&gt;(1) multidimensional transonic shocks, free boundary problems, and&lt;br/&gt;related nonlinear problems;&lt;br/&gt;(2) divergence-measure fields for entropy solutions with shocks to&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic conservation laws;&lt;br/&gt;(3) solutions with shocks to anisotropic degenerate&lt;br/&gt;diffusion-convection equations and related nonlinear problems.&lt;br/&gt;In each, both nonlinear problems involving shock waves and new&lt;br/&gt;mathematical techniques are proposed. The unifying mathematical theme&lt;br/&gt;of the three topics is shock wave problems and related nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;techniques. The objective of this proposed program is twofold:&lt;br/&gt;(1) investigate important nonlinear problems involving shock&lt;br/&gt;waves to gain new physical insights, to guide the formulation of&lt;br/&gt;efficient nonlinear techniques, and to find the correct mathematical&lt;br/&gt;frameworks in which to pose the nonlinear conservation laws and&lt;br/&gt;develop the numerical methods that converge stably and rapidly;&lt;br/&gt;(2) analyze and develop nonlinear techniques including free boundary&lt;br/&gt;methods, kinetic methods, compensated regularity methods, and related&lt;br/&gt;potential techniques to formulate new, more efficient nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;techniques and to solve various more important nonlinear problems&lt;br/&gt;in conservation laws and related applications.&lt;br/&gt;                                                                                &lt;br/&gt;The mathematical problems in this research program arise in such&lt;br/&gt;areas as gas dynamics, hydraulics, elasticity, multiphase flow,&lt;br/&gt;combustion, magnetohydrodynamics, semiconductor, phase transitions,&lt;br/&gt;kinetic theory, biophysics, sedimentation-consolidation processes,&lt;br/&gt;material science, and image processing.&lt;br/&gt;The award will support research on the solvability of these&lt;br/&gt;mathematical problems involving shock waves in nonlinear conservation&lt;br/&gt;laws and related applications, the qualitative behavior of their&lt;br/&gt;solutions, as well as the analysis and development of nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;methods in applied analysis and numerical analysis.&lt;br/&gt;This research will lead to a deeper understanding of nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;phenomena, especially for shock waves, and will provide more&lt;br/&gt;efficient nonlinear methods and theories for applications.&lt;br/&gt;Given the richness and the range of applications for which&lt;br/&gt;shock waves are involved in nature, this project will have&lt;br/&gt;a broad impact by understanding the behavior of shock waves and&lt;br/&gt;developing methodology and a set of nonlinear techniques&lt;br/&gt;for their further study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
