<AbstractNarration>Transcription (the first step in gene expression) is essential for all living organisms. On the majority of genes transcription is regulated by enhancers - DNA sequences regulating transcription over a distance. The goal of this project is to understand the mechanism of transcription regulation by enhancers, including action over a large distance. The primary features of this process have been recapitulated in vitro in a highly purified bacterial system. Enhancer action involves direct interaction between the proteins bound at the enhancer sites and their targets (promoters) with accompanying looping of the spacer DNA. Recently it has been shown that the action of enhancers requires: (1) unique tertiary DNA structure that can greatly facilitate enhancer-promoter communication and (2) unique structure of the enhancer targets. This project focuses on further analysis of these two crucial aspects of the mechanism of enhancer action and transcription regulation. The mechanism of enhancer action will be analyzed using biochemical and molecular genetic approaches. New techniques and strategies for the analysis of protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, including interactions over a distance will be developed. Completion of this project will result in better understanding of the mechanism of transcription regulation over a distance. The results obtained will also have direct implications for understanding of other processes regulated over a distance (such as DNA replication, recombination and repair) and will be broadly applicable to both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. The project will train undergraduate and graduate students in biochemistry and molecular biology.</AbstractNarration>
