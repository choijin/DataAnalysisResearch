<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result in a high throughput, large area, Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) tool for the production of device grade SiC epitaxial films and substrates. This proposal will develop, test and implement the technology. Silicon carbide (SiC) is a wide band gap material that is the proven key enabler of the next-generation high power, high-frequency and radiation hard device applications succeeding silicon and gallium arsenide. Due to its unique materials and electronic properties, SiC devices can function under higher power ratings as well as higher frequency and temperatures compared to Si and GaAs products. For that reason, these high performance devices are intensely sought after for both commercial and military device applications. To date, however, its commercial potential has been limited by a lack of production capacity for large area, device grade epitaxial films and substrates. The proposed work will address the current materials limitations of SiC epitaxial process technology through enhanced processing capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique materials properties of Silicon Carbide allow the material to be used in high performance devices for applications that require high power, high frequency or high temperature. Such devices are under development for lighting, consumer electronics, industrial electronics and the automotive industry for example. SiC devices will also find use in industrial motors and power supplies requiring high voltage. In addition to&lt;br/&gt;performance benefits, SiC offers significant cost saving opportunities by eliminating expensive cooling systems needed in a range of industrial equipment common to factories worldwide. However, development has been hampered by a lack of inexpensive, high quality SiC substrate material. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
