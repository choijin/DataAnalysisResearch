    <AbstractNarration>The grant supports junior scientists' participation in the 2005 Gordon Conference on Nuclear Physics. The objective of the Gordon Research Conference on Nuclear Physics is to provide the international community of nuclear scientists with a unique forum where the most recent developments in this field can be presented, discussed and criticized. The agenda of this Conference provokes new ideas for future research, in ensuring that discussions facilitate vigorous and open interactions between scientists. This requires the participation of a significant number of the leaders, including both internationally recognized senior scientists and the young and rising stars. Bright and promising postdoctoral researchers and graduate students are selected for participation in this Conference and encouraged to present their ideas. Their participation provides them with unique and extensive access to the leaders in their field, exposes them to new research opportunities and techniques and helps prepare them for the leadership roles they will assume in the future. Some of the young scientists have been invited to present talks. For others, poster sessions are organized to provide a forum for their ideas, with best displays additionally selected for oral presentations</AbstractNarration>
