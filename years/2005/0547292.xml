<AbstractNarration>0547292&lt;br/&gt;Georgakoudi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to develop tools for characterization of engineered tissues using the optical techniques of light scattering and fluorescence. An integrated instrument is proposed which will incorporate several optical techniques. This system will be applied to model systems to assess and characterize its capabilities and will ultimately be applied to monitor engineered bone tissues. The educational objectives include course development, student recruitment and outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
