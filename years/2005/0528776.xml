<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This brief proposal requests modest funds to help support the participation of&lt;br/&gt;US-based graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the 9th International&lt;br/&gt;Workshop on Numerical Modeling of Mantle Convection and Lithospheric Dynamics&lt;br/&gt;(henceforth IWNMC2005), to be held September 8-14, 2005, in Erice,&lt;br/&gt;Sicily at the Ettore Majorana Center for Scientific Culture. The workshop is to&lt;br/&gt;take place as the 25th Course of the International School of Geophysics.&lt;br/&gt;The IWNMC2005 is the most recent in an established and highly successful&lt;br/&gt;series of international meetings on mantle convection and lithospheric dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;Previous meetings in the series were held in 1989 (La Londe les Maures, France),&lt;br/&gt;1991 (Weilburg/Lahn, Germany), 1993 (Oleron, France), 1995 (Vlieland, Netherlands),&lt;br/&gt;and 1997 (Naurod, Germany), 2001 (Aussois, France), and, lastly, 2003&lt;br/&gt;(Hruba Skala, Czech Republic). The organizing committee for IWNMC2001 includes&lt;br/&gt;David Bercovici (Yale University), Thorsten Becker (University of Southern&lt;br/&gt;California), Cinzia Farnetani (IPG Paris), Carlo Giunchi (INGV Roma), and&lt;br/&gt;Giorgio Spada (University of Urbino). The program for the workshop has been&lt;br/&gt;completed, and information for participants can be found through the website at&lt;br/&gt;http://www.ingv.it/erice2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Mantle and lithospheric dynamics is perhaps one of the most&lt;br/&gt;fundamental and global of the geophysical sciences since it studies the basic engine&lt;br/&gt;that controls the geological behavior of the Earth and terrestrial planets, not&lt;br/&gt;only in terms of their thermal and chemical evolution, but also with regard to ongoing&lt;br/&gt;tectonics and volcanism. The International Mantle ConvectionWorkshop is&lt;br/&gt;the longest running series of conferences on this science in existence and has for&lt;br/&gt;the past two decades provided an unprecedented means for scientists and students&lt;br/&gt;from around the world to gather in unique and intimate surroundings, to discuss&lt;br/&gt;the state of the art of our science, and to argue about the problems that remain to&lt;br/&gt;be solved. Moreover, the workshop provides students and young researchers with&lt;br/&gt;international exposure as well as technical training through lectures and tutorials&lt;br/&gt;from some of the world's experts. The benefit to US students and junior scientists&lt;br/&gt;will also be long-lasting as they meet new colleagues from around the world, and&lt;br/&gt;form new collaborations that will inspire the next important discoveries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The essential impact of this workshop and the requested funding&lt;br/&gt;is the benefit it brings to junior scientists and students by furthering their intellectual&lt;br/&gt;and professional growth, and by expanding their interaction with schools&lt;br/&gt;of thought from other countries. Moreover, the contact that we make with our&lt;br/&gt;over-seas colleagues facilitates our ability to recruit future excellent students and&lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral scholars from around the world.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
