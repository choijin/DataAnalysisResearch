<AbstractNarration>Abstract for EEC-0552896&lt;br/&gt;University: Illinois Institute of Technology (ITT)&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Vincent T. Turitto&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU award for a Site focused on diabetes will support 8-10 undergraduates for three years in a 10- week summer research experience at the Illinois Institute of Technology (ITT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the program are to: (1) train undergraduates in basic research through challenging diabetes-related engineering projects performed with research mentors from ITT, (2) expose them to the broader health implications of their research with lectures from clinical experts and tours of clinical facilities, and (3) integrate ethics discussion and training into all aspects of the student experience.  These experiences will stimulate the interests of undergraduates in engineering research, in general, and specifically emphasize the needs for top-notch researchers in the field of diabetes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than 18 million people in the United States have diabetes. While a cure does not currently exist, biomedical engineering is providing important inroads to understanding and treating the disease and its many complications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ITT has recently established a unique multi-disciplinary center, the Engineering Center for Diabetes Research and Educations (ECDRE) under the umbrella of the Pritzker Institute for Biomedical Science and Engineering.  The objective of the ECDRE is to use engineering techniques to increase understanding and treatment of diabetes and its complications. Also, the ECDRE is the first engineering center in the U.S. to focus on diabetes.   The Biomedical Engineering Department at ITT in collaboration with the ECDRE will provide the foundation for this summer REU program.  Close cooperation of these two entities will be ensured since the Principal Investigator is both Chair of Biomedical Engineering and the Director of the Pritzker Institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will target undergraduates from institutions were Biomedical Engineering research opportunities are limited, with a focus on women and underrepresented minorities for participation in this REU summer program. By conducting research projects related to a disease that affects more than 18 million people in the U.S., the PIs have the potential to advance understanding while influencing engineers in their career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
