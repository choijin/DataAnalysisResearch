<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to the Universidad del Turabo under the direction of Dr. Sharon Cantrell in partial support of the acquisition of a Capillary Genetic Analyzer.  This instrument will improve and expand the research capacity of Hispanic researchers and students in Molecular Biology at Universidad del Turabo. The Universidad del Turabo includes as a part of its institutional vision the goal of being a lead institution for research in Puerto Rico and, as part of its strategic plan promotes undergraduate and graduate research for Hispanic students, particularly in the areas of the sciences and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Capillary Genetic Analyzer will be placed in a core facility for DNA sequencing, genotyping strain identification and community structure analysis (tRFLP). Research activities include the sequencing of tropical fungi (Hygrophoraceae, discomycetes, halophilic and endophitic species) and the use of DNA to study soil microbial community structure, worked conducted in collaboration with the Luquillo Long Term Ecological Research (LuqLTER). The pool of researchers that will use the equipment will be increase yearly. This equipment will also be used to conduct Molecular Microbial Ecology in Puerto Rico; the Universidad del Turabo will be the first institution conducting this type of research in Puerto Rico with on site equipment. It will also allow Hispanic undergraduate and graduate students to obtain training in Molecular Biology and Phylogenetics, allowing them to be more competitive scientist, while promoting an increase of minority populations graduated in STEM fields.  The sequencer will facilitate laboratory activities in several undergraduate and graduate courses, including Conservation Biology, Evolutionary Biology, Microbial Ecology, Molecular Biology, Biotechnology and Bioremediation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrumentation will make a major contribution to the improvement and expansion of the core Molecular Biology Laboratory that is in development and will serve to: 1) enhance the research of faculty members at Universidad del Turabo; 2) consolidate research collaborations with faculty/researchers at other institutions in Puerto Rico and the U.S.; 3) allow the development of research training for Hispanic faculty, and undergraduate and graduate students in the Molecular Biology discipline; 4) improve the research infrastructure of the Universidad del Turabo; 5) stimulate and enable grant solicitations and renewal; 6) enhance the institution's ability to attract and retain Hispanic faculty/researchers and students; and 7) Contribute to the success of the Luquillo Long Term Ecological Research (LuqLTER).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
