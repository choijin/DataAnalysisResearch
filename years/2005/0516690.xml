<AbstractNarration>Genetic studies indicate that post-translational modification of proteins with the sugar N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is important to multiple signal transduction pathways of plants. In the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, two O-GlcNAc transferases, SECRET AGENT (SEC) and SPINDLY (SPY), are responsible for this modification.  Genetic studies indicate that O-GlcNAc modification of a gibberellin (GA) signaling pathway component negatively regulates the plant's response to this hormone. DELLA proteins also negatively regulate GA responses and genetic studies suggest that O-GlcNAc modification of DELLA proteins is required for this regulation. SEC produced in bacteria modifies RGA, a DELLA protein, within a proposed regulatory region. Additionally preliminary evidence suggests that another arabidopsis DELLA protein, GAI, is O-GlcNAc modified. Thus it is hypothesized that O-GlcNAc modification activates RGA and GAI. This research will test the hypothesis by determining if RGA and GAI are O-GlcNAc modified in plants and characterizing the activity of mutant proteins that cannot be modified.  While O-GlcNAc modification is essential for gamete and embryo viability and plays a role in a number of signaling pathways, knowledge of the identities of the modified proteins is extremely limited.  The second goal of this project will address this deficiency by identifying additional O-GlcNAc modified proteins and mapping the modifications. The amount of O-GlcNAc modification to animal proteins is responsive to environmental conditions and hormonal signals and these changes are believed to regulate the activity of the modified proteins. To understand the role of O-GlcNAc modification in plants, it is important to be able to determine the effects of different treatments on the abundance of an O-GlcNAc modified protein. Therefore, this research will develop methods to quantitate the abundance of specific O-GlcNAc modified proteins.  &lt;br/&gt; High school, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained by performing portions of this research.  Some of these students will be recruited from U of MN summer programs that provide laboratory research experiences for high school students, teachers and undergraduates.  Interest in science in high school students will be stimulated by giving tours of the laboratory and presentations to students and teachers. In addition to contributing to learning, the project will contribute to the dissemination of knowledge by creating and maintaining a website containing information on O-GlcNAc modification in plants.  The research will contribute to scientific infrastructure by providing a new method for quantitating O-GlcNAc modified proteins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
