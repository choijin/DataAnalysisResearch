    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a new class of mechanical shaft seals based on the benefits of a novel material called Ultrananocrystalline (tm) diamond (UNCDtm) that will result in seals that last longer, save energy and reduce environmental emissions associated with industrial pumping and turbo-machinery applications. Mechanical shaft seals are used in almost every industry. The main functions of these seals are to ensure that the pumping fluid does not escape the system and to protect the fluids from contaminants. This program will build upon earlier results that showed that UNCD could reduce seal wear by orders of magnitude over SiC seals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will include customer trials, securing industry standard qualification and developing manufacturing capabilities. New UNCD seal products will be developed for chemical, refinery, pharmaceutical, mining, and other demanding industrial applications. Several features of UNCD, including its fine grain size, high quality surface and its ability to be processed at reasonable temperatures, make it an ideal material to be leveraged other friction and wear&lt;br/&gt;materials.</AbstractNarration>
