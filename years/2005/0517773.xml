<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paleontological and molecular evidence indicates that early whales are most closely related to&lt;br/&gt;artiodactyl land mammals, probably early anthracothere artiodactyls that were close to the ancestry of&lt;br/&gt;living hippos. Two stages of Eocene archaeocete evolution are now well known morphologically: (1) an&lt;br/&gt;early protocetid stage represented by 47 million-year-old early middle Eocene Rodhocetus; and (2) a&lt;br/&gt;generalized basilosaurid stage represented by 37 million-year-old middle-to-late Eocene Dorudon.&lt;br/&gt;Field work carried out through 2004 in collaboration with the Geological Survey of Pakistan&lt;br/&gt;demonstrates that it is possible to collect well-preserved and virtually-complete skeletons of archaeocete&lt;br/&gt;whales from upper Ypresian through Priabonian strata deposited in eastern Tethys and now exposed&lt;br/&gt;spectacularly in the Sulaiman Range of central Pakistan. New field and laboratory research proposed&lt;br/&gt;here includes three successive annual field expeditions to Pakistan, with two objectives:&lt;br/&gt;1. Recovery and study of articulated skeletons of primitive archaeocetes from 48-50 million-yearold&lt;br/&gt;strata of the marginal-marine low-sea-stand Baska Formation of central Pakistan. The&lt;br/&gt;hypothesis to be tested is that whales of Pakicetus-grade were terrestrial. Whether the hypothesis&lt;br/&gt;is corroborated or not, good skeletal remains from this interval will greatly enhance our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the cetacean transition from land to sea.&lt;br/&gt;2. Recovery and study of articulated skeletons of protocetid-to-basilosaurid archaeocetes from 38-&lt;br/&gt;45 million-year-old strata of the shallow marine upper Domanda, Pir Koh, and lower Drazinda&lt;br/&gt;formations of central Pakistan. The hypothesis to be tested is that advanced protocetids like&lt;br/&gt;Georgiacetus were fully aquatic and lacked connection of the pelvic girdle to the vertebral&lt;br/&gt;column, precluding support of their weight on land. Whether the hypothesis is corroborated or&lt;br/&gt;not, good skeletal remains from this interval will greatly enhance our understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;transition from foot-powered swimming like that of primitive protocetids to tail-power swimming&lt;br/&gt;like that of basilosaurids and modern whales.&lt;br/&gt;Field methods to be employed are standard GPS/GIS-enhanced methods, preparation and replication of&lt;br/&gt;fossils will take place in a state-of-the-art preparation facility at the University of Michigan, and analysis&lt;br/&gt;will involve extensive quantitative description and functional interpretation in comparison with living&lt;br/&gt;and extinct semiaquatic mammals.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research is recovery of tangible evidence of new morphologically&lt;br/&gt;and temporally intermediate stages of early whale evolution that enable assessment of many aspects of&lt;br/&gt;adaptation to life in water. Such new evidence is essential for advancing knowledge of early whale&lt;br/&gt;evolution and for enhancing our understanding of macroevolution across adaptive zones (in this case in&lt;br/&gt;the transition from land to sea).&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this project include enhancement of infrastructure for research and education&lt;br/&gt;through discovery of new skeletons representing stages of whale evolution that are presently poorly&lt;br/&gt;known. The project will provide international research experience for American and foreign nationals.&lt;br/&gt;The greatest impact may be enhanced public understanding of evolution through better geological and&lt;br/&gt;paleontological evidence for one of the principal evolutionary transitions of wide interest. Whale&lt;br/&gt;skeletons collected by previous expeditions are now exhibited in museums, illustrated in textbooks, and&lt;br/&gt;discussed in classrooms all over the world.</AbstractNarration>
