<AbstractNarration>Measuring and describing patterns of individual and population movement is a fundamental aspect of understanding the physiology, behavior, ecology and life-history of any animal.  Measuring movement also can provide the key to predicting species extinctions and invasions or the spread of disease.  Yet, we have long been limited in our abilities to track animal movements over large distances and across time. Following individual animals has always proven challenging for human observers.  Researchers must rely on technological innovations to expand our abilities to measure and describe movement.  Recent rapid advances in molecular, chemical, electrical, and remote-sensing technologies are creating new tools for tracking individuals and whole populations and opening new frontiers for ecologists by allowing us to follow small, highly mobile animals like migratory songbirds in real-time across continents.  The MIGRATE Research Coordination Network (RCN) will bring together researchers who are pioneering the development and application of emerging technologies for the purpose of investigating the amazing long-distance movements of migratory songbirds.&lt;br/&gt;Long-distance landbird migration is an ideal system for applying new technologies in ways that advance both the technologies and our ability to describe movement strategies.  To accelerate progress in these areas, the MIGRATE network will: (1) focus research techniques and questions on a small suite of model species that will advance understanding of ecological and evolutionary implications of long-distance movement; (2) foster cross-disciplinary collaborations among researchers throughout the Americas and Europe; (3) encourage standardized collection and sharing of tissues, technological advances, and data; and (4) create a platform for interdisciplinary training of students and the public.  Additionally, by working at the nexus of emerging technologies (e.g., molecular, electrical, remote-sensing) and ecology, this network will provide allow currently active researchers to engage students from groups under-represented in the sciences in novel research projects.  &lt;br/&gt;Application of emerging intrinsic and extrinsic tracking technologies to novel problems in ecology will improve the technologies themselves.  The rigorous research fostered by MIGRATE will increase our ability to identify population-level sources of DNA, stable isotope ratios, and trace elements.  Advances in use of molecular markers will have applications across a broad range of disciplines such as identifying sources of bio-terrorism, commercial testing of ingredient purity, and locating origins of introduced exotic species.  MIGRATE will allow students to access the newest developments, make field scientists aware of state-of-the-art technology advancements, and provide an interface between industry and field ecologist in diverse countries. In areas of health and economics, the results of MIGRATE can be applied to understanding and controlling the spread of disease through animal movement.  Moreover, the ability to track individual migrant birds and identify populations will have immediate applications for conservation planning.  A complete and integrated understanding of migration ecology will allow for more effective use of limited conservation resources and provide scientists with the ability to use migratory birds to monitor ecological responses to global climate change.  This network will bring together a diverse set of approaches, facilitating communication among researchers on a multinational, inter-continental scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Long- distance animal movements are a key element of global connectivity that has consequences for the flow of biodiversity, energy, and information over large spatial scales. The study of these movements depends in large measure on advanced technologies such as genetics, stable isotope analyses, and miniaturization of electronics.  This dependence on technology has narrowed the pool of scientists who are able to ask and answer the most pressing questions about the causes and consequences of animal movement at inter-continental spatial extents. MIGRATE has worked to provide training in the application of these technologies and to provide low-cost methods (e.g., geolocation) for tracking the movements of individuals.  Broadening access to these technologies has allowed more rapid advancement of science in this area and the rapid development of international collaborations.  Understanding movements of animals has far-reaching implications for basic and applied science that include predicting responses to changes in land use and climate, forecasting the consequences of these responses, and effective mitigation of biological control hazards; such as disease transmission by migrating animals.  Compiling and exchanging available information on animal movements in an effective and readily interpretable way is a critical part of addressing the societal need to comprehend these global movements.  Meeting this need warrants a strong network connecting scientists, educators, and the public.  The NSF-funded MIGRATE program foraged such a network. A total of 273 students, faculty, K-12 educators, and researchers from 24 countries participated in meetings, workshops, and working groups focused on collaborative research ideas; student training; development of websites and educational materials; and outreach activities. Countless collaborations sprung from or were strengthened by the MIGRATE network of international researchers and students.    Primary outcomes of the MIGRATE enterprise include advancement of the integration of genetic and stable isotope data to understand connectivity of migratory populations, conceptualization and early development of relatively inexpensive geologging devices for use in tracking long distance animal movements, and increasing focus on the emerging discipline of radar aeroecology as a way to understand the ecology of life in the aerosphere.  The rapid advance in genomics and stable isotope technologies has greatly expanded the horizons for understanding animal movements.  As these technological advances become more affordable it is important that they become rapidly incorporated into the science of animal movement.  Geologging devices have the potential to be used in a wide variety of studies to understand animal movements across nations, continents, and the world. The use of these devices has grown rapidly over the past 5 years, and they are becoming a core technology for understanding the movements of migrants with body sizes as low as 15g, the size of a small sparrow.  Finally the vast radar infrastructure in North America is perhaps the largest coordinated biological observatory in the world.  Yet radar data are vastly underused in answering biological questions for which they are ideally suited: those that involve continental spatial extents over decadal time scales.  MIGRATE has begun to organize a community of scientists who are interested in making these data more biologically accessible.   It was important to MIGRATE to both push the development of such technologies and to try to broaden the use of these new devices and methods.  Many of MIGRATEÆs training and outreach programs were designed to increase access to advanced methodologies for a broad cross-section of the science and education community. The strength of the MIGRATE network will continue beyond its founding by bringing a whole new generation into the fold of migration studies that serve the interests of science and the public equally.   ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
