    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is a request for support for a two-day symposium that will provide funds to bring teachers and their minority high school students who are excelling in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines to a statewide symposium to hear and interact with university researchers who will be sharing cutting edge research at the State's flagship university -- The University of Georgia. This interaction will provide high school teachers opportunities to update their knowledge of cutting edge research in the STEM disciplines and become familiar with the opportunities their students can consider in the STEM disciplines. The students will also have the opportunity to shadow researchers and scientists at the symposium, in their laboratories and their classes for two days. The request will provide funds to support ten minority students and one of their science teachers</AbstractNarration>
