<AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER proposal describes an integrated research and education program that will build a&lt;br/&gt;foundation for achieving the PIs career goals: to deliver smaller and smarter systems by developing&lt;br/&gt;novel modeling and control methodologies, and to train tomorrows control engineers with crossdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;perspectives. In particular, the proposed research aims to fully realize the potential of&lt;br/&gt;Ionic Polymer-Metal Composites (IPMCs), informally known as artificial muscles, in manipulation of&lt;br/&gt;delicate, microscale objects (e.g., capture and transport of single biological cells and assembly of 3D&lt;br/&gt;MEMS structures), by developing modeling, sensing, and control strategies to address time-varying,&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear behaviors of IPMCs in actuation and sensing. The research will have four core thrusts:&lt;br/&gt;1. Development of a control-oriented model capturing essential dynamics and nonlinearities in&lt;br/&gt;IPMCs, including both hysteresis and nonlinear feedback coupling from the bending curvature&lt;br/&gt;of an IPMC actuator to its electrical behavior.&lt;br/&gt;2. Investigation of two original sensing approaches for IPMCs: one exploiting IPMCs built-in&lt;br/&gt;sensory capability using nonlinear compensation, the other utilizing the curvature-to-electrical&lt;br/&gt;behavior coupling observed by the PIs group.&lt;br/&gt;3. Development of control schemes targeting the major nonlinearities in IPMC actuators, including&lt;br/&gt;adaptive inverse control methods for hysteretic, dynamical systems to accommodate possible&lt;br/&gt;variation of IPMC behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;4. Design and fabrication of a biomimetic micromanipulator with IPMCs functioning simultaneously&lt;br/&gt;as structures, actuators, and sensors, and validation of the proposed modeling, sensing,&lt;br/&gt;control methods through manipulation of microbeads and biological cells (in collaboration with&lt;br/&gt;a biomedical engineer at Michigan State).&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will enable fast, precision control of IPMC actuators throughout their full&lt;br/&gt;actuation ranges by identifying and accommodating major nonlinearities in the control design. The&lt;br/&gt;developed sensing schemes can potentially eliminate the need for external sensors, resulting in smaller&lt;br/&gt;systems. Theoretical and experimental investigation of scaling laws will help understand the capabilities&lt;br/&gt;and limitations of micro IPMC actuators and sensors, and offer insight into design of active&lt;br/&gt;dithering schemes to overcome adhesion, a critical problem in micromanipulation. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;project will thus promote the development of compact, dexterous IPMC-based micromanipulation&lt;br/&gt;systems while motivating formulations and solutions of new problems in modeling and control.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will provide an innovative approach to manipulation of biological cells and micro&lt;br/&gt;devices, facilitating advances in biological studies, biotechnology, and microtechnology. Through&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with Environmental Robots Inc., the developed control and sensing schemes will be&lt;br/&gt;applied to a number of IPMC-based biomedical applications (e.g., implantable micropumps for drug&lt;br/&gt;delivery), with potential impacts on health care. Integrating with the research program, the PI will&lt;br/&gt;establish an interdisciplinary curriculum on Smart Materials and Systems including a senior design&lt;br/&gt;program involving industrial partners (the PI has secured seed funding from SPIE) and a graduate&lt;br/&gt;course Smart Sensors and Actuators in Micro and Nanosystems. As a faculty advisor to the undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;research program hosted by the Diversity Programs Office at Michigan State, the PI&lt;br/&gt;will involve women and minority students in developing biomimetic microrobots incorporating smart&lt;br/&gt;sensors and actuators, and further use these microrobots as appealing, hands-on educational kits to&lt;br/&gt;inspire the interest of K-12 students in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
