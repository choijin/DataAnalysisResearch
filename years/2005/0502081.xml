<AbstractNarration>Project Summary &lt;br/&gt;Brent Mishler&lt;br/&gt;EF 0502081&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Proposal for the first meeting of the PIs of the Assembling the Tree of Life Program &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt; One of the most profound ideas to emerge from biological research over the last decade is &lt;br/&gt;the realization that all life, from the smallest microorganism to the largest vertebrate, is &lt;br/&gt;connected through phylogenetic relatedness to form a single, vast evolutionary tree, the Tree of &lt;br/&gt;Life.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In 2001, the National Science Foundation funded one round of tree of life grants in the &lt;br/&gt;Biocomplexity Program (GEN-EN), and then beginning in 2002 has so far funded three annual &lt;br/&gt;rounds of grants in its "Assembling the Tree of Life Program," on topics ranging across the Tree.  &lt;br/&gt;An ITR grant was also funded as part of this effort (known as CIPRES).  Now is a good time to &lt;br/&gt;take stock of these projects, determine what works and what doesn't, explore new approaches for &lt;br/&gt;dealing with the vastly expanded data begin generated, and share ideas among the three cohorts &lt;br/&gt;of PIs and co-PIs.  This supplemental proposal requests funds to hold a meeting of all PIs and co-&lt;br/&gt;PIs of the AToL grants and CIPRES, November 19 - 21, 2004, at NSF in Washington, DC. &lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;Goals of meeting: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1- Sharing of information among the current PIs and co-PIs about common goals and  &lt;br/&gt;obstacles. &lt;br/&gt;2-The establishment of a coordinating structure across the separate AToL programs. &lt;br/&gt;3- Clear understandings developed between CIPRES and the AToL grants, to coordinate &lt;br/&gt;informatics efforts across AToL. &lt;br/&gt;4-New ways found to increase linkages between AToL and other efforts (at NSF, elsewhere &lt;br/&gt;in the US government, or internationally) in such areas as monographic taxonomy &lt;br/&gt;(e.g., PEET and REVSYS), ecology (e.g., LTER and NEON), evolution &amp; &lt;br/&gt;development, physiology, and genomics &lt;br/&gt;5- A better picture developed of where AToL should go in the future, both as individual &lt;br/&gt;projects and in terms of future grants and initiatives. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit.  The Tree of Life provides the framework for much of our modern &lt;br/&gt;understanding of biology because it reveals the diversity of life as well as the historical basis for &lt;br/&gt;similarity and differences among organisms. The convergence of three important developments: &lt;br/&gt;(1) conceptual and methodological advances in phylogenetic analysis; (2) the rise of comparative &lt;br/&gt;genomics with its vast quantities of data; and (3) rapid advances in information technology and &lt;br/&gt;processing, have now made possible the construction of a robust Tree of Life depicting the &lt;br/&gt;genealogical relationships of all known species. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Increased knowledge of phylogenetic relationships will improve &lt;br/&gt;human health, push back the frontiers of comparative developmental biology, meet threats to &lt;br/&gt;agriculture and forestry from invasive species and pests, and improve management of our natural &lt;br/&gt;resources.  Without substantial growth in our knowledge of the Tree of Life, it will become &lt;br/&gt;increasingly  difficult and inefficient to manage, understand, and manipulate biological &lt;br/&gt;information held in numerous databases worldwide, including the burgeoning information from &lt;br/&gt;the genomic sciences, to build our understanding of the relationships among them.  The proposed &lt;br/&gt;meeting will greatly enhance coordination of this effort.</AbstractNarration>
