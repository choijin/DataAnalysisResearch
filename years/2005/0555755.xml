<AbstractNarration>The proposed project covers a range of important&lt;br/&gt;problems in extremal combinatorics, principally those motivated by the&lt;br/&gt;Turan problem, which has led to many developments in the theory of graphs&lt;br/&gt;and hypergraphs. Here the ultimate goal is to determine the Turan numbers&lt;br/&gt;of complete hypergraphs, an open problem that mathematicians have battled&lt;br/&gt;with for over sixty years. Recently there has been a lot of progress in&lt;br/&gt;this area, so it is an exciting topic for future research. The PI is&lt;br/&gt;considering a variety of ways to extend the scope of this area, such as&lt;br/&gt;the study of rainbow Turan numbers, which not only have natural&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial motivations, but also have impressive potential applications&lt;br/&gt;in additive number theory. Another direction is investigating an old&lt;br/&gt;conjecture of Erdos on the number of edges one must delete from a&lt;br/&gt;triangle-free graph to make it bipartite. A second area being studied is&lt;br/&gt;the theory of set systems with restricted intersections, which has a rich&lt;br/&gt;history in combinatorics, and has also found applications to computer&lt;br/&gt;science, particular in the theories of complexity and communication. The&lt;br/&gt;PI is continuing his study of the structural properties of large&lt;br/&gt;intersecting systems, and investigating a conjecture of Ahlswede, Cai and&lt;br/&gt;Zhang on cross-intersecting systems. The concepts of trace and&lt;br/&gt;VC-dimension play a central role in many areas of statistics, discrete and&lt;br/&gt;computational geometry and learning theory. The quantitive character of&lt;br/&gt;these problems is poorly understood, and this project addresses a&lt;br/&gt;conjecture of Anstee and Sali that offers some hope of improving this&lt;br/&gt;situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an area of pure mathematics, extremal&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics is in the happy position of being relatively accessible to a&lt;br/&gt;wider audience. It also finds a wide number of direct applications both to&lt;br/&gt;other areas of mathematics and other academic disciplines, and thus makes&lt;br/&gt;its influence felt indirectly as these disciplines in turn apply the&lt;br/&gt;theoretical power of combinatorics in more practical settings. Its impact&lt;br/&gt;on computer science is particularly striking, and its ideas also make&lt;br/&gt;contributions to such diverse areas as physics, electrical engineering,&lt;br/&gt;bioinformatics, economics, and internet modelling. The proposed project&lt;br/&gt;covers a range of important problems in extremal combinatorics,&lt;br/&gt;principally those motivated by a question of Turan, an open problem that&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians have battled with for over sixty years, which has led to&lt;br/&gt;many developments in the theory of graphs and hypergraphs. Recently there&lt;br/&gt;has been a lot of progress in this area, so it is an exciting topic for&lt;br/&gt;future research. The PI is considering various ways to extend the scope of&lt;br/&gt;this area, including a rainbow variant that has impressive potential&lt;br/&gt;applications in additive number theory. A second area being studied is the&lt;br/&gt;theory of set systems with restricted intersections, which has a rich&lt;br/&gt;history in combinatorics, and has also found applications to computer&lt;br/&gt;science, particular in the theories of complexity and communication. The&lt;br/&gt;concepts of trace and VC-dimension play a central role in many areas of&lt;br/&gt;statistics, discrete and computational geometry and learning theory. The&lt;br/&gt;quantitive character of these problems is poorly understood, and this&lt;br/&gt;project addresses a conjecture of Anstee and Sali that offers some hope of&lt;br/&gt;improving this situation. In addition to research, the PI is conducting&lt;br/&gt;educational activities in his role as an instructor in mathematics at&lt;br/&gt;Caltech, including developing and teaching courses to disseminate&lt;br/&gt;cutting-edge research techniques in combinatorics, and mentoring students&lt;br/&gt;on their own projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
