<AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is adapting and extending materials from NSF-funded projects on the WeBWorK web-based assessment system, initially developed at the University of Rochester, to supplement and enhance the core computer science courses that cover the topics that are collectively known as Programming Fundamentals (i.e. fundamental programming constructs, algorithms and problem-solving, elementary data structures, recursion and event-driven programming). The project is doing this by developing problems that give students practice and feedback with programming fundamentals, which requires broadening the scope of WeBWorK to support a wider class of problem type. With this WeBWorK enhancement, the courses are: 1) engaging students in active online learning to augment traditional practices in all the core computer science courses; 2) supplying students with immediate and customized feedback on their progress with problem-solving tasks; 3) furnishing students with tailored and constructive support for any problem areas they encounter; and 4) providing instructors with the ability to continually monitor and assess student work.</AbstractNarration>
