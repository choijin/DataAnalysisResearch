    <AbstractNarration>The principal investigator will study several questions&lt;br/&gt;in representation theory, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics which are related to &lt;br/&gt;nilpotent orbits in Lie algebras.&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, &lt;br/&gt;the investigator will continue his work on ideals in the poset of positive roots&lt;br/&gt;and their connection to representation theory and the theory of cluster algebras.&lt;br/&gt;He will also continue to study the Lusztig-Vogan bijection and to seek out its explicit computation. &lt;br/&gt;He will try to complete the &lt;br/&gt;determination of which nilpotent orbits in the exceptional Lie algebras &lt;br/&gt;have normal closure and prove results (in all Lie algebras) &lt;br/&gt;about the structure of&lt;br/&gt;functions on covers of nilpotent orbits that rely on similar techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Representation theory is a branch of modern algebra that is concerned&lt;br/&gt;with understanding symmetries. &lt;br/&gt;A central idea is that complicated algebraic or geometric structures can be&lt;br/&gt;represented by a certain set of matrices (arrays of numbers),&lt;br/&gt; which are easier to understand than the original structure. For example, the&lt;br/&gt;symmetries of the square can be represented (in one possible way) &lt;br/&gt;by a certain set of eight two-by-two matrices. &lt;br/&gt;This view of representation theory has many applications in &lt;br/&gt;chemistry and physics. The investigator's work will contribute to&lt;br/&gt;understanding the representation theory of Lie algebras and Lie groups, which &lt;br/&gt;are essential to understanding the symmetry of objects which arise in mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
