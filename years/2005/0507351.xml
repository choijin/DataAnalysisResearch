    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL EXPLANATION This project addresses fundamentals of surface processes during ion bombardment. Theoretical and experimental work has shown it to be a complex process, leading in some cases to well-defined surface instabilities that produce structures on length scales from 10 to 1000 nm. This project addresses fundamental issues about the dominant processes acting and their effects in particular situations. Real-time investigations of surface evolution during processing have natural advantages over post facto studies, and the PI has developed a unique facility at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) of Brookhaven National Laboratory for real-time investigation of surface processing. This approach is expected to enable detailed studies of how surface morphology changes during ion bombardment. The project aims to better understand a wide range of materials behavior during ion bombardment and, ultimately, plasma processing. While maintaining close contact with collaborators performing theory and simulations, studies will be made into the effects of stress on surface evolution during ion bombardment, the nature of ion-enhanced surface relaxation, the evolution of lithographically fabricated nanoscale structures during ion bombardment, and the structural evolution of compound semiconductors during ion bombardment both with and without sample rotation. &lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses fundamental materials research with strong technological relevance to electronics and photonics, and effectively integrates research and education. As part of this research project, students at the graduate, undergraduate and high school levels will be involved in learning about scientific and technological issues at the forefront of current materials research. Through continuing collaborations with scientists at national labs and other universities, these students will have special opportunities to participate in a broad spectrum of research environments. The program includes support for two graduate students performing their doctoral research in these areas. It is anticipated that 1-2 undergraduate students will be actively engaged with the program at any given time. The PI also, through Boston University's existing summer High School Honor's program, expects to mentor a high school student in the project each year.</AbstractNarration>
