<AbstractNarration>The proliferation of shrubs and trees in arid/semiarid grasslands and savannas in recent&lt;br/&gt;decades has been widely documented. This worldwide phenomenon threatens the&lt;br/&gt;livelihood of rural economies through adverse impacts on livestock production. It is also&lt;br/&gt;thought to have had a significant impact on the terrestrial carbon cycle in North and&lt;br/&gt;South America, Australia and Africa. The ability of woody plants to encroach into&lt;br/&gt;grasslands varies widely among species. Why are some so successful and others not?&lt;br/&gt;The study will address this question by determining how woody plants gain their&lt;br/&gt;foothold in grasslands during the critical establishment phase. By comparing the&lt;br/&gt;survivorship and growth of more and less successful woody encroachers under a range&lt;br/&gt;of climatic conditions and disturbances (defoliation), the study will determine a) which&lt;br/&gt;root and shoot growth characteristics, of the many that seem plausible, are reliably&lt;br/&gt;associated with encroachment potential; and b) how soil properties (such at clay&lt;br/&gt;content) may amplify or mitigate environmental factors influencing encroachment&lt;br/&gt;potential. The goals are two-fold: (1) to develop guidelines that can be used to identify&lt;br/&gt;potential problem species and characterize the conditions under which they are likely to&lt;br/&gt;establish so that appropriate management actions can be taken to minimize their&lt;br/&gt;invasion into grassland; and (2) to generate information needed to parameterize&lt;br/&gt;simulation models that can be used to forecast when and where woody plant invasions&lt;br/&gt;are likely to occur, thus giving land managers time to develop and implement&lt;br/&gt;appropriate preventative measures. Outreach activities will be an integral part of this&lt;br/&gt;work.</AbstractNarration>
