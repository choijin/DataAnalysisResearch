<AbstractNarration>This project focus on problems at the interface of commutative algebra and&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry. Specifically, several commutatative algebraic&lt;br/&gt;approaches to problems in higher dimensional birational algebraic geometry&lt;br/&gt;are proposed. These include building on the PI's prior work on ideal cores&lt;br/&gt;to prove a conjecture of Kawamata's on the existence of a global section&lt;br/&gt;for any ample line bundle on a smooth projective variety which is adjoint&lt;br/&gt;to an ample bundle. It also includes the development of the theory of&lt;br/&gt;multiplier ideals in the singular setting, and a study of the commutative&lt;br/&gt;algebraic properties of jet schemes, especially for combinatorially rich&lt;br/&gt;cases such as monomial schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work proposed here is part of the broader landscape of research in&lt;br/&gt;"pure" algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, the fields that study&lt;br/&gt;the geometric objects (called algebraic varieties) that can be described&lt;br/&gt;by polynomial equations. These fields provide the underpinnings of several&lt;br/&gt;important areas of applications of mathematics to problems in government&lt;br/&gt;and industry.  Examples include error-correcting codes based on algebraic&lt;br/&gt;varieties, and computer-aided design (CAD) which "draws" geometric objects&lt;br/&gt;on the computer screen by plotting pieces of algebraic varieties. While&lt;br/&gt;this project does not address specific current problems in applications,&lt;br/&gt;it does contribute to the healthy thriving infrastructure of the subject&lt;br/&gt;necessary to support applications in the future. Furthermore, it is&lt;br/&gt;expected that several of trainees in this project will continue later with&lt;br/&gt;more applied aspects of the subject by moving to positions in industry and&lt;br/&gt;government  (such as the National Security Agency).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
