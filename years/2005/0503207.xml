<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Laurencin&lt;br/&gt;05503207&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project employs a multidisciplinary approach towards the development of novel polymer based matrices in rotating bioreactors for bone tissue engineering. The development of a matrix of this sort combined with novel tissue culture technology provides opportunities for studying polymer-cell interactions, polymer matrix  effects  on  cellular response, and  effects  of transport  on cellular response in matrix based systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first project aim is to explore the development of new polymer constructs fabricated by sintering microspheres to form matrices suitable for bone tissue engineering in rotating bioreactors.  In the second aim, the scaffolds and operating environment is to be optimized in rotating bioreactors as well as the optimizing of physicochemical parameters such as scaffold composition, pore size of scaffolds, rotating speed of rotating bioreactors and cell seeding density surrounding these novel microsphere-  based  scaffolds. The third aim, the delivery of growth factors, will be studied in the bioreactors, building on the previous work via incorporating factors into the matrix that may enhance cellular endothelialization and bone growth. And, in the fourth aim,  extensive in  vivo  studies  will  be  performed,  examining  the  ability  of  these  tissue  engineered bioreactor cultured matrices to heal critical size bone defects. These studies will pay careful attention to the mechanical strength of the healing defect and the histology and histomorphometry at the defect site. The studies should yield important new fundamental information broadly applicable in tissue engineering.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educationally, the research is expected to have a special impact on the training of underrepresented minority students at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and  hence  would  greatly  enrich  the  level  of  scientific  resources  available  to  our  nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gilbert B.
