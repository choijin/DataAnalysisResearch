    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will develop an innovative non-volatile spintronic cryptographic key memory that can self-erase without data remanence in the event of tampering and without applied power. Magnetic Random Access Memory (MRAM) is the only technology with potential for this capability. Anti-tamper MRAM could be a major paradigm shift - memories used in ICs presently must be erased by overwriting or disconnection of a power source when tampering is detected. Research objectives include a micromagnetic study of MRAM bit shapes to eliminate data remanence after DC field erasure, finite elements simulation of the integrated system to determine optimal magnet/shield/die configurations, fabrication of spintronic anti-tamper memory cells, and red team analysis of the integrated device. This work will be&lt;br/&gt;accomplished through use of spin-dependent tunneling fabrication and simulation&lt;br/&gt;resources. The anticipated result is a 1 kbit anti-tamper embedded MRAM design and&lt;br/&gt;feasibility analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially, this provides an extra layer of protection on IC-based assemblies such as&lt;br/&gt;smart cards, cash machines etc. In addition, the proposed program will render a system&lt;br/&gt;inoperable in the event of physical tamper. This will be a very useful tool in stemming&lt;br/&gt;the tide of fraudulent usage or compromises of IC-based instruments as well as certain&lt;br/&gt;types of identify theft. Certain groups have targeted various research organizations and&lt;br/&gt;attempted to otherwise compromise their research through attacks on their computer&lt;br/&gt;systems. This would provide additional protection to the data. Identity theft has become&lt;br/&gt;a very large issue for society in general and particularly in the more computerized&lt;br/&gt;societies.</AbstractNarration>
