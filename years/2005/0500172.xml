<AbstractNarration>First order logic is suitable for describing and studying classes of&lt;br/&gt;"discrete" structures: fields, groups, graphs, etc.  Model theory, and&lt;br/&gt;in particular stability theory, provided several striking structure&lt;br/&gt;theorems for such classes: for example, the fact that every vector&lt;br/&gt;space is determined by (the cardinality of) a linear base, while every&lt;br/&gt;algebraically closed fields is determined by a transcendence base, are&lt;br/&gt;both special cases of Morley's Theorem: in any class of structure to&lt;br/&gt;which this theorem applies, all structures are generated by a suitable&lt;br/&gt;base.  Shelah's classification theory is a vast generalisation of&lt;br/&gt;Morley's Theorem, yielding structure theorems to many more classes of&lt;br/&gt;structures.  While all these theories were developed for classes of&lt;br/&gt;discrete structures, they seems to hold, at least to some extent, for&lt;br/&gt;classes of metric, or "continuous" structures: for example, compare&lt;br/&gt;Morley's theorem with the fact that every Hilbert space is generated&lt;br/&gt;(as a complete metric vector space) by an orthonormal base.  This&lt;br/&gt;proposal seeks to further adapt classical structure results from&lt;br/&gt;stability and classification theory to classes of continuous&lt;br/&gt;structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal therefore seeks to extend the results and techniques of&lt;br/&gt;stability theory, and in particular superstability, to the setting of&lt;br/&gt;continuous first order logic, aiming towards a generalisation of&lt;br/&gt;Shelah's Main Gap Theorem.  Continuous first order logic has the&lt;br/&gt;advantage of being a natural generalisation of first order logic,&lt;br/&gt;while at the time accommodating many natural classes of (metric)&lt;br/&gt;structures arising in functional analysis and probability theory&lt;br/&gt;(various classes of Banach spaces possibly with additional structure,&lt;br/&gt;measure algebras of probability spaces and of adapted spaces, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;New complications arising from the presence of a non-discrete metric&lt;br/&gt;require us to revise the fundamental definitions (superstability,&lt;br/&gt;ranks, etc.), and renders most of the classical theory, and in&lt;br/&gt;particular the notion of regular types, seemingly inapplicable.&lt;br/&gt;Nevertheless there has been considerable progress recently in this&lt;br/&gt;direction, such as an adaptation of Lachlan's theorem to continuous&lt;br/&gt;superstable theories, and there are indications that similar&lt;br/&gt;techniques can be used towards finiteness of weight and its&lt;br/&gt;consequences, which seem the natural next step towards the achievement&lt;br/&gt;of this programme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
