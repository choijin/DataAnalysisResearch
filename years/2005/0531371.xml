    <AbstractNarration>Defining the Opportunities, Challenges, and Research Needs for NanoBiomaterials Derived from Lignocellulosics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This nations forest resources play an important role in the economic, social, and environmental performance of the U.S. and represent one of the top five global forest reserves. Recent changes in national and international competitiveness of the forest products industry have challenged the historical position of leadership this nation has held in this important industrial sector. These changes have resulted in a loss of current and future economic growth in many rural U.S. regions that are dependent on the forest products industry. And yet, within these challenging economic conditions, tremendous new opportunities are emerging. The recently hosted 2004 Forest Products Nanotechnology Workshop in Washington identified nanocomposites engineered from wood biopolymers as a unique material that could be readily utilized in several industrial sectors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this workshop proposal is two-fold:&lt;br/&gt;1) Research: Develop a broad multidisciplinary workshop directed at evaluating the research needs, opportunities, and benefits of separating, synthesizing, and engineering nanostructures from wood biopolymers into advanced materials&lt;br/&gt;2) Education: Provide an opportunity by which national and international experts and other interested parties in can exchange ideas and concepts providing a unique cross-disciplinary learning opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that this NSF sponsored workshop will be a pivotal meeting that will lead to a new vision and roadmap that will highlight the future benefits and opportunities for the development of new nanobioterials based wood. The roadmap will leverage this nations' position of leadership in nanotechnology with its preeminent renewable forest resources to develop a research roadmap that will contribute to the development of innovative value-added nanocomposites.</AbstractNarration>
