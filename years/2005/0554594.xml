<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on critical needs in the preparation and long-term development of&lt;br/&gt;pre-service, undergraduate, K-6 teachers of science.  The goal is to investigate the&lt;br/&gt;impact on these students of undergraduate, standards-based, reform entry level science&lt;br/&gt;courses developed by faculty based on their participation in the NASA Opportunities for&lt;br/&gt;Visionary Academics (NOVA) professional development program.  Thirty reform and 30&lt;br/&gt;comparison undergraduate science courses from a national population of 101 diverse&lt;br/&gt;institutions, stratified by institutional type, are being selected and compared in a&lt;br/&gt;professional development impact design model.  Data is being collected using multiple&lt;br/&gt;quantitative and qualitative instruments and analyzed using comparative and relational&lt;br/&gt;studies at multiple points.  Research questions to be explored include:  determination of&lt;br/&gt;short-term impacts on undergraduate students and long-term effects on graduated&lt;br/&gt;in-service teachers in their own classroom science teaching; identification of&lt;br/&gt;characteristics of reform courses that produce significant impacts and identification of&lt;br/&gt;characteristics of effective faculty development efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project evolves from the large sample of reformed courses&lt;br/&gt;available for study (all based on the same extensive longitudinal professional&lt;br/&gt;development model developed through NOVA).  The study is advancing understanding&lt;br/&gt;of effective faculty professional development and of the characteristics of undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;science courses that impact student subject matter and pedagogical content knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project stem from the diversity of the student populations&lt;br/&gt;and variety of the institutions involved in the study.  The population from which the study&lt;br/&gt;sample is drawn consists of over 30% minority institutions, is geographically diverse,&lt;br/&gt;and is representative of the variety of teacher preparation institutions.  The study is&lt;br/&gt;advancing the teaching, training and learning of undergraduate science faculty and&lt;br/&gt;their students at the 30 institutions directly involved and, more broadly, at a national&lt;br/&gt;network of institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This 5-year national study of education in undergraduate science (NSEUS) focused on short-term outcomes of undergraduate students and long-term effects on graduated students who became elementary school teachers. We investigated the impact of professional development on faculty and their development of undergraduate entry-level science courses. Our study uniquely involved the largest and most diverse population of institutions involved in reforming undergraduate science courses through an extensive, longitudinal professional development program.  From the population of 103 institutions, 20 were selected for extensive on-site data collection visits.  We investigated courses involving 39 faculty and the students in their courses. Courses taken by a wide range of majors were studied, with a particular emphasis on courses serving future elementary teachers.  At the same sites, data were collected from 99 elementary teachers who had completed these courses.   We can report several important findings. The professional development experienced by course faculty enabled and facilitated their development of undergraduate science courses with reform characteristics.  The elements of effective reform courses had a significantly greater number of indicators of inquiry learning that related to course design, instructional strategies, and the curriculum.  Faculty teaching reformed courses had a significantly higher level of instructional expertise, engaging students more effectively in active learning. Students in the reformed science courses indicated that they experienced more facilitative classroom learning environments as compared to more traditional courses.  Students experiencing higher levels of reform also demonstrated higher levels of achievement.  In addition, the study found that active and inquiry-oriented undergraduate classes affect how graduates later planned science lessons in their role as elementary school teachers.  Additional findings were that collaborative faculty teams effectively developed and sustained course reform over time, and that successful course reforms were influencing factors for other faculty who eventually reformed their own courses.  The results of our national study provide information on several important questions: (a) What is an effective reform course?  (b) What elements are effective in science course reform? (c) What is inquiry teaching at the undergraduate level? (d) How many reform elements must be included at the undergraduate level to show better than average student achievement gain? (e) What amount of instructional knowledge is needed by faculty if they are to be effective in teaching undergraduate classes? and (f) How well does reform have to be implemented to show better than average student achievement gain?  In summary, the model used in this study for research on reform in undergraduate science teaching can be used to predict faculty change and student outcomes.  Reform efforts were found to be sustainable with dedicated, collaborative faculty who have continuing administrative support.  A significantly high level of reform in both quantity and quality, however, is required to observe greater than expected gains in student outcomes.  Adding a single innovation to a traditional course, or poorly performing an innovation, does not affect student outcomes.  Effective reform requires significant multiple innovations by faculty over a sustained period of time to create real change.  The broader impacts of this study advance the teaching, training, and learning of undergraduate science faculty and the development of more effective entry-level courses.    Throughout the duration of the project, we used multiple forms of dissemination which proved to be important in providing faculty across the nation with research-based practices for reforming courses. Two national conferences with the theme of research-based undergraduate science teaching were held involving 150 researchers from 85 higher...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
