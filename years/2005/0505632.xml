<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0505632&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Bo Guan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this project is to understand some nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;elliptic and parabolic equations which arise from problems in&lt;br/&gt;differential geometry.  The research will be focused on three&lt;br/&gt;types of geometric problems: Plateau-type problems for&lt;br/&gt;hypersurfaces in Euclidean space and in more general manifolds;&lt;br/&gt;the Minkowski-type problems of finding closed convex&lt;br/&gt;hypersurfaces of prescribed Weingarten curvature, and problems in&lt;br/&gt;isometric embedding.  Each of these problems involves solving&lt;br/&gt;some fully nonlinear partial differential equations. Because of&lt;br/&gt;their origins in geometry, these equations are closely related&lt;br/&gt;and therefore share many common technical issues.  Thus, progress&lt;br/&gt;in one of the problems will very likely lead to progress in the&lt;br/&gt;others, and more generally in the theory of nonlinear partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations (on manifolds) and geometric analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fully nonlinear equations also arise in other problems in&lt;br/&gt;geometry and physics as well as in science and&lt;br/&gt;engineering. Results from our research may have impact and&lt;br/&gt;applications in areas such as string theory in physics, and&lt;br/&gt;optimal control theory.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
