<AbstractNarration>Case Studies in Bayesian Statistics VIII is the eighth workshop in the&lt;br/&gt;series that was begun in 1991. These workshops aim to advance&lt;br/&gt;statistical practice by examining Bayesian methods in specific applied&lt;br/&gt;contexts. The workshops are held in odd years at Carnegie Mellon&lt;br/&gt;University in early fall. The eighth workshop is planned for September&lt;br/&gt;16--17, 2005.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the workshop, "Case Studies in Bayesian Statistics&lt;br/&gt;VIII" is are to explore the interplay of statistical theory and&lt;br/&gt;practice in the context of substantive scientific research; to promote&lt;br/&gt;the continued development of Bayesian statistics by highlighting&lt;br/&gt;problems in the sciences that require non-standard approaches; to&lt;br/&gt;provide an opportunity for scientists and statisticians to present&lt;br/&gt;their work in depth, highlighting both the scientific background and&lt;br/&gt;the analytical approaches; and to encourage dissemination of the&lt;br/&gt;findings presented at the workshop via well-documented and&lt;br/&gt;peer-reviewed case studies.  As it has evolved, this workshop series&lt;br/&gt;has become an important meeting for younger researchers in Bayesian&lt;br/&gt;statistics.  The workshop aims to encourage young researchers,&lt;br/&gt;including graduate students, to present their applied work; provide a&lt;br/&gt;small meeting atmosphere to facilitate the interaction of young&lt;br/&gt;researchers with senior colleagues; expose young researchers to&lt;br/&gt;important challenges and opportunities in collaborative research; and&lt;br/&gt;include as participants women, under-represented minorities and&lt;br/&gt;persons with disabilities who might benefit from the small workshop&lt;br/&gt;environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
