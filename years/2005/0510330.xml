<AbstractNarration>Acoustic Properties of Open Cell Metal, Ceramic, and Reticulated Carbon Foams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this research project are to develop theoretical and experimental models for the acoustic properties of high porosity, metal, ceramic, and carbon foams.  Current empirical and theoretical models are inadequate for prediction of acoustic properties such as the characteristic acoustic impedance and wavenumber of these materials.  The models will use pore geometry information such as pore size, frame size, and pore/frame size distribution as the basis of the models instead of information that requires additional physical measurements such as flow resistivity, porosity, and tortuosity.  Accurate models of the acoustic properties are essential to use these materials in such applications as acoustic absorbers in harsh environments, and as stacks, regenerators, and heat exchangers for thermodynamic devices.  In addition, the project will use the results to aid in the development of a thermoacoustic Stirling demonstration device and the PI will develop additional acoustics demonstrations for K-12 outreach in programs located in predominately African-American and Latino neighborhoods.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
