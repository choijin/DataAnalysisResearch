<AbstractNarration>The principal thrust of this research project is further development of &lt;br/&gt;efficient triangulations and their applications to the study and &lt;br/&gt;understanding of 3-manifolds. 0- and 1-efficient triangulations have lead &lt;br/&gt;to a number of new methods and results on triangulations of 3-manifolds, &lt;br/&gt;decision problems, algorithms, computational complexity, Heegaard &lt;br/&gt;splittings, and Dehn fillings. We propose to develop further our &lt;br/&gt;understanding of 0- and 1-efficient triangulations and to form a notion of &lt;br/&gt;g-efficient triangulations (g &gt; 1). Our goals are to make an explicit &lt;br/&gt;connection between efficient triangulations and geometric structures on &lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds, to use efficient triangulations for a better understanding of &lt;br/&gt;Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds, and to use our methods that reduce a &lt;br/&gt;given triangulation to an efficient triangulation to achieve a &lt;br/&gt;simplification to the solution of the Homeomorphism Problem for &lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds (Classification of 3-manifolds).  In particular, we propose &lt;br/&gt;new algorithms for deciding if a 3-manifold is a Haken manifold, for the &lt;br/&gt;JSJ decomposition of a 3-manifold and for the recognition of Haken &lt;br/&gt;manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three-dimensional manifolds are mathematical objects which are locally &lt;br/&gt;modeled on familiar three-dimensional space. The major problem in the &lt;br/&gt;study of three-manifolds is their classification, which is to make a &lt;br/&gt;complete list of all three-manifolds without duplications. The study and &lt;br/&gt;understanding of three-manifolds toward such a classification is the main &lt;br/&gt;objective of this project. In particular, we know that three-manifolds can &lt;br/&gt;be considered as a union of building blocks fitting together in a very &lt;br/&gt;organized way. For example, tetrahedra may be used as the building blocks; &lt;br/&gt;in this case, the collection of tetrahedra and the information about how &lt;br/&gt;they fit together is called a triangulation of the three-manifold. All &lt;br/&gt;three-manifolds can be triangulated. Thus one of the major strategies &lt;br/&gt;toward solving the classification problem is to find methods to recognize &lt;br/&gt;a particular three-manifold, having been given the three-manifold in one &lt;br/&gt;of its many possible triangulations.  Applications of topology of &lt;br/&gt;three-manifolds range from questions of protein knotting and unknotting in &lt;br/&gt;DNA to the issue of the shape of space (the universe). In particular, the &lt;br/&gt;latter may very well come to an issue of recognizing the three-manifold &lt;br/&gt;that is our universe. Thus the classification and understanding of &lt;br/&gt;three-manifolds has far reaching applications and implications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
