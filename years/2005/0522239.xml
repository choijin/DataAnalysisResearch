    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project will complete the development of an oxygen sensor that can be deployed inside aircraft fuel tanks. Such a sensor will be needed after the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) mandates the use of nitrogen-enriched air to prevent explosions like the one that destroyed TWA flight 800. Currently available oxygen sensors cannot withstand the harsh environment and meet the accuracy, longevity, and cost requirements. The technical objectives are to completely characterize and understand the permeation properties of the polymer matrix; examine alternative formulations of the polymer; completely understand the photochemical, leaching, and spectroscopic properties of the phosphorescent dye, examine other candidate dyes, and conduct long-term testing. A flight test of the oxygen sensor is planned. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will ultimately benefit society by making air travel safer. It will also serve as a model for the interplay between fundamental science, applied science, and the engineering disciplines during product development. The work will open the door for development of other luminescent sensors that can be deployed in comparably harsh chemical environments, including the measurement of water in fuels and alcohols.</AbstractNarration>
