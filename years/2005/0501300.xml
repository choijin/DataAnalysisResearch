<AbstractNarration>Harmonic analysis on sets is an area that has been under intensive development&lt;br/&gt;since the 1980's. The first results concerned the behavior of singular integrals &lt;br/&gt;on sets in terms of the geometry of the sets. The model operator, and &lt;br/&gt;impetus to the theory, was the Cauchy integral with the model geometric &lt;br/&gt;setting being a Lipschitz curve. This theory has witnessed an explosive &lt;br/&gt;growth in terms of understanding the relation between L2 estimates in &lt;br/&gt;terms of the multiscale geometry of the underlying set. One of the &lt;br/&gt;realizations of the 1990's was that there is an L2 theory of geometry &lt;br/&gt;in terms of so-called Beta numbers, and that there is a "dictionary" &lt;br/&gt;that translates theorems on geometry of sets into theorems on wavelets, &lt;br/&gt;and vice versa. While the theory of Beta numbers also gave a good &lt;br/&gt;understanding of the multiscale structure of e.g. a data set, it only &lt;br/&gt;provides a certain framework for the understanding of the geometry, and &lt;br/&gt;does not encompass a theory analogous to Fourier series or the study of &lt;br/&gt;heat flow. It is the development of such a theory, along with its &lt;br/&gt;relations to the already understood multiscale aspects, that is now &lt;br/&gt;required to provide a deeper understanding of harmonic analysis on sets. &lt;br/&gt;For example the problem of building local coordinates that capture most &lt;br/&gt;of the statistical behavior of (mostly) lower dimensional subsets has &lt;br/&gt;not been well developed mathematically, though many proposed methods &lt;br/&gt;have been studied. We propose to relate the top down methods (e.g. Beta &lt;br/&gt;Numbers and corresponding geometry) to bottom up methods of diffusion &lt;br/&gt;geometries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  This new method of studying harmonic analysis on sets is based on the &lt;br/&gt;use of certain eigenfunctions related to the set. These eigenfunctions, &lt;br/&gt;coming from naturally defined matrices, allow the introduction of "local &lt;br/&gt;coordinates" on the set by picking the n largest eigenvalues, and &lt;br/&gt;using the corresponding n eigenfunctions as coordinates. The method &lt;br/&gt;proposed has a close relation to the theory of so-called prolate &lt;br/&gt;functions, as the resulting eigenfunctions have similar properties. This &lt;br/&gt;is in sharp contrast to the method of Coifman, Jones, and Semmes for &lt;br/&gt;defining Haar type L2 frames on sets resembling Lipschitz curves. &lt;br/&gt;The method of the proposal gives different functions with which one can &lt;br/&gt;naturally define local coordinates and study (approximate and correctly &lt;br/&gt;defined) heat flow on sets. Professors Jones and Coifman propose to &lt;br/&gt;study these methods and develop a theory that can be combined with &lt;br/&gt;previous results to relate top down behavior to bottom up behavior. This &lt;br/&gt;is done from the point of view of computational efficiency and the &lt;br/&gt;development of fast algorithms. They also propose to study the various &lt;br/&gt;geometrical descriptions to provide new methods of attacking older &lt;br/&gt;problems in harmonic analysis. In doing so, they aim to break new ground &lt;br/&gt;and broaden the applicability of other earlier methods.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
