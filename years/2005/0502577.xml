<AbstractNarration>This project aims at developing a new generation of advanced glass ceramics with tailored functionalities for a range of application in infrared optics. Various nucleating agents can be added to a chalcogenide glass matrix to produce nano-crystal and generate materials with new and unique properties. This results in a wide range of potential applications including, non-linear properties for second harmonic generation, nanoporous structures for infrared sensing, near-zero thermal dispersion for highly sensitive optical systems and rare earth doping for high efficiency luminescence. A fine control of the morphology and number of nano-crystals in the glass matrix is crucial to deliver the appropriate properties hence the fundamental mechanism of nucleation and growth will be investigated using modulated differential calorimetry. Additionally, the phenomenon of photoinduced nucleation will be investigated in order to generate localized crystallization and produce patterned structures not accessible thermally. Finally, the correlation between loss of mechanical resistance and aging in rapidly cooled chalcogenide glass fiber will be evaluated in terms of average coordination number, in order to improve the resistance of fibers used in optical sensors. Additionally the phenomenon of photoinduced fluidity will be investigated for processing high performance fiber sensors. This program will bring together two research groups with complementary skills to enhance collaborative research at the University of Arizona and University of Rennes, France. The program will seek to attract under-represented groups to the field of glass science and educate them to a range of cutting edge techniques. Students will particularly benefit from the program by performing course work and research partly at both institutions and earning a joint Ph.D. degree recognized at both institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optical materials is a fast developing field that has a large impact on enabling new technologies such as optical communications, optical sensors, laser guided weapons etc... In particular, the infrared optics developed in this project have unique potentials for advanced detection of hazardous bio-chemicals, for improving signal transmission in telecom networks and developing stable optics for laser defense systems. This research will therefore impact the community in the field of homeland security, information technology and smart weapons design. Additionally, this program will allow to attract students from under-represented groups to the field of material science and to train them to cutting-edge science in an international context that is becoming crucial in today's global economy and scientific world.</AbstractNarration>
