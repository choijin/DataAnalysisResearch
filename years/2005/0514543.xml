    <AbstractNarration>A-1&lt;br/&gt;The domain Archaea is one of the three domains of life, and organisms in this domain&lt;br/&gt;are distinct from organisms in either the domain Bacteria (eubacteria) or the domain&lt;br/&gt;Eucarya (eukaryotes). Although archaeal organisms represent approximately one third&lt;br/&gt;of life's evolutionary diversity and display many interesting and practical properties and&lt;br/&gt;activities, Archaea are much less characterized than are organisms from the other two&lt;br/&gt;domains. The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Archaea grew out of a GRC on&lt;br/&gt;methanogenesis, which was held every three years from 1984-1993. The first GRC on&lt;br/&gt;Archaea was held in 1996, and at the second meeting held in 1999, the participants&lt;br/&gt;voted unanimously to make it a reoccurring meeting. The 2001 meeting had an&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary program, stressing genomics, unusual metabolism, transcription and its&lt;br/&gt;regulation. A similar theme with added sessions (ecodiversity, extremophilic proteins,&lt;br/&gt;functional genomics) was pursued in 2003. The 2005 conference will emphasize&lt;br/&gt;emerging topics including systems biology, proteomics and biotechnology. These&lt;br/&gt;changes expand on the number of impacted NSF programs and include PIs funded in&lt;br/&gt;MCB, DEB, and BES. Specific programs are itemized in the suggested reviewers&lt;br/&gt;sections. The conference has a diverse and gender-balanced slate of speakers and&lt;br/&gt;session leaders. NSF support for this conference will allow more participants including&lt;br/&gt;students and postdocs to attend the GRC, facilitating interaction between junior and&lt;br/&gt;established American and international scientists.</AbstractNarration>
