<AbstractNarration>The investigator and his colleagues develop numerical methods for scattering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;problems, and perform a detailed analysis of these methods. Specifically,&lt;br/&gt;they develop boundary element methods for integral formulations &lt;br/&gt;of the Helmholtz equation, in which the basis functions are asymptotically&lt;br/&gt;derived. Each basis function is the product of a &lt;br/&gt;smooth amplitude and a highly oscillatory phase factor, like the asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;solution. &lt;br/&gt;The phase factor is determined a-priori by geometrical optics and the&lt;br/&gt;geometrical theory of diffraction, while the amplitude is a smooth function.&lt;br/&gt; This choice of oscillatory phase factor, ensures that the number of&lt;br/&gt;unknowns is virtually independent of the frequency. The basis functions&lt;br/&gt;being studied are designed in a way that the matrix, resulting from the&lt;br/&gt;discretization, has a number of significant entries which is proportional to&lt;br/&gt;the number of basis functions, in the large frequency limit. &lt;br/&gt;Hence, this matrix can be approximated with a sparse approximate &lt;br/&gt;matrix. The investigator and his colleagues explore the use of the sparse &lt;br/&gt;matrix instead of the original matrix, in order to obtain an approximate &lt;br/&gt;solution to the problem, and they study the solution of the approximate&lt;br/&gt;problem with iterative methods, and multi-grid methods. In addition they&lt;br/&gt;study the use of the sparse matrix as a preconditioner.&lt;br/&gt;This new methodology is being developed by studying problems of increasing&lt;br/&gt;complexity, such as convex domains with corners in two dimensions, and&lt;br/&gt;convex three dimensional domains. The impact of this research is therefore&lt;br/&gt;in the development of discretization schemes for the Helmholtz equation in &lt;br/&gt;which the number of unknowns is virtually independent of the frequency, and&lt;br/&gt;the design of optimally fast algorithms for solving those discrete problems.&lt;br/&gt;This transforms problems which are computationally exceedingly difficult if&lt;br/&gt;not intractable, into ones which are readily solved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The solution of scattering problems has many applications in technology.&lt;br/&gt;Applications include remote sensing, ultra-sound imaging of tissue,&lt;br/&gt;non-destructive testing, geophysical prospecting, the design of reduced&lt;br/&gt;radar signature airplanes, and the determination of the acoustic signature&lt;br/&gt;of submersible vehicles. For the current configurations of interest,&lt;br/&gt;geometrical complications and/or compositional complexity in the underlying&lt;br/&gt;structure make manual solutions practically impossible. Moreover, in the mid&lt;br/&gt;to high frequency regime, standard computational approaches require an&lt;br/&gt;exceedingly large amount of calculations, leaving some problems&lt;br/&gt;computationally intractable. The fast and efficient algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;scattering problems developed by the investigator and his colleagues will&lt;br/&gt;broadly impact design and discovery tools in the application areas mentioned&lt;br/&gt;above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
