<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to acquire a fundamental understanding of friction in machining processes, especially in the context of the tribological roles of multi-scale tool coatings, tool topology and controlled cutting fluid application.  The approach to be followed includes detailed experimental work allied with analytical and numerical modeling methodologies; the expected outcome is models that effectively describe variable tool-chip interfacial friction and its effects on machining process mechanics.  First, the tribological effects of new multi-scale multi-layered coatings on machining performance will be studied.  This will be followed by an investigation into the effects of macro- and meso-scale topological features (such as complex chip breaker geometries) on variable friction in machining.  The next task involves a study of the fundamental mechanisms by which cooling and lubrication are achieved (or not achieved) when cutting fluids are applied in a controlled manner.  This task will also explore the role of engineered tool micro-features in enhancing cooling and/or lubrication.  The final task involves integration of the acquired new knowledge to establish interaction effects between tool coatings, tool topology and cutting fluid application followed by application of this integrated analysis to a typical 3-D machining operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the new friction models and knowledge generated will improve future analytical and computational modeling of critical issues such as tool-wear, chip formation, and surface integrity.  The fundamental understanding of the integrated effects of tool coatings, topology and cutting fluid application will enable better process planning decisions for industry based on their performance needs.  The research on estimating precise cooling and lubrication effects of cutting fluid application can be used to minimize use of these fluids, thereby promoting sustainable manufacturing.  Broad educational and societal impact is expected through the development of new courses and multimedia content, outreach to high school students and teachers, recruitment of minorities into manufacturing research, and focused dissemination of the results to academia, industry and society.</AbstractNarration>
