<AbstractNarration>This symposium will cover various aspects related to sol-gel processes as a chemical synthesis technique for preparing oxide gels, glasses and inorganic compounds at low temperature, generally below 100C. The method is of considerable significance, both scientifically and technologically, because it possesses a number of desirable attributes in terms of the low synthesis temperature, chemical flexibility and the ability to design materials with specific properties and morphology. These and other priority areas will be discussed at this conference. The International Workshop on Sol-Gel Science and Technology is widely recognized as the most prominent conference in this field as it brings together a multidisciplinary group of scientists and engineers to disseminate the most important research and technological developments. This workshop has been held biennually for over 20 years, but has never been held in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include opportunities for the participants to foster collaborative relationships with other scientists where there are mutual interests in biomaterials areas. It will give early career faculty, post doctoral scholars, and graduate students an opportunity to engage in cross-disciplinary discussions with colleagues from other universities, government laboratories and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
