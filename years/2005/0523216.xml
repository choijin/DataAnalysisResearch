<AbstractNarration>Fruit flies exhibit versatile and sophisticated capabilities of stimulus discrimination and&lt;br/&gt;"attention"-like behavior. They are particularly attuned to recognizing novelty. This proposal&lt;br/&gt;outlines a plan to delineate the network and neural principles underlying the fruit fly's ability to&lt;br/&gt;perform these information-processing functions, and then to employ them as the basis for a&lt;br/&gt;computational device. This multi-step program will be begun by defining the circuitry in the fruit&lt;br/&gt;fly subserving its recognition, selective attention, and novelty responses, analyzing the&lt;br/&gt;contributions, connections, and interactions of these circuit elements both behaviorally and&lt;br/&gt;physiogically, and then introducing this neural architecture as the basis for the computer-simulated&lt;br/&gt;brain in a brain-based device capable of displaying novelty recognition.&lt;br/&gt;We will use techniques of gene targeting that we have developed previously to identify&lt;br/&gt;the parts of the brain contributing to recognition, selective attention, and novelty responses. We&lt;br/&gt;will map the sites in the nervous system mediating the effect by manipulating neural activity.&lt;br/&gt;This will be achieved in two opposing ways: one way by blocking activity and the other by&lt;br/&gt;increasing activity. These perturbations will be targeted to different, restricted parts of the brain&lt;br/&gt;by means of a set of genetically engineered fly strains we have developed and used over the&lt;br/&gt;years. In this manner, we will map the funcitonal circuitry mediating a fruit fly's novelty&lt;br/&gt;response by increasing or decreasing excitability in restricted brain regions.&lt;br/&gt;Aim 1: Analyze the complex, organizational architecture by which the fruit fly's nervous system&lt;br/&gt;achieves behaviorally the recognition of novelty.&lt;br/&gt;Aim 2: Map the distribution of the 20-30 Hz LFP response in various brain regions, and the role&lt;br/&gt;of coherence between these brain regions in the generation of the fruit fly's novelty response.&lt;br/&gt;Brain-based devices provide the groundwork for the development of intelligent machines&lt;br/&gt;that follow neurobiological rather than computational principles in their construction. As is the&lt;br/&gt;case with animals, the behaviors of brain-based devices emerge solely as a result of internally&lt;br/&gt;generated activity of their nervous systems rather than of responses to any programmed&lt;br/&gt;instructions from computer software. Such devices are particularly useful in situations of novelty&lt;br/&gt;where computation is not possible in principle or in cases of great local complexity where&lt;br/&gt;programming proves infeasible. Such a device must confront novel situations and complex sets of&lt;br/&gt;parameters that must be dealt with rapidly. Our goal is to implement principles from the fruit fly&lt;br/&gt;system into such a device, using as our platform an existing brain-based device developed at The&lt;br/&gt;Neurosciences Institute.&lt;br/&gt;Aim 3: Introduce a simulated neural architecture based on the functional network for novelty&lt;br/&gt;detection defined in Aims 1 &amp; 2 into a brain-based device.&lt;br/&gt;The long-term goal of this work is to understand the principles upon which the nervous&lt;br/&gt;system of the fruit fly operates as the basis for neurobiologically inspired computational devices.&lt;br/&gt;The principles underlying nervous system function hold promise for developing a new generation&lt;br/&gt;of devices that would be more capable of adaptive behavior than current systems. The most&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated behavior seen in either biological or artificial agents is shown by organisms whose&lt;br/&gt;behavior is guided by a nervous system. The fruit fly offers the requisite complexity to be of&lt;br/&gt;value in this endeavor, while being simple enough (i.e., small enough in neuron number) to be&lt;br/&gt;amenable to analysis. Most importantly, it offers sophistication afforded by a multi-disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;experimental approach (genetics, anatomy, physiology and behavior) to be followed by computer&lt;br/&gt;simulation and device implementation.</AbstractNarration>
