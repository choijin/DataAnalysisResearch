<AbstractNarration>This award supports two workshops to engage high school teachers and research scientists in the southwestern US in the SpiNet educational seismology  program. The workshops will be developed and documented in such a manner as to provide a model and toolkit for others to implement as part of a "Broader Impacts" effort associated with a seismology-related research project. Scientists will be involved in the workshops, as observers and participants, to ensure incorporation of their needs and perspectives in the workshop model and toolkit, as well. While this project is about seismology, the workshop model and toolkit are applicable to data-collection-based educational strategies in other disciplines.    The workshops will formalize a model for teacher workshops and develop a toolkit for others to use.  Scientists around the world will be able to use SpiNet as a platform for their own outreach. The goal is to reduce the time and specialized personnel needed for scientists to get involved in educational seismology efforts, thereby increasing the number who will pursue this avenue to satisfy their Criterion 2: Broader Impacts efforts. Additionally, the workshops, toolkit, and supporting infrastructure will advance understanding of how to most effectively engage classroom teachers and research scientists in educational seismology  activities.</AbstractNarration>
