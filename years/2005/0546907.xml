<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0546907&lt;br/&gt;Bevan Baas&lt;br/&gt;U of California - Davis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER:  Processors for the Computation of Future Digital Signal Processing Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications requiring significant levels of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) are becoming increasingly commonplace examples include GPS receivers, Wi-Fi wireless networking, 3D medical imaging, and cell phones. As these applications become increasingly sophisticated and more frequently portable, their performance and power dissipation requirements often exceed the capabilities of modern DSP processors. The&lt;br/&gt;goal of this research is to develop novel architectures, circuits, and software for high performance and low power DSP processors that meet the demands of emerging and future DSP applications, and that are also well-suited to future semiconductor fabrication processes. Research results are introduced into both undergraduate and graduate level courses and other investigators are involved in collaborative efforts. Results of this research are expected to enable new embedded, medical, environmental, and consumer applications.&lt;br/&gt;To achieve project goals, the investigators develop DSP systems with features that are new on several levels. First, easily-scalable programmable building block processors with high performance and high energy efficiency are developed using innovative architectures, granularity, clocking, interconnection, and circuits. Second, efficient architectures are developed for shared blocks such as large memory arrays and specialpurpose DSP processors, as well as methods for effectively integrating these blocks into the programmable DSP array. Third, software tools including a compiler and automatic mapping tools are developed to more easily program the system. Fourth, to demonstrate gains in performance and energy efficiency, the system is implemented in silicon, tested, and characterized.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goals of this project were to develop and study novel techniques for a programmable and/or reconfigurable processing system for the efficient computation of a broad range of digital signal processing (DSP) workloads. The targeted workloads are numerically intensive, typically composed of a variety of DSP sub-tasks, and can be found in a large number of current and future embedded, wireless, imaging, sensor, and communications applications.  While interesting and notable results were developed in many areas, the most active work was done in three general areas: 1) core processor architectures and circuits, 2) memory systems and special-purpose accelerators, and 3) the design and fabrication of a fully-functional 167-processor silicon chip that set records in many categories.  Core architectural and circuit work focused on inter-processor interconnects that are both very high throughput and also highly energy efficient. The second main sub-area was in the development of dynamic supply voltage and dynamic clock frequency scaling (DVFS) circuits and control algorithms. Most of these ideas and results were implemented in the AsAP2 167-processor chip.  In the era of very large numbers of processors per chip (such as over 1000 per chip), it will be increasingly important to have memories that can be coupled to certain processors as required by dynamic program needs.  This second thrust developed such memories and also developed a number of special-purpose accelerators.  A 167-processor computational platform was designed and fabricated as the third thrust of this project.  It consists of an array of simple programmable processors capable of per-processor dynamic supply voltage and clock frequency scaling, three algorithm-specific processors, and three 16 KB shared memories; and is implemented in 65 nm CMOS.  All processors and shared memories are clocked by local fully independent, dynamically haltable, digitally-programmable oscillators and are interconnected by a configurable circuit-switched network which supports long-distance communication.  Programmable processors occupy 0.17 mm2 and operate at a maximum clock frequency of 1.2 GHz at 1.3 V. At 1.2 V, they operate at 1.07 GHz and consume 47.5 mW when 100% active, resulting in an energy dissipation of 44 pJ per operation.  At 0.675 V, they operate at 66 MHz and consume 608 &micro;W when 100% active, resulting in a total energy dissipation of 9.2 pJ per ALU or MAC operation.
