<AbstractNarration>ECS-0524648&lt;br/&gt;B. AmirParviz, U of Washington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to demonstrate the use of self-assembled molecular monolayers as resist for photolithography and in particular near-field photolithography. Formation of molecular monolayers on a number of substrates is studied with spectroscopy. Molecules that demonstrate bond breakage from the substrate, or undergo chemical transformation, upon exposure to UV light are studied as photoresist. The product of the lithography procedure is a molecularly patterned substrate that can be used for further microfabrication or as a template for the bottom-up self-assembly of electronic devices. Post-processing methods for the substrate will be developed including wet chemical etching, polymer self-assembly, and selective attachment. The resolution limits of the lithography, using a resist with effective thickness of 1-2 nm, will be experimentally established and light propagation through the system will be modeled. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research makes a new photoresist available with a number of unique advantages: a) the resist is extremely thin and atomically uniform and hence can be used for near-field lithography, b) it self-assembles on the substrate, c) it can be engineered to attach only to specific locations on a substrate or onto non-planar substrate. Moreover it allows groups with access only to conventional lithography tools to generate nano-scale patterns.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal directly contributes to the training of a graduate student at the interface between chemistry and electrical engineering. It opens a venue for participation of undergraduate students in nanotechnology research and provides modules to be used in a laboratory course on nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
