<AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;In this project an automated microscope workstation will be specifically designed for&lt;br/&gt;students with mobility and visual impairments to independently operate all features of light&lt;br/&gt;microscopy. In a previous project an accessible microscopy workstation, called AccessScope,&lt;br/&gt;was developed to allow persons with mobility impairments to control a research light microscope&lt;br/&gt;without assistance through a personal computer, including loading slides. The PC became the&lt;br/&gt;user interface for controlling the microscope hardware and for displaying slide images in a live&lt;br/&gt;preview window via a video camera. Thus, the PC replaced the need to physically operate the&lt;br/&gt;microscopy workstation and view through microscope eyepieces. The AccessScope project&lt;br/&gt;demonstrated that independent control of microscopy was possible and useful for students with&lt;br/&gt;disabilities to actively participate in this laboratory technique.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Technical advancements can provide AccessScope with even greater functionality and&lt;br/&gt;the capability to be independently operated by students with visual impairments. A standalone&lt;br/&gt;software application to control AccessScope and view slides will be developed in this proposed&lt;br/&gt;project. This new software application will provide features that other commercial applications,&lt;br/&gt;including the one used in the previous AccessScope project, do not offer. Better stage movement,&lt;br/&gt;theta rotation of slide images in real-time, and remote control of the AccessScope workstation&lt;br/&gt;through the internet will be available. Disabled students using a PC will be able to remotely&lt;br/&gt;control a publicly shared research-level light microscope from virtually anywhere. The graphical&lt;br/&gt;user interface of the AccessScope application will be designed to accommodate users with low&lt;br/&gt;vision and upper limb motor impairments. Design features of the user interface will include user&lt;br/&gt;definable shortcut keys, intuitive graphical buttons and analog controls, color filtering, and the&lt;br/&gt;ability to alter the user interface's color, size, and contrast. The AccessScope application will be&lt;br/&gt;compliant with different assistive technology input devices for users with mobility impairments&lt;br/&gt;and screen enlargers, magnifiers, and readers for users with visual impairments. The&lt;br/&gt;AccessScope application will be simple enough in design to be used by secondary and&lt;br/&gt;postsecondary students with disabilities yet powerful enough to be valuable for scientists.&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the AccessScope project is to allow students with mobility impairments or&lt;br/&gt;low vision to independently use a light microscope and be able to actively participate in the same&lt;br/&gt;learning experiences as their able-bodied peers. Microscopy is an essential tool in many STEM&lt;br/&gt;fields. Not only does microscopy allow disabled students to participate in laboratory courses, but&lt;br/&gt;the hands-on experience provides a greater understanding of the character of tissue specimens,&lt;br/&gt;how histology slides are created, and the physics of microscope optics including its limitations.&lt;br/&gt;Activity-based learning is critical for pursuing an undergraduate science education, graduate&lt;br/&gt;level research, and many careers in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;The AccessScope software program will allow students with disabilities to have complete&lt;br/&gt;control of commercially available microscope equipment. This program will be freely distributed&lt;br/&gt;to students and teachers in secondary and postsecondary institutions, thus decreasing the expense&lt;br/&gt;of developing an AccessScope workstation. In addition, a demonstration version of the&lt;br/&gt;application will also be available to allow users to evaluate AccessScope without commitment.</AbstractNarration>
