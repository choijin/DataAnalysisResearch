<AbstractNarration>Polyolefins comprise an economically and technologically important class of materials.&lt;br/&gt;As a subset of all polymers, they are in general well-known, but continuing improvements in&lt;br/&gt;metallocene polymerization catalysis have demonstrated that enhanced physical properties are&lt;br/&gt;accessible through copolymerization, blending, and composites. Consequently, polyolefins and&lt;br/&gt;their blends span the gamut of possible applications, ranging from low-cost disposable foodpackaging to multicomponent composites for aerospace structural design. In all cases involving more than just a pure polymer, which is the majority, the morphology and local structure of the blend or composite determines the final physical and performance properties of the material.&lt;br/&gt;Surprisingly, first-principle mixing rules for polyolefin blends are not known, as these&lt;br/&gt;chemically simple polymers defy like dissolves like solubility conventions.                                                  &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. A conspicuous lack of experimental data at the molecular or chain level&lt;br/&gt;suggests that chain-structure/miscibility relationships in bulk polyolefin mixtures are far from&lt;br/&gt;being realized. The microscopic to mesoscopic (i.e. angstroms to tens of nanometers) length&lt;br/&gt;scales accessible by solids NMR experiments can address this deficiency in a non-invasive&lt;br/&gt;manner. Through acquisition of the chain-specific data (dynamics and distance) needed to&lt;br/&gt;resolve long-standing questions about the relative importance of chain packing and chain&lt;br/&gt;architecture, the role of each in determining entropic versus enthalpic contributions to the overall&lt;br/&gt;phase behavior may be examined.                                                                                                                                     &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The fundamental scientific questions surrounding polyolefin phase behavior,&lt;br/&gt;particularly for amorphous polyolefins in the melt or solid states, are far reaching in that&lt;br/&gt;mixtures of these nonpolar, noncrystalline polymers constitute a limiting class of&lt;br/&gt;macromolecular thermodynamics. As such, polyolefins and their blends are ideal systems for the&lt;br/&gt;experimental study of some long-standing questions in polymer science. For example, bulk&lt;br/&gt;amorphous polyolefins are concentrated systems, with many degrees of freedom. Given the&lt;br/&gt;varying chain architectures possible with polyolefins, can distinct degrees of freedom within and&lt;br/&gt;between molecules (rational introduction of dynamic heterogeneity fluctuations) be identified&lt;br/&gt;and related to phase behavior/phase transitions? The length-scale and time-scale of phase&lt;br/&gt;transitions in amorphous macromolecules, like those in liquid crystals, have been described in&lt;br/&gt;the context of configurational entropy arguments. Can we, using bulk polyolefins and their&lt;br/&gt;blends, provide non-invasive experimental confirmation of this view at the local chain level (1-&lt;br/&gt;10 nm)? If glass formation in non-interacting molecules is driven by loss of configurational&lt;br/&gt;entropy, can molecular level (less than the polymer radius of gyration) experiments detect and&lt;br/&gt;define local Tg's? Can this data be used to help broaden the scope of current thermodynamic&lt;br/&gt;models of polymer phase behavior to include configurational entropy contributions?                              &lt;br/&gt;The PI has been, and will continue to be, an active participant at all levels of education&lt;br/&gt;through this project. The PI, whose efforts are leveraged through the public outreach director in&lt;br/&gt;the NCSU chemistry department, has presented multiple demonstrations in physical science, and&lt;br/&gt;polymer science, at elementary, middle, and high school venues. Moreover, the&lt;br/&gt;multidisciplinary aspect of this project (spectroscopy, polymer chemistry, polymer physics,&lt;br/&gt;materials science) continues to attract top undergraduate and graduate students in the department.</AbstractNarration>
