    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an optically diffractive electrical electrode structure. This structure will permit the penetration of deep ultraviolet radiation into an underlying dielectric in a capacitance device. The radiation will permit a photochemical reaction to take place altering the dielectric constant of the material under the electrode. This will allow an optical process, the deep UV exposure, to alter the electrical value of the capacitor while the circuit is under test. Compact, precision capacitors can be embedded on chip in place of external discrete capacitors for use in producing completed electrical circuits. The higher precision and on chip embedding of these passive components will reduce the size of the electrical system, providing increased performance through precise value tolerance, and reduce cost by performing the integration of passive capacitors during integrated circuit fabrication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially, the demand for embedded passive components is well established. Recent market reports published in February 2005 show a global passive market increasing 8.6% in 2004 to $12.4 Billion. In 2002 Nokia reported passives are 80% percent of the part count in a cell phone, utilizing 60%of the area and represent 20% of the material cost. Solid-State Technology reported that passive components can account for 70% of the product assembly costs. The ability to embed precision passive components, particularly capacitors, has large economic potential for fabricators of ultra portable electronics, such as cell phones, by dramatically reducing manufacture costs and increasing performance.</AbstractNarration>
