<AbstractNarration>This five-year research project has as its central aim the testing of a particular model of teacher professional development with secondary school chemistry teachers.  The Target Inquiry (TI) model emphasizes the importance of the inquiry process in teaching and learning science by combining a research experience for teachers (RET) with curriculum adaptation and action research.  TI has been translated into a chemistry emphasis for an existing M.Ed. program at Grand Valley State University in Michigan by integrating the key features of effective professional development programs with experiences designed to impact instruction and student outcomes in chemistry.  A longitudinal study involving comparisons between the participant and control groups as well as measures of participant change over time will investigate the nature of the impacts on teachers and their students.  Data will be collected pre-program, after each core experience, end of program, and one and two years post-program.  Quantitative instruments such as American Chemical Society examinations and observational measures of classrooms will be used in addition to qualitative methods such as teacher interviews and classroom artifacts.  The major research questions are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. How do the three core experiences (chemistry research, materials adaptation, and action research) impact in-service high school chemistry teachers' (a) content knowledge in chemistry; (b) attitudes and beliefs about scientific inquiry and self-efficacy; and (c) classroom instructional methods?&lt;br/&gt;2. How do the core experiences build upon one another?&lt;br/&gt;3. What connections do teachers make between the core experiences?&lt;br/&gt;4. How does teacher participation in TI affect student achievement?&lt;br/&gt;5. What impact does TI, a three-year, coherent, inquiry-focused PD program continue to have on teachers classroom instructional practices and student achievement after program completion?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding from the Dreyfus Foundation and Grand Valley State University is being used to support the TI implementation with twenty teachers and this award is funding the in-depth research study of the effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Inquiry-based instruction improves achievement, increases scientific ways of communicating and thinking, and is particularly important for students in underserved and underrepresented groups. Unfortunately, inquiry teaching strategies are lacking in most U.S. chemistry classrooms. This is not surprising given that traditional college science programs rely primarily on lecture and &ldquo;cookbook&rdquo; laboratory experiences. Although teacher professional development (PD) is supposed to improve instructional quality, most programs are short-term, patchy, and fail to have significant and lasting effects on instruction and student learning. The Target Inquiry (TI) model aims to improve the quality and frequency of inquiry instruction and emphasizes the importance of the inquiry process in teaching and learning science through a 2.5-year program combining chemistry research experience for teachers (RET) with developing, piloting, and testing classroom inquiry activities. All teachers completing TI reported that it had more impact on their teaching than other previous PD experiences because of TI&rsquo;s long-term, coherent design and built-in support features.

More specifically, teachers found the summer-long chemistry RET to be meaningful and expressed how it helped them to develop and implement inquiry activities.

Furthermore, lessons developed by TI teachers were shown to be more aligned with inquiry practices than those developed by teachers in more traditional RET programs.
