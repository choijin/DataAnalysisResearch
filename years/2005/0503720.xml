<AbstractNarration>My main goal in this project is to use the homotopy theory of pro-spaces&lt;br/&gt;to prove non-existence theorems for sums-of-squares formulas over&lt;br/&gt;arbitrary fields.  This is a question of primary interest in the study of&lt;br/&gt;quadratic forms, but it is also closely linked to a variety of other&lt;br/&gt;fields of mathematics, including the existence of finite-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;division algebras, counting independent vector fields on spheres, and&lt;br/&gt;immersions of projective spaces into euclidean spaces. There is a long&lt;br/&gt;history of applying cohomological methods to sums-of-squares formulas over&lt;br/&gt;the real numbers. My goal is to adapt these methods so that they work for&lt;br/&gt;other fields. This involves the use of generalized etale cohomology&lt;br/&gt;theories (such as but not limited to etale K-theory) of algebraic&lt;br/&gt;varieties instead of generalized cohomology of topological spaces. The&lt;br/&gt;correct definition of generalized etale cohomology involves some subtle&lt;br/&gt;aspects of the homotopy theory of pro-spaces. Motivic homotopy theory is&lt;br/&gt;another useful tool in studying sums-of-squares formulas and more&lt;br/&gt;generally quadratic forms.  I intend to work on specific problems that&lt;br/&gt;further elucidate the relationship between motivic homotopy theory and the&lt;br/&gt;theory of quadratic forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cohomology was a key unifying concept in the study of topology throughout&lt;br/&gt;the twentieth century.  The basic principle of cohomology is to turn a&lt;br/&gt;difficult problem in topology into a computable algebra problem. Many of&lt;br/&gt;these cohomological methods work also in algebraic geometry (i.e., the&lt;br/&gt;study of geometric objects that are defined by polynomial equations), but&lt;br/&gt;the technical details tend to be much more complicated. Traditional&lt;br/&gt;cohomology can be used to prove theorems about the real numbers because&lt;br/&gt;the real numbers are a topological space.  Cohomology in algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry allows us to generalize these theorems to other number systems,&lt;br/&gt;such as finite fields.  The basic goal of my project is to establish some&lt;br/&gt;of these generalizations. In short, the point is to use ideas from&lt;br/&gt;algebraic topology to think about problems in algebra in new ways.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
