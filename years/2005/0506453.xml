    <AbstractNarration>AST-0506453&lt;br/&gt;Stephen Thorsett&lt;br/&gt;University of California-Santa Cruz&lt;br/&gt;Pulsar Interferometry&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The Milky Way contains between 100 million and one billion neutron stars, left behind after the&lt;br/&gt;supernova explosions that distributed heavy elements throughout the Galaxy. Understanding the&lt;br/&gt;distribution and properties of these stars is important for understanding Galactic chemical evolution,&lt;br/&gt;as well as for constraining the dynamics of supernova explosions and for illuminating the formation&lt;br/&gt;and life-cycles of various type of exotic compact binary systems.&lt;br/&gt;The most direct constraints on the neutron star distribution come from measurements of parallaxes&lt;br/&gt;and proper motions. In most cases, these measurements can be made only for the subclass of&lt;br/&gt;neutron stars that are luminous at radio wavelengths: the radio pulsars. Even then, the closest radio&lt;br/&gt;pulsars are a hundred times the distance of the closest stars, and the effects of parallax and proper&lt;br/&gt;motion are correspondingly smaller. Only about 1% of pulsars have measured parallaxes and only&lt;br/&gt;about 10% of pulsars have even crudely measured proper motions.&lt;br/&gt;Here, Thorsett and Dewey will continue their highly successful interferometry program, using the&lt;br/&gt;Very Large Array and the Very Long Baseline Array to make very precise astrometric&lt;br/&gt;measurements of a large sample of pulsars and address several important questions. The&lt;br/&gt;investigation will, over the next three years, measure the birth velocity distribution of neutron stars&lt;br/&gt;with sufficient accuracy to constrain both the high and low velocity tails (needed to understand&lt;br/&gt;supernova asymmetries and retention of neutron stars in globular clusters, respectively), and will&lt;br/&gt;improve understanding of local pulsar distances and the local pulsar birthrate. This plan is based&lt;br/&gt;primarily on observations that are either underway or already approved.&lt;br/&gt;The investigations will include student training and support, with project data forming the basis of a&lt;br/&gt;Ph.D. thesis. The student and the principle investigators will also maintain formal connections and&lt;br/&gt;participate in activities with the Exploratorium science museum and the COSMOS summer&lt;br/&gt;program. Co-investigator Dewey is also Education and Public Outreach Director for the UCSC&lt;br/&gt;branch of Calspace, providing further outreach opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;External science investigations will also be enabled by both web and traditional publication of the&lt;br/&gt;data gathered here. These include identification of the primary target lists for The Gamma-ray Large&lt;br/&gt;Area Space Telescope and other satellite missions, and interpretation of multiwavelength pulsar&lt;br/&gt;emission data. Comparison of the local pulsar birthrate to the massive star birthrate, constrains the&lt;br/&gt;properties of the progenitors of Type II supernovae. Pulsar velocity measurements not only&lt;br/&gt;constrain models of their birth events, and are important input parameters to population synthesis&lt;br/&gt;studies of binary systems. The observations made to identify calibration sources for the Very Long&lt;br/&gt;Baseline Array surveys comprise a large survey sample of 21-cm snapshots of extragalactic sources.</AbstractNarration>
