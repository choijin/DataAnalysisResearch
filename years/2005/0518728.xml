<AbstractNarration>Planning and Sustaining Partnerships in Native American Learning Paradigms&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little is known or understood about Native American learning traditions or the complex set of knowledge and technologies embedded in Native languages. In its most general sense, the project will seek to comprehend the communicative and informational processes enfolded in Native  American languages, the diverse learning processes that are animated by the languages, and how and when these processes can be appropriately translated into new learning environments.  The project will explore how this learning transformation occurs using the collaborations and dialogues of diverse scholars and traditions. It will explore how to enable partnership building and how new studies can lead to deeper understandings of Native American learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Native American youth are born into a world in which they have to exist and learn in a bi-cognitive context. This bi-cognitive experience has been characterized as living in two worlds or living with a "split head consciousness." The lack of awareness or understanding of this bi-cognitive process in learning has been reflected in the poor success rates of Native American students. The last two decades have produced the first generation of mature Native American scholars.   This project seeks to identify the practices and strategies of this successful generation of Native Americans scholars in order to understand and maximize their unique educational achievement.   Past studies have demonstrated the benefit of creating enhanced learning through focusing on the traditional understandings, meanings and purposes that are enfolded in Native American languages.  This project seeks to transform transcultural exploration and study into learning.  It will also work to develop a relationship with, and sustain a discourse between, the varied Native American, majority-cultural, and developmental learning paradigms and practices. This exploration has direct implications for developing successful learning ecologies to further Native American youths' achievement in contemporary education and life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focal point of this catalyst study will be a series of traditional, trans-cultural dialogues (talking circles) among Native American and majority-cultural scholars in a variety of disciplines, the aim of which will be to approach the reconciliation of  differences between Native American and contemporary systems of learning. A central goal of these dialogues is to create a sustainable discourse on understanding and improving Native American learning, with the ultimate objective of steadily increasing and sustaining the participation of Native Americans in livelihoods of their choosing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will be aided by the established team of collaborators of the Native American Academy (NAA), a continental consortium of Native American professoriate, Elders and knowledge keepers committed to maintaining Indigenous knowledge in all aspects of the human endeavor, particularly in the sciences. As accomplished intellectuals, both institutionally and organically educated, they are exploring the interface between contemporary knowledge and learning and Native American heritage, knowledge, and learning.  The Academy represents a convergence of transdisciplinary and disciplinary fields and institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
