    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0504890&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Mark A. Stern&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In collaboration with Anda Degeratu, the principal investigator&lt;br/&gt;will continue their study of harmonic spinors on manifolds with&lt;br/&gt;degenerating spin structures. Their primary goal is to use these&lt;br/&gt;degenerating spin structures to extend Witten's technique for&lt;br/&gt;proving the positive mass theorem to new classes of higher&lt;br/&gt;dimensional nonspin manifolds. They will also investigate the&lt;br/&gt;application of index theory to these degenerate spin structures&lt;br/&gt;in order to find new relations for the A hat genus on nonspin&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. The principal investigator will also continue his&lt;br/&gt;study of a geometric model of B fields and the higher p-form&lt;br/&gt;potentials arising in string theory, which is suitable for&lt;br/&gt;understanding how these fields affect the application of&lt;br/&gt;geometric analysis to string theory. He will then apply this&lt;br/&gt;improved understanding to various questions in string theory,&lt;br/&gt;including joint work with Savdeep Sethi on the analysis of&lt;br/&gt;gravitational anomalies of field theories arising from string&lt;br/&gt;theories on singular spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At low speeds and masses, general relativity should reduce to&lt;br/&gt;Newton's theory of gravity. This correspondence is confused by&lt;br/&gt;the fact that there is no definition of mass in general&lt;br/&gt;relativity which allows one to define the mass density at a&lt;br/&gt;single point in space. One can only define the mass of large&lt;br/&gt;regions. Physicists have introduced several notions of mass to&lt;br/&gt;obviate this difficulty, the best known of which is the ADM&lt;br/&gt;mass. The positive mass conjecture posits that this complicated&lt;br/&gt;ADM mass is never negative. This is important because a negative&lt;br/&gt;mass universe seems physically unreasonable. Moreover, the truth&lt;br/&gt;of the positive mass conjecture has strong implications for the&lt;br/&gt;very stability of space. In lower dimensions (including 4) this&lt;br/&gt;conjecture was proved by Schoen and Yau. Recent work in string&lt;br/&gt;theory has led to the study of gravity in more than 4 spacetime&lt;br/&gt;dimensions and thus interest in higher dimensional positive mass&lt;br/&gt;theorems under investigation in this project. Many related&lt;br/&gt;questions arising in the gravity theories produced by string&lt;br/&gt;theory are not currently amenable to careful mathematical&lt;br/&gt;analysis because the correct mathematical translation of some of&lt;br/&gt;the important string theory concepts, such as higher p form&lt;br/&gt;potentials, remains unclear. One of the goals of this project is&lt;br/&gt;to provide and apply such a translation.</AbstractNarration>
