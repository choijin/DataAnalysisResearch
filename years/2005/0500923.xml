<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Deift&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will continue his work on the analysis of various asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;problems in mathematics and mathematical physics. The steepest-descent &lt;br/&gt;method for Riemann-Hilbert problems will continue to play a key role.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the PI will consider&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;** the perturbation theory of specific infinite-dimensional integrable &lt;br/&gt;systems which support soliton solutions&lt;br/&gt;** universality problems in random matrix theory&lt;br/&gt;** asymptotics for multiple orthogonal polynomials, with a view to proving&lt;br/&gt;the irrationality of certain distinguished constants&lt;br/&gt;** the asymptotic evaluation of Toeplitz and Hankel determinants, of the &lt;br/&gt;kind that arise in the analysis of Bose-Einstein condensation&lt;br/&gt;** statistical experiments which demonstrate the prevalence of random &lt;br/&gt;matrix theory in mathematics, physics and also in the "real world".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most fascinating scientific developments over the last fifty &lt;br/&gt;years has been the discovery that an extraordinarily wide variety of &lt;br/&gt;mathematical and physical phenomena are modelled by the eigenvalues of a &lt;br/&gt;random matrix. In particular, random matrix theory describes the &lt;br/&gt;scattering of neutrons off large nuclei, as well as the statistics of the &lt;br/&gt;zeros of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line in the complex &lt;br/&gt;plane. More recently, it has been discovered that random matrix theory &lt;br/&gt;also describes problems in the "real world", such as the bus scheduling &lt;br/&gt;problem in the city of Cuernevaca in Mexico, the distribution of telephone &lt;br/&gt;numbers in the Manhattan telephone directory, as well as the statistics of &lt;br/&gt;a form of solitaire called patience sorting. A central focus of the PI's &lt;br/&gt;work will involve the analysis of random matrix theory per se, as well as &lt;br/&gt;the application of random matrix theory to new problems in mathematics, &lt;br/&gt;physics and the "real world".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
