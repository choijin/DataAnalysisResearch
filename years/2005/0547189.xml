<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Fourkas will investigate nanoporous sol-gel glasses to study the confinement effects on a distance scale that is within approximately the order of a molecular dimension.  At such distances there can be significant effects on the structure and dynamics of liquids.  The materials are highly porous, of optical quality, and the average pore size and chemical nature of the pore surfaces can be controlled readily.  The experiments are based on the use of ultrafast optical Kerr effect (OKE) techniques.  The role of molecular shapes on the dynamics of weakly wetting liquids at solid/liquid interfaces will be investigated as function of temperature and pore size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several ways in which this research will make an impact.  Confined liquids are found throughout nature and are also important in many areas of technology.  The knowledge gained from this work will be of importance to many areas of science and technology, such as, for example, how water behaves in biological contexts, while the work on the confined alkanes will have direct bearing on lubrication and oil recovery.  The university and high school students, as well as high school teachers who will participate in this project will be involved in a multidisciplinary undertaking that broadens their outlook and understanding of how contemporary science is practiced.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
