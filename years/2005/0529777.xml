<AbstractNarration>This Ethics Education In Science and Engineering award to The Colorado School of Mines supports a team of five faculty led by Dr. Juan Lucena, Department of Liberal Arts and International Studies to conduct research on the application of humanitarian ethics(HE) to engineering, and to create a model of HE for engineering in graduate education.&lt;br/&gt;Engineering ethics education and research, with focus mainly on individual and social responsibilities,&lt;br/&gt;can be substantially enhanced by the analysis of an important dimension of engineering practice: the role&lt;br/&gt;of engineers in humanitarian activities. Further, reform initiatives in science and engineering (S&amp;E)&lt;br/&gt;graduate education have not yet realized their potential for integrating ethics into graduate curricula.&lt;br/&gt;Contributing to these conceptual, methodological, and curricular challenges, the proposed project has the&lt;br/&gt;following objectives: 1) to review and critically assess relations between humanitarianism and&lt;br/&gt;engineering in order to develop an applicable concept of HE in engineering&lt;br/&gt;education and practice; 2) to discover and overcome barriers to the integration of HE in graduate&lt;br/&gt;engineering education as currently taught and learned; 3) to create and implement a model of HE in&lt;br/&gt;graduate engineering education; and 4) to assess and improve the model of HE in order to make it an&lt;br/&gt;example for broad dissemination. &lt;br/&gt;The benefits to society from the proposed project include opening alternative career paths to&lt;br/&gt;graduate engineering students in the areas humanitarian intervention and community development and&lt;br/&gt;providing an ethical framework for humanitarian practice to an increasing number of engineers involved&lt;br/&gt;in humanitarian activities.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal for this award was received in response to the Ethics Education in Science and Engineering announcement, NSF 05-532, and was funded by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) in the Directorate for Engineering, Division of Computer and Network Systems in the Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering Directorate, and by the  Social, Behavioral &amp; Economic Sciences Directorate.</AbstractNarration>
