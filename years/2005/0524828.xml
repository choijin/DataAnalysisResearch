<AbstractNarration>1. Intellectual Impact&lt;br/&gt;Research is proposed on two Areas of Interest in NSF Solicitation 05-501: Development of a broad&lt;br/&gt;and general collection of quantum algorithms; Quantum simulation of quantum systems. Specific&lt;br/&gt;topics:&lt;br/&gt;Hidden subgroup problems: The status of the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem (HSP)&lt;br/&gt;is one of the most fundamental open problems in quantum algorithms. In particular, the graph&lt;br/&gt;automorphism problem may be formulated as a hidden subgroup problem over the symmetric&lt;br/&gt;group S n . The abelian case can be effectively computed with a quantum computer by repetition&lt;br/&gt;of coset state preparation and Fourier sampling. The natural generalization of this method to&lt;br/&gt;nonabelian groups is commonly referred to as the standard method for the nonabelian HSP. The&lt;br/&gt;performance of this algorithm depends upon properties of the irreducible complex representations&lt;br/&gt;of the group. However in most cases they do not yet yield useful algorithms. Research is proposed&lt;br/&gt;on improving these methods as well as determining in which cases they are bound for failure and&lt;br/&gt;other methods are necessitated.&lt;br/&gt;Algorithmic cooling: Algorithmic cooling is an inescapable component of quantum algorithms:&lt;br/&gt;for example, we can even view fault-tolerant computing as moving heat (random errors) out of the&lt;br/&gt;computation registers. These issues are particularly pressing in the context of liquid-state NMR&lt;br/&gt;quantum computing as well as ion trap quantum computing, and we have studied them (especially&lt;br/&gt;in the NMR context) in the past, obtaining results that are nearly best-possible for closed-system&lt;br/&gt;cooling. These results reveal, however, that closed-system cooling cannot be powerful enough to&lt;br/&gt;turn warm systems into large-scale quantum computers. We are therefore turning to the study&lt;br/&gt;of open-system algorithmic cooling. This requires new algorithmic techniques. Also, since open&lt;br/&gt;systems are more sensitive to decoherence than closed systems, more careful modeling of these&lt;br/&gt;effects will be required.&lt;br/&gt;Fault-tolerant Quantum Comptutation: Decoherence is the major obstacle to the experimen-&lt;br/&gt;tal realization of quantum computers. Over the last year there have been two significant break-&lt;br/&gt;throughs in the ability to carry out fault-tolerant quantum computation in the presence of deco-&lt;br/&gt;herence. The main idea in both cases is the use of uniquely quantum features to limit the exposure&lt;br/&gt;of data to decoherence. We plan to explore these ideas further to a) improve the overhead in the&lt;br/&gt;number of ancillas discarded and therefore the total number of qubits required b) improve the&lt;br/&gt;threshold and decrease computational overhead for more realistic error-models&lt;br/&gt;2. Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Societal impact: Even if quantum computers are a distant reality, encryption of data today so that&lt;br/&gt;it cannot be decrypted at a future time, depends upon the development of cryptosystems resilient&lt;br/&gt;to attacks by quantum computers. This in turn demands an understanding of what problems are&lt;br/&gt;and are not tractable on quantum computers, a core topic of the proposed research.&lt;br/&gt;Educational impact: Ideas from quantum computation and quantum information can poten-&lt;br/&gt;tially have a major impact on how basic quantum mechanics is taught (quite apart from teaching&lt;br/&gt;quantum computation, which is also part of our efforts). We propose to create course material to&lt;br/&gt;make this happen.</AbstractNarration>
