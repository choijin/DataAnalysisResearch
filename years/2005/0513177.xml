<AbstractNarration>AST-0513177&lt;br/&gt;Shapero&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Committee of Astronomy and Astrophysics (CAA) is the National Research Council's advisory body for astronomy and astrophysics, both ground and space-based.  The objectives of the CAA are to monitor the status of astronomy and astrophysics, to provide broadly based independent strategic advice to federal agencies, to serve as a multi-agency forum for discussion and coordination, and to monitor implementation of the recommendations in the report of the decadal Astronomy and Astrophysics Survey Committee.   The CAA meets these objectives by convening regular meetings, coordinating briefings on new research, and facilitating communication with the agencies.  It produces reports and studies as needed and as requested by federal agencies and by Congress.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
