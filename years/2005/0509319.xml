<AbstractNarration>DMS-0331315&lt;br/&gt;Angela Gibney&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The moduli space of curves is an algebraic variety (more accurately a&lt;br/&gt;scheme or a stack) whose points parametrize isomorphism classes of&lt;br/&gt;algebraic curves of genus g.  In studying the behavior of families of&lt;br/&gt;curves, it is useful to consider each curve as a point in the moduli &lt;br/&gt;space, or in the natural projective closure (called the Deligne-Mumford &lt;br/&gt;compactification) whose points correspond to curves with at most &lt;br/&gt;nodal singularities. The components of the boundary are the images of &lt;br/&gt;maps from moduli spaces of stable n-pointed curves. In fact, it turns &lt;br/&gt;out that the birational geometry of these various moduli spaces of &lt;br/&gt;curves frequently reveals interesting properties of families of curves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most fruitful ways to study the birational geometry of&lt;br/&gt;projective varieties is to investigate the divisors and curves on them.  &lt;br/&gt;In particular, it is a fundamental  problem to describe the effective  &lt;br/&gt;and nef cones of divisors, and hence the effective cone of curves of &lt;br/&gt;these spaces. The research program to be pursued is a many faceted &lt;br/&gt;attack on this problem.  The goal is to provide further clarification &lt;br/&gt;of the nature of these cones, the relationships between them as well &lt;br/&gt;as to provide a collection of rich examples which would deepen &lt;br/&gt;understanding of the birational geometry of the moduli spaces and &lt;br/&gt;also broaden general knowledge about cones of curves and divisors.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
