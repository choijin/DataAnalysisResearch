<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Szarek&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves continued research on the geometric, &lt;br/&gt;probabilistic and combinatorial aspects of functional analysis and &lt;br/&gt;convexity theory, the loosely defined area that has been lately &lt;br/&gt;referred to as "asymptotic geometric analysis."  Particular attention &lt;br/&gt;will be paid to non-commutative objects and phenomena on one hand &lt;br/&gt;and, on the other hand, to links with other areas of mathematics and &lt;br/&gt;other mathematical sciences, which motivate most of the problems that &lt;br/&gt;are being considered. Sample research topics that are proposed to be &lt;br/&gt;studied include: structural properties of high-dimensional convex &lt;br/&gt;bodies and of high-dimensional normed spaces, metric entropy (of &lt;br/&gt;convex sets or of linear operators) and duality of such entropy and &lt;br/&gt;some geometric questions related to quantum information theory and &lt;br/&gt;quantum.  The questions are typically expressed in the language of &lt;br/&gt;local or finite dimensional geometry of Banach spaces and are to be &lt;br/&gt;analyzed using mainly the diverse methods that originated or were &lt;br/&gt;developed in that context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On an elementary level, Analysis is a study of functions, or &lt;br/&gt;relationships between quantities and the parameters on which they &lt;br/&gt;depend. Since very many naturally appearing relationships are linear &lt;br/&gt;or at least convex, a good understanding of convex functions and, &lt;br/&gt;consequently, of convex sets is a prerequisite for understanding &lt;br/&gt;those relationships. The number of free parameters in the underlying &lt;br/&gt;problem can often be related to the dimension of sets in the &lt;br/&gt;corresponding mathematical model. Since real-life problems usually &lt;br/&gt;depend on very many parameters, the high-dimensional setting is of &lt;br/&gt;particular interest. This is exactly the domain of asymptotic &lt;br/&gt;geometric analysis, which studies quantitative properties of convex &lt;br/&gt;sets (or other geometric structures) as the dimension goes to &lt;br/&gt;infinity. For the last two decades or so the asymptotic theory has &lt;br/&gt;been quite successful in identifying and exploiting "approximate" &lt;br/&gt;symmetries of various problems that escaped the earlier "too &lt;br/&gt;qualitative" or "too rigid" methods of classical functional analysis &lt;br/&gt;and classical geometry. (This led, among others, to the discovery of &lt;br/&gt;many links to computer science.) Finally, to explain our emphasis on &lt;br/&gt;non-commutativity we point out that it simply reflects the fact that &lt;br/&gt;the final outcome of a process may depend on the order of operations &lt;br/&gt;involved; the best known, but by far not the only manifestation of &lt;br/&gt;that principle is quantum mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
