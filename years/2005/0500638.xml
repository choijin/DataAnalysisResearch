<AbstractNarration>The investigator will develop and apply combinatorial methods for &lt;br/&gt;studying the topological structure of simplicial complexes and cell &lt;br/&gt;complexes arising in combinatorics and related fields. A major focus &lt;br/&gt;is to deal with complexes of more general topological type than many of &lt;br/&gt;the prevalent methods within combinatorics were designed to handle, e.g. &lt;br/&gt;in new techniques for proving connectivity lower bounds. The &lt;br/&gt;investigator will continue her ongoing effort to develop techniques for &lt;br/&gt;constructing discrete Morse functions with few critical cells, with &lt;br/&gt;emphasis on order complexes of partially ordered sets and on related &lt;br/&gt;free resolutions (both for monomial ideals, and also for resolving a &lt;br/&gt;residue field over a monomial or toric ring). Substantial improvement, &lt;br/&gt;at least for order complexes, will likely require better understanding &lt;br/&gt;of the very rich structure governing gradient paths between critical &lt;br/&gt;cells. In related work, she also plans to study Poincare' series for &lt;br/&gt;free resolutions over monomial and toric rings, for instance trying to &lt;br/&gt;better understand for toric rings which such Poincare' series will be &lt;br/&gt;rational. She also intends to study modular elements in (non-geometric) &lt;br/&gt;lattices and to try to generalize lexicographic shellability to skeleta &lt;br/&gt;of complexes, motivated again by potential applications to constructing &lt;br/&gt;small free resolutions and also to bounding graph chromatic number (via &lt;br/&gt;better understanding of characteristic polynomial). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topological combinatorics, and in particular connectivity lower bounds, &lt;br/&gt;have in the past been used to determine and verify complexity theory &lt;br/&gt;lower bounds on the running time for certain types of algorithms, to &lt;br/&gt;deduce results in commutative algebra about relations among polynomials &lt;br/&gt;via the theory of free resolutions, and also to give lower bounds on the &lt;br/&gt;number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph in such a &lt;br/&gt;way that no two vertices sharing an edge are the same color. The &lt;br/&gt;investigator is interested in further developing combinatorial &lt;br/&gt;techniques (such as a recently introduced discrete version of Morse &lt;br/&gt;theory) for studying topological structure, letting potential &lt;br/&gt;applications guide the way. Morse theory is a classical theory which &lt;br/&gt;analyzes the topological structure of an object by viewing the object &lt;br/&gt;progressively from bottom to top, keeping track of essential data at &lt;br/&gt;those moments in time where fundamental changes in structure take &lt;br/&gt;place; recently Robin Forman introduced a discrete version of this &lt;br/&gt;seemingly inherently continuous notion. One of the investigator's &lt;br/&gt;major focuses is to develop to practical machinery for making this &lt;br/&gt;theoretically very powerful tool convenient to use on real (and in many cases very complex) examples.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
