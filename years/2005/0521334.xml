<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Western Carolina University under the direction of Dr. Katherine Mathews for partial support of a Genetic Analyzer and a Real-Time PCR System. The Genetic Analyzer is an automated system that performs DNA sequencing and an array of genotyping and DNA fingerprinting techniques.  The Real-Time PCR System quantifies sequences from mixtures of DNA and is especially useful in detecting rare, but functionally important microorganisms in the environment.  The two instrument systems will function as multi-user research, research training, and educational molecular biology equipment in the Biology Department at WCU.  The instruments are meant to enhance the research capabilities of the Biology faculty and the educational experience of WCU students, as well as to attract new students and researchers to the university.  The many applications of these systems will make possible a host of research activities, including evolutionary and genetic studies of species and populations of ecologically and economically significant organisms, forensic biology techniques, and microbial community analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for these instruments will support the investigation of organismal biodiversity using recent innovations in molecular biology.  It will greatly expand the molecular biological capabilities of the Biology Department at WCU and will lead to exciting discoveries.  Much remains to be learned about the evolutionary history of plants, animals, and microorganisms.  A diverse array of organisms will be examined in molecular and genetic studies, and the resulting data will help resolve relationships among organisms from diverse ecosystems.  Students will be included in the generation, interpretation, and presentation of data acquired with these instruments, and together faculty and students will publish novel research results.  These instruments will also broaden the capabilities and effectiveness of instruction in the classroom and research laboratories and will result in dynamic and creative ways of communicating science to both Biology majors and non-majors at the university.        &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project has at its core the intent to train young scientists in biodiversity studies while utilizing the latest in technological advances.  The Genomic Analyzer and Real-Time PCR System will provide students with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in molecular-based studies and in obtaining and analyzing genomic datasets.  Student interest in biology will be invigorated by the modernization of teaching techniques and laboratory experiences, and better understanding of the modern methods used by biologists to answer scientific questions will be promoted.  Furthermore, outreach to underrepresented groups including students from the nearby Cherokee Reservation; women, disabled persons, and minorities; as well as students from the rural, Southern Appalachian local communities will be undertaken.  By learning an array of molecular tools, WCU students will be better prepared for advanced studies in biology, for jobs in high-tech industries and education, or simply to become science and technology literate. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
