<AbstractNarration>The University of Oklahoma / University of Arkansas Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC), titled the Center for Semiconductor Physics in Nanostructures (CSPIN), supports innovative research and education in controlled growth of semiconductor and ferroelectric arrays, and narrow band gap semiconductor heterostructures.   Potential applications include inexpensive high density, low power, non-volatile memory, negative refractive index materials, and improved magnetic read-head technology.   The center will develop coordinated activities in graduate and undergraduate education, advance inquiry based learning for the improved understanding of K-12 science, and partner with regional museums to produce exhibits for the general public.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MRSEC consists of two Interdisciplinary Research Groups (IRGs); IRG-1 Collective Properties of Nanostructure Arrays - control over semiconductor and ferroelectric materials growth will yield systems that give new insight into the collective interactions between individual quantum dots, wires and rings, and will provide the basis for new optical and electronic materials.  IRG-2 Mesoscopic Narrow Gap Systems - explores the unique properties of narrow bandgap semiconductor materials to address nanoscale electronic devices that exploit quantum mechanical effects for higher speed operation, denser memory with increased functionality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in the center currently include twenty two senior investigators split evenly between the two partner institutions.  In addition the center includes, six graduate students and three post-doctoral associates at the University of Oklahoma and six graduate students and six post-doctoral associates at the University of Arkansas.   Professor Matthew Johnson at the University of Oklahoma directs the MRSEC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[CENTER FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PHYSICS IN NANOSTRUCTURES Rationale:  The quest for improvement in computing power, data storage, and communication requires new approaches to fabrication, new materials systems, and new methods of operation.  The Universities of Oklahoma and Arkansas have strong traditions of research in novel materials and in a broad spectrum of complementary nanoscale fabrication and characterization techniques, but our partnership was born of necessity&mdash;only together do we have the required scope of tools and expertise.  One collaborative group brought together proficiency in semiconductor crystal growth, electron microscopy, and optical characterization techniques that resulted in the fabrication and understanding of the underlying materials science and behavior of self-assembled structures.  We subsequently advanced the science and tailored the behavior of organized arrays of assembled from these nanostructures.  These advances provide the basis for high-density memory elements, photonic lattices, and high efficiency arrays of light emitters and detectors.  A second joint effort focused on high mobility narrow bandgap semiconductors and demonstrated successes in growth, ballistic transport, and optical studies of important spin behaviors with potential applications in bio-magnetic sensing, infra-red detection and emission and spintronic devices.  We also continued a strong record in educational and scientific human resource development and science education outreach in a region that is badly in need of both.   Impact:  C-SPIN has  had a significant impact on the institutional culture at OU and UA.  First, within C-SPIN it is now the routine procedure to set up internet video-conferences to discuss samples, recent theoretical advances and issues of administration. Participation in educational outreach is the norm among C-SPIN faculty, rather than the exception.  Second, new research facilities have drawn in new users.  Moreover the research mission of each university is moving towards nanoscience, most notably with the construction of a new Nanoscale Material Science and Engineering building, new hires in electrical engineering and chemistry, and new fundraising efforts from individual donors.  In addition to its research mission, C-SPIN is reaching out to the larger community.  Since neither Arkansas nor Oklahoma is a traditionally high tech economy, we have a significant impact on our region through spin-off companies. By improving science education, enhancing minority participation, promoting careers in materials science, and assisting local industry, we not only train the next generation of material scientists and engineers, we sow the seeds for the future economic development of the region.  The combined efforts were very successful in the production of quality publications that were well cited. Furthermore C-SPIN scientists produced 2 patents with 4 pending and have aided in the launch of five start-up companies.  Additionally we contributed to work force development with at least 16 undergraduate students and 8 high-school teachers doing research in C-SPIN labs per year and we graduated 28 MS and PhD students including 9 female and 2 members of minority groups.
