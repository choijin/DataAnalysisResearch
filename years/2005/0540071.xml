    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;OISE-0540071&lt;br/&gt;Ratchford, George Mason University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. J. Thomas Ratchford, National Center for Technology and the Law, George Mason University, working closely with leaders from the Chinese and American scientific policymaking community, will convene the US-China Forum on Science &amp; Technology Policy in Beijing in late autumn 2006. The Forum will include high-level policy makers and academics, including U.S. Presidential science and technology advisors from past administrations and their Chinese counterparts. The Forum will inform current policymakers attending the 12th Meeting of the U.S.-China Joint Commission Meeting on Scientific and Technological Cooperation (JCM). The 2006 forum was endorsed by the 11th JCM in Washington D.C in October 2004. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximately thirty participants (fifteen from the United States) from government, industry and academia will attend. Representatives will include graduate students from both nations. The goals of the forum are to: 1) Develop a baseline document for future scholarship on U.S. and Chinese science policy; 2) Address current S&amp;T policy issues of importance to policy makers in both countries; and 3) Discuss the economic, social and foreign policy considerations relevant to future bilateral science and technology policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Forum comes at an important time in filling a gap in scholarly attention to the converging interests of science and the effects of policymaking on China-US scientific cooperation. The Forum also has strong potential to attract a new generation of scholars into the field.</AbstractNarration>
