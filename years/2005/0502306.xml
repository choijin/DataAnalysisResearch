    <AbstractNarration>0502306&lt;br/&gt;Manahan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a twenty-two-month research fellowship by Dr. Thomas K. Manahan to work with Dr. William J. Folan, director of the Centro de Investigaciones Historicas y Sociales at the Universidad Autonoma de Campeche, Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is testing the degree of economic and political integration of archaic states in Mesoamerica. Specifically the investigators will test the hypothesis that the Terminal Classic polity of Chichen Itza represented a dramatic economic and political transformation, as evaluated from the ancient Maya center of Xuenkal. They are achieving their goals through an interdisciplinary approach aimed at quantifying changes to the political economy, local economy, and agricultural systems of Xuenkal between the Classic and Terminal Classic periods. Manahan's research will contribute to current understanding of the nature of political and economic change in ancient Maya polities and more broadly increase our understanding of the organizational framework of all archaic states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaborative research project integrates both US and Mexican graduate students who will participate in an international research experience, strengthening ties between scientists of the two nations and enhancing the infrastructure for archaeological research and education in Mexico.</AbstractNarration>
