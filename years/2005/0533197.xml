<AbstractNarration>Midwest Alliance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Midwest Alliance in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (Midwest) is a consortium of educators, scientists and disability service providers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison), the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UI) and the University of Northern Iowa (UNI). The principal objectives of the Midwest Alliance are to increase the number of students with disabilities who are (a) exploring opportunities in STEM, (b) entering and succeeding in STEM disciplines at the associate, baccalaureate and graduate levels, and (c) having careers in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Midwest has strong partnerships locally, regionally, and nationally that benefit students, faculty and institutions across the tri-state area, and contribute to the goal of helping students with disabilities connect, persist and achieve in postsecondary education. Midwest efforts and activities center on the following three areas: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1)   Direct Student Interventions (e.g., mentorships, internships, STEM enrichment and immersion activities such as the Exploration by Design summer camps, and transition and self-advocacy learning) &lt;br/&gt;2)   Indirect Student Interventions (e.g., teacher training in inclusive science instruction and curricular development)  &lt;br/&gt;3)   Systems Interventions (e.g., identifying and defining comprehensive strategies for supporting students with disabilities by improving student access and accommodations, AT development, and reporting on evidence-based interventions and practices).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Midwest programs and activities are focused on critical junctures, including the transition from high school to postsecondary education; are designed to utilize promising and/or successful practices; and include a dissemination component through journal publications, our website and newsletter, and presentations at conferences.  Midwest uses both formative and summative evaluation in its continuous improvement efforts.</AbstractNarration>

The Midwest Alliance programs formed a comprehensive system, and approached this challenge at multiple levels and through multiple methods. A unified program of change was integrated throughout the Midwest Alliance such that once a SWD was recruited and began participation in Alliance activities, the student was involved in Midwest Alliance programs all the way to career entry.  The Midwest Alliance activities broadened the opportunities for SWD in STEM and increased the number of SWD in STEM because of: 1) Enhanced opportunities for SWD in STEM through the three-state area and beyond, resulting in increases in participation and choice, 2) Improvements in educator use of inclusive STEM education in classrooms and laboratories, and 3) Systemic changes effecting national practice and long-term directions in policy related to SWD in post-secondary STEM education.  Direct Student Impact Interventions were those activities that the Midwest Alliance employed to identify, attract, and support SWD throughout their exploration, entry, and continuance in STEM fields. The actions or events SWD go through are sequential and each must be successful before the next phase can be started.

Major accomplishments of the Midwest Alliance include:  Establishment of active collaboration between three different post-secondary institutions in the Midwest. Virtually all Midwest Alliance programs involved three-state participation, including joint leadership, joint planning, and multi-campus implementation. Establishment of a comprehensive program assisting SWD to succeed in STEM. This included successful programs in mentoring, internships, enrichment activities, and immersion experiences. Exponential growth in success recruiting students to Midwest Alliance programs. For example, the last full year of the Midwest Alliance, 251 students participated in MidwestÆs mentoring, internship, and immersion programs. 2400+ educators, staff members, and pre-service education students participated in 80+ workshops to improve their ability to teach STEM s...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
