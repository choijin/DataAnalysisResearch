    <AbstractNarration>The proposed SGER project will provide undergraduate evaluation training and a professional certificate, with an emphasis on cultural competence. The project is unique in the level at which evaluation education is initiated. Currently, evaluation education is only provided at the graduate level. (See Peterson's Undergraduate Guide, 2005). The project provides an opportunity to explore the feasibility of providing undergraduate evaluation education. Because undergraduate evaluation concentrations are not currently offered, the project incurs some risk. It is feasible that the undergraduate students are not ready for the rigor of research training required to be a competent evaluator. However, it successful, the undergraduate standards set forth in this project can establish an emerging trend in undergraduate education. The success of this project will inform curriculum development linking undergraduate and graduate evaluation education. The undergraduate program will provide the foundation for a logical progression of evaluation knowledge building at the graduate level. In addition, the emphasis on cultural competence and the recruitment of students of color will broaden the pipeline diversity base.</AbstractNarration>
