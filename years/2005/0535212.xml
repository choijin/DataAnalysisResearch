    <AbstractNarration>The proposed 2-day workshop focuses on research issues lying at the interface of the mathematical sciences and the geosciences. Many of these issues relate strongly to the themes of the National Science Foundation (NSF) program on Collabotation in Mathematical Geosciences (CMG), including mathematical and statistical modeling of large, complex geosystems, representing uncertainty in geosystems, and analyzing large geoscience data sets. The workshop will also be used as a forum to assess the effectiveness of the CMG program and identify new frontiers in mathematical geociences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The anticipated outcomes of the workshop include sharper identification of current research and training issues at the interface between the mathematical sciences and the geosciences, and new collaborations to address those issues. The workshop will attract more than 100 participants to represent the broad research communities in mathematics, statistics, and the geosciences. Young researchers, women and other under-represented groups will be encouged to participate. A workshop report will be prepared for the benefit of the NSF and the scientific communities.</AbstractNarration>
