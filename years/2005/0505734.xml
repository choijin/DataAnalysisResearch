<AbstractNarration>This project is devoted to studying deterministic and random&lt;br/&gt;cellular automata models of growth processes, with the emphasis&lt;br/&gt;on several new directions. The first field of study are&lt;br/&gt;nonmonotone growth models; the investigator aims to study&lt;br/&gt;their growth shapes and space-covering properties by extending&lt;br/&gt;renewal, rescaling and perturbation techniques from probability,&lt;br/&gt;as well as various geometric methods. Also being developed are&lt;br/&gt;new analytic and computational approaches to higher dimensional&lt;br/&gt;and long range models, and to connections with differential&lt;br/&gt;and integral equations. An important example of a high-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;space is the hypercube, where the investigator uses&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial and probabilistic methods to understand the&lt;br/&gt;effect of uncorrelated and correlated random environments&lt;br/&gt;on basic growth processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a broad scientific context, the aim of this project is&lt;br/&gt;to understand principles by which various physical systems&lt;br/&gt;propagate disturbances. Among instances of such growth&lt;br/&gt;dynamics are growth of snowflakes and other crystals, spread&lt;br/&gt;of epidemics, propagation of waves, competition between species,&lt;br/&gt;and genetic diversification. The investigator's research sheds&lt;br/&gt;light on how microscopic properties of a growth process influence&lt;br/&gt;its space-covering ability, on the effect of perturbations in&lt;br/&gt;the environment and in the dynamics, and on the role of dimension&lt;br/&gt;and range of interaction. For example, simple mathematical metaphors&lt;br/&gt;for neutral mutations, incompatibilities and harshness of the&lt;br/&gt;environment contribute to understanding the onset of genetic&lt;br/&gt;diversity. The project has an essential computational component&lt;br/&gt;and is developing a variety of efficient computer algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for simulation and visualization of complex processes. Finally,&lt;br/&gt;ample opportunities for undergraduate involvement in studying&lt;br/&gt;complex and random dynamics help to popularize mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;its applications.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
