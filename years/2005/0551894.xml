<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves work on several distinct problems with the common&lt;br/&gt;themes of controlling, estimating or reconstructing singularities that arise in&lt;br/&gt;oscillatory integral operators, Fourier integral operators and  inverse problems.&lt;br/&gt;The first problem concerns establishing optimal decay rates for oscillatory&lt;br/&gt;integral operators in three dimensions having generic homogeneous polynomial&lt;br/&gt;phase functions. In the second, the Calderon problem for scalar conductivities&lt;br/&gt;with jump discontinuities in two dimensions will be analyzed, with singularities&lt;br/&gt;(suitably interpreted) of boundary data yielding information about the&lt;br/&gt;locations, and possibly sizes, of the jumps of the conductivity in the interior. &lt;br/&gt;A linearized version of the identification problem for the attenuated Radon&lt;br/&gt;transform will be analyzed using techniques from micro-local and harmonic analysis&lt;br/&gt;in the third problem. Finally, a linearized hyperbolic inverse problem involves&lt;br/&gt;studying the composition of Fourier integral operators associated to specific&lt;br/&gt;singular geometries arising from the presence of caustics occurring generically&lt;br/&gt;in three dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Progress on these problems will add to the understanding of partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations, the operators, which are used to solve them, and the&lt;br/&gt;behavior of their solutions. Many laws of nature are expressed as partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations, which govern physical quantities of interest, such as electromagnetic&lt;br/&gt;field strength or pressure exerted by acoustic waves. The techniques to be developed&lt;br/&gt;in this project are applicable to equations that govern various kinds of wave&lt;br/&gt;propagation and are based on a geometric point of view in understanding the&lt;br/&gt;singularities, which are present.  The last three problems have the potential to&lt;br/&gt;assist in the design or refinement of systems for nondestructive testing, &lt;br/&gt;medical imaging, and seismic exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
