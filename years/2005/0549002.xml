<AbstractNarration>1&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;Scientific Representation: Structure and Perspective&lt;br/&gt;Bas C. van Fraassen&lt;br/&gt;The project is to develop an account of measurement as at the same time a physical&lt;br/&gt;interaction and a meaningful information gathering process. Sources include Duhems&lt;br/&gt;view of measurement outcomes as theory-laden and Poincare's  view of measurement as&lt;br/&gt;perspectival. These aspects of measurement are to be explored in the context of recent as&lt;br/&gt;well as classical physics. Envisaged is an account of measurement outcomes as&lt;br/&gt;perspectival representations that provide a bridge between pure and applied science.&lt;br/&gt;This project on measurement is the final stage of a larger project on the subject of&lt;br/&gt;scientific representation, overlapping with each of its parts. Part I, Representation,&lt;br/&gt;investigates the general concept, restricted to physical and mathematical representations&lt;br/&gt;(excluding concerns of psychology). Part II, Structure, addresses scientific modelling as&lt;br/&gt;representation of phenomena, with special reference to measurement instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;Historical examples include the development of perspective in art and architecture;&lt;br/&gt;Copernicus  explanation of  retrograde  planetary motion; the development of&lt;br/&gt;microscopy; the changes in spatio-temporal representation introduced by the theory of&lt;br/&gt;relativity, and the description in quantum mechanics of the experiments that support it.&lt;br/&gt;Part III, Perspective, engages paradoxes that threaten structuralist views concerning&lt;br/&gt;scientific representation, referring to arguments from Herman Weyl to Hilary Putnam.&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The PI will introduce original responses to the theoretical&lt;br/&gt;and philosophical problems encountered, both in the current project on measurement and&lt;br/&gt;in the larger project of which this is part. Measurement and modelling, structure and&lt;br/&gt;perspective are at the center of recent developments in philosophy of science. The&lt;br/&gt;project is envisaged to solve or dissolve outstanding problems concerning these, and&lt;br/&gt;involves the design of a distinctly empiricist structuralism offered in critical response to&lt;br/&gt;recent structural realism and to recently revived and extended neo-Kantian views.&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT: The PI proposes to present the theoretical results in a book under&lt;br/&gt;contract with Oxford University Press, Scientific Representation: Paradoxes Of&lt;br/&gt;Perspective. Begun in the Locke Lectures, Oxford 2001, the project is evolving in active&lt;br/&gt;scholarly consultation and cooperation through international conferences and journal&lt;br/&gt;exchanges. While the PIs most recent book, The Empirical Stance offered a broad view&lt;br/&gt;of empiricism today, this project continues the more technical investigations of his Laws&lt;br/&gt;and Symmetry and Quantum Mechanics: an Empiricist View -- while addressing some of&lt;br/&gt;the most lively topics in current philosophical debates.&lt;br/&gt;These debates have salient repercussions in our wider culture, and require for&lt;br/&gt;their response a combination of subtlety and rigor. Within this distinctively empiricist&lt;br/&gt;view to be developed, a specifically pragmatic turn makes it possible to dissolve a family&lt;br/&gt;of paradoxes that have been thought to support relativism and skepticism concerning the&lt;br/&gt;sciences. The PI continues here his critique of relativism and skepticism, as initially&lt;br/&gt;presented in his 1992 Presidential Address to the Philosophy of Science Association.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
