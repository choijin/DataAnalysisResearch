    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0505968&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Helmut H. Hofer and Dusa McDuff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instructional workshop, co-sponsored by the DFG (the German&lt;br/&gt;equivalent of the NSF) will bring together junior and senior&lt;br/&gt;researchers in the field of symplectic geometry. The field has&lt;br/&gt;its origins in Hamiltonian dynamics and geometric optics and has&lt;br/&gt;many fundamental applications. For example, numerical methods&lt;br/&gt;based on symplectic ideas (symplectic integrators) are used to&lt;br/&gt;compute the orbits of satellites and other celestial&lt;br/&gt;bodies. Historic highlights are KAM-Theory&lt;br/&gt;(Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser), which leads to a proof of the&lt;br/&gt;stability of our solar system, and the theory of&lt;br/&gt;infinite-dimensional integrable systems, which is the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical underpinning of fiber optics, a technology that lies&lt;br/&gt;at the heart of all of our communication networks. More recently,&lt;br/&gt;the rapidly developing theory of pseudoholomorphic curves has led&lt;br/&gt;to deep new insights into the structure of three and&lt;br/&gt;four-dimensional space, and to unexpected new connections between&lt;br/&gt;geometry and physics. It is a surprising fact that the same&lt;br/&gt;underlying ideas apply to geometric optics, to dynamics and to&lt;br/&gt;the most abstract physics (i.e. string theory).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the purpose of this instructional workshop to describe the&lt;br/&gt;construction of symplectic field theory (SFT) in detail. SFT is a&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive theory of symplectic invariants, including such&lt;br/&gt;well-known theories as Floer theory, Gromov-Witten theory and&lt;br/&gt;contact homology. It is constructed by measuring moduli spaces of&lt;br/&gt;pseudoholomorphic curves. The richness of its structure comes&lt;br/&gt;from the fact that the moduli spaces have boundaries and&lt;br/&gt;singularities and that infinitely many moduli spaces interact&lt;br/&gt;with each other. These structures can be captured by a novel&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear Fredholm theory which is distinguished by two&lt;br/&gt;facts. The ambient spaces do not carry smooth structures in the&lt;br/&gt;usual sense and even have locally varying dimensions. However&lt;br/&gt;there is a notion of transversality (or regularity), and at&lt;br/&gt;regular points the solution sets are smooth orbifolds with&lt;br/&gt;boundaries and corners. Moreover the theory makes precise what&lt;br/&gt;it means for infinitely many Fredholm operators to interact with&lt;br/&gt;each other, which leads to a so-called "Fredholm Theory with&lt;br/&gt;Operations". This abstract Fredholm Theory is developed and&lt;br/&gt;illustrated by its application to SFT. The issues addressed are&lt;br/&gt;pertinent to a variety of important problems, and one can expect&lt;br/&gt;that the ideas presented at the workshop will have implications&lt;br/&gt;in a number of mathematical fields and their applications.</AbstractNarration>
