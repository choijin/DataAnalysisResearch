<AbstractNarration>In this CAREER award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Tianbo Liu of Lehigh University and his graduate student and postodoctoral associate colleagues will study the formation and properties of interesting, hydrophillic, nanometer-sized, macroions.  These macroions resemble blackberries, in that they are single-layer vesicles, composed of many large, hydrophillic polyoxometalate clusters.  This will be done using laser light-scattering, small-angle x-ray scattering and atomic force and transmission electron microscopy techniques.  Prof. Liu and his team will study the kinetics and thermodynamics of these interesting chemical systems.  In addition to his course-development, Prof. Liu will continue to mentor high-school students from under represented groups in research projects for national competitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interesting "blackberry" materials may eventually find use as biomimetic systems, or they may be useful as nanocontainers.  The results of these studies are likely to shed light on other self-assembly processes that occur in nature.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      This project aims to understand an uncharted and important fundamental issue in solution physical chemistry: the transition stage between small simple ions and large colloids.       It is well known that soluble small simple ions distribute homogeneously in dilute solutions, forming stable "real solutions", while large colloidal particles (nanoparticles) can only temporarily and unstably suspended in solution. Both states have been well studied and different theories apply. A key question is that what happens between simple ions and colloids &ndash; in term of size and charge density. Or, the question can be modified to "What happens when soluble ions reach the size of nanometer scale". Such macroions also have connections to polyelectrolyte (including biomacromolecular) solutions.       Supported by this NSF grant, the PI and co-workers extensively explored various hydrophilic macroions, especially the polyoxometalate (POM) macroanions and metal-organic cationic nanocages, by different techniques. We demonstrate that macroions indeed have different solution behavior. With proper charges, they tend to strongly attract with each other and form stable, single-layered spherical "blackberry" structures with the blackberry size being accurately controlled by the solvent, the macroionic size and charge density, as well as the additional electrolytes.
