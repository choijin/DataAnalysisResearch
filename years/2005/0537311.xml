<AbstractNarration>This is a three-year project to conduct a theoretical investigation of gravity wave propagation in the thermosphere. An advanced ray-tracing model that takes into account the strong diffusion in the thermosphere was recently developed by the proposing team and will be utilized in this project. Like-wise, the wave source will be generated by a model that simulates the secondary waves generated by wave breaking in the mesopause and waves generated by mesoscale convective complexes, which was also recently developed by the proposers. A specific objective is to determine the variation of gravity wave forcing and spectra due to variations in the gravity wave source and in the background atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems that this project will address are significant to a wide range of research areas from global circulation modeling to space weather. Specifically, better understanding of wave propagation into the thermosphere is essential to resolve their role in generating, and hence forecasting, such phenomena as equatorial spread-F, which has significant space weather effects. In addition, the project would promote the participation of women in science by helping to advance the successful research career of a female scientist.</AbstractNarration>
