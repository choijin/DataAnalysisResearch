<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Research &lt;br/&gt;0529029 (PI: Kon-Well Wang, Penn State University) and&lt;br/&gt;0528790 (PI: Jiong Tang, University of Connecticut)&lt;br/&gt;0528790 (University of Connecticut)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will fundamentally advance the state-of-the-art of frequency response based structural health monitoring by developing a new multifunctional adaptive piezoelectric sensory system.  The efforts are to develop (a) methodology in using tunable piezoelectric circuits and the associated new algorithms for multiple-FRF based damage identification; (b) novel eigenstructure assignment technique for the further enhancement of performance; and (c) innovative power electronics to create sensory nodes that have integrated self-sensing actuation, parameter tuning, and energy harvesting functions for realizing the proposed damage detection methodology.  This research is expected to increase the sensory system sensitivity, robustness, and accuracy; and will eventually deliver a system that is easy to implement, accurate in prediction, self-contained, and wireless-ready.  The aerospace, civil, mechanical, transportation, and many other industries would benefit from the damage detection devices and technologies developed based on the outcomes of this investigation.  The proposed educational efforts will have broad impact on student learning through integrating research and education at Penn State and University of Connecticut. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These two collaborative projects are supported under sensor initiative NSF 05-526.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
