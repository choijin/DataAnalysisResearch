    <AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes investigatomg the education production function in the context of an informal&lt;br/&gt;community based model of instruction targeted at out-of-school children in India. Using the&lt;br/&gt;planned expansion of the program, the PI will conduct a three part randomization that will&lt;br/&gt;allow us to distinguish the effects of student, teacher, classmate, and non-class peers on student&lt;br/&gt;achievement while also generally evaluating the effectiveness of community based class model.&lt;br/&gt;The evaluation design comprises three randomizations. First, from one hundred communities we&lt;br/&gt;will randomly choose sixty-six in which to provide the intervention. In the treatment&lt;br/&gt;communities, the PI will randomly choose from the out-of-school children who indicate an interest&lt;br/&gt;in the program a subset to receive the treatment. To generate variation in the coverage of&lt;br/&gt;students peer networks, the PI will also varying the fraction of out of school children that will be treated in&lt;br/&gt;these communities. Finally, the PI will randomly assign students to classes and teachers to classes&lt;br/&gt;to allow measurement of the effects of teacher and classmate characteristics. The PI will track&lt;br/&gt;interested children in 100 communities (6,000 children) for two years. Student performance will&lt;br/&gt;be measured through tests, attendance rates, and subsequent enrollment rates.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity&lt;br/&gt;The study will expand the understanding of the education production function in three ways.&lt;br/&gt;First, the PI will contribute to the growing literature that employs randomized evaluations to estimate the&lt;br/&gt;causal effects of educational interventions in the context of developing countries. The PI's estimates&lt;br/&gt;taken in combination with the existing literature will expand understanding of how individual&lt;br/&gt;institutional structures shape students experiences. For example, comparing the change in&lt;br/&gt;student performance due untrained teachers through the Bridge Course program to the change in&lt;br/&gt;student performance due to similar teachers operating in conjunction with normal school teachers&lt;br/&gt;(Banerjee, Cole, Duflo and Linden, 2005) allows improved understanding of the relative effectiveness of&lt;br/&gt;such teachers operating in different environments and with different populations of students.&lt;br/&gt;To complement these global estimates, the PI also seeks to conduct micro-level analyses in which the PI&lt;br/&gt;estimates more fundamental relationships underlying the education production function. Drawing&lt;br/&gt;on the classic theoretical specifications of the education production function and the newer&lt;br/&gt;models of peer effects, the PI directly estimates the effects of teacher, classmate, and non-class peer&lt;br/&gt;characteristics on student learning. Finally, the PI investigates a richer set of characteristics than&lt;br/&gt;have been previously investigated in the developing context. For example, the PI investigates the&lt;br/&gt;influence of different types of peers by testing the effects of peers that have different&lt;br/&gt;relationships to a child by surveying described levels of closeness, shared activities, etc.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact of the Proposed Activity&lt;br/&gt;The intervention the PI proposes to evaluate is extremely cheap (about $1.50 per student per month),&lt;br/&gt;and operates completely outside of traditional administrative boundaries (schools, religious&lt;br/&gt;institutions, etc.). If effective, it could provide a viable mechanism for educating the over 100&lt;br/&gt;million primary-aged children in the developing world who are currently out of school. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, the entire data set resulting from the proposed study will be made available to other&lt;br/&gt;researchers once the PI has finished working with the data.</AbstractNarration>
