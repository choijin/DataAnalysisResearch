<AbstractNarration>The Shodor Education Foundation, Inc. requests funding support in the amount of&lt;br/&gt;$292,590 for a research and development effort, Deaf Educational Access For Science,&lt;br/&gt;Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (DEAF STEM). DEAF STEM will expand&lt;br/&gt;the work of Project SUCCEED-HI (NSF #9906189) by adding American Sign Language&lt;br/&gt;(ASL) versions to the existing text of a wide variety of Shodor materials. A project goal&lt;br/&gt;is to improve access for all students to the National Science Digital Library (NSDL),&lt;br/&gt;including Shodor's extensive STEM materials, which have been developed through&lt;br/&gt;previous, and current NSF funding. In addition, DEAF STEM will provide a dynamic&lt;br/&gt;resource for educational interpreters and other providers to increase their competence and&lt;br/&gt;confidence in interpreting and supporting education in STEM areas to deaf students.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: DEAF STEM addresses the needs of both deaf students and their&lt;br/&gt;teachers/educational interpreters. Deaf students are underrepresented in STEM fields in&lt;br/&gt;large part because of the documented low-grade reading level (3 rd  4 th grade) of the&lt;br/&gt;average deaf high school student and the minimal skill levels of most educational&lt;br/&gt;interpreters. DEAF STEM will address the teacher and student needs by expanding on&lt;br/&gt;the work of SUCCEED-HI to provide bilingual versions of two of Shodor's award&lt;br/&gt;winning activities: Project Interactivate and the Computational Science Education&lt;br/&gt;Reference Desk (CSERD) which has been selected as one of the inaugural pathway&lt;br/&gt;projects of NSDL. Purely text-based approaches to STEM materials are insufficient to&lt;br/&gt;ensure active access to STEM information by deaf students. Through focused research,&lt;br/&gt;DEAF STEM scientists will work with deaf educators and their students to perfect the&lt;br/&gt;modification and presentation of NSDL materials, while assessing a variety of&lt;br/&gt;technologies, including video and the use of avatars. This focused research includes the&lt;br/&gt;development of best practices for providing bilingual materials to our audience.&lt;br/&gt;Additional online tools for searching our growing collection of signed lessons will&lt;br/&gt;support educational interpreters. These tools will enable providers to locate correct&lt;br/&gt;examples of STEM concepts communicated through ASL. The DEAF STEM team will&lt;br/&gt;invite educational interpreters in the field to submit STEM passages that they need help&lt;br/&gt;signing. These passages will be signed and posted on a signing STEM forum. This will&lt;br/&gt;provide an open-ended opportunity for interpreters to both improve their signing skills&lt;br/&gt;and to provide support for the issues they face on a daily basis.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The impact of our DEAF STEM project will be felt on two fronts. By&lt;br/&gt;providing deaf students with signed assistance to read STEM text, the students' ability&lt;br/&gt;and confidence in reading STEM materials will be improved. The bilingual presentation&lt;br/&gt;of the STEM materials in both English text and ASL video clips will provide an&lt;br/&gt;opportunity for language arts and STEM teachers to work together to improve their deaf&lt;br/&gt;students' reading and English skills.&lt;br/&gt;By creating a web based DEAF STEM Forum, the entire deaf community will be&lt;br/&gt;encouraged to explore the signing of STEM concepts. By appealing to the deaf&lt;br/&gt;community's interest in promoting their language, DEAF STEM will widen the exposure&lt;br/&gt;of the deaf community to relevant STEM issues. As a deliverable under the&lt;br/&gt;NSDL/Pathway memorandum of understanding, Shodor will be sharing these best&lt;br/&gt;practices with other projects in NSDL to maximize impact and breadth of dissemination.</AbstractNarration>
