<AbstractNarration>Abstract  &lt;br/&gt;Life Science - Biological  (61)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project establishes a centralized digital imaging, analysis, and quantitation laboratory to be utilized throughout the natural science curriculum.  The facility is modeled after highly successful imaging and analysis laboratories at both Franklin and Marshall College (DUE #9750430) and Wheaton College (DUE #0126637), but modified to place a greater emphasis on quantitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The intellectual merit of the project is reflected in its potential to: 1) generate fundamental improvements in teaching and learning by effectively using technology; 2) provide students with significant exposure to current, real-world technologies; and 3) greatly increase quantitative literacy.  This project is based on an extensive analysis of existing literature, and in turn contributes to the literature and effective practice in undergraduate natural science education through innovative uses of digital imaging and quantitation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The broader impacts of the project include transforming the pedagogy and student experiences in twenty-five courses taught in the biology, chemistry, and physics departments.  These courses target all biology, biochemistry, chemistry, physics, pre-engineering, and math education majors, as well as all pre-service K-12 teachers, and more than 25% of non-science majors.   Student learning gains related to the project are assessed across disciplines using both formative and summative evaluation and direct and indirect measures.  The imaging facility is used for recruitment of and summer outreach experiences for primarily African-American middle and high school students in the Pittsburgh, PA area.</AbstractNarration>
