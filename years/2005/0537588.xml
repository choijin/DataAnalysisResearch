<AbstractNarration>The Synchrotron Radiation Center (SRC) is a national research laboratory operated by the Graduate School of the University of Wisconsin - Madison with funding from the National Science Foundation Division of Materials Research. The SRC uses an electron storage ring named Aladdin to produce light from the infrared to soft X-rays that enables a diverse range of experiments. The SRC is a world-class facility that provides an environment uniquely suited to the performance of often-seminal research, the development of new experimental techniques and instrumentation, and the use of synchrotron radiation in a broad range of disciplines including biology and medicine.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This important national laboratory serves scientists from around the world who tackle fundamental and applied scientific problems such as: illuminating the physics of high temperature superconductors and exotic materials, understanding Alzheimer's and prion diseases, developing new techniques in brain cancer therapy, and cutting-edge explorations of nanotechnology and nanocircuit fabrication.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The mission and activities of the SRC extend well beyond the laboratory bench, however. As part of a major public university based facility, the SRC contributes broadly to education and public outreach. Besides its continued role in graduate education (about 100 graduate students/year carry out research at the facility), the SRC hosts the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program, which focuses on encouraging and supporting women and ethnic minorities in their pursuit of science. The SRC has also developed a groundbreaking Web-based interface for high school students and undergraduates to conduct research remotely. Finally, a rare graduate program in accelerator physics is offered by UW-Madison --a program that includes hands-on experiments on Aladdin.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The SRC is pursuing initiatives that will expand the scientific reach of the facility and take full advantage of the special qualities of the Aladdin complex. For example, given UW-Madison's preeminence in embryonic stem cell research, Aladdin would be an ideal site for an X-ray tomography microscope dedicated to this science.  As part of its long-range planning, the installation of an energy recovery linear accelerator will produce shorter, brighter pulses of infrared and soft X-ray radiation and propel the facility as an invaluable national treasure well into the 21st century.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

It has been primarily funded by the National Science Foundation. SRC has provided an environment uniquely suited to the performance of seminal research, the development of new experimental techniques and instrumentation, and the training of scientists for the future. It has offered a significant component of the highest performance, lower-energy synchrotron-light experimental stations in the U.S.  The capabilities of the facility have been continually improved, and, in particular, advanced instrumentation in polarized ultraviolet photons and rapid infrared imaging has been recently developed.  These capabilities enable, for example, studies of algae for biofuels, refined cancer diagnosis, re-creation of molecules found in space, advances in high temperature superconductivity for efficient energy transmission, and nanotechnology for compact electronics. The education and outreach programs at SRC successfully brought the knowledge and power of light source science to the wider national community.           The results of SRC research are summarized in numerous research reports each year, including regular appearances in leading journals such as Science, Nature, and Physical Review Letters.  Over 400 scientific papers have been published under this cooperative agreement.  Scientific contributions include:           1. Development of a chemically sensitive infrared imaging technique that will greatly expand the ability to examine biological structures with unprecedented resolution, and to track changes over minutes, marking a revolution in synchrotron-enabled science. The new system is the best of its kind in the world. These results allow scientists to identify the biochemistry of very small objects in tissue samples, such as single cells and membranes.            2. Explorations of organic semiconductors, which are promising candidates for novel electronic applications such as flexible computer displays, spray- or paint-on solar cells, and "printed" electronics, with mass production coming off  rotary printing presses rather than by the elaborate production steps currently involved in the fabrication of electronic circuits. Considering the much simpler manufacturing processes and their comparatively low environmental impact, solar cells based on organic molecules could be a key in solving the worldÆs energy crisis.            3. Probing samples of materials such as chromium dioxide and lanthanum strontium magnesium oxide to study how they reacted magnetically on an atomic scale. This knowledge could lead to continued advances in electronic and magnetic devices in the area of magnetoelectronics, also known as spintronics. The benefits of research like this are inside every single hard disk drive, and understanding the magnetic properties of materials can lead to faster computers.               4. Expanded understanding of high temperature superconductivity, which has a huge technological potential with its zero electrical energy losses. Ultimately, this work can lead to room temperature superconductivity that will change completely the electricity and electronics industries, creating a revolution that can be compared to the semi-conductor revolution of the 1960s.            5. Unraveling the mechanisms behind the strength of biominerals. Biominerals are widespread and diverse in nature with examples such as bones, shells, and teeth. These discoveries provide insights that may lead to artificially produced materials with exceptional physical properties.
