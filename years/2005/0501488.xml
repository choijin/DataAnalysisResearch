<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate self-assembled molecular layers as interface chemical isolators in microdevice structures to enable new high-reliability device technologies. The approach is harness the effects of the molecular termini and length of organosilane nanolayers to enhance the chemical and structural integrity of thin film device interfaces. Device structures with the organosilane nanolayers at interfaces of metal-dielectric thin film structures will be fabricated, and used to characterize the roles of molecular termini, length, multilayering, and lateral/interlayer cross-linking nanolayers on parameters such as impurity-induced leakage currents, interface contact resistivity and capacitance, and interfacial adhesion. The effects of thermal treatments, step-coverage and defects, on electrical properties and chemical stability, will be studied by combining electrical device tests with microscopy and spectroscopy techniques, to develop an understanding of property enhancement and device failure mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt;This work will directly impact future device technologies by enabling the use of self-assembled structures in conventional devices, and contribute to bridging the gap between conventional microelectronics and emerging molecular device technologies. Additionally, it provides a unique opportunity for cross-disciplinary training to graduate and undergraduate students through research in molecular self-assembly, device fabrication, testing and materials characterization, international and industrial collaborations. The research will be integrated in the Nanostructured Materials course through a module on fabrication and properties of molecular layer-modified device structures. Site-visits and modular presentations are planned to increase the awareness for K-12 school students and science teachers on self-assembly, properties and applications of molecular layers, for integration in their science classes.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
