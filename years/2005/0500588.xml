<AbstractNarration>This proposal studies two questions in the Homological&lt;br/&gt;Conjectures in Commutative Algebra.  The first is on &lt;br/&gt;intersection multiplicities defined by modules of finite&lt;br/&gt;projective dimension.  This part of the proposal studies&lt;br/&gt;the action on thAbstract&lt;br/&gt;e Chow group defined by such a module.&lt;br/&gt;A theorem of the Principal Investigator and V. Srinivas &lt;br/&gt;answers this question in the case of dimension zero,&lt;br/&gt;and this research will investigate the more complicated&lt;br/&gt;situation in higher dimension.  The second part concerns&lt;br/&gt;the question of whether there are small annihilators of elements&lt;br/&gt;of local cohomology groups in finite extensions.  This&lt;br/&gt;question was inspired by a recent result of Ray Heitmann,&lt;br/&gt;who proved that small powers of the prime p achieved this&lt;br/&gt;in rings of mixed characteristic in dimension three and&lt;br/&gt;used this fact to prove the Direct Summand Conjecture in that&lt;br/&gt;case. In this proposal we consider alternative approaches&lt;br/&gt;in mixed characteristic and whether similar results hold&lt;br/&gt;in characteristic zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the problems that often arises in mathematics&lt;br/&gt;is how to measure the order of tangency, or multiplicity&lt;br/&gt;of intersection, of subspaces of a space.  These numbers are&lt;br/&gt;used, for example, to count how many solutions a given equation has &lt;br/&gt;or how many geometric objects of a certain type there are. &lt;br/&gt;While computing the order of tangency may seem simple for &lt;br/&gt;curves intersecting in the plane, in higher dimension it can&lt;br/&gt;be quite complicated.  This proposal deals with questions that arise&lt;br/&gt;from attempting to measure these algebraically.  More specifically,&lt;br/&gt;the methods use Homological Algebra, and they have&lt;br/&gt;given rise to a set of questions known as the "Homological Conjectures."&lt;br/&gt;The particular questions in this proposal concern determining&lt;br/&gt;whether these invariants are zero and studying their consequences for&lt;br/&gt;the structure of rings and modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
