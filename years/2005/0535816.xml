<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal draws on existing efforts to develop measures of elementary and middle school&lt;br/&gt;mathematical knowledge for teaching. Different from conventional assessments of mathematical&lt;br/&gt;knowledge (e.g., the SAT or Woodcock-Johnson assessment), these measures investigate the special&lt;br/&gt;mathematical knowledge teachers use to work in classrooms with students. For instance, these measures&lt;br/&gt;assess not only whether teachers know that 1 3/4  1/2 = 3 1/2, but also whether they can explain what&lt;br/&gt;this equation means, can construct a concrete representation or word problem which corresponds to it, and&lt;br/&gt;can understand and generalize from an unusual solution method for this problem. This proposal responds&lt;br/&gt;to a number of challenges that have arisen while disseminating these measures to researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, the Learning Mathematics for Teaching project (LMT) disseminates pre-piloted forms and&lt;br/&gt;technical information for evaluating teacher learning in K-8 number and operations, pre-algebra and&lt;br/&gt;algebra, and geometry. Teacher learning opportunities, however, frequently focus on more narrowly&lt;br/&gt;defined topic areas  for instance, rational number concepts and operations. Yet items capturing teacher&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of rational number compose only one component of LMT's number concepts and operations&lt;br/&gt;measures. Because these current measures include other topics, they are unlikely to be appropriately&lt;br/&gt;sensitive to the content and effects of such professional development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In response, this proposal argues for the construction of evaluation modules designed to be sensitive to&lt;br/&gt;and allow research and evaluation in the following areas: rational numbers; proportional reasoning;&lt;br/&gt;geometry; data analysis and probability. In all but the last topic area, for which LMT will create an&lt;br/&gt;entirely new set of items, the project will review and supplement existing items, create a form composed&lt;br/&gt;of items that capture key teacher competencies in these areas, pilot this form, then compose technical&lt;br/&gt;materials that support these modules' use. These technical materials will include two parallel forms and&lt;br/&gt;pre-equated raw-score-to-standardized-score conversion tables, to facilitate straightforward scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal also describes plans to improve the quality of dissemination training by exploring the&lt;br/&gt;nature of problems that arise when outside evaluators use these measures, and describes work to improve&lt;br/&gt;measures of teachers' knowledge of student learning around content.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal grows from a well-established measures development project. At every step in this project's&lt;br/&gt;history, the provision of high-quality measures has coincided with  and in some ways, depended upon &lt;br/&gt;progress in building theory about content knowledge for teaching mathematics, and exploring new areas&lt;br/&gt;in measurement design and scaling. This will be the case in the work proposed here, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal enhances the infrastructure for research on teacher learning. These measures can be used to&lt;br/&gt;evaluate teachers' learning in pre-service teacher education programs; to make comparisons between&lt;br/&gt;preparation in traditional teacher education programs and alternative routes to certification; to judge the&lt;br/&gt;efficacy of professional development aimed at improving teachers' content knowledge for teaching; and&lt;br/&gt;to estimate the effects of curriculum materials designed to improve teachers' knowledge of mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and students. These measures are accessible to users with limited technical expertise, comparable across&lt;br/&gt;programs and approaches to professional development, and of high technical quality.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
