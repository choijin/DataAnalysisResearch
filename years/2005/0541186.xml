<AbstractNarration>The PI requests partial funding from NSF to provide a National Academy study that will examine the basic scientific, technical and institutional needs of countries, especially in the developing world, for the effective protection and management of ocean and coastal environments. The committee will examine human resource development (e.g., training and education), the establishment of appropriate institutions and infrastructure, and the creation of favorable policy environments. Barriers to effective management will also be explored. The study will address critical elements of capacity building that have not received adequate attention in the past with a view to identifying ways in which such elements can be integrated into effective marine protection and management strategies. The study will examine how the United States, working in partnership with the wider international community, can help create and strengthen marine capacity building worldwide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will promote greater awareness and understanding by experts, policy makers and the general public of the importance of healthy marine and coastal ecosystems for the environmental, economic and security interests of the U.S. and the wider international community. In addition to the information gathering by the committee, an international workshop will be convened to draw on the broader expertise of the capacity building community. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
