<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed project is to develop decision and control theory, state estimation&lt;br/&gt;algorithms, and mathematical tools for networked sensors in a system-level application area of&lt;br/&gt;structural health monitoring (SHM). We will develop distributed computing algorithms for diagnostic&lt;br/&gt;and prognostic interpretation of the spatio-temporal data. The initial focus is on aerospace&lt;br/&gt;applications but the research results will be suffciently general to be used in many other areas. The&lt;br/&gt;algorithms will use embedded optimization for accurate estimation of the evolving spatio-temporal&lt;br/&gt;pattern of the damage. The computing will be scalable to very large sensor arrays.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed approach is to develop an innovative engineering application in aerospace&lt;br/&gt;SHM area through industrial collaboration and then generalizing the results. Existing SHM work&lt;br/&gt;is aimed at developing sensors, data interrogation methods, and low-level signal processing to&lt;br/&gt;obtain a single damage estimate array. This project will develop system-level statistical algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for estimation of structural health state, monitoring, and decision support based on series of spatial&lt;br/&gt;data arrays obtained from distributed networked sensors. The algorithms will allow for scalable&lt;br/&gt;and reconfigurable distributed parallel computing implementation.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit. We propose to develop algorithms for spatio-temporal estimation of structural&lt;br/&gt;damage that can be scaled to very large spatial data arrays through networked computing.&lt;br/&gt;The engineering need and potential for practical impact come from collaboration with Honeywell.&lt;br/&gt;The place of the problem formulation with respect to existing work is characterized by the&lt;br/&gt;following highlights: (i) We concentrate on mathematical processing of the existing sensor data,&lt;br/&gt;rather than developing new sensing systems; (ii) We focus on spatio-temporal processing of the&lt;br/&gt;data, while the existing SHM literature is focused on obtaining a single spatial pattern of the&lt;br/&gt;damage. Modeling and trending the temporal evolution of the damage will enable prognostics;&lt;br/&gt;(iii) We pursue system scalability through constrained optimization-based estimation algorithms&lt;br/&gt;implemented through distributed computing. Existing distributed algorithms are for optimizing&lt;br/&gt;a small number of parameters. We will estimate large spatio-temporal arrays; (iv) The decision&lt;br/&gt;system design will include uncertainty, missing data, self-healing capability etc, as opposed to&lt;br/&gt;considering an idealized and simplified mathematical problem.&lt;br/&gt;The main steps and challenges in the proposed work include: 1. Formulating models of spatiotemporal&lt;br/&gt;evolution of the damage and criteria of estimation optimality. 2. Developing solutions of&lt;br/&gt;optimal statistical estimation and detection problems through embedded convex optimization of a&lt;br/&gt;log-likelihood index. 3. Developing scalable algorithms through networked distributed computing.&lt;br/&gt;Broad impact. Algorithmic and system engineering approaches in this proposal would accelerate&lt;br/&gt;industrial adoption of the SHM technology by reducing false alarms and improving scalability.&lt;br/&gt;This would enable condition-based maintenance of structures reducing airline flight delays and improving&lt;br/&gt;military aircraft readiness. Other aerospace applications include next generation space&lt;br/&gt;vehicles and space habitats. The transition into aerospace engineering practice will be facilitated&lt;br/&gt;by the collaboration with Honeywell. The research would help in developing large networked sensing&lt;br/&gt;systems in other areas. These include SHM of civil structures (buildings, bridges, etc), marine&lt;br/&gt;and ground vehicles, and industrial plants. The results could be also extended to sensing and&lt;br/&gt;health assessment in medicine, geophysics (e.g., earthquake related damage), and bio or ecosystem&lt;br/&gt;damage.&lt;br/&gt;We will take steps towards developing graduate training in the area of decision technology for the&lt;br/&gt;networked sensors by including the research results in the curriculum of existing courses. During&lt;br/&gt;the planned university visit, the industrial co-PI will teach an industrial-oriented graduate-level&lt;br/&gt;course. The students involved with the project or attending the courses will have an opportunity&lt;br/&gt;to work as interns at Honeywell, which will provide them with an additional practical training.&lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>
