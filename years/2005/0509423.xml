<AbstractNarration>     Wave motion is one of the most common phenomena of the&lt;br/&gt;natural world and a subject central to Applied Mathematics.  This&lt;br/&gt;proposal focuses on two areas in fluid mechanics: internal gravity&lt;br/&gt;waves, as encountered in the ocean and atmosphere, and waves at&lt;br/&gt;the interface between two phases dominated by a large viscosity&lt;br/&gt;contrast, a setup that occurs in the lung airways.  While situated&lt;br/&gt;far apart in their relevant scales, these two areas nonetheless&lt;br/&gt;share common mathematical tools for devising models able to&lt;br/&gt;describe and predict their main dynamical behaviors.  Within the&lt;br/&gt;first theme, a long term goal is to provide a model of internal&lt;br/&gt;waves in layered stratification that correctly accounts for&lt;br/&gt;dispersion and high nonlinearity.  The motivation comes from the&lt;br/&gt;growing body of evidence, experimental and in the field, that&lt;br/&gt;large amplitude internal waves are easily attainable and a common&lt;br/&gt;feature of ocean dynamics.  The focus of the second theme is to&lt;br/&gt;develop the proper model capable of detecting and following the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of instabilities in a class of core-annular flows in a&lt;br/&gt;pipe.  The motivation comes from understanding the hydrodynamic&lt;br/&gt;feedback mechanisms that govern mucus-air flow coupling in&lt;br/&gt;respiratory systems.  Careful asymptotic analysis taking advantage&lt;br/&gt;of the long wave nature of the dynamics can be brought to bear on&lt;br/&gt;both problems, with emphasis on strongly nonlinear motion.  Field&lt;br/&gt;and laboratory data test the resulting models and their predictive&lt;br/&gt;capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The overall aim of this project is to isolate, understand,&lt;br/&gt;and integrate into working models particular mechanisms of wave&lt;br/&gt;dynamics that experiments, field observations, and analysis&lt;br/&gt;suggest are important for an accurate mathematical description of&lt;br/&gt;certain fluid flow problems.  The outcome of this approach informs&lt;br/&gt;and benchmarks experiments as well as more elaborate numerical&lt;br/&gt;simulations.  The understanding made available through the new&lt;br/&gt;models has an impact in environmental and health sciences, e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;by enhancing the accuracy of simulations of nutrient and pollutant&lt;br/&gt;dispersion in the environment, or, for the second part of this&lt;br/&gt;project, by helping devise improved strategies of drug delivery in&lt;br/&gt;human airways.</AbstractNarration>
