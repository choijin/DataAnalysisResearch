    <AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Nongjian Tao of Arizona State University. Prof. Tao and his students will develop new methods to measure and control electron transport properties at the single molecule level. To realize this goal they will fabricate systems where bifunctional single molecules are covalently attached to and connect between two electrodes. This will enable the measurement of electron transport properties of individual molecules between the two electrodes as a function of their REDOX state. This challenging study is likely to lead to the development of revolutionized molecular nanoelectronic devices. It will also increase our understanding of electrochemical reactions at the nano scale. The research of Prof. Tao will provide excellent training opportunities for students and postdoctoral research associates in a highly multidisciplinary area at the forefront of scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
