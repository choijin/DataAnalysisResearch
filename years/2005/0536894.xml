<AbstractNarration>In this U.S.-Brazil workshop supported by the Americas Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering, Dr. Jack Saltiel, Florida State University will bring together a broad mix of theoretical and experimental chemists who will tackle the challenges of theoretically predicting the course of photochemical reactions.  This workshop, entitled "The Interplay of Experiment and Theory in Photochemistry," will be held in Salvador, Brazil on June 9-11, 2006 and is scheduled immediately before the 17th Inter-American Photochemical Society Conference at the same location.  The Brazilian co-organizer is Dr.Frank H. Quina of the University of Sao Paulo, and the local organizer is Professor Dr. Jose Carlos Netto Ferreira of the Federal University of Bahia in Salvador.  Although the workshop is intended to bring together U.S. and Brazilian researchers, several scientists from other Latin American countries and Canada have accepted invitations to attend at their own expense and participate in discussions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop focuses on a topic of considerable importance to photochemistry and theoretical chemistry.  It would enable younger scientists and female researchers to be introduced to an international research community.  It also promises to establish a wide network of new interactions and collaborations that should be very productive.  The possibility for future student and postdoctoral exchanges is also a positive potential outcome.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
