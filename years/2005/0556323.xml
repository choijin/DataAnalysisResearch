<AbstractNarration>Abstract  - Bazant, NWn U.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently the strength reduction parts of safety factors are&lt;br/&gt;considered as fixed, determined purely from statistics of test&lt;br/&gt;data. However, this is adequate only for purely brittle or ductile&lt;br/&gt;limiting cases. Here the key idea is that, for the transitional&lt;br/&gt;range of quasibrittle structures (concrete structures, fiber&lt;br/&gt;composites, rigid foams, ceramics, rocks, ice, soils, wood, etc.,&lt;br/&gt;and those on approach to nanoscale), the safety factor must depend&lt;br/&gt;on structure size and geometry, and that to ensure tolerable&lt;br/&gt;failure probability, such as one in a million, the safety factor&lt;br/&gt;must be determined from extreme-value statistics based on stress&lt;br/&gt;dependence of activation energy of interatomic bonds. The strength&lt;br/&gt;probability distributions of material elements and of structure,&lt;br/&gt;deviations from power-law size effect, kinks on strength&lt;br/&gt;histograms, and dependence on temperature, loading rate and&lt;br/&gt;duration, are derived and exploited for verification and&lt;br/&gt;calibration.  Relevance and practical applications are&lt;br/&gt;demonstrated by stochastic numerical analysis of documented&lt;br/&gt;structural disasters. Major implications for design codes and&lt;br/&gt;practices for quasibrittle structures, as well as reliability of&lt;br/&gt;micro-nano-scale thin films and MEMS, are identified.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

For quasibrittle materials the correct statistical distribution of material and structural strength and lifetime has not been known, and the safety factors have been purely empirical.

The present investigation has changed that. It led to the formulations of nano-mechanics based theory of strength and lifetime statistics of quasibrittle structures. By contrast to perfectly brittle structures, it was found theoretically, as well on the basis of test results, the probability distribution of strength of a small material element (precisely, the representative volume element) is mostly Gaussian (or normal), with a remote power-law tail.  Most interestingly, with increasing structure size, this distribution was found to gradually change, with the tail growing into the core of distribution in the Weibull form while the Gaussian part is shrinking until, for structures comprising more than 1.E4 representative volume elements, the entire distribution becomes Weibullian. The same was found to be true of the structural lifetime.  The consequences are profound. The safety factors should not be considered to be independent of the structure size (and shape), as they are for brittle and ductile structures, but should be varied with the structure size, according to a calculation method developed (based on the weakest-link model with a finite number of links). This new finding affect large concrete structures as well as the new designs of light fully composite airframes for commercial aircraft. Proposals to introduce these new ideas into the structural design practice and codes have been made, and computer methods to carry out this kind of probabilistic design are pursued as an extension of this project.   An interesting spin-off was found for the desing oh the new computer chips with high-k dielectrics, about 5 nm thick, which attempt to extend the famous Moore's law. Although physically the problem is totally different, mathematically is it completely analogous, with same kind of statistical distribution describing the electronic breakdown.  Various honest broadreach efforts of the usual kind have been made.        .            Last Modif...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
