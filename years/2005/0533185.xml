<AbstractNarration>The proposed one-year DEI project will create standard-based science materials that&lt;br/&gt;parents of students with disabilities can use to reinforce science instruction covered in&lt;br/&gt;grades K-5. The Science Learning Ideas Pages will emphasize activities that parents&lt;br/&gt;can do with their children at home (and in the community) and will be distributed by&lt;br/&gt;teachers to parents. It has been demonstrated that parent involvement in their child's&lt;br/&gt;education is one of the prime reasons for success. Seventy-six sheets will be produced&lt;br/&gt;that describe supplemental activities. The materials will be standards-based, and&lt;br/&gt;therefore will be appealing for many teachers to use. These sheets will be available&lt;br/&gt;free over the Internet, and will be distributed to state Science and Special Education&lt;br/&gt;Coordinators and to national parent organizations. Similar supplemental materials have&lt;br/&gt;been developed by this group in the past, but focusing on literacy and recreation. The&lt;br/&gt;project is well thought out, and it involves a strong team with a good blend of STEM and&lt;br/&gt;disability experience. One weakness was that there was little reference to the&lt;br/&gt;strategies the investigators would use to make the activities accessible for students with&lt;br/&gt;disabilities. The evaluation plan is strong, with both parent and teacher perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;The reviewers unanimously felt that the Science Learning Ideas Pages could be just as&lt;br/&gt;useful for students without disabilities as with disabilities. Therefore, we would suggest&lt;br/&gt;that the investigators take a universal design approach to develop an inclusive&lt;br/&gt;document that could help parents of students regardless of whether their children have&lt;br/&gt;a disability.</AbstractNarration>
