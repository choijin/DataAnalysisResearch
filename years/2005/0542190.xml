<AbstractNarration>Pangborn Abstract&lt;br/&gt;PAESMEM Mentoring for Academic Career Development Study and Action Workshop&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The power of mentoring and role models is generally acknowledged and are critical&lt;br/&gt;career development tools for women in engineering faculty careers. Yet, because women are&lt;br/&gt;severely underrepresented on engineering faculties nationwide, many junior and mid-level&lt;br/&gt;engineering faculty women lack positive female role models and mentors and are too often&lt;br/&gt;overlooked or left out of crucial information loops. The successful senior women who are the&lt;br/&gt;potential mentors have little time or experience of successful mentoring. What is needed is a&lt;br/&gt;mentoring model, or methodology, that provides the necessary support for junior and mid-level&lt;br/&gt;women faculty, mines the experience of senior women faculty, and respects the time demands&lt;br/&gt;that are a reality for all productive engineering faculty members. It is necessary to design ways in&lt;br/&gt;which successful mentors can have sustained contact with junior faculty while not overburdening&lt;br/&gt;the mentors themselves.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Mentoring for Academic Career Development Study and Action Workshop,&lt;br/&gt;led by Penn State's Council of Senior Engineering Faculty Women will bring together senior&lt;br/&gt;women from universities and industry to identify effective practices in faculty mentoring as well as&lt;br/&gt;problems in developing good mentoring programs. The goal will be to develop a realistic model&lt;br/&gt;and guidelines for mentoring junior and mid-level faculty women. Inclusion of successful industry&lt;br/&gt;women will allow the workshop to include industry practices and experiences in the deliberation.&lt;br/&gt;Workshop objectives are to:&lt;br/&gt;o Create a realistic model, based upon experience, practice and on-going research, of how&lt;br/&gt;mentoring can be provided in a comprehensive way to junior faculty women.&lt;br/&gt;o Build on existing Penn State workshops for career development for faculty women&lt;br/&gt;o Improve the mentoring experiences of all participants&lt;br/&gt;o Identify a set of research questions for future investigation into mentoring for engineering&lt;br/&gt;faculty women&lt;br/&gt;o Publish and broadly disseminate workshop outcomes&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will include pre-assessment surveys, pre-work and readings on current literature,&lt;br/&gt;and pre- and post-conference interactions-all designed to set up a productive dialogue. Postconference&lt;br/&gt;assessment will also be conducted.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The PAESMEM Mentoring Study and Action Workshop aims to broaden current understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the challenges of mentoring in the Academy to benefit three important audiences - junior and&lt;br/&gt;mid-level faculty women, senior faculty women and administrators. The proposed workshop will&lt;br/&gt;result in published guidelines in paper and electronic format. The workshop assessment will&lt;br/&gt;provide basic information for researchers in academic mentoring. In the long term, this workshop&lt;br/&gt;will create a new dialogue about effective mentoring that can be implemented in the high&lt;br/&gt;pressure world of engineering faculties. It is anticipated that the findings will be relevant to other&lt;br/&gt;STEM professionals.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The findings of the workshop have the potential to provide engineering faculty with the tools for&lt;br/&gt;developing an effective mentoring model for engineering faculty women, a group&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented in engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
