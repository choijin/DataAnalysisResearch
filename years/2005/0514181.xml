<AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is allowing qualified participants from the United States to attend the 8th IFIP World Conference on Computers in Education (IFIP WCCE'2005) will be held July 4-7, 2005 at the University of Stellenbosch in Cape Town, South Africa. Participants will be selected competitively by a committee of qualified reviewers, and will be chosen based in part on the likelihood of their sharing the results of this participation with others. The maximum travel award will be $2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is an opportunity for United States faculty to interact with peers from other nations who are exploring opportunities and addressing problems critical to advances in computing education and the uses of computers in education. Individuals who are able to attend WCCE as a result of this funding will bring new ideas and collaboration opportunities back to share at a variety of U.S. based conferences as well as the institutions in which they teach. The results of this support will be magnified by the continuing interactions of these participants over the next few years.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
