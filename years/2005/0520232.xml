<AbstractNarration>The proliferation of wireless applications creates an increased density of wireless devices.  Information-bearing signals from these devices generate significant aggregate interference that adversely affects Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) performance.  Non-data bearing radiated signals also contaminate the space of WLANs in unlicensed bands.  To date, this interference problem has largely been treated in an incremental, application specific manner.  Thus, there is strong motivation to thoroughly understand this interference phenomenon to improve WLAN design, and ultimately adapt WLANs to dynamically mitigate interference degradation.&lt;br/&gt;This effort focuses on:  the development of quantifiable interference characteristics of wireless receivers and, intentional and unintentional transmitters; the establishment of a means of understanding and characterizing interference temperature; and the use of this critical information to enhance interference and general error-modeling capabilities of  network simulation tools.  These objectives are achieved via a three-prong methodology:  (1) theoretical modeling of interfering signals in temporal and spectral domains; (2) simulation modeling for studying the impact of interference on network performance including specific protocols, applications, and validation of interference models; (3) physical experimentation to verify and enhance theoretical and simulation results, augmenting empirical observations.&lt;br/&gt;The broad impact of this research allows the technical community to better understand wireless network resource management, leading to significant economic savings and performance improvements.  Another important impact is on U.S. government communications policy.  Education and training of students in this field is enhanced.  Public demonstrations, symposia, and print/broadcast media are employed to disseminate results.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Wireless technologies have experienced rapid growth in recent years.  As more and more devices are released, the demand for radio spectrum from both public and private sectors is rapidly increasing. In parallel, there is recognition that while the spectrum is fully allocated, most of the spectrum is actually unused, and the real root of the spectrum scarcity problem is that the historic system of spectral regulation has largely been rendered ineffective by the rapid enhancement of the underlying radio technologies. This historic spectral regulation is based on the premise that slices of the spectrum must be treated as the exclusive domains of single entities who are the licensees to specific frequency bands.       The opening of unlicensed and multi-use bands to alleviate the spectrum scarcity issue has lead to a rapid proliferation of new wireless standards and related devices which exist under names like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee and a host of proprietary offerings.  As their popularity grows, such devices experience increasing challenges with interference. The critical and fundamental topic of interference in this new environment had historically received only limited focus, less than its growing importance would suggest that it deserves.     The NSF funding for this grant has supported an Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) lead collaborative research effort with the Wireless Network and Security (WiNSec) Research Center at Stevens Institute of Technology (SIT), Shared Spectrum Company (SSC), and more recently research at West Virginia University. This grant supported a variety of collaborative research efforts across and between academia (e.g. Rutgers, U of Kansas, WPI, various IIT departments, etc.), industry (primarily our partners Motorola, and SSC, though numerous organizations have reviewed our results), and government entities (e.g. DARPA, ONR, AFRL, NTIA, and the FCC).  Largely through the funding provided by this grant, a well-equipped wireless laboratory was created at IIT for conducting wireless interference measurements and performing experiments. The establishment of this facility has ultimately led to the creation of the Wireless Network and Communication (WiNCom) Research Center at IIT, benefiting dozens of students over the years in conducting their research, and ultimately receiving advanced degrees.  Due to the popularity and low cost of the unlicensed 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band (widely used by consumer Wi-Fi devices, among others) equipment and devices, most of the research was conducted in this band. Among the issues studied were the characterization of time-varying interfering sources, methods of mitigation, and the effect of interference across the wireless network.  The research aimed to better understand and improve network performance through the development of interference propagation models, data traffic models, and novel control mechanisms. A compendium of wireless device spectral signatures and characteristics was developed through investigations of ISM band devices such as Wi-Fi, microwave ovens and cordless phones; in the process much knowledge was gained as to how these devices interfere with each other while competing for the same spectral resources.  Of particular interest was the effect of interference on the Wi-Fi. Mitigation schemes have been designed and tested to reduce the detrimental effects of microwave oven and Bluetooth signals on Wi-Fi, as well as automated systems to detect and identify competing transmitters.  The research work has contributed to eleven MasterÆs degrees, six doctoral theses, dozens of published scientific papers, several book chapters and a book. The availability of this information and the techniques used to obtain, catalog and analyze it provided a very useful education platform, supporting undergraduate and graduate education at IIT.
