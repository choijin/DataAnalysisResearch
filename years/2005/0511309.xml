<AbstractNarration>This project considers the construction and analysis of algorithms to&lt;br/&gt;simulate fluid systems containing elastic components. Polymers, such&lt;br/&gt;as liquid crystals, are an important class of such fluids, and in this&lt;br/&gt;instance the elastic properties of the molecules are usually&lt;br/&gt;incorporated into a continuum model. Another example is blood flow&lt;br/&gt;where the elasticity of the red blood cells gives rise to&lt;br/&gt;non-Newtonian behavior. This problem was motivated by collaborative&lt;br/&gt;work with engineers who wish to determine the distribution of and&lt;br/&gt;damage to red blood cells in the small clearances within mechanical&lt;br/&gt;heart assist devices. Since these clearances are of comparable&lt;br/&gt;dimension to the cells, it is necessary to explicitly model the cells&lt;br/&gt;at the micrometer scale in order to determine their distribution and&lt;br/&gt;the stresses they experience. The mathematical structure of the&lt;br/&gt;equations modeling viscoelastic polymers and blood are very similar,&lt;br/&gt;and insight gained in one of them sheds light on the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to simulate the flow of complex materials on a computer is&lt;br/&gt;a key technology required for the design and development of many "next&lt;br/&gt;generation" products, such as micro-mechanical devices, bio-materials,&lt;br/&gt;and prosthetic organs. For example, a major mode of failure in&lt;br/&gt;mechanical heart assist devices is the formation of clots (thrombosis)&lt;br/&gt;which are primarily initiated by damage to the red blood cells. This&lt;br/&gt;phenomena is difficult to control and the ability to simulate it on a&lt;br/&gt;computer it would represent a breakthrough which would eliminate much&lt;br/&gt;of the expensive and time consuming experimentation currently&lt;br/&gt;required. The equations used to model such phenomena are complex and&lt;br/&gt;poorly understood, and much of the research proposed herein is directed&lt;br/&gt;to revealing the theoretical (mathematical) properties of these&lt;br/&gt;models. This work complements the more practical approaches undertaken&lt;br/&gt;in the engineering community and at the national laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
