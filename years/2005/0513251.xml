<AbstractNarration>Large scale continuum mechanics simulations routinely require&lt;br/&gt;the efficient solution of very large linear or nonlinear systems&lt;br/&gt;of algebraic equations as well as powerful computer systems.&lt;br/&gt;Such problems are increasingly solved on parallel or distributed&lt;br/&gt;computing systems which provide access to a large amount of memory&lt;br/&gt;as well as a substantial number of fast processors. The goal of&lt;br/&gt;this project is to further develop solvers of domain decomposition&lt;br/&gt;type, algorithms which respect the memory hierarchy of modern computing &lt;br/&gt;systems and allow for a performance which approaches peak floating point&lt;br/&gt;performance. There already exists a well developed mathematical theory &lt;br/&gt;and a good understanding of how to adjust these algorithms to problems&lt;br/&gt;arising in different applications but there is also a real need&lt;br/&gt;to further extend our understanding and to improve and numerically&lt;br/&gt;test new algorithms especially in view of emergence of parallel&lt;br/&gt;computing systems with very many powerful processors. A main&lt;br/&gt;goal of this project is the further understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;FETI-DP and BDDC families of domain decomposition methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The direction of the work in this field is strongly influenced&lt;br/&gt;by the interaction between academic computational scientists&lt;br/&gt;and scientists at the US national laboratories and in&lt;br/&gt;the engineering software industry. The connection to the SANDIA-&lt;br/&gt;Albuquerque laboratories is particularly strong. Domain decomposition&lt;br/&gt;methods are used extensively in very large and important applications&lt;br/&gt;at these laboratories and the domain decomposition methods are&lt;br/&gt;also making significant inroads in software systems that are used&lt;br/&gt;by a large community of engineers for the design and checking&lt;br/&gt;of machine parts and larger engineering structures. Particularly important&lt;br/&gt;application areas are elasticity and electromagnetics. The latter&lt;br/&gt;field helps create a foundation for improvements of cellular&lt;br/&gt;phone systems, other wire-less communication systems, as well as&lt;br/&gt;micro electronics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
