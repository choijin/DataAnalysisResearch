<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organic conductors represent a class of carbon-based materials where &lt;br/&gt;pressure and temperature may induce transformations from one kind of &lt;br/&gt;electronic behavior to another.  A striking example is the transformation &lt;br/&gt;from magnetism into superconductivity which will be the focus of this &lt;br/&gt;project.  Experiments are planned to measure a quantity called the magnetic &lt;br/&gt;penetration depth, whose behavior provides a window into the microscopic &lt;br/&gt;behavior of electrons in the superconducting state.   This work will build &lt;br/&gt;upon novel techniques previously developed in this lab to measure the &lt;br/&gt;penetration depth.   How organic superconductivity differs from its &lt;br/&gt;counterpart in ordinary metals and high temperature superconductors, how it &lt;br/&gt;evolves from magnetism and what ultimately causes it to occur will be the &lt;br/&gt;key questions this project will try to answer.  Complex electronic &lt;br/&gt;materials of this type will undoubtedly play a role in future computational &lt;br/&gt;and micro mechanical devices.  Understanding the physical principles that &lt;br/&gt;govern their behavior is critical in the same way that understanding the &lt;br/&gt;behavior of silicon was to the computer revolution. This program will &lt;br/&gt;provide training for both undergraduate and graduate students in low noise, &lt;br/&gt;high frequency electronic instrumentation, cryogenics, computer simulation &lt;br/&gt;and high pressure methods. It will also provide these students with the &lt;br/&gt;intellectual challenge of understanding the complex behavior of newly &lt;br/&gt;synthesized materials and help forge links between physics, chemistry, &lt;br/&gt;electrical engineering and material science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organic conductors are synthetic metals composed of carbon-based &lt;br/&gt;molecules.   By changing temperature and pressure they transform from &lt;br/&gt;metals into insulators, magnets or superconductors.   Determining the &lt;br/&gt;general principles that govern these electronic transformations is one of &lt;br/&gt;the central unsolved problems in condensed matter physics.  This project &lt;br/&gt;will focus on high frequency magnetic measurements in a class of organic &lt;br/&gt;materials for which high quality, single crystals are readily &lt;br/&gt;available.   The experiments will utilize  electronic oscillator techniques &lt;br/&gt;developed in this lab to measure the magnetic penetration length, a &lt;br/&gt;quantity fundamental to all superconductors.  By studying how the &lt;br/&gt;penetration depth changes in response to pressure, temperature, magnetic &lt;br/&gt;field and chemical substitution, a window will be opened into the &lt;br/&gt;underlying quantum state of the superconductor. The themes will be how &lt;br/&gt;organic superconductivity differs from its counterpart in conventional &lt;br/&gt;metals and high temperature superconductors, how it evolves under pressure &lt;br/&gt;from the magnetic phase and ultimately what causes organic materials to &lt;br/&gt;become superconductors.   The program will provide training for both &lt;br/&gt;undergraduates and graduate students in  low noise, high frequency &lt;br/&gt;electronic instrumentation, cryogenics, magnetic measurements and &lt;br/&gt;high-pressure techniques. It will also provide students with the &lt;br/&gt;intellectual challenge of understanding the complex behavior of newly &lt;br/&gt;synthesized materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
