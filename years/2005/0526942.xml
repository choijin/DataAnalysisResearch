<AbstractNarration>Abstract Carbotte&lt;br/&gt; This project involves two efforts directly linked to community-defined goals.  The first is a central metadata catalog for past, present and future marine geological and geophysical data.  This effort will build on the proponent's database experience and will include streamlined structure to capture metadata from future expeditions.  The metadata catalog will be designed to serve as a central search device for expedition information with links to distributed disciplinary databases.  Legacy data and expedition information will be collected by active solicitation and on-site visits to scientists and repositories.  The second is to develop a bathymetry synthesis for the global oceans.  A major focus will be to establish standard procedures for managing multibeam bathymetry data in particular, which includes through data documentation, quality control, and streamlined processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
