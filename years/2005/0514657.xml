<AbstractNarration>Since the 1950s, inertial interchange true polar wander (IITPW) has been recognized as a phys-&lt;br/&gt;ically viable process in which the entire solid Earth may shift as much as 90. with respect to the&lt;br/&gt;spin axis in 106-107 years. Nevertheless, IITPW events have not been demonstrated convincingly&lt;br/&gt;in the geologic record for two main reasons: (1) studies have been plagued by uncertainties in&lt;br/&gt;the age, quality, and correlation of paleomagnetic poles collected from various types of rocks on&lt;br/&gt;different continents, and (2) no serious effort has been made to link the effects IITPW may have&lt;br/&gt;on the stratigraphic record due to changes in global climate structure, ocean circulation, sea level,&lt;br/&gt;nutrient cycling, organic carbon burial, methane storage, and continental weathering.&lt;br/&gt;The IITPW hypothesis provides a series of testable predictions because an IITPW event will&lt;br/&gt;affect every continent differently, but predictably, depending on the continent's changing position&lt;br/&gt;relative to Earth's spin axis. For example, the further a craton is from the inertial interchange&lt;br/&gt;axis (Imin), the greater the changes in sea level and paleomagnetic inclination will be. Maloof&lt;br/&gt;et al. [70] identified an interval of relatively light carbon isotopes in *800 million year old (Ma)&lt;br/&gt;carbonate rocks of East Svalbard (Norway) that is bracketed by large shifts in relative sea level&lt;br/&gt;and paleomagnetic orientation. They argue that the coincidence of these isotopic, magnetic, and&lt;br/&gt;eustatic changes can be explained by rapid shifts in global paleogeography associated with a pair&lt;br/&gt;of inertial interchange true polar wander IITPW events. The same isotopic interval has also been&lt;br/&gt;identified in Bitter Springs Formation equivalents in Australia. Australia is an ideal locality to&lt;br/&gt;test the IITPW hypothesis because most models of middle Neoproterozoic paleogeography place&lt;br/&gt;Australia further away and in a different direction from Imin than East Svalbard. Therefore, the&lt;br/&gt;stratigraphy spanning this interval in Australia should show unique paleomagnetic and sea level&lt;br/&gt;shifts that are both larger in amplitude and different in shape than those documented in Svalbard.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will test the IITPW hypothesis through an integrated investigation of the physical,&lt;br/&gt;geochemical, and magnetic stratigraphy of the Bitter Springs Stage in Australia.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. All paleogeographic reconstructions to date rely on two fundamental as-&lt;br/&gt;sumptions: (1) the motion of continents is dominated by plate tectonics, and (2) Earth's magnetic&lt;br/&gt;field is geocentric and dipolar on time scales *104 yrs. Documenting IITPW in the geologic record&lt;br/&gt;would have profound implications for interpreting plate motions over the last 2 billion years. Fur-&lt;br/&gt;thermore, documenting the sedimentological and biogeochemical consequences of an IITPW event&lt;br/&gt;at *800 would shed light on the equilibrium Earth System prior to the first of at least three major&lt;br/&gt;Neoproterozoic glaciations. A falsification of the IITPW hypothesis would lead to an equally im-&lt;br/&gt;portant suite of results documenting ancient secular variation of the geomagnetic field or perhaps&lt;br/&gt;an unexpected Neoproterozoic paleogeography.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. (1) The distribution of continents is crucial to any first order understanding&lt;br/&gt;of general fluid circulation on the Earth. Therefore, the science of developing geologically and&lt;br/&gt;paleomagnetically realistic paleogeographies is necessary for generating models of ancient climates&lt;br/&gt;and for understanding the limits of global change. (2) This proposal will be the start of a research&lt;br/&gt;project led by the PI and involving laboratory collaborations with MIT (S.A. Bowring, B.P. Weiss),&lt;br/&gt;Yale (D.A.D. Evans), and Caltech (J.L. Kirschvink). These collaborations not only will produce&lt;br/&gt;important science, but also will begin a technology transfer to Princeton, where the PI will set&lt;br/&gt;up a paleomagnetics laboratory in 2006. (3) Study of the Bitter Springs Stage is an ideal student&lt;br/&gt;project because it requires the knowledge of a suite of complementary subjects, from basic field&lt;br/&gt;mapping and sequence stratigraphy to paleomagnetism, stable and radiogenic isotope systems, and&lt;br/&gt;whole-Earth geophysics. The PI will recruit underrepresented students to receive extensive training&lt;br/&gt;in field and analytical methods, and to play active roles in discovery-based research science.</AbstractNarration>
