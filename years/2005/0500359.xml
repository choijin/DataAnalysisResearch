    <AbstractNarration>The main objective of the investigator is the study of&lt;br/&gt;algebraic structures--a ring, an ideal or even a module--as they&lt;br/&gt;undergo smoothing processes. These transformations enable them to&lt;br/&gt;support new constructions, including analytic ones. In the case&lt;br/&gt;of algebras, divisors acquire a group structure, cohomology tends to slim down, and &lt;br/&gt;it is an essential step in the desingularization of singular&lt;br/&gt;varieties. There is an inherent interest in those processes that add to the&lt;br/&gt;structure the solutions of collections of equations of integral&lt;br/&gt;dependence. Finding these equations, determining the&lt;br/&gt;properties of the assemblage of solutions and understanding the&lt;br/&gt;complexity costs of these tasks, is a central region of &lt;br/&gt; research for commutative algebra. Bringing into this mix the numerical &lt;br/&gt; controls provided by multiplicity theory--broadly seen as the&lt;br/&gt; assignment of measures of size to an structure--make for a technically challenging and &lt;br/&gt;potentially very rewarding activity smack right where the field interacts&lt;br/&gt;mostly intensively with algebraic geometry and computational algebra. &lt;br/&gt;The investigator introduces an approach to the study of theoretical aspects of&lt;br/&gt; certain classes of algebraic structures from the perspective&lt;br/&gt; of complexity. As applications, the investigator seeks to predict how&lt;br/&gt; delicate techniques associated to smoothing processes will perform&lt;br/&gt; when applied to the solution of several problems of interest,&lt;br/&gt;and thereby suggest which mix of methods offer higher performance.&lt;br/&gt; They will also be employed to derive ordinary complexity counts for several&lt;br/&gt;of these problems without previously known classical counts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commutative algebra is foremost the study of sytems of polynomial &lt;br/&gt;equations, and of its generalizations. It has elucidated several&lt;br/&gt;structures that occur among such systems, particularly those tagged as&lt;br/&gt;of Cohen-Macaulay type. These encode incredible theoretical efficiencies in the&lt;br/&gt;derivation/prediction of its properties and offer superb computational&lt;br/&gt;economies. Often the full natural set of equations is not known at&lt;br/&gt;the outset so that methods and processes must be developed to find and analyze it.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is focused on one central process, that of smoothing transformation. &lt;br/&gt; It will develop methods, grounded on the Cohen-Macaulay case, to predict properties of&lt;br/&gt;the `closure', devise algorithms to find it and examine the limits of&lt;br/&gt;the behavior of arbitrary [even unknown] algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;The methods and results used in these developments will be used for&lt;br/&gt;interaction where the subject meets algebraic geometry, combinatorics, geometric modelling, number theory and robotics.</AbstractNarration>
