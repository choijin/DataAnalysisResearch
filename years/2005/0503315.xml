<AbstractNarration>Wie&lt;br/&gt;0503315&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this BME/RAPD/GOALI initiative program, the applicants will explore a new apatite/fibrous&lt;br/&gt;polymer composite featuring a Young's modulus matched to natural bone, sufficient mechanical&lt;br/&gt;strength to support reasonable loads during the healing process, excellent biocompatibility,&lt;br/&gt;capability of controlled release of drugs, good osteoconductivity and osteoinductivity to enhance&lt;br/&gt;both bone formation and ingrowth, appropriate degradation rate, and capability of being replaced&lt;br/&gt;by natural bone in a long-term. The specific objectives are:&lt;br/&gt;o To prepare bone-like carbonated hydroxyapatite (CHA)/ fibrous polymer composites with&lt;br/&gt;Young's modulus and mechanical strength matching that of cortical bone using novel&lt;br/&gt;polymer-braid constructions.&lt;br/&gt;o To obtain excellent biocompatibility and osteoconductivity of the composite by biomimetic&lt;br/&gt;formation of bone-like CHA on the surface of polymer fibers.&lt;br/&gt;o To explore the possibility of using the novel constructions proposed in the study as a more&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated drug delivery system.&lt;br/&gt;o To understand the interrelationship between the composite mechanical properties and the&lt;br/&gt;fiber composition, fiber surface modification, formation of trans-crystallinity, and CHA&lt;br/&gt;loading by conducting systematic experimental work and comparing the data with the&lt;br/&gt;predictions of theory.&lt;br/&gt;o To gain an in-depth knowledge of the effect of the composite composition, construction,&lt;br/&gt;and geometry on the bone formation rate on the composite using a series of cell culture&lt;br/&gt;assays.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over 10 million Americans are currently carrying at least one major implanted medical device in their body. Among these implants, those for repair of bone fracture and other damage constitute a large proportion, and play an essential role in more than 1.3 million bone-repair procedures per year in the USA. This large demand has led to a need for the development of new bone-repair materials. To address this need, polymer-based implants have attracted significant attention due to a more stable bone/implant interface during physiological loading. In addition, some polymers are biodegradable in vivo, and can be gradually replaced by living tissue, which is the best repair for defects. Unfortunately, polymers have relatively poor mechanical properties, which greatly restrict their usefulness in many applications. A second drawback arises because nearly all polymeric materials are bioinert, so they are consequently not osteoconductive, resulting in poor surface continuity.     In this BME/RAPD/GOALI initiative program, we explored a new apatite/fibrous polymer composite featuring a YoungÆs modulus matched to that of natural bone, sufficient mechanical strength to support reasonable loads during the healing process, excellent biocompatibility, capability of controlled release of drugs, good osteoconductivity and osteoinductivity to enhance both bone formation and ingrowth, appropriate degradation rate, and capability of being replaced by natural bone in a long-term.  To be successful, our research had been focusing on the development of an in-depth understanding of the interrelationship between the mechanical properties of the composite and the HA loading, HA orientation, polymer surface modification, HA/polymer bonding and composite processing conditions.     This project has also resulted in the training of a number of graduate and undergraduate students in areas of hydroxyapatite synthesis, polymer surface modification, HA/polymer bonding, composite processing and fabrication, biomimetic apatite coating, mechanical testing, drug delivery and in vitro cell culture.  In addition, we have filed two patents, published numerous referred journal papers and conference proceedings with the findings from this project. The results of this project were also presented at different occasions, such as national and international conferences, seminars to professionals and graduate, undergraduate and high school students and University Open Houses and demonstrations.
