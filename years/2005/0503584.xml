<AbstractNarration>Institution: Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) &lt;br/&gt;Title: Theoretical Physics &lt;br/&gt;Mentoring young researchers is the primary responsibility of the Natural Sciences faculty at the IAS. The research experiences that are provided for postdoctoral fellows in physics and astrophysics have a broad impact on education and research in the United States. &lt;br/&gt;Because of the high qualifications of the young researchers, the selection of research problems is left to the Post-doctoral fellows and their collaborators. The Faculty offer advice, suggestions, and occasional criticism. Post-docs colloborate among themselves, with faculty members at both the IAS and Princeton, as well as with people from their previous institutional affiliation. The strength of the IAS is in string theory and theoretical astrophysics and the resident staff are leaders in both fields. The research of the PI's on this proposal are at the cutting edge of string theory and neutrino astrophysics and will be continually changing during the 5 year period of this grant as new ideas emerge. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
