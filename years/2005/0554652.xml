<AbstractNarration>"Inquiry into Practice" is a five-year sequence of research on teacher professional development that is documenting how middle and secondary school science teachers first develop a perspective on science learning, translate that perspective into their own teaching practice and finally make explicit links to their colleagues.  The research is carried out in the tradition of design research in education that bridges theoretical research and educational practice.  Specifically, it is investigating the impact of professional development based on model-based reasoning, supported by Lesson Study and an apprentice-like program in teacher leadership.  The program consists of two cycles of professional development with selected teachers in California.  A cohort of 30 teachers begins the program in year one and a second cohort in year three.  Each cycle includes two summer institutes in which teachers learn to use scientific data to construct and apply explanatory models.  Each institute also includes modeling of effective pedagogical strategies and instruction in leadership skills.  Over the two years, the emphasis gradually changes from primarily instruction in scientific models to primarily instruction in leadership skills.  Each cycle also includes academic year support through Lesson Study groups.  Multiple measures are used including teacher content knowledge and facility with models instruments as well as classroom observations, interviews and analysis of teacher writings and lesson plans.  The key research questions of the project are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. What are teachers' understandings of critical science concepts and how do their understandings change when they approach science as a process of producing and testing models?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. What are teachers' conceptions of effective pedagogical practices in the science classroom and how do those perspectives change through their own experiences with a modeling approach?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. What roles do teachers currently play at their school sites and how does participation in the program affect their work with teachers at their school site and in other settings?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
