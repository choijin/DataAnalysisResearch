<AbstractNarration>The PIs are organizing the 47th Annual Maize Genetics Conference to be held in Lake Geneva, WI, March 10-13, 2005.  The meeting provides opportunities for members of the maize community to present and discuss recent research results.  The conference covers a wide range of topics, including classical genetics, molecular genetics, and genomics.  The Maize Genetics Conference provides an outstanding opportunity for graduate students to meet and interact with scientists in the field, to discuss their research ideas at talks or posters, and to begin to establish the scientific networks that will prove invaluable throughout their careers.  The conference also includes two workshops on the topics of 1) site-specific transformation systems and 2) methods for cloning maize genes.  To encourage student participation, the Conference defrays the cost of attendance for a number of graduate and undergraduate students.  Students are encouraged to give short talks at the meeting by submitting an abstract of a proposed talk to the organizing committee.  The funding provided by NSF will be used to support the participation of students from the U.S. scientific community.   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
