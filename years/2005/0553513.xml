<AbstractNarration>OISE 05-53513&lt;br/&gt;Sergiy Butenko&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This US-Ukraine project provides US undergraduate and graduate students opportunities to conduct research at the Glushkov Institute of Cybernetics in Kyiv, Ukraine.  The research activities are focused in the areas of discrete and nondifferentiable optimization and their applications. The principal investigators are Sergiy Butenko from the Texas Engineering Experiment Station and Ivan Sergienko from the Glushkov Institute of Cybernetics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US students spend three-week periods at the Glushkov Institute where they work in teams consisting of one US graduate student, one US undergraduate student, and one Ukrainian student.  The graduate students are assigned as team leaders and the Ukrainian senior researchers serve as mentors.  Students are offered a variety of research project ideas to choose from.  They may also propose their own problems to work on.  The problems to be solved include some well-known ones, as well as novel combinatorial optimization problems that have numerous applications.  An example of a project topic offered is the analysis to connectivity properties of transportation networks and their role in developing effective emergency response strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project fulfills the program objectives of providing US students with a global perspective and opportunities for professional growth through international cooperative research training, networking and mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
