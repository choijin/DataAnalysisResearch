<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program: NSF 04-588 CISE Computing Research Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;Title:  CRI: Wireless Open-Access Research Platform (WARP) - A Scalable and Extensible Testbed for High Performance Wireless Systems&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CNS 0551692&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Sabharwal, Ashutosh&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Rice University&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators at Rice University will develop the Wireless Open-Access Research Platform (WARP) that promotes a holistic and rapid approach to wireless network design. WARP will be a scalable and extensible platform with three component layers: custom hardware with scalable processing and extensible I/O, platform support packages that provide seamless integration across different hardware components, and an application design environment. They will develop an open-access repository with WWW access that allows WARP users to construct wireless networks, share experiments over the Internet, and implement their networks on their own WARP hardware kits; lastly the investigators will develop a wireless development kit and make it available to other researchers and educators, conduct workshops on use of the WARP system, and host a student exchange program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
