<AbstractNarration>Many animal populations experience catastrophic population declines which are often caused by natural or human-induced changes in environmental conditions such as climate change or habitat alteration. In response to environment disasters, all vertebrate animals show a stress response that involves the secretion of the stress hormone (corticosterone/cortisol) into the blood. It is so far unclear whether and how a stress response helps individuals to survive, and whether a low or a high stress response is better. The main problem is that it is very hard to study dying animals in the wild. Here professors Wikelski and Romero make use of the fact that Galapagos marine iguanas repeatedly experience natural catastrophes (El Nino weather events) but at the same time are tame and can easily be observed as they die. The researchers will assess the stress response of individuals before a catastrophe and test what kind of a stress response helps individuals most to survive. This research will be put into the context of a 25-year data set that will be made public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study will significantly advance the understanding of how vertebrates physiologically deal with catastrophic events in their environment. This project will also educate the public via TV shows and publications, foster scientific exchange between Latin American and US researchers and provide advanced training for undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

These students are co-authors on many of the publications.  Finally, the project had a number of broader contributions.  The work on tameness has the potential to alter regulatory policies concerning island species and it attracted substantial media coverage.  There was also substantial media coverage of the work on stress and survival during El Nino.  Both projects were presented in major media outlets as well as numerous websites directed at the general public.  The results from these projects w...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
