<AbstractNarration>This NER proposal is based on our recent experimental observation of plasmon-induced magnetism of nanostructured metallic samples. Our magnetic force microscopy measurements indicated that magnetization of an array of nanoholes in a non-magnetic metallic film can be achieved by illumination of the structure at the wavelengths corresponding to various surface plasmon excitations. This second-order nonlinear optical effect appears to affect propagation of light through an array of such nanoholes in a gold film as observed by spectroscopic measurements in external magnetic field. This effect can find numerous applications in magnetooptical data storage and optical communication and computing. For example, optically controlled magnetization in nanoscale metallic samples may considerably increase the density of magnetic data recording. On the other hand, our observations suggest the possibility to control transmission of nanoholes at a single-photon level with an external magnetic field. This possibility is extremely attractive in quantum communication applications. Both developments would potentially revolutionize their respective fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have formed a multidisciplinary team of Principal Investigators composed of a solid-state physicist (Smolyaninova), an expert in scanning probe microscopy (Schaefer), and an optical scientist (Smolyaninov) to enhance our understanding of this new magneto-optical effect and to explore its potential applications in magneto-optical data storage and optical communications. We are planning to achieve good in-situ control of the shape of nanofabricated metal nanostructures and, hence, their spectral properties by implementing precise scanning probe microscopy-based nanoindentation techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is based on large number of new ideas and concepts in nanoscience and engineering, such as plasmon-induced magnetization of nanostructured metallic samples that has let to introduction of novel optically controlled nanoscale-size sources of magnetic field. These original concepts have been introduced very recently by the team of principal investigators. The proposed activity will advance understanding of two-dimensional nanooptics of surface plasmon-polaritons. At the same time, the results of this research may open new ways of magneto-optical data storage. The new imaging&lt;br/&gt;and fabrication techniques we have developed, and will further develop, will be useful, not only for this project, but also for other nanoscience projects in electrical and computer engineering, Physics, Materials, and Chemistry and Biochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad impact:&lt;br/&gt;This proposed research program will advance the state of the art in nanofabrication by application scanning-probe microscopy-based nanoindentation techniques. It will advance understanding of surface plasmon nanophotonics, which has become an essential tool in such diverse areas as optoelectronics, nanolithography, and biosensing. It will also advance education and training of undergraduate students in the areas of material science, magnetism, nanooptics, and Nanoscale science and technology. The P.I. and co-P.I.s of this proposed work have an outstanding record of involving undergraduate students in novel, publishable research projects. Undergraduates, including women and minority students, are involved with the work of the group every semester.   particular strength of the proposed work is its breadth in terms of the range of experimental techniques in which students will obtain training, including optical instrumentation design and construction, nanofabrication, microscopy (optical, scanning, and TEM), and electronics.  Students will also gain experience in theoretical modeling of nanostructures, including electromagnetic modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses the following research theme: Nanoscale Devices and System Architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
