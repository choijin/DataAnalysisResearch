    <AbstractNarration>This TPC Conference Proposal is a request for a follow-up to a successful exploratory grant which brought seven minority students who are excelling in the STEM disciplines and their teachers to a statewide undergraduate research two-day symposium. This proposal seeks to bring high school minority students and teachers together with university scientists engaged in STEM research. The participants will have the opportunity to interact with scientists who will serve in a mentoring role. The symposium will bring teachers and their minority high school students who are excelling in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines to a statewide symposium to hear and interact with university researchers who will be sharing cutting- edge research at the State's flagship university -- The University of Georgia. This interaction will provide high school teachers opportunities to update their knowledge of cutting-edge research in the STEM disciplines and become familiar with the opportunities their students can consider in the STEM disciplines. The students will also have the opportunity to shadow researchers and scientists at the symposium, in their laboratories and in their classes during the symposium and periodically throughout the year.</AbstractNarration>
