<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests continued support for a broad program of research by the PI and his Co-PI in important areas of particle physics and astrophysics. The particle physics proposed relates largely to the LHC and includes both possible alternatives to the Higgs mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and detailed calculations of experimental signatures for the Higgs; but it also includes work on the spectroscopy of heavy quarkonium systems. the astrophysics includes studies of dark energy using supernova and CMB data, and neutrino interactions in intense magnetic fields and other high energy astrophysical situations. Repko, the PI is an expert in the astrophysical studies and Schmidt on the Higgs physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include the close connection to experiments, and the training of students across a broad variety of subjects. They also include active participation by the PI in rebuilding the physics program at an undergraduate school, Marietta College. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
