<AbstractNarration>There is an increasing need for researchers in the biological sciences to address global problems, using data collected from around the world. As computing speeds and data&lt;br/&gt;storage capacities have increased and costs have dropped, technology has become less an obstacle to ready data sharing than are the ingrained habits of the scientific community. Changing these habits requires development of technological means, cultural inducements, and training opportunities that make biological data, information, and knowledge available to all potential users. Such systemic change is far more likely to be successful if professional societies and funding agencies work together, rather than&lt;br/&gt;acting alone. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve these goals, the Joint Working Group on Data Sharing and Archiving, representing the major professional societies that publish ecology, evolution, and organismal biology journals, was formed. The objectives of this project are to implement recommendations from the initial workshop of the group, including:&lt;br/&gt;(1) facilitate continuing communication among professional societies on data sharing and archiving issues via a dedicated web site and periodic e-mails,&lt;br/&gt;(2) widen participation in these activities by professional societies and international organizations,&lt;br/&gt;(3) support three workshops to (a) develop a strategy for creating data registries, which describe data sets and provide information on how to access them, (b) identify, and develop means to reduce or eliminate, cultural and other barriers to data sharing, and (c) develop a set of requirements and recommendations for data centers in ecology, evolution, and organismal biology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
