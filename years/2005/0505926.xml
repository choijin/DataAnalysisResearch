    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary, 2005 Epigenetics Gordon Research Conference &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of epigenetics concerns the enormously complex mechanisms by which &lt;br/&gt;genotype gives rise to phenotype. It pertains to every aspect of development in virtually &lt;br/&gt;all organisms and has been a good reminder that the essence of how genotype gives rise &lt;br/&gt;to phenotype does not, after all, reside completely in DNA. This proposal requests &lt;br/&gt;support for the sixth Gordon Research Conference on Epigenetics to be held at &lt;br/&gt;Holderness School, New Hampshire, August 7-12, 2005. Invited speakers are leading &lt;br/&gt;researchers working on prokaryotes, fungi, ciliates, plants, worms, insects, and mammals, &lt;br/&gt;and their presentations will cover some of the most fascinating areas of science today, &lt;br/&gt;including molecular and cellular memory, cellular de-differentiation, DNA asymmetry, &lt;br/&gt;DNA methylation, RNA interference, parental imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, &lt;br/&gt;paramutation, ploidy, switching, environmental stress, genome defense systems, position &lt;br/&gt;effects, histone modifications, mammalian cloning, and stem cell development. Of &lt;br/&gt;particular interest are newly-recognized phenomena whose underlying mechanisms are &lt;br/&gt;currently mysterious. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2005 Gordon Research Conference on Epigenetics will provide a unique setting for &lt;br/&gt;researchers working on this broad spectrum of mechanisms and organisms to come &lt;br/&gt;together and exchange results and ideas. With a limited enrollment and ample time for &lt;br/&gt;formal and informal discussions, the cross-disciplinary environment of this conference &lt;br/&gt;will foster the innovative thinking and novel collaborations that are critical for the &lt;br/&gt;success of researchers in the field of epigenetics. Finally, as has always been the case &lt;br/&gt;with this series, the 2005 Conference will place a high priority on promoting the science &lt;br/&gt;and careers of young investigators and increasing the diversity of the scientific &lt;br/&gt;community.</AbstractNarration>
