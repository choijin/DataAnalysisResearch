<AbstractNarration>The research continues development of theoretical methodologies and calculations that explore ionizing collisions of electromagnetic radiation and charged particles with matter.&lt;br/&gt;The work stresses the need to account for many-body interactions which dominate many photoionization and photodetachment processes.  The study will also encompass the spectra of electrons ejected in many of these collisions and how that is crucial to understanding the deposition of energy by radiation in matter. Finally, the work will continue previous studies of the interaction of radiation with confined atoms and ions, e.g., confined in fullerenes or quantum dots.  Of great importance will be the realistic handling of the confining potential of systems such as C60. Particular emphasis shall be placed upon the how the details of the confinement alters the properties of free atoms and ions. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
