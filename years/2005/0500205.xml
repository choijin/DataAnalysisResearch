<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum unique ergodicity and rigidity in dynamical systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed lies at the interface of dynamical systems&lt;br/&gt;and several other mathematical disciplines, and in particular number&lt;br/&gt;theory and the theory of automorphic form. It is well&lt;br/&gt;known that the collections of invariant probability measures and closed&lt;br/&gt;invariant sets for hyperbolic maps or flows is very large; remarkably,&lt;br/&gt;in many dynamical systems of algebraic origin where there are two&lt;br/&gt;(or more) commuting hyperbolic maps or flows it is conjectured that&lt;br/&gt;there are actually very few measures or closed sets invariant under this&lt;br/&gt;bigger action. Substantial progress has been made in the study of such &lt;br/&gt;systems, which has yielded a proof of arithmetic quantum unique &lt;br/&gt;ergodicity of compact arithmetic surfaces, and has given a partial &lt;br/&gt;result towards Littlewood's Conjecture in diophantine approximation.&lt;br/&gt;The author&lt;br/&gt;proposes to build on his research on the various facets of this problem&lt;br/&gt;to further our understanding of this rigidity phenomenon, as well as&lt;br/&gt;to apply these techniques and methods and the methods developed&lt;br/&gt;by other authors towards potential applications in number theory and&lt;br/&gt;other subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In dynamical systems we study evolution of a mathematical system. &lt;br/&gt;Ergodic theory&lt;br/&gt;is a specific flavor of the theory of dynamical systems. The tools of &lt;br/&gt;ergodic theory applied to concrete algebraically defined dynamical &lt;br/&gt;systems can be used to prove theorems and conjectures in other seemingly &lt;br/&gt;unrelated fields, notably number theory. In our previous work we have &lt;br/&gt;shown how these tools can also be used effectively to study problems &lt;br/&gt;motivated by quantum mechanics, specifically the arithmetic&lt;br/&gt;case of the Quantum Unique Ergodicity Conjecture. The&lt;br/&gt;connections that have been found between these special dynamical systems &lt;br/&gt;and problems in number theory, mathematical physics, and automorphic &lt;br/&gt;forms (the study of the spectrum of certain fundamental arithmetic &lt;br/&gt;manifolds)&lt;br/&gt;suggests that this interdisciplinary approach is likely to have additional&lt;br/&gt;applications. In addition to the research itself, substantial effort &lt;br/&gt;will be given to human resources development, particularly at the &lt;br/&gt;graduate level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
