<AbstractNarration>Nonlinear transport equations model a variety of physical phenomena&lt;br/&gt;which often occur in real life. Examples of such phenomena are&lt;br/&gt;fluid mechanics, meteorology, reactive flows, multi-component flows, &lt;br/&gt;image processing, financial and biological modeling and others.&lt;br/&gt;Computing the solutions to these equations remains an important and &lt;br/&gt;challenging problem that requires development of fast, reliable and &lt;br/&gt;accurate numerical methods. At the same time, understanding &lt;br/&gt;the analytical properties of their solutions is not only useful &lt;br/&gt;for developing fast solvers, but remains imperative for real world&lt;br/&gt;applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the analytic side, we propose to utilize techniques from approximation &lt;br/&gt;theory and Harmonic Analysis to prove  analytical results for nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;equations and to use these techniques to develop numerical methods.&lt;br/&gt;The   techniques to be employed include Littlewood-Paley theory, wavelet &lt;br/&gt;decompositions, maximal functions, interpolation and K-functionals. &lt;br/&gt;Emphasis will be placed on the understanding the relation between micro- &lt;br/&gt;and macroscopic models for transport, where a main vehicle in moving from &lt;br/&gt;the micro to the macro level are averaging lemmas.&lt;br/&gt;On the numerical side, the project aims to  further develop the Godunov &lt;br/&gt;type central schemes for multidimensional systems of conservation &lt;br/&gt;laws and related problems. These schemes do not employ Riemann problem &lt;br/&gt;solvers and characteristic decomposition. Their high resolution and &lt;br/&gt;simplicity turns them into a universal tool for solving a wide range of &lt;br/&gt;problems. The application of these schemes to multi-phase and multi-fluid &lt;br/&gt;flow models, the Saint-Venant systems of shallow water equations, &lt;br/&gt;multi-layer shallow water systems, shallow water equations on a rotating&lt;br/&gt;sphere, granular material flows is another goal of the proposed &lt;br/&gt;research, which requires further development of central schemes and &lt;br/&gt;incorporation of various adaptive techniques into the central framework.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
