Improvements will include a new simulator architecture, new models for wireless networks, provide for software encapsulation, and integration of the tools with virtual network testbeds. The changes will enhance scalability, extensibility, and new application program interfaces that open the simulator to open source networking software. Emulation capability will be improved to allow integration with testbeds.Wireless modules will be rewritten to track advances in wireless networking. Educational scripts will be facilitated in the enhanced version. The Network Simulator is heavily used in research; these improvements will allow it to continue to be a leading resource for &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

As the name implies, the tool is a third-generation network simulation (ns) tool intended to replace the widely-used ns-2 tool that was developed in the late 1990s.  ns-3 was set up as an open-source software project, enabling the  contribution of a number of research organizations worldwide. In particular, close collaboration with the French research institute INRIA turned out to be integral to the project's rapid development.  ns-3 is a software tool that allows users to experiment with models of data communications networks such as the Internet or sensor networks.  ns-3 allows users to conduct network experiments  (such as evaluating how a new piece of networking software might  behave if actually deployed in the Internet) by testing models  of such software in a synthetic environment constructed by the simulator.
