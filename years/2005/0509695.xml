<AbstractNarration>The key objective of the project is to build a quantitative predictive capability &lt;br/&gt;for the focusing nonlinear electromagnetic waves. A standard mathematical model &lt;br/&gt;for describing this type of problems is the nonlinear Schroedinger equation (NLS). &lt;br/&gt;By now, this equation is relatively well studied. There are, however, indications &lt;br/&gt;that the NLS model may be oversimplified. An alternative is provided by a more &lt;br/&gt;comprehensive nonlinear Helmholtz equation (NLH), from which the NLS is, in fact, &lt;br/&gt;derived by employing the so-called paraxial approximation and neglecting the &lt;br/&gt;important phenomenon of backscattering. In contradistinction to the NLS, relatively &lt;br/&gt;little is known about the solvability of the NLH and uniqueness of its solutions.&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, this equation presents a considerable challenge for the numerical approach&lt;br/&gt;as well. Nonlinearity is a major hurdle, as it implies that the impinging and&lt;br/&gt;(back)scattered waves cannot be separated. Another key difficulty is the small &lt;br/&gt;magnitude of backscattering compared to that of the forward propagating wave.&lt;br/&gt;In the course of the project, the PI and his colleagues will develop, implement,&lt;br/&gt;and test an efficient numerical procedure for integrating the NLH. It will involve&lt;br/&gt;major modifications and improvements to the previously proposed methodology that&lt;br/&gt;has already proven successful and, in fact, unparalled in the literature. The &lt;br/&gt;methodology employs a high-order finite-difference approximation. Its central &lt;br/&gt;element is a special two-way nonlocal artificial boundary condition that makes the &lt;br/&gt;outer boundary transparent for all the outgoing waves and at the same time is capable &lt;br/&gt;of accurately prescribing the given impinging signal. It is expected that with the &lt;br/&gt;help of this methodology, a valuable new insight will be gained into a number of key &lt;br/&gt;outstanding questions in nonlinear optics, in particular, whether the nonparaxiality &lt;br/&gt;and backscattering may arrest the collapse (blow-up) of focusing nonlinear waves, and &lt;br/&gt;whether the NLH is capable of sustaining the so-called narrow spatial solitons, with &lt;br/&gt;the width on the order of only several wavelengths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the course of the project, a numerical methodology will be built to simulate the&lt;br/&gt;propagation of intense laser light through a variety of media and materials. This &lt;br/&gt;methodology has a solid mathematical foundation, and is expected to help address&lt;br/&gt;a number of challenging issues in the theoretical nonlinear optics. In addition&lt;br/&gt;to its potential theoretical merits, the methodology will be useful from the &lt;br/&gt;standpoint of applications as well. Indeed, the propagation of laser beams in &lt;br/&gt;materials is typically accompanied by the phenomena of nonlinear self-focusing and &lt;br/&gt;backscattering. The capability to quantitatively analyze and predict these key &lt;br/&gt;phenomena is extremely important for many of applications in modern science and &lt;br/&gt;engineering. The latter range from remote atmosphere sensing (when an earth-based &lt;br/&gt;powerful laser sends pulses to the sky, and backscattered radiation accounts for a &lt;br/&gt;substantial part of the detected signal), to laser surgery (propagation of laser beams &lt;br/&gt;in tissues), to transmitting information along optical fibers. There are other possible &lt;br/&gt;applications that involve, e.g., interactions between the co-propagating or counter-&lt;br/&gt;propagating laser beams. They may provide a vehicle for designing the so-called all-&lt;br/&gt;optical switches for the next generation of opto-electronic circuits. The proposed &lt;br/&gt;numerical methodology will yield a powerful tool for the accurate and robust analysis &lt;br/&gt;of the foregoing applications, along with many others.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
