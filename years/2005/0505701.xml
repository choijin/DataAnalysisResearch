<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0505701&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  C. Robin Graham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will carry out several research projects&lt;br/&gt;studying various aspects of conformal geometry and asymptotically&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic metrics.  These include analyzing a&lt;br/&gt;Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for Poincare-Einstein metrics, studying&lt;br/&gt;the boundary rigidity problem for asymptotically hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;metrics, and developing the theory of the ambient metric in even&lt;br/&gt;dimensions beyond the obstruction.  The main objectives are to&lt;br/&gt;further understanding of these geometries and their relationship.&lt;br/&gt;The methods are analytic, geometric, and algebraic, with an&lt;br/&gt;intimate connection between these different aspects of the study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study the relationship between different&lt;br/&gt;geometric structures: conformal geometry on the one hand and&lt;br/&gt;asymptotically hyperbolic geometry on the other.  Conformal&lt;br/&gt;geometry is the study of properties of space which depend only on&lt;br/&gt;angles but not on distances.  Hyperbolic geometry involves spaces&lt;br/&gt;of negative curvature, in which the analogues of straight lines&lt;br/&gt;separate more than in usual flat space.  Several projects will&lt;br/&gt;study the relationship between these geometries.  Apart from the&lt;br/&gt;intrinsic geometric interest, one motivation is the AdS/CFT&lt;br/&gt;correspondence in Physics, a proposed holographic correspondence&lt;br/&gt;for certain physical phenomena.  The proposed activity will&lt;br/&gt;further enable the development of human resources through&lt;br/&gt;educationally oriented activities of the investigator, including&lt;br/&gt;advising, mentoring and teaching graduate students, and&lt;br/&gt;curricular development.  International cooperation and&lt;br/&gt;partnership will be promoted.  Ties between the mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;physics communities will be enhanced.  The results will be&lt;br/&gt;effectively disseminated through attendance and speaking at&lt;br/&gt;meetings and conferences and through posting and publication of&lt;br/&gt;articles.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
