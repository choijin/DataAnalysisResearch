<AbstractNarration>This award will provide a cluster of equipment to strengthen a newly established Biogeochemistry Core Facility (BCF).  The equipment cluster consists of four pieces of core equipment and two supporting instrumentats. Of the four core pieces of equipment, the nutrient analyzer will be used for high throughput nutrient sampling of water samples; the in-situ multiprobe will perform real-time simultaneous analysis of nutrients, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll and pH in aquatic ecosystems; the multi-channel O2 / CO2 respirometer will be used for mechanistic biogeochemcial studies, and the microbial assay system will be used for investigating microbial community dynamics. In addition, the two climate-controlled incubators will be used with the respirometer; and the two computers are for dedicated and integrated use with the respirometer and the multiprobe instrument. While nutrient analyzer and multiprobe help monitor and document changes in nutrient concentrations in aquatic ecosystems, the respirometer and the microbial assay system will provide insights into the biogeochemical processes that regulate nutrient concentrations in these ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These instruments will be used immediately in an interdisciplinary project that seeks to address the impacts of multiple stressors on the ecology of the Cheyenne River. The legacy of historical gold mining activities in the Black Hills, increasing population densities in the Black Hills regions, as well as the developing coal bed methane (CBM) mining activities, have adversely impacted the water quality, resource availability, and ecology of the Cheyenne River. This award will facilitate multidisciplinary studies on water quality and biogeochemistry that integrate ecosystem science and natural resource management. Beyond immediate use in the Cheyenne River project, the equipment cluster will strengthen other research activities of individual investigators and strengthen the possibilities for collaborative work on water quality, ecosystem nutrient dynamics and bioenergetics, climate change research, bioremediation, and natural resource management. A well-equipped BCF is a strategic component in the development of the proposed Center for the Integration of Research in Climate, Land use, Engineering, and Education into Society (CIRCLE2S) at SDSM&amp;T, and it also matches the strategic objectives of the Tribal Science Council. A strong research facility is at the core of collaborations among SDSM&amp;T, regional undergraduate institutions such as the Black Hills State University, Oglala Lakota College and Sinte Gleska University. The requested facilities will significantly enhance education, research-training and new curriculum development. This acquisition will strengthen the role of BCF as a regional resource. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will: 1) enhance the technical facilities to allow the faculty in the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences, Departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Geology and Geological Engineering, and Chemistry, to perform cutting-edge ecological and environmental research, 2) provide opportunities to train and educate undergraduate and graduate students in terrestrial and aquatic biogeochemistry and ecology, and to 3) further strengthen research and education partnership between SDSM&amp;T and regional undergraduate institutions including two Tribal Colleges, through research that provides opportunities for hands on field and laboratory training for students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
