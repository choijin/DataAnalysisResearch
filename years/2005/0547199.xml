<AbstractNarration>CAREER: Cooperative Control Under Communication Constraints&lt;br/&gt;Summary Statement&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The fields of cooperative and networked control are on the verge of a technological&lt;br/&gt;revolution. Emerging applications in national security, transportation, communication, and&lt;br/&gt;commerce require distributed networks to be capable of multi-user communication, collaborative&lt;br/&gt;signal and information processing, sensor fusion of multi-modal data, and, distributed computation,&lt;br/&gt;actuation, and control.&lt;br/&gt;These information rich applications place specific demands upon networks: the networks must&lt;br/&gt;scale gracefully to a large numbers of agents; the agents may be geographically distributed, often&lt;br/&gt;requiring communication over noisy, bandwidth-limited channels; the networks may consist of heterogeneous&lt;br/&gt;components, including embedded systems with limited computational power; and, the&lt;br/&gt;networks architecture may be decentralized, requiring local coordination amongst the agents.&lt;br/&gt;There has been quite a bit of recent activity in exploring graph-based, multi-agent cooperative&lt;br/&gt;control. In this proposal the PI will examine how the addition of realistic communication channels,&lt;br/&gt;with noise and delay, can effect the cooperative control performance. For noisy channel situations&lt;br/&gt;it is no longer reasonable to assume that each agent has perfect knowledge of its neighbors states.&lt;br/&gt;We will examine the question of local versus global knowledge. This project will build on the PIs&lt;br/&gt;extensive research on control with communication constraints, graphical models, and information&lt;br/&gt;theory. In systems with large numbers of weakly coupled agents statistical mechanics tools, like&lt;br/&gt;mean-field approximation, can be used to determine the qualitative behavior of the system. If&lt;br/&gt;there is stronger coupling between agents then there is the possibility of multiple phases in these&lt;br/&gt;engineered systems.&lt;br/&gt;Our main objectives in carrying out this research are: (1) Fundamental limits and tradeoffs.&lt;br/&gt;This aspect of the project considers the qualitative scaling behavior of large cooperative control&lt;br/&gt;systems. In addition, the PI will consider the fundamental limits and tradeoeffs between the quality&lt;br/&gt;of the communication and the resulting control performance. (2)Algorithm development. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will develop reinforcement learning techniques for solving large factored Markov&lt;br/&gt;decision problems. (3) Educational development.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: In order to develop a useful theory that can explain the advancements in&lt;br/&gt;cooperative control one needs to view communication and control as two sides of a coin. On the&lt;br/&gt;one hand Shannon theory tell us what can be communicated and on the other hand control theory&lt;br/&gt;theory tell us what should be communicated. Tools from information theory, graphical models,&lt;br/&gt;probability theory, and statistical mechanics will be used to develop a formal framework for treating&lt;br/&gt;stochastic cooperative control problems. This framework will allow us to realistically model the&lt;br/&gt;communication between agents and allow us to understand the interaction between information&lt;br/&gt;and control.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research project blends tools from many disciplines. The PI plans to encourage&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates, graduate students, and practicing engineers to contribute to this interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;research program. Course curriculum, talks, and projects will be designed to encourage this participation.&lt;br/&gt;To promote a unified view of the theory and algorithms under development and to provide a&lt;br/&gt;testbed for the evaluation of ideas we will focus on the following driving applications: distributed&lt;br/&gt;estimation and actuation in sensor networks, distributed optimization, multi-agent decision making,&lt;br/&gt;message-passing algorithms, and multi-user information theory. Undergraduate and graduate&lt;br/&gt;students will be called on to perform various experiments and simulations to validate the algorithms.</AbstractNarration>
