<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research undertaken by Jay Jorgenson involves collaboration with &lt;br/&gt;numerous co-authors on a range of questions in analysis which are &lt;br/&gt;motivated by questions from number theory, such as L-functions, &lt;br/&gt;automorphic forms and trace formulae.  The work with Jurg Kramer &lt;br/&gt;focuses on questions which arise in certain aspects of Arakelov theory, &lt;br/&gt;and extends into the study of theta functions, automorphic forms, and &lt;br/&gt;Selberg's zeta function.  With Cormac O'Sullivan, Jorgenson is developing &lt;br/&gt;the theory of higher order modular forms which to date has produced &lt;br/&gt;analogues of Kronecker's limit formula and Dedekind sums.  The research &lt;br/&gt;with Serge Lang involves zeta function constructions for general symmetric &lt;br/&gt;spaces, beginning with SL(n,C).  Certain methods of proof are common to &lt;br/&gt;all investigations, such as techniques from analytic number theory, algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geometry and heat kernel analysis, which provides for an interesting mixture &lt;br/&gt;of ideas and consolidation of results.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical gadget known as the heat kernel appears in many diverse &lt;br/&gt;areas of mathematics research, either explicitly or implicitly, and one aspect &lt;br/&gt;of Jay Jorgenson's research activities is the investigation of the many &lt;br/&gt;manifestations of the heat kernel.  In the mathematics of finance, the classical &lt;br/&gt;heat kernel in one dimension can be used to describe the Black-Scholes-Merton &lt;br/&gt;formula, which is used to price certain stock options.  In number theory, the &lt;br/&gt;heat kernel is used to construct many basic objects of study, such as theta and &lt;br/&gt;zeta functions.  In geometry, analysis and probability, the heat kernel is both an &lt;br/&gt;object of primary study as well as a tool to understand specific questions of &lt;br/&gt;research interest.  By studying the many realizations of heat kernels and heat &lt;br/&gt;kernel techniques, Jay Jorgenson is able to utilize proven techniques in one field &lt;br/&gt;of mathematics and develop ideas in another discipline.  In addition, this method &lt;br/&gt;of study has proven useful in providing students, both undergraduate and graduate, &lt;br/&gt;with new ways in which they have access to certain areas of mathematical &lt;br/&gt;research.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
