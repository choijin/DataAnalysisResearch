<AbstractNarration>The goals of The North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) are to: (1) develop and make openly available, multiple high resolution regional climate change scenarios for use in impacts and risk assessments; (2) evaluate regional model performance over North America by nesting the Regional Climate Models (RCM) in coarser spatial scale reanalyzed data products; (3) understand critical regional climate change issues, such as the effects of increased greenhouse gases on the frequency of various types for extreme weather events; (4) enhance understanding of key issues in regional climate modeling, including methodological approaches; (5) conduct a limited examination of uncertainties in regional model and global climate model (GCM) future regional projections; (6) create greater collaboration between US, Canadian, and European climate modeling groups to leverage the diverse modeling capability across the countries; and (7) coordinate with and derive added value from diverse regional and global modeling projects and programs currently underway in the US, Canada, Europe, and South America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the research include support for the climate impacts community to provide decision-relevant information for public policy, in part through a user-oriented data access, formatting and archival facility for output from the simulations. NARCCAP will contribute to a wide range of climate research by producing regional-scale projections of climate change. In doing so, the program will enhance the infrastructure for climate-change research by linking several North American and European institutions in a collaborative network for multi-model simulation, output analysis and data dissemination. The program's output will promote undergraduate and graduate research at the participating institutions and foster cross-disciplinary links across campuses and between institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborating PIs supported by NSF:&lt;br/&gt;Mearns, Linda O., National Center for Atmospheric Research (Lead)&lt;br/&gt;Sloan, Lisa C., University of California-Santa Cruz &lt;br/&gt;Gutowski, William J.
