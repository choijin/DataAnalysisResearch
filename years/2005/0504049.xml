<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this proposal is to study problems in Convex Geometry &lt;br/&gt;and Geometric Tomography using methods of Harmonic Analysis.  Geometric &lt;br/&gt;Tomography is the area of mathematics where one investigates properties &lt;br/&gt;of solids based on the information about sections and projections of &lt;br/&gt;these solids. It borrows ideas and methods from many fields of &lt;br/&gt;Theoretical Mathematics, such as integral and differential geometry, &lt;br/&gt;statistics, and Fourier analysis. But perhaps its biggest overlap is &lt;br/&gt;with Convex Geometry. A major component of this proposal is to study &lt;br/&gt;problems which arise naturally from the recent work of the PI on Fourier &lt;br/&gt;analytic approach to the case of the most general measure of sections of &lt;br/&gt;star bodies. This method provided a number of new links between harmonic &lt;br/&gt;analysis, probability theory and convex geometry.  PI intends to &lt;br/&gt;continue his work in this area and to consider a number of questions &lt;br/&gt;motivated by Slicing Problem and Isomorphic Busemann-Petty problem. PI &lt;br/&gt;also proposes a new approach to the study of the geometric properties of &lt;br/&gt;convex sets with respect to the Gaussian measure. As an application PI &lt;br/&gt;consider problems connected to the Gaussian Correlation Conjecture. The &lt;br/&gt;idea, of this method, is to restate the conjecture in the language of &lt;br/&gt;Geometric Tomography and to apply recently developed Fourier Analytic &lt;br/&gt;techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Geometric Tomography has a lot of real life applications. It has goals &lt;br/&gt;similar to those of many related and often practical areas. One of the &lt;br/&gt;best known examples is Classical Computer Aided Tomography, which aims &lt;br/&gt;to reconstruct the density of objects by means of their line integrals. &lt;br/&gt;Other examples are crystallography, robotics, stereology, and electron &lt;br/&gt;microscopy. One of the ideas of this proposal is to connect theoretical &lt;br/&gt;results from Convex Geometry to those practical areas via Geometric &lt;br/&gt;Tomography.  Another component of the broader impact of proposed &lt;br/&gt;research lies in the training of graduate and undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;Indeed, a lot of problems addressed in this proposal stated in such a &lt;br/&gt;way that they are intuitively clear not only to graduate but to &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students. On the other hand, the answers for many of those &lt;br/&gt;problems are quite counterintuitive which stimulates an interest of &lt;br/&gt;students to the subject and Mathematics in general!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
