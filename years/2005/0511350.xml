<AbstractNarration>Engineering-Engineering Technology (58) &lt;br/&gt;The project is developing laboratory activities for a senior course in power electronics by adapting labs developed at the University of Minnesota. Modifications to the University of Minnesota Model include placing special emphasis on design aspects of power electronics by including PSpice simulation in pre-labs. State-of-the-art Digital Signaling Processing-based (DSP) software is being reconfigured to control power electronic converters. New laboratories that are being developed include: 1) Introduction to DSP Controller and Inverter; 2) AC to DC converter that includes analysis of input current harmonic and output voltage ripple in diode rectifier circuits with PSpice simulation, and basic operation of a single phase voltage sources PWM inverter using DSP control; and 3) Motor control application using the DSP controller.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A goal is to revitalize interest in the area of Electric Power and Power Electronics and help address the low student enrollment crisis in the rapidly developing multidisciplinary field of Power Electronics. The leadership team is assessing the impact that the laboratories have on learning for underrepresented populations of students. The project is being supported by Texas Instruments Inc. Dissemination is through a website, workshops and conferences. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
