<AbstractNarration>Name: Richard E. Barvainis&lt;br/&gt;Date: 11/16/2005 11:12 AM&lt;br/&gt;Keyword: Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Note:&lt;br/&gt;The Caltech Submillimeter Observatory employs a precision 10.4-meter-diameter&lt;br/&gt;telescope operating within a dome to observe the sky at submillimeter wavelengths.&lt;br/&gt;This award will continue funding for the next three years for observatory operations,&lt;br/&gt;staff and student support, and for instrumentation development. Areas of research will&lt;br/&gt;include studies of molecular gas and dust in distant primeval galaxies, large-scale&lt;br/&gt;imaging of star-forming clouds using powerful new bolometer cameras, and&lt;br/&gt;observations of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect on the cosmic microwave background.&lt;br/&gt;Instrumentation will be developed to increase overall system sensitivity and mapping&lt;br/&gt;speed. The CSO trains many undergraduate students, graduate students and&lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral fellows, in both observational science and instrumentation development. A&lt;br/&gt;considerable fraction of telescope time is allocated to students, both at Caltech and at&lt;br/&gt;other institutions; overall, more than 50% of telescope usage is by astronomers from&lt;br/&gt;outside of Caltech. The CSO is noteworthy for its pioneering research in astronomical&lt;br/&gt;receiver technology, which is used at many other observatories both national and&lt;br/&gt;worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;Diary Note&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:0540882 PI Name:Phillips, Thomas G.&lt;br/&gt;Printed from eJacket: 11/16/05 Page 1 of 1</AbstractNarration>
