    <AbstractNarration>The Gordon Conference on&lt;br/&gt;Thin Film and Small-Scale Mechanical Behavior&lt;br/&gt;July 30-August 4, 2006&lt;br/&gt;Colby College, Waterville, Maine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The study of small-scale mechanical behavior is at the forefront of research in materials science and applied mechanics, and offers a visible link between basic research and technological applications. The research focuses on structures of complex architectures, many materials, and small features. When the feature size of a structure is small compared to some natural length scale, material properties differ significantly from their bulk counterparts. The impetus for basic research comes from the need to understand deformation and fracture in small structures used in current and emerging technologies, including interconnects on semiconductor chips, thermal barriers in gas turbines, and organic/inorganic hybrids for flexible displays and photovoltaic membranes. In addition, forces and movements in biomolecules, cells and tissues offer enticing opportunities to researchers in materials science and applied mechanics, who can investigate these phenomena with methods that have not previously been exploited by biologists. The program of the conference will be posted before February 2006 at http://www.grc.org/programs/2006/thinfilm.htm.</AbstractNarration>
