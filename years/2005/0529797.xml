<AbstractNarration>Considerable progress has been made in evaluating the present generation of global models and reanalyses, but there are still deficiencies in their physical parameterizations, particularly in the modeling of energy and water transports at the land surface, and in the coupling of the surface and boundary layer to clouds and precipitation.  This research advances the understanding of the interactions between the land surface fluxes of energy, water and carbon dioxide with clouds and precipitation, in support of global analysis and modeling of the earth's land-atmosphere system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The PI will (1) analyze flux tower datasets, examine their use for evaluating the representation of physical processes in global models, and evaluate global reanalyses on river basin scales, and (2) develop idealized models for the atmospheric boundary layer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The research will improve medium-range and seasonal weather forecasting, and quantify the component of the surface CO2 budget associated with natural vegetation.</AbstractNarration>
