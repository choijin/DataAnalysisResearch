<AbstractNarration>Harnessing the tools, techniques, and technologies of computational science to provide context-rich computing and collaboration experiences, Pathways to CyberInfrastructure is a partnership of Shodor with North Carolina Central University, the Durham Public Schools, and Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society. New pathways to learning and working with cyberinfrastructure are opened for students and their teachers. Workshops, apprenticeships, and internships replicate and adapt Shodor's proven approach combining hands-on exploration and interactive simulations to attract longstanding underrepresented groups into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) studies and careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists engaged in current research and application of CI technologies help spark excitement about science and technology by providing grid-mediated CybAdventures showcasing their work.  Students then gain experience in using CI technologies such as simulations, scientific visualizations of complex datasets, cluster and grid computing, distributed databases, and collaborative tools such as AccessGrid. In-service and pre-service teachers trained through the National Computational Science Institute (NCSI) guide activities in pattern recognition and characterization. Scientists from Sigma Xi and student and teacher participants who demonstrate the capacity for real expertise serve as mentors for others who are just beginning on these pathways.  In addition, the Sigma Xi Committee on Education oversees the evaluation of the project, providing an additional mechanism for disseminating the results through the chapters of the society. This approach extends the impact of CI to additional generations of learners. Curricula for student activities exploit Shodor's Computational Science Education Reference Desk (CSERD), a Pathway project of the National Science Digital Library (NSDL).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Explorations in computational science, math and engineering use the tools of cyberinfrastructure to explore the wonders of cyberinfrastructure.  Urban community centers transform into informal science education settings attracting individuals from longstanding underrepresented groups to consider studies and careers in science, math, engineering, and technology. Pathways to Cyberinfrastructure combines professional development for in-service and pre-service teachers using informal educational settings to master CI skills that can then be implemented to improve both formal and informal learning opportunities for all students.  Adapting a philosophy of rapid prototype, deployment, and iterative improvement, materials and activities for students and their teachers are tested in community centers and schools in one urban community the first year, and up to five additional cities in the second. Best practices are incorporated into pre-service education classes at NCCU, shared in the new virtual institutes of the Engaging People In CyberInfrastructure (EPIC) project, and disseminated through NCSI workshops. Improved computational science education materials are maintained in NSDL/CSERD.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
