<AbstractNarration>Many of the most important public policy questions facing our nation concern human judgment and decision making. For example, answers to questions concerning how to best communicate risks of terrorism, how to best encourage retirement savings, and how to best discourage unhealthy eating choices all revolve to a greater or lesser extent on understanding human judgment and decision making. It is important, therefore, to bring multi-disciplinary sciences to bear on this topic. In particular, the policy questions outlined above should simultaneously draw on at least social psychology, personality psychology, cognitive psychology, decision science, and economics. In order to foster increased attention to research synergies at this multifaceted juncture, this project's main activity will be a preconference on judgment and decision making preceding the 2006 annual meeting of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology. The preconference speakers, including Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman, will represent some of the most important research advances in judgment and decision making. They will include not only psychologists, but also economists, decision scientists, and neuroscientists.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested funds will be used primarily for two purposes. First, funds will provide scholarships to graduate students to facilitate their participation in the preconference. Second, funds will pay for equipment rentals related to speakers' presentations. This will allow the preconference to keep registration fees low, especially for graduate students. In addition to the intellectual advances inherent in bringing this group of researchers together, the broader impact of this project will be to increase the participation of talented students in the interdisciplinary topic of judgment and decision making. Because many of the questions studied in judgment and decision making have direct policy application, as described above, increased research in this area will contribute to an important knowledge base for the public good.</AbstractNarration>
