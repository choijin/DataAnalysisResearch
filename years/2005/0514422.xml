<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL EXPLANATION&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funds to continue the development of a novel analytical technique for&lt;br/&gt;characterizing the organization of anisotropic nanostructures (e.g. lamellae and cylinders)&lt;br/&gt;in optically transparent block copolymer thin films. Quantitative measurement of&lt;br/&gt;organization is critical for many proposed applications of nanotechnology, ranging from&lt;br/&gt;fuel cells to optoelectronic devices. GWDLS allows the low-cost, non-destructive, realtime&lt;br/&gt;measurement of order formation and defect density in optically transparent thin&lt;br/&gt;films. Among methods for thin-film characterization, GWDLS is unique in that it&lt;br/&gt;provides an average measure of defect density over macroscopic length scales (~1 cm) in&lt;br/&gt;a film. Position-space methods for studying defect structure, such as atomic force&lt;br/&gt;microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), can measure local defect&lt;br/&gt;structure, but are impractical for obtaining statistical averages over macroscopic regions.&lt;br/&gt;The GWDLS technique involves the coupling of a laser beam into a guided mode of a&lt;br/&gt;planar optical waveguide consisting of a block copolymer film deposited on a low&lt;br/&gt;refractive index substrate. Light coupled into a guided mode propagates through the film&lt;br/&gt;by total internal reflection. As the light interacts with anisotropic grains in the film, it&lt;br/&gt;generates depolarized scattered light which propagates in guided modes with orthogonal&lt;br/&gt;polarization. This scattered light is coupled out of the film and detected. In the proposed&lt;br/&gt;work, we will (1) Modify the current GWDLS apparatus to study the propagation of&lt;br/&gt;polarized light in a symmetric silica-polymer-silica sample environment using a grating&lt;br/&gt;coupler. (2) Develop a theoretical model for quantifying the relationship between the&lt;br/&gt;GWDLS signal and statistical properties of randomly oriented and partially oriented&lt;br/&gt;grains in thin films. (3) Use GWDLS to determine the order-disorder transition&lt;br/&gt;temperature of block copolymer thin films with both lamellar and cylindrical order. (4)&lt;br/&gt;Measure the kinetics of order formation in thin films after quenching from the disordered&lt;br/&gt;to the ordered state. (5) Obtain a quantitative measure of the average grain size by&lt;br/&gt;comparing the measured signal with theoretical predictions. All of the polymers and&lt;br/&gt;substrates required for the project will be prepared by the students. Complete&lt;br/&gt;characterization of the films using complementary techniques such as AFM, SEM, and&lt;br/&gt;SIMS will be carried out.                                                                                                                                        &lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION&lt;br/&gt;Balsara will serve as a faculty instructor in the Math and Science Summer Academy&lt;br/&gt;which brings approximately 60 students from local high schools to the University campus&lt;br/&gt;to participate in a six-week enrichment program in math and science. Typically half of&lt;br/&gt;the participants are African American, one quarter Chicano, and the remaining quarter&lt;br/&gt;Asian, Caucasian, Filipino and Latino. Garetz will continue his 7-year involvement with&lt;br/&gt;Polytechnic University's David Packard Center for Technology and Educational&lt;br/&gt;Alliances. His activities include conducting workshops at the New York City&lt;br/&gt;Science/Technology Forum where 500 students from New York City public schools&lt;br/&gt;come to Poly for a full-day program where they meet outstanding engineers and&lt;br/&gt;technologists representing centers of higher education, hospitals, and corporations. The&lt;br/&gt;graduate students working on this project will receive multidisciplinary scientific training&lt;br/&gt;encompassing synthesis and characterization of polymers, optics, lithography, and nonequilibrium&lt;br/&gt;thermodynamics. Their background in characterization and manipulating&lt;br/&gt;nanostructured thin films is relevant for current and future technologies.</AbstractNarration>
