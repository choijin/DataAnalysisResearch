<AbstractNarration>DMS - 0532413&lt;br/&gt;NSF PROGRAM: Mathematical, Social, and Behavioral Sciences&lt;br/&gt;Institutions: Iowa State University&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigators and co-PIs:  Larsen, Michael D., Kang, Shin-Soo, and Lorentz, Frederick O.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Fractional Imputation for Missing data in Social Surveys&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missing data are a serious problem for practically all large-scale &lt;br/&gt;surveys and research projects in the behavioral, economic, health, &lt;br/&gt;and social sciences.  Analyzing only the complete cases reduces sample&lt;br/&gt; size, often introduces bias, and ignores information concerning &lt;br/&gt;relationships among variables.  Substituting single values for the &lt;br/&gt;missing observations produces a complete data set, but treating the &lt;br/&gt;completed data as if they all were real leads to an overstatement of &lt;br/&gt;precision and, potentially, unwarranted conclusions.  Multiple and &lt;br/&gt;fractional imputation are methods that replace each missing value &lt;br/&gt;not with one but with multiple, say five, plausible values. Results &lt;br/&gt;from separate analyses using the multiple completed data sets are &lt;br/&gt;combined according to theoretically derived rules.  Of concern is &lt;br/&gt;the performance of multiple imputation methods when sampling from &lt;br/&gt;a finite population and when sample sizes are moderate to small.  &lt;br/&gt;Recent theoretical work by Kim (2004) and Kim and Fuller (2004) &lt;br/&gt;ntroduced fractional imputation (FI) and elucidated a shortcoming &lt;br/&gt;of multiple imputation variance estimation.  A number of extensions &lt;br/&gt;to their work are feasible and expected to increase greatly the &lt;br/&gt;usability of FI by researchers in the behavioral and social sciences. &lt;br/&gt;Models for missing data can help reduce or eliminate bias and maintain&lt;br/&gt; statistical power by utilizing relationships among variables.  &lt;br/&gt;FI provides a way for researchers to calculate valid standard errors&lt;br/&gt; and resulting confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.  In order&lt;br/&gt; for researchers in the behavioral and social sciences to use FI to &lt;br/&gt;its full advantage, development of FI for categorical data, mixed &lt;br/&gt;continuous and categorical data, and general missing data patterns&lt;br/&gt; is needed.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missing data are a serious problem for many research studies in the &lt;br/&gt;behavioral, economic, and social sciences.  When respondents do not&lt;br/&gt; provide the desired data, subsequent analyses can be biased and &lt;br/&gt;less precise.  Frequently researchers simply ignore the fact that&lt;br/&gt; some observations are missing and report results based on those &lt;br/&gt;that are observed.  Although expedient, this is not a recommended &lt;br/&gt;procedure.  In the Family Transitions Study, imputation for missing&lt;br/&gt; responses from men and women have been very important for maintaining&lt;br/&gt; sample size and statistical power.  Another common response to &lt;br/&gt;missing data is to impute or fill-in the empty space with a &lt;br/&gt;substitute value.  Values can be donated from observed similar &lt;br/&gt;individuals, predicted through a model, or handled implicitly &lt;br/&gt;through nonresponse weighting.  These methods, if implemented &lt;br/&gt;appropriately with adequate data, can reduce bias.  Unfortunately,&lt;br/&gt; single imputations if treated as real can lead to understatements&lt;br/&gt; of uncertainty.  Multiple and fractional imputation methods have &lt;br/&gt;been developed to reflect uncertainty due to missing information &lt;br/&gt;and aim to allow researchers to both correct for bias due to missing &lt;br/&gt;information and reach valid conclusions based on the observed data. &lt;br/&gt; The development of theory, methods, and procedures for fractional &lt;br/&gt;imputation of missing values will greatly enhance the applicability&lt;br/&gt; of fractional imputation to problems in economic, behavioral, and &lt;br/&gt;social sciences.  Study of missing data, its causes and effects and&lt;br/&gt; possible remedies, is critical for the maintenance of the high &lt;br/&gt;quality of the Family Transitions Project study and for long-term&lt;br/&gt; research studies at the Mayo clinic. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
