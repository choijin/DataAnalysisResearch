<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0542162&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Richard B. Melrose, Victor Guillemin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to support U.S. participants in a program in&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations to be held in summer 2006, in&lt;br/&gt;Cambridge, England at the Newton Institute. The focus of the&lt;br/&gt;program is spectral theory: in particular, lowest eigenvalue&lt;br/&gt;estimates, Weyl asymptotics, trace formulae, scattering phenomena&lt;br/&gt;and properties of periodic Schroedinger operators. These are all&lt;br/&gt;very active areas of research. Moreover, there are celebrated&lt;br/&gt;problems in these areas which have proved intractible for decades&lt;br/&gt;(such as the "hot spot" conjecture of Rauch or the spectral gap&lt;br/&gt;conjecture of Bethe-Sommerfeld) which seem, in light of recent&lt;br/&gt;developments, be on the verge of being settled, and for which the&lt;br/&gt;underlying phenomena have recently become much better&lt;br/&gt;understood. Hence this program is occurring at a very exciting&lt;br/&gt;time for researchers in these areas, and we should have a lot to&lt;br/&gt;learn from each other next summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spectrum of an object is the set of its natural frequencies&lt;br/&gt;of vibration. These include the spectral lines in the light&lt;br/&gt;emitted (or absorbed) by molecules. In many situations the&lt;br/&gt;frequencies arise as the set of values of a parameter for which a&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equation has a non-trivial solution. The&lt;br/&gt;most important mathematical questions concern the dependence of&lt;br/&gt;these frequencies on the geometric attributes of the object and&lt;br/&gt;the degree to which information about the object can be recovered&lt;br/&gt;from the frequencies. Several of the world's leading analysts&lt;br/&gt;will participate in this program, and it is important opportunity&lt;br/&gt;for younger researchers, to gain direct access to the general&lt;br/&gt;subject. The future prospects of research in this branch of&lt;br/&gt;analysis, which is vitally important for applications to physics,&lt;br/&gt;chemistry and the other sciences, depend very much on the influx&lt;br/&gt;of persons in their twenties and thirties, and summer programs of&lt;br/&gt;this type provide the opportunity to learn first hand about&lt;br/&gt;developments that are still on the drawing boards, not accessible&lt;br/&gt;in books and journals. More information on the program is&lt;br/&gt;available at&lt;br/&gt;http://www.newton.cam.ac.uk/programmes/STP/index.html.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
