<AbstractNarration>A new paradigm for voltage and frequency control in power grids is proposed. In the conventional sense, frequency regulation in power systems is obtained mainly by use of governor response of synchronous generators. This work develops new methodologies to take advantage of several new technologies in order to prevent cascading outages. These technologies include the use of a novel power electronics interface associated with distributed energy resources (DER), such as, wind power, as well as superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) to optimize DER response. The research will address with coordinating the location and operation of the DER with the SMES unit(s) coupled with controlled separation, if necessary, to maintain frequency balance and stable voltage profile in the system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Market forces, such as deregulation and competition continue to push the margins of stability and reliability, and, even though enabling technologies, such as power electronics and storage are well understood, their deployment in power networks has not reached the level required to produce an impact. This research will optimize the impact of distributed generation and storage so that new technology concepts as well their integration will move forward in unison. Broader Impacts: This work seeks to improve the reliability of electric energy supply which has a direct benefit to society in terms of minimizing the cost of power outages. The study also lays the foundation of a framework for an updated power engineering curriculum for educating future engineers who understand the value of non-conventional generation and storage. The PI will organize a workshop for the local PES chapter so that practicing engineers can benefit from research outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
