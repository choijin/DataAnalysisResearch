<AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The main goal of the project is to find the conditions on an&lt;br/&gt;algebraic variety that guarantee good estimates for analytic functions&lt;br/&gt;on the variety in terms of their values at real points.  Particularly,&lt;br/&gt;it is concerned with estimates analogous to those of the&lt;br/&gt;Phragmen-Lindelof theorem which gives uniform upper bounds for&lt;br/&gt;pluri-subharmonic functions that are bounded above at the real points&lt;br/&gt;of the complex Euclidean space and satisfy an asymptotic linear growth&lt;br/&gt;rate.  A new geometric condition, that the variety is nearly&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic, is proposed to characterize such properties.  The new&lt;br/&gt;condition gives a precise sense in which the variety has many real&lt;br/&gt;points, and is intermediate in strength between having a full&lt;br/&gt;dimensional set of real points and admitting a projection map with&lt;br/&gt;real fibers over real points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The project aims to determine the geometric properties of&lt;br/&gt;algebraic and analytic varieties in Euclidean space that determine&lt;br/&gt;when the analytic functions on the variety have properties similar to&lt;br/&gt;those of entire functions on Euclidean space.  It is motivated by&lt;br/&gt;connections with the properties of solution operators for systems of&lt;br/&gt;constant coefficient partial differential operators and convolution&lt;br/&gt;operators on global smooth functions.  The goal is to give algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for deciding whether or not specific operators admit solutions and&lt;br/&gt;solution operators on spaces of infinitely differentiable functions&lt;br/&gt;and distributions.  The study uses methods from and contributes new&lt;br/&gt;results to pluri-potential theory, the area whose relationship to&lt;br/&gt;analytic functions of several complex variables is the analogue of the&lt;br/&gt;relationship of classical potential theory to the theory of analytic&lt;br/&gt;functions of one complex variable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
