<AbstractNarration>This is a proposal to test whether mentoring middle school science and math teachers by University Ph.D. STEM faculty has a positive effect on the teachers' understanding of science, their teaching ability and the learning outcomes of their students.  This proposal will investigate the impact of content mentoring by University professionals on middle school science and mathematics teachers' knowledge, skills, dispositions and overall ability to effectively facilitate student learning and achievement.  The goal of this research study is to strengthen the theoretical underpinning of best practices in middle grades math and science teaching and to enhance the knowledge base for teacher recruitment, preparation, induction and retention</AbstractNarration>
