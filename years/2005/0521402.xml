<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to North Dakota State University (NDSU) under the direction of Dr. Shahryar Kianian for partial support of a central high-throughput genetic analysis facility at NDSU.  The advent of new tools and associated technologies in modern genetics/genomics has provided an exciting opportunity to integrate genetic findings and detection of minute DNA molecules to all aspects of plant genetics on a high-throughput scale.  This facility will form a powerful investigative high-throughput research tool, and enhance the capability of NDSU researchers to understand the molecular genetic basis of these problems and address them in a timely manner.&lt;br/&gt;Development of the NDSU high-throughput genetic analysis facility will allow researchers to screen large reverse genetic collections for identification and characterization of mutations in genes, develop high-resolution maps of chromosomes and or chromosomal regions for physical mapping and gene cloning, conduct genetic testing and selection in large populations for characterization of gene action in different genetic backgrounds and environmental stresses, apply association mapping techniques to gene discovery, analyze plant pathogens in the environment or as they interact with their hosts, and detect bio-contaminants in food samples and their impact on human health and nutrition. NDSU researchers are committed to incorporating the methodologies involved and data generated into the training and education of students at all levels, providing them with access to state-of-the-art science and skills needed to successfully compete in the job market.  &lt;br/&gt;The equipment will impact a very large group of projects from more than seven departments across the NDSU campus alone.  Through numerous collaborations this equipment can potentially impact a large number of projects in smaller regional universities and colleges as well. NDSU faculty and extension services help train and educate a large group of traditional and non-traditional students including high school students and teachers, undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral scientists, tribal college students, crop consultants, growers, and members of various crop improvement associations. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
