<AbstractNarration>0509853&lt;br/&gt;Toran&lt;br/&gt;Groundwater-surface water interactions are an emerging area of research. There&lt;br/&gt;is a critical need to determine water budgets, to track contaminants moving across the&lt;br/&gt;interface (in either direction), and to understand the influence of groundwater discharge&lt;br/&gt;on surface water habitats. But obstacles remain to making the necessary measurements.&lt;br/&gt;Flux estimates made using mass balance calculations and models do not provide locations&lt;br/&gt;of groundwater discharge and recharge. Point measurements made using seepage meters&lt;br/&gt;or piezometers and sediment K have been plagued by lack of spatial coverage and&lt;br/&gt;reproducibility problems.&lt;br/&gt;This research will map the extent and continuity of groundwater recharge and&lt;br/&gt;discharge zones at two well-documented sites, Lake Lacawac in Pennsylvania and Mirror&lt;br/&gt;Lake in New Hampshire, using a newly-developed marine resistivity system.&lt;br/&gt;Measurements collected by towing the electrodes behind the boat on a floating line can&lt;br/&gt;be combined with GPS and bathymetry data during data inversion to produce nearly&lt;br/&gt;continuous 2-D resistivity profiles. Resistivity responds to variation in porosity, ionic&lt;br/&gt;strength of pore fluids, and clay content. In some cases, changes in pore fluid indicate&lt;br/&gt;groundwater recharge from the lake (outseepage) or discharge to the lake (seepage).&lt;br/&gt;Increase in porosity may indicate likely areas of discharge and increased clay content&lt;br/&gt;may indicate areas of restricted groundwater-surface water interaction. Using the&lt;br/&gt;resistivity system, measurements can be made over larger areas, and compared with the&lt;br/&gt;geology beneath the lake. The geophysical interpretation of potential areas of&lt;br/&gt;groundwater seepage or outseepage will tested by deploying an array of low cost manual&lt;br/&gt;seepage meters, as well as new logging seepage meters that make use of an&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic flowmeter to detect changes in flow over time. The geophysical surveys&lt;br/&gt;will advance knowledge of groundwater-lake interactions by providing better spatial&lt;br/&gt;coverage, linkages between geologic features and seepage, and more temporal data in&lt;br/&gt;order to examine system response to stresses (both storms and climate change).&lt;br/&gt;This research is important to society because of the increasing pressures on&lt;br/&gt;freshwater resources. Better understanding groundwater-surface water interactions will&lt;br/&gt;improve prediction of water budgets and chemical transfer (i.e., contaminants).&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, seepage interfaces are often hot spots of biological activity and play an&lt;br/&gt;important role in nutrient and carbon cycling. This study is designed for transfer to other&lt;br/&gt;sites because it looks at the fundamental relationships between the geophysical signal(s)&lt;br/&gt;and the observed hydrology.&lt;br/&gt;The educational impact of this research occurs at multiple levels. Funds will be&lt;br/&gt;provided for three masters students during their second year of study. In addition,&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates will act as field assistants and take ownership of research sub-projects. To&lt;br/&gt;further enhance their research experience, funding is included to permit undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students to attend a scientific conference and present their research. Temple often attracts&lt;br/&gt;first-generation college students and has a 30% minority population; in the geology&lt;br/&gt;department, there is a good gender balance among students. Thus, Temple is able to&lt;br/&gt;reach under-represented groups in the sciences. In addition to university education, the&lt;br/&gt;project will contribute educational materials on the importance of groundwater-lake&lt;br/&gt;interaction for tours at the lakes studied.</AbstractNarration>
