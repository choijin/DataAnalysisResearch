<AbstractNarration>0519425&lt;br/&gt;ElShall&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Description:  This project supports a collaborative research between Dr. Mohamed Samy El-Shall, Department of Chemistry at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), Richmond and Dr. Osama Fouad, Central Metallurgical Research and Development Institute (CMRDI), Helwan.  They will study the preparation and characterization of nanostructured ZnO, SnO2 semiconductors and their composites as gas sensor materials. Most of the metallurgical industries and some other industries as well use or produce gases that are air pollutants. In most cases the concentrations of these gases exceed the permitted levels. Environmental pollution and contamination by various harmful gases is a serious problem that directly affects human health, and it can have significant impact on the technological and economic progress of society.  The challenge of developing novel ultra sensitive gas sensors could be met by exploiting the unique&lt;br/&gt;size-dependent physical and chemical properties of semiconductor nanoscale materials. This project deals with the development of new types of nano-structured gas sensors aimed at monitoring and consequently minimizing environmental pollution.  The project combines the laser methods developed at VCU in the USA with the chemical-metallurgical and spin coating methods developed at the CMRDI in Egypt, to synthesize and characterize a new family of nanowires of mixed oxides and thin films of zinc and tin oxides as novel gas sensor materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: It is expected that, with the precise control of the size, composition, dopants and surface properties of the nano-structured sensors, this research will lead to a powerful approach for the development of selective highly sensitive gas sensors. The proposed research will also result in a better understanding of the factors that control the selectivity and sensitivity of nanostrucured gas sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Successful results will likely initiate new efforts for a variety of environmental applications involving both the industrial and commercial sectors in Egypt and the US, and can lead to economic development in both countries. In addition, the project has broad implications in the education and training of graduate students and junior scientists in the multi-disciplinary research areas of nanomaterials, gas sensors, environmental chemistry, and materials science. The research will introduce new areas of research on nanostructure materials to the Egyptian scientific community. This is expected to open new fields of research with promising applications in advanced materials, sensors and devices.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
