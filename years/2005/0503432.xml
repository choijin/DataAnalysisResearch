<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Griesemer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus is on two projects. Both of them concern the effect&lt;br/&gt;of quantized low-energy (infrared) radiation on the dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;atoms and molecules. The first project studies the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;atoms and molecules that are initially in their ground state and&lt;br/&gt;subject to an external electromagnetic field. Then, in a time&lt;br/&gt;interval of length T this external field is slowly changed in a&lt;br/&gt;given and fixed manner; slowly meaning that T is very large on the&lt;br/&gt;time scale of the atom or molecule. The goal is to understand why,&lt;br/&gt;in an experiment, the system would stay close to its instantaneous&lt;br/&gt;ground state at all times. The main mathematical problem in&lt;br/&gt;proving this within non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics is to&lt;br/&gt;show that the ground state eigenvector and its energy are smooth&lt;br/&gt;functions of the external field configuration, even though the&lt;br/&gt;ground state energy is embedded in the continuous spectrum. To&lt;br/&gt;analyze this problem the renormalization group analysis of Bach,&lt;br/&gt;Froehlich, and Sigal is simplified and adjusted to the problem at&lt;br/&gt;hand. The second project concerns the phenomenon of relaxation to&lt;br/&gt;the ground state of excited atoms and molecules. Under the&lt;br/&gt;assumption of an infrared cutoff this problem has recently been&lt;br/&gt;completely analyzed by the PI and his collaborators. The goal now&lt;br/&gt;is to remove the un-physical assumption of an IR cutoff and to&lt;br/&gt;show that no infrared problem occurs, that is, that only finitely&lt;br/&gt;many photons are emitted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project devoted to the mathematical analysis of&lt;br/&gt;dynamical aspects of light (photons) interacting with atoms and&lt;br/&gt;molecules. It is motivated by fundamental mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;physical problems, the physics problems stemming from every day&lt;br/&gt;phenomena and from low energy laboratory experiments (neon lamp,&lt;br/&gt;quantum chemistry, laser light etc). More specifically, the&lt;br/&gt;proposed research contributes to a rigorous mathematical&lt;br/&gt;understanding of basic physical phenomena, such as the existence&lt;br/&gt;of ''adiabatic limits'' and the relaxation to the ground state of&lt;br/&gt;excited atoms and molecules. The existence of adiabatic limits is&lt;br/&gt;of fundamental importance for our understanding of chemistry,&lt;br/&gt;since much of theoretical chemistry assumes good accuracy of an&lt;br/&gt;approximative theory, called Born-Oppenheimer approximation, whose&lt;br/&gt;justification requires existence an adiabatic limit. The&lt;br/&gt;relaxation to the ground state of an excited atom is an example&lt;br/&gt;where dissipation of energy in an open quantum system can be&lt;br/&gt;derived from first principles. It is also one of the main effects&lt;br/&gt;responsible for the production of all visible light. This project&lt;br/&gt;will deepen our understanding of the physics of atoms and&lt;br/&gt;molecules and produce new mathematical tools that will likely find&lt;br/&gt;applications elsewhere.</AbstractNarration>
