    <AbstractNarration>This proposal describes a two-year pilot to establish an academic year, two-year college (2YC) Research Experiences for Undergraduates site and build a 2YC-4YC support network and pipeline. This is a collaborative project between William Rainey Harper College (WRHC) and Harold Washington College (HWC). Thomas Dowd (WRHC) and Thomas Higgins (HWC) are the PIs for this project, and Co-PIs Roger House (WRHC) and Daniel Stanford (WRHC) assist them. The specific goals of this project are: (1) to provide 12 2YC undergraduates with authentic, on-campus, academic-year research experiences mentored by 2YC faculty. Six students will participate each project year; (2) to assess the impact of the research experience on students' attitudes, skills and likelihood of future study and employment in STEM fields; (3) to provide professional development opportunities for 2YC faculty by giving them the opportunity and resources to re-connect with their disciplinary research interests, and; (4) to build a network of local and regional 4YCs that will collaborate with 2YC faculty and can provide 2YC students with summer research experiences. WRHC is a comprehensive 2YC located in Palatine, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, Illinois with an annual enrollment of over 25,000 students (4,000 full-time and 21,000 part-time). Almost 3,000 students enroll in science classes each semester with 41% of the student population coming from traditionally underrepresented groups (58% female; 17% Hispanic, 14% Asian/Pacific Islander, 3% Black, and 7% other). HWC is a one of the City Colleges of Chicago and is a Minority Serving Institution with an annual enrollment of over 11,000 students (5,000 full-time and 6,000 part-time). Over 500 students enroll in science classes each semester with 62% of the student population coming from traditionally underrepresented groups (57% female; 44% Black, 18% Hispanic, 12% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 3% other). Because of the diversity of both institutions, it is highly likely that a significant number of the students involved in the project will be from under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
