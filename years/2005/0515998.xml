<AbstractNarration>Autophagy (meaning 'self-eating') is a process that takes place in animal, plant and fungal cells during starvation and senescence (aging). During this process, cellular components are broken down into smaller molecules as a means to recycle nutrients for re-use by the organism. This degradation takes place inside a cellular compartment called the vacuole. The aim of the proposed research is to determine how components are delivered to the vacuole for degradation during nutrient starvation in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The mechanism of delivery will be characterized using microscopy together with chemicals that prevent transport. In addition, the function of a gene that is likely to be involved in the transport process will be analyzed using genetic and biochemical approaches. This research is expected to provide insight into the importance of autophagy in the response of plants to nutrient starvation and to elucidate the mechanism of transport of components to the vacuole during autophagy. This will add to our knowledge of a fundamental process that is important in stress responses and disease progression in many different organisms. It also has agricultural implications, as nutrient deficiency is often encountered by crop plants in the field, and a greater understanding of the response of plants to these conditions may lead to new strategies to combat the deficiency. An integral part of this proposal is the training of graduate and undergraduate students in research. This project will provide opportunities for students to gain laboratory experience through a number of different programs, including programs designed to increase the participation of women and minority students in scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
