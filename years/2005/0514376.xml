    <AbstractNarration>With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support of the work of Professor John Baldwin, of the Chemistry Department at Syracuse University. The research will extend the PI's studies of fundamental reaction mechanisms occurring in the rearrangement of hydrocarbons. These investigations, utilizing sophisticated experimental techniques, offer particularly attractive opportunities to test modern theoretical predictions. The hydrocarbon rearrangements to be studied include the isomerization of cyclopropane to propylene, the reaction path leading from the pentamethylene diradical to propylene, conversion of vinylcyclobutanes into isomeric cyclohexenes, and isomerizations of 1,3-cycloalkadienes. The methods and techniques that will be employed in these experiments include organic synthesis, the use of stable isotopes, application of many different spectroscopic tools, and kinetic and stereochemical analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These investigations of the mechanisms of hydrocarbon thermal rearrangements, which will provide fundamental new information on chemical reactivity, are expected to have significant impact on much of synthetic chemistry. A major positive benefit of this research will be the young scientists nurtured by participation in the project. These undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows will become part of the human capital so essential for new scientific advances.</AbstractNarration>
