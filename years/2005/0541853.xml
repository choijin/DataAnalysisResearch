<AbstractNarration>HRD 04-54569&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MentorNet will host a workshop for engineering researchers and higher education faculty/administrators attending the annual WEPAN meeting (Women in Engineering Programs &amp; Advocates Network) to share and further disseminate new findings and best practices about mentoring, particularly mentoring via the Mentor Net electronic/virtual systems. An additional focus is the targeted inclusion of members of the National Association for Minority Engineering Program Administrators (NAMEPA) in the workshop. The project plan includes basic evaluation, including pre- (formative) and post-workshop evaluations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Muller cites data from a recent MentorNet evaluation and research project that was performed by SJB Consulting (contracted by MentorNet) that indicates that women of color participating in MentorNet's one-on-one mentoring program find the experience particularly helpful - African-Americans at 76 percent and Hispanics/Latinos at 79 percent, compared with Asian-Americans at 69 percent and Anglo-/European Americans at 72 percent. The study also reported that African-American and Hispanic/Latino mentors also had preferentially good experiences-with their development of mentoring skills, commitment, and confidence increasing significantly. The activity should provide a learning opportunity for WEPAN and NAMEPA members to acquire some skills and knowledge from MentorNet's extensive investment and interaction in mentoring. The workshop should impact (increase) the retention of women and minorities in engineering education, and their preparation for entry, perseverance, and promotion in the engineering workforce.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
