    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is concerned with the asymptotic enumeration of tilings of &lt;br/&gt;lattice regions with holes. More specifically, using work of Fisher and &lt;br/&gt;Stephenson as its starting point, it studies the interaction of the holes &lt;br/&gt;when all the leftover portion is tiled, via a certain averaging over all &lt;br/&gt;such possible tilings, called the joint correlation of the holes. In &lt;br/&gt;earlier work, the proposer proved that the case of triangular holes on the &lt;br/&gt;triangular lattice is governed, for large separations between the holes, &lt;br/&gt;by a law closely resembling the superposition principle of electrostatics, &lt;br/&gt;where holes correspond to charges of magnitude equal to the difference &lt;br/&gt;between the number of unit triangles of each orientation they enclose. In &lt;br/&gt;the current project, the proposer presents a program of research problems &lt;br/&gt;that extend his previous work in some new, interrelated directions. One of &lt;br/&gt;these problems concerns generalizing the superposition principle for &lt;br/&gt;correlation to the case when the holes can be arbitrary (not necessarily &lt;br/&gt;connected) unions of lattice triangles of side two. Another problem &lt;br/&gt;considers a finer analysis of the correlation, namely the study of its &lt;br/&gt;variation under small displacements of individual holes. The proposer &lt;br/&gt;conjectures that these finer changes are also governed by a superposition &lt;br/&gt;principle, analogous to the superposition principle for the electric field &lt;br/&gt;in electrostatics. A third problem is concerned with studying boundary &lt;br/&gt;effects. Besides the core research program outlined above, the proposer &lt;br/&gt;also intends to study the symmetry classes of perfect matchings of a &lt;br/&gt;certain family of graphs on the lattice determined by the tiling of the &lt;br/&gt;plane by squares, regular hexagons and regular dodecagons, and determine &lt;br/&gt;to what degree a parallel he found between the perfect matchings of these &lt;br/&gt;graphs and the intensively studied plane partitions extends when &lt;br/&gt;considering the action of symmetry groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of &lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete &lt;br/&gt;collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems &lt;br/&gt;is extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design &lt;br/&gt;of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the &lt;br/&gt;design of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of &lt;br/&gt;objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research. The specific &lt;br/&gt;problems in this project are instances of the dimer model of statistical &lt;br/&gt;physics. A basic illustration of this is the real-world process (relevant &lt;br/&gt;to the study of of lubricants) of adsorption of a liquid, consisting of &lt;br/&gt;two-atom molecules---the dimers in the model---along the surface of a &lt;br/&gt;crystal, whose fixed atoms form a lattice pattern, with any two &lt;br/&gt;neighboring positions capable of holding one molecule, and any given &lt;br/&gt;crystal atom being involved in the adsorption of at most one molecule. The &lt;br/&gt;main issue in this setting is the asymptotic behavior of the quantities &lt;br/&gt;that are studied (speciffically, the number of different ways the surface &lt;br/&gt;of the crystal can be covered by molecules). In some of the instances we &lt;br/&gt;encounter, the usually more difficult problem of determining quantities &lt;br/&gt;exactly turns out to allow progress in the asymptotic study.</AbstractNarration>
