<AbstractNarration>The Crime Scene Information Technology (CSIT) project directed by the New York Hall of Science (NYHOS) seeks to enhance middle school science curriculum with forensic science and IT applications and introduce educators and students from underserved communities to IT career opportunities in forensic science.  As a comprehensive project, the project directly serves 60 teachers and 300 students in grades six through nine, 600 guidance counselors and 200 school personnel including school administrators.  An additional 700 students participate in ancillary activities, while 5,780 students are reached indirectly.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NYHOS has a successful track record of providing informal science learning programs to area schools.  Designed to improve public understanding of science and technology, the NYHOS is the only hands-on science and technology museum in New York City and possesses the largest collection of hands-on science exhibits.  Along with the NYHOS, project partners include the NYC school system, the American Academy of Forensic Science, and the Public Education Association (NYC-based not for profit).  Designed to facilitate the acquisition of IT content and skills within the context of forensic science, interdisciplinary investigations (e.g., earth science, life science, math, biology, chemistry, physics, computer science and geography) utilize image processing, physics simulation, database analyses and superimposition of maps.  Project components include professional development workshops, summer intensives, student innovation camps, field trips, curriculum module development, portable lab development and a CSIT symposium.  As a result of the project, forensic science-based curriculum modules and five portable forensic science labs will be available to schools for use with the existing science curricula.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teachers contribute to the development of the forensic science curriculum modules and portable labs.  Predominantly Title I designated, partnering schools serve large populations of underserved and underrepresented students.  Teachers receive intensive professional development in IT concepts, skills and applications to further the skills and awareness of IT career and educational paths for students.  Receiving 120 contact hours, teachers work directly with students at one- and two-week Innovation student summer camps at the museum to test the module and lab investigations.  The career exposure component includes field visits to forensic labs and other IT-related sites, as well as IT-related guest speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An advisory committee comprising expertise from forensic science, informal science, information technology and K-12 provides guidance and direction to the project.  The project will produce forensic science curriculum modules and mobile portable forensic science labs for broad dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
