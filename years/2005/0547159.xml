<AbstractNarration>CAREER: Shock-Tube Studies of Ignition and Oxidation at Practical Conditions&lt;br/&gt;Eric L. Petersen&lt;br/&gt;Mechanical, Materials &amp; Aerospace Engineering&lt;br/&gt;University of Central Florida&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the Earths population continues to grow and counties continue to develop industrially and technologically, our reliance on energy resources remains at the forefront of world science, technology, and politics. Although alternative sources of energy have been pursued for several years, all estimates indicate that the major energy sources for the next 50-100 years or more will continue to be from chemical means. At the heart of this production of energy, whether for electricity or transportation, is the combustion process inside of an engine. Examples include internal combustion engines for automobiles, large gas turbine engines for power plants, and jet engines for aircraft. However, global and local concerns regarding energy conservation, pollution, and dependable fuel supplies place an ever-increasing need for more efficient and cleaner-burning engines. Such demands are often beyond the limits of existing combustion science and technology. To meet the seemingly conflicting demands of increased energy production, fuel flexibility, and emissions reduction, we must understand the combustion processes at the fundamental combustion level and at conditions that are representative of practical devices. A modern frontier in this area includes the chemistry of fuel oxidation at elevated pressures since most engines operate at pressures much greater than atmospheric pressure. The goal of this CAREER award is to better understand the chemistry of fuel ignition and oxidation through experimental research using a facility that is ideal for reproducing high-temperature, high-pressure engine conditions in a laboratory environment: a shock tube.&lt;br/&gt;An important global topic such as energy production requires not only advances in scientific research, but trained people to carry it out. Engineers and scientists with a worldview will certainly further the advancement of science at an international level. A critical aspect of this CAREER award therefore involves the participation of students in related research abroad in countries such as Germany and Ireland. Each summer, a student will spend 3 months conducting research at the host international university laboratory. At the grassroots level, the development of future scientists and engineers begins at high school, middle school, and even elementary school. Exposing young students and their teachers to scientific research will help to instill the excitement of science and the desire to pursue careers in scientific research. This CAREER effort includes a K-12 outreach component including a panel of local teachers to serve as an advisory committee for ideas and plans for involving students at a young age in engineering and science. In fact, this 5-year CAREER award alone will give more than a dozen university students several being female or of minority status a first-hand experience in scientific research. Many others will be impacted by the proliferation of ideas and resources into university and K-12 classrooms.   &lt;br/&gt;In summary, this CAREER effort will acquire much-needed, higher-pressure chemical kinetics data and expose several students at both the university and K-12 levels to the scientific research process. The focus of the study will be on the oxidation kinetics of CO/H2 and certain lower-order hydrocarbons at pressures up to 100 atm, with emphasis on the 10-to-30 atm range and temperatures between roughly 800 and 2000 K. The overall effort is divided into seven tasks: 1) design and construction of a low-temperature, high-pressure shock tube; 2) conduct ignition and oxidation experiments; 3) perform kinetics modeling studies; 4) measure rate coefficients of key reactions; 5) incorporate research experiences at international and industry laboratories; 6) launch a K-12 outreach program to encourage interest in engineering research at an early age; and, 7) instigate a program that involves undergraduate students conducting research year round.&lt;br/&gt;The Combustion and Plasma Systems Program and the Office of International Science and Engineering cofund this project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
