<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a long and fruitful history of interaction between&lt;br/&gt;various branches of analysis and probability theory.  This&lt;br/&gt;proposal focuses furthering these connections, both by applying&lt;br/&gt;recent results in probability to analyze dynamical systems, and&lt;br/&gt;using ergodic theory and other branches of analysis, to study&lt;br/&gt;questions in probability.  Two probabilistic models which have&lt;br/&gt;seen large contributions from ergodic theory are first passage&lt;br/&gt;percolation and Richardson's growth model. The work in this&lt;br/&gt;proposal aims to apply techniques from ergodic theory to study&lt;br/&gt;questions of coexistence of multiple infections in Richardson's&lt;br/&gt;growth models and the existence of one sided geodesics in first&lt;br/&gt;passage percolation. One proposed application of probability&lt;br/&gt;results to study dynamical systems is the use of domino tilings&lt;br/&gt;the possible ergodic properties of two dimensional subshifts of&lt;br/&gt;finite type. Another is to use recent advances in necessary&lt;br/&gt;conditions for ergodicity of g measures to answer a longstanding&lt;br/&gt;open question about the necessary conditions modulus of continuity&lt;br/&gt;of an Anosov map on the torus which ensures ergodicity of the&lt;br/&gt;corresponding measure preserving system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematicians have long used probabilistic models to gain&lt;br/&gt;understanding of complex physical, biological and social systems.&lt;br/&gt;Examples of these models include the Ising model to understand the&lt;br/&gt;process of magnetization, random graphs to study the spread of&lt;br/&gt;disease through sexual contact, and Richardson's growth model to&lt;br/&gt;understand the spread of infection. This proposal aims to&lt;br/&gt;contribute to this field by using new techniques in the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical field of dynamical systems to analyze probabilistic&lt;br/&gt;models inspired by physics and biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
