<AbstractNarration>Technical&lt;br/&gt;The theme of this project is to understand and manipulate spins and magnetismin self-assembled nanoparticle arrays with potential for spintronic and high frequency applications. Theresearch approach includes material synthesis, self-assembly, property characterization, device fabrication, and theoretical modeling to address fundamental challenges impeding progressin nanomagnetism and spintronics. Research efforts are grouped into three topics: 1) development ofnanoscale building blocks based on solution phase synthesis, with emphasis on half-metallicnanoparticles, diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS) quantum dots (QDs) and multicomponent hybridnanoparticles; 2) fabrication and characterization of ordered nanoparticle arrays with tailored propertiesand interactions, created by the integration of self-assembly and microfabrication techniques; 3)development of functional materials and devices having potential for spintronic and high frequency applications. &lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed work contains a strong educational component with a goal ofcultivating researchers with multidisciplinary skills and integrating the PI's research expertise into educational activities. These research activities lie at the intersection of physics, chemistry and engineering, involving material synthesis, device fabrication, and structural and physical property characterizations. This combination offers interdisciplinary and multi-skill training to students and postdocs. Through collaboration with IBM researchers, selected graduate and undergraduate students will be offered industrial internships. This exposure will broaden their horizons and prepare them forcareers in either academic or industrial settings. The PI expects to increase participation of women and minority students in his research program via targeted recruiting, in the form of providing research experience for undergraduates, assistantships and internships. Undergraduate students will be recruited to develop a magnetotransport measurement system, which will be used for the Department's Advanced Lab course as well as a unique tool for spin polarized transport studies. Systematic approaches will be employed to stimulate abstract thinking and logical reasoning in the teaching of undergraduate introductory physics. Research results and current and future technology trends will bepresented to a broader audience including K-12 science teachers and students, targeting high needs of inner city and Native American schools in the Buffalo area, through developing hands-on material science tools and resources.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
