<AbstractNarration>This award supports the acquisition of two controlled-temperature environmental chambers by the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL).  The chambers will be used for research programs requiring the culture of marine organisms and for experimental studies of the benthic-pelagic coupling of marine nutrients and contaminants. The experimental research that characterizes much current research at marine laboratories includes biochemical/molecular and physiological/bioenergetic analyses that relate to the ecology of marine organisms. To enable such research, seawater systems at marine laboratories must have fine-scale control of seawater temperature. Many of the research programs carried out at the CBL in the fields of ecology, oceanography, ecotoxicology, and environmental chemistry/geochemistry depend on the high quality of temperature-controlled and filtered seawater. These additional chambers will greatly improve the CBL's ability to provide such facilities to resident scientists, visitors, and students.  &lt;br/&gt;The CBL is involved in various outreach activities and K-gray education initiatives. Its visitor center hosts more than 10,000 visitors per year.  Education has been integrated into the overall CBL operations. There are developed mechanisms for collaborating with K-12 education activities and outreach to the general public primarily through collaborations with other institutions in the region. In addition, the mission and mandate for CBL has provided for strong ties with regional management agencies, and much of the experimental research that is conducted has been in conjunction with those agencies. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
