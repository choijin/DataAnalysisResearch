    <AbstractNarration>This is a new Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) making an award to the ANDRILL Operations Account. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ANDRILL is a multinational initiative to investigate Antarctica's role in Cenozoic-Recent global environmental change through stratigraphic drilling for Antarctic climate, volcanic, and tectonic history. The initiative grew out of the successful Cape Roberts Project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Parties Contributors have agreed to form a collaboration, with the Parties contributing shares of the operations costs in accordance with the Drill System Budget (Annex 6) and the Payment Schedule (Annex 7). The U.S. also contributed to development of the drill system through a separate award and will contribute to future science through research grants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is recommended in the amount of $958,357 to be funded from operations funds. This amount brings the U.S. current in its payments through the period June 30, 2006.</AbstractNarration>
