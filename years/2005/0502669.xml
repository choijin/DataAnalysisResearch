<AbstractNarration>Technical:  This international multidisciplinary research team from Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK, Germany) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU, USA) proposes to undertake a collaborative DFG-NSF program to develop novel electrodeposited LIGA (LIGA is an acronym from the German words for lithography, electroplating, and molding) materials for high temperature MEMS applications. The technological motivation for this collaboration is derived from the need  to  expand  the  reliability  and  functionality  of  current  MEMS  materials. The overarching scientific theme involves judicious control and optimization of processing parameters in a way that will tailor the underlying microstructure and attendant mechanical properties of novel LIGA MEMS materials. Current LIGA structures are severely limited by their dismal high temperature properties, and the focus of the proposed research will be on the development of new electrodeposited MEMS: high temperature alloys, dispersion strengthened composites  and  Ni-base superalloys. Processing issues related  to  the  fabrication  of  micron- sized structures will be addressed at FZK (the birthplace of LIGA), and unique characterization  and  elevated  temperature  microsample testing  techniques  (recently  developed  at  JHU)  will  be employed to characterize the full-range of mechanical properties of these new materials. Non-Technical: To date, the majority of commercial MEMS devices  have  been  thin  film  sensors manufactured using chemical and vapor deposition processes. Future MEMS applications will not be restricted to two-dimensional structures and the development of elevated temperature LIGA materials is predicted to be an enabling technology in regard to the development of next generation MEMS. Close collaboration between the two institutions, providing complementary and synergistic expertise, will be required  to  fulfill  the  scientific  mission of  the proposal, and integrated exchanges of graduate students and senior researcher  scientists  will  both  create  the  vehicle  for  this  collaboration  and  provide  a  unique  educational  experience for all participants. Moreover, the proposed participation in Congressional Visit Days will introduce JHU students to the need and opportunity for young scientists to educate congressional members and staffers and in so doing promote the support of science and  technology on Capital Hill.</AbstractNarration>
