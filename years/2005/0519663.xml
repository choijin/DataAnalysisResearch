<AbstractNarration>A hierarchical macro-model of mobile ad-hoc wireless networks is introduced to provide quality of service guarantees between nodes. The area covered by the network consists of obstacles that inhibit transmission and areas where communications can take place.  Obstacles can be physical structures that are permanent, or can be temporary, caused by a deficit of forwarding nodes. The hypothesis is that the spans between nearby obstacles are bottlenecks that inhibit the flows in the network. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A network is partitioned into areas that are surrounded by bottlenecks and obstacles. All of the nodes in an area are modeled as a single super-node, and the bottlenecks between areas are modeled as undirected links. Super-nodes are comprised of many individual nodes. Therefore, the flows between super-nodes are more stable than that between the individual nodes. Several metrics are being investigated to determine the stability of the model. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new routing procedure, called probabilistic geographic routing, will be used within a super-node to prevent additional congested regions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IEEE 802.11 LANs are becoming pervasive. Providing quality of service guarantees on these networks makes them applicable to additional services. These networks will become the basis for economically testing and deploying new services. The hypothesis that bottlenecks constrain the flows will be analyzed using the Columbia University campus. We will determine the location of bottlenecks and super-nodes based upon the location of buildings, and determine the effect of the density of mobile forwarding nodes. A preliminary set of experiments will be conducted using IEEE 802.11 transmission units.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
