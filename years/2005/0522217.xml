    <AbstractNarration>This workshop will expose to the research community a set of research needs identified by the U.S. Treasury Department as both high priority and medium to high research risk. Topics to be presented include: securing software environments including COTS software, technology to defend against insider cyber attacks, high reliability biometric identification systems, pattern recognition for asset movement, data replication technology, and technology to prevent or recover from widespread identity theft. Researchers with activities relevant to these areas will be identified and invited to participate in the workshop. The Treasury Department will coordinate participation of appropriate members of the financial community. The expected results of the workshop include improved opportunities for effective research and technology transfer that will mitigate some of the problems faced by the Treasury Department and the U.S. financial infrastructure overall. During the workshop, reports and briefings will also be produced.</AbstractNarration>
