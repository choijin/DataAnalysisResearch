<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0513981&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Krishnan Shankar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of non-negatively curved Riemannian manifolds is a rich&lt;br/&gt;subject with many open problems. The PI proposes two research&lt;br/&gt;projects in this area. The first project in collaboration with&lt;br/&gt;R. Spatzier is continuation of recent work with R. Spatzier and&lt;br/&gt;B. Wilking; we showed that a manifold with upper curvature bound&lt;br/&gt;1 and spherical Jacobi fields along every geodesic must be&lt;br/&gt;locally isometric to a compact, rank one symmetric space. This&lt;br/&gt;has led to further interesting questions. The second project&lt;br/&gt;proposes to find obstructions on the fundamental group of&lt;br/&gt;positively curved manifolds in the presence of continuous&lt;br/&gt;symmetry; other than the classical Synge theorem, there are no&lt;br/&gt;known obstructions. The third project is in the area of geometric&lt;br/&gt;group theory. In collaboration with N. Brady, M. Bridson and&lt;br/&gt;M. Forester we constructed many new examples of first and second&lt;br/&gt;order Dehn functions by constructing the so called snowflake&lt;br/&gt;groups. We hope to pursue further questions about Dehn functions&lt;br/&gt;for other classes of finitely presented groups (like CAT(0)&lt;br/&gt;groups, higher Dehn functions etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of us have an intuitive understanding of the term&lt;br/&gt;curvature. Tabletops and desktops are flat while basketballs and&lt;br/&gt;saddles are curved. My research concerns the study of objects in&lt;br/&gt;higher dimensions that admit non-negative curvature. This falls&lt;br/&gt;under the umbrella of differential geometry which is the language&lt;br/&gt;Einstein used to express the general theory of relativity, our&lt;br/&gt;best theoretical description of gravity and its effects on the&lt;br/&gt;universe. Intuitively a positively curved object has the property&lt;br/&gt;that all triangles drawn on it are fatter than triangles drawn on&lt;br/&gt;a tabletop. Similarly, negative curvature corresponds to thin or&lt;br/&gt;skinny triangles. So (the surface of) a basketball has positive&lt;br/&gt;curvature while a saddle has negative curvature where the rider&lt;br/&gt;sits. In higher dimensions, matters being much less visually&lt;br/&gt;apparent, one uses equations and sophisticated geometrical&lt;br/&gt;techniques to study the curvature of manifolds which are, roughly&lt;br/&gt;speaking, objects with no sharp edges. One of the great mysteries&lt;br/&gt;in differential geometry is the dearth of examples of&lt;br/&gt;non-negatively curved manifolds, and not many structure theorems&lt;br/&gt;either. My work deals with trying to understand the structure of&lt;br/&gt;manifolds in the presence of certain constraints like&lt;br/&gt;non-negative curvature or symmetry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
