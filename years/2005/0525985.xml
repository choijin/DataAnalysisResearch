<AbstractNarration>Epstein / Ribes - NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (prop #6457371, Feb 2005)&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;This project takes the development and deployment of GEON as its object.&lt;br/&gt;GEON, the 'geo-sciences network,' is an American cyberinfrastructure for the solid&lt;br/&gt;earth sciences - a five year National Science Foundation (NSF) project with the goal of&lt;br/&gt;providing computing, data interoperability and visualization resources for the broader&lt;br/&gt;geo-sciences. To date GEON is the most ambitious project of its kind, drawing together&lt;br/&gt;such diverse disciplines within the earth-sciences as geophysics, paleobotany,&lt;br/&gt;seismology, and geochemistry to name only a few. GEON is only one of many already&lt;br/&gt;initiated or planned cyberinfrastructure under the Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Program&lt;br/&gt;(ACP) . Through shared infrastructure, computer science expertise, and information&lt;br/&gt;technologies the impact of GEON stretches beyond the geo-sciences to the larger goal of&lt;br/&gt;science informatization. Cyberinfrastructure generally, and GEON specifically, is as much a bottom-up&lt;br/&gt;activity as top-down. In the case of GEON the NSF provides the encouragement and&lt;br/&gt;multi-million dollar funding 'from above', but the socio-technical structure of GEON&lt;br/&gt;itself was proposed, designed and enacted by practicing scientists 'from below'. How&lt;br/&gt;can we understand the conjunction and enaction of these two trajectories: state funding,&lt;br/&gt;and geo-science/IT construction and deployment? This project seeks to follow the&lt;br/&gt;practices of information technologists and geo-scientists from below and the policy&lt;br/&gt;action from above in order to understand the resulting transformations in the organization&lt;br/&gt;and practice of science. What are the consequences of mobilizing the geo-scientific&lt;br/&gt;community in its own technological transformation to meet the larger goals of the ACP?&lt;br/&gt;From GEON's inception in 2002, Ribes (co-PI) has been an ethnographic&lt;br/&gt;participant observer of the negotiations between geo-scientists and information&lt;br/&gt;technologists. This research proposal requests the resources to complement the already&lt;br/&gt;proceeding research by tracing GEON's development 'from above': NSF funding and&lt;br/&gt;support, and geoscience's vision of an informaticized science of the earth. Funds will be&lt;br/&gt;used to support travel for archival research on the ACP and to conduct interviews with&lt;br/&gt;significant 'macro-scale' actors which have provided political and financial support for&lt;br/&gt;the GEON cyberinfrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Within the field of science and technology studies this research&lt;br/&gt;project seeks to address the intersection of four themes of growing importance which&lt;br/&gt;have thus far been taken separately within the field, and which cross traditional notions of&lt;br/&gt;'scale,' but which in GEON appear simultaneously: i- standardization and classification,&lt;br/&gt;ii- users and design, iii - the organization of science and changes of practice in relation to&lt;br/&gt;information technologies; and iv- science and the state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt; In a broader sense this study contributes to the successful&lt;br/&gt;development and unfolding of contemporary information infrastructures. Calls from&lt;br/&gt;within computer science itself have pointed to the need for a greater research&lt;br/&gt;involvement of social science in the production of these large-scale infrastructures.&lt;br/&gt;'Cyberinfrastructure' is already framed as an organizational and institutional endeavor&lt;br/&gt;and offers an inviting site for building relationships with science studies. Finally this&lt;br/&gt;study will seek to offer practical, conceptual and analytic resources for practicing&lt;br/&gt;scientists themselves who are currently facing greater transformation through&lt;br/&gt;informatization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
