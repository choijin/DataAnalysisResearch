<AbstractNarration>     The interaction of an electromagnetic field with an&lt;br/&gt;inhomogeneous material is a pervasive problem arising in a broad&lt;br/&gt;array of applications.  Often a wave interacts with a random or&lt;br/&gt;structured medium, and one is interested in the effective behavior&lt;br/&gt;as the wave propagates through or is localized by the medium. &lt;br/&gt;Moreover, systems as varied as photonic crystals and band gap&lt;br/&gt;structures, random resistor netorks, sea ice and other porous&lt;br/&gt;media, and electrorheological fluids exhibit critical behavior in&lt;br/&gt;their effective electromagnetic properties as some parameter is&lt;br/&gt;varied.  The investigators conduct fundamental, mathematical&lt;br/&gt;studies of the interaction of electromagnetic fields with such&lt;br/&gt;composites, in conjunction with state of the art numerical&lt;br/&gt;experiments on model problems.  In particular, a method based on&lt;br/&gt;spectral theory and analytic continuation has been developed to&lt;br/&gt;obtain rigorous bounds on the effective complex permittivity in&lt;br/&gt;the quasistatic limit.  More recently, this approach has led to&lt;br/&gt;the finding that the effective transport properties of&lt;br/&gt;two-component media share the same analytic properties as the&lt;br/&gt;order parameters in statistical mechanics, such as the&lt;br/&gt;magnetization in an Ising model.  These powerful relations have&lt;br/&gt;only been exploited in the static case and raise many important&lt;br/&gt;questions, yet the ideas of statistical mechanics form a natural&lt;br/&gt;framework for analyzing critical behavior of wave phenomena as&lt;br/&gt;well.  Much of the analytic structure displayed in the static case&lt;br/&gt;carries over to the Helmholtz equation in a composite.  This&lt;br/&gt;observation, as well as its implications for using statistical&lt;br/&gt;mechanics in this context, is investigated analytically and&lt;br/&gt;numerically.  These investigations may yield fundamental advances&lt;br/&gt;in the mathematics, computation, and physics of electromagnetic&lt;br/&gt;fields and their interactions with composite systems.  Graduate&lt;br/&gt;and undergraduate students are involved in key projects combining&lt;br/&gt;mathematical and computational analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In a broad range of problems across many disciplines,&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic fields such as light, radar, or microwaves&lt;br/&gt;interact with inhomogeneous materials such as semiconductors,&lt;br/&gt;oil-filled rocks, bone or heart tissue, radar absorbing coatings,&lt;br/&gt;or shipping containers.  Examples arise in physics, materials&lt;br/&gt;science, electrical and bio-engineering, chemistry, biology,&lt;br/&gt;geophysics, and astrophysics, and are central to communications&lt;br/&gt;and medical technologies.  The investigators conduct fundamental&lt;br/&gt;mathematical studies of electromagnetic fields interacting with&lt;br/&gt;composite media, in conjunction with state of the art numerical&lt;br/&gt;experiments on model problems.  In many important examples, the&lt;br/&gt;effective electromagnetic properties depend critically on some&lt;br/&gt;parameter in the system.  For example, whether or not a wave can&lt;br/&gt;propagate through some types of structured media, called photonic&lt;br/&gt;crystals, depends critically on the ratio of the wavelength to the&lt;br/&gt;scale of the structure or other properties of the medium. &lt;br/&gt;Recently it was found that the mathematics underlying electrical&lt;br/&gt;transport in composites is almost identical to the mathematics&lt;br/&gt;underlying statistical mechanics.  Statistical mechanics deals&lt;br/&gt;with phase transitions such as the freezing of water at the&lt;br/&gt;critical temperature of zero degrees Centigrade, and provides a&lt;br/&gt;natural framework for posing key questions about these systems. &lt;br/&gt;The investigators develop and apply the ideas of statistical&lt;br/&gt;mechanics to electromagnetic systems using mathematical analysis&lt;br/&gt;and sophisticated computations.  They seek fundamental new&lt;br/&gt;insights, as well as novel ways of understanding and predicting&lt;br/&gt;how electromagnetic fields interact with composites.  The project&lt;br/&gt;actively involves graduate and undergraduate students engaged in&lt;br/&gt;analytical and computational projects that are central to the&lt;br/&gt;overall goals.  Results, particularly concerning critical&lt;br/&gt;properties, could potentially affect a broad range of application&lt;br/&gt;areas, including media structured on the nanometer scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
