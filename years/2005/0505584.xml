<AbstractNarration>The demands on statistical methodology have grown relentlessly&lt;br/&gt;as new technologies for data collection appear.  Many of&lt;br/&gt;these datasets are unusual by statistical standards:&lt;br/&gt;they are massive;  they are highly nonlinear;  they are&lt;br/&gt;contaminated;  they contain data which are in fact functions;&lt;br/&gt;or the data come from a mechanism which is only partially known.&lt;br/&gt;The tasks of estimation, testing, functional testing, pattern&lt;br/&gt;discovery, feature extraction, visualization, and comparison&lt;br/&gt;require the statistician look at each problem anew.&lt;br/&gt;Nonparametric methodology, which has been widely used in one&lt;br/&gt;and two dimensions, is also appropriate in these higher dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;Particular emphasis will be given to multivariate regression and&lt;br/&gt;density estimation problems, and closely related applications such&lt;br/&gt;as clustering, mixture estimation, pattern recognition, robust&lt;br/&gt;estimation, and dimension reduction.  The statistician's view of&lt;br/&gt;the scientific method is a continuously improving process of model&lt;br/&gt;building, data collection, estimation, criticism, and refinement.&lt;br/&gt;However, many practicing statisticians are stymied by an inability&lt;br/&gt;to repair poorly fitting models. Of particular interest in this&lt;br/&gt;research are methods which provide critical diagnostic information&lt;br/&gt;as part of the model estimation task.  A focus of this research is&lt;br/&gt;a relatively new minimum-distance data-based parametric estimation&lt;br/&gt;algorithm, which has been investigated for its robustness properties.&lt;br/&gt;The algorithm can be applied to mixture models and spline fitting.&lt;br/&gt;An incomplete density model may be fitted, a highly unusual&lt;br/&gt;capability that will be explored fully in the context of regression,&lt;br/&gt;image processing, clustering, outlier detection, and density&lt;br/&gt;estimation.  Other novel potential applications include adaptive&lt;br/&gt;wavelet thresholding, solution of the mixture of regression problems,&lt;br/&gt;and application to models which apply to only a subset of the data.&lt;br/&gt;capability that will be explored fully in the context of regression, image &lt;br/&gt;processing, clustering, outlier detection, and density estimation.  Other &lt;br/&gt;novel potential applications include adaptive wavelet thresholding, &lt;br/&gt;solution of the mixture of regression problems, and application to &lt;br/&gt;models which apply to only a subset of the data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research in data analysis and statistical modeling provides&lt;br/&gt;intellectual challenges with deep applications in almost every&lt;br/&gt;field of natural and social sciences and engineering. The field of&lt;br/&gt;nonparametric statistics has made a significant contribution to&lt;br/&gt;the success of science with algorithms that are hidden but critical&lt;br/&gt;even in the inner workings of cell phones.  At a recent National&lt;br/&gt;Research Council workshop, numerous scientists identified&lt;br/&gt;critical statistical needs in their work with massive data sets:&lt;br/&gt;new dimension reduction algorithms, specialized visualization tools&lt;br/&gt;for exploring massive data, better clustering algorithms, and&lt;br/&gt;techniques for handling nonstationary data.  Results from this proposed&lt;br/&gt;research directly impact three of these four critical opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;This program represents a comprehensive and long-term attack&lt;br/&gt;on a host of important data analytic problems in multivariate estimation. &lt;br/&gt;Graduate training is significant component of this project.  The results&lt;br/&gt; will be of long-term theoretical interest and will provide short-term &lt;br/&gt;solutions to real-world problems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
