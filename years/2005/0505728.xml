<AbstractNarration>Fractional factorial designs are among the most widely used experimental&lt;br/&gt;plans in practice.  Most existing researches are limited to small&lt;br/&gt;fractional factorial designs. The objectives of this proposed research are&lt;br/&gt;to develop a general theory and to construct efficient large fractional&lt;br/&gt;factorial designs for practical use.  The concept of moment projection&lt;br/&gt;pattern is introduced to study design isomorphism. Linear programming&lt;br/&gt;technique is used to study design optimality. Efficient algorithms are&lt;br/&gt;proposed for constructing both regular and nonregular designs.  The&lt;br/&gt;concept of minimum moment aberration is utilized to study optimal blocking&lt;br/&gt;schemes for both regular and nonregular designs.  Coding theory is&lt;br/&gt;employed to develop a general theory on minimum aberration blocking&lt;br/&gt;schemes. Catalogs of efficient large fractional factorial designs are&lt;br/&gt;built for practical use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental design is an effective and commonly used tool in scientific&lt;br/&gt;investigation. Fractional factorial designs are among the most widely used&lt;br/&gt;experimental plans in practice.  Most existing researches are limited to&lt;br/&gt;small fractional factorial designs. Progresses in science and technology&lt;br/&gt;urge the study of efficient fractional factorial designs with both large&lt;br/&gt;run sizes and a large number of factors. Some recent examples are computer&lt;br/&gt;experiments in large scale simulation, high throughput screening in drug&lt;br/&gt;discovery, and microarray experiments in biotechnology.  The objectives of&lt;br/&gt;this proposed research are to develop a general theory and to construct&lt;br/&gt;efficient large fractional factorial designs for practical use. &lt;br/&gt;Addressing the fundamental issue of design construction and selection, the&lt;br/&gt;results of the proposed research can be quickly assimilated into graduate&lt;br/&gt;courses on experimental design.  New algorithms and efficient designs will&lt;br/&gt;be made available online for broad and quick dissemination.  The proposed&lt;br/&gt;research has wide-ranging impact both theoretically and practically, and&lt;br/&gt;will lead to remarkable new advances in design theory and better practice&lt;br/&gt;in experimentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
