<AbstractNarration>Problem statement Quantum information theory, the quantum extension of Shannon's classi-&lt;br/&gt;cal information theory, has experienced a surge of interest and rapid technical advance over the past&lt;br/&gt;ten years, largely in response to the development of quantum-mechanically based cryptographic&lt;br/&gt;protocols and algorithms for quantum computing. Very recent work by the Principal Investigator&lt;br/&gt;and collaborators has led to a \grand unification" in the two-user setting, and much is now under-&lt;br/&gt;stood about the interplay between the plethora of quantum information processing resources such&lt;br/&gt;as quantum channels, entanglement and classical communication. As progress in the field has been&lt;br/&gt;hitherto guided by experiences from the classical theory, the next natural step is to investigate the&lt;br/&gt;quantum extensions of classical network (or multi-user) information theory. We propose a number&lt;br/&gt;of problems in quantum network information theory, including quantum versions of distributed&lt;br/&gt;compression, coding for multiple-access channels, broadcast channels and channels with state in-&lt;br/&gt;formation, and channel simulation with side information. Preliminary investigations indicate that&lt;br/&gt;many of the methods used in quantum two-user information theory apply to the multi-user setting,&lt;br/&gt;while revealing interesting new behaviour. Moreover, solutions to certain two-user problems may&lt;br/&gt;be interpreted in stunning new ways as solutions to long sought after multi-user ones.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit This research will contribute to both quantum information theory and clas-&lt;br/&gt;sical network information theory. Multi-user scenarios shed new light on the properties of quantum&lt;br/&gt;information, in particular i) the ways in which two independent sources of quantum information&lt;br/&gt;may be used, despite their delicate nature, to decode each other; ii) the ways in which a distributed&lt;br/&gt;quantum source may be localized. On the other hand, \quantizing" classical results has hitherto&lt;br/&gt;lead to several new techniques and re-interpretations of the classical theory.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact This research will contribute to developing links between network information&lt;br/&gt;theory and quantum mechanics. On a more practical level, due to the traditional connection&lt;br/&gt;between quantumness and privacy, network quantum information theory bears relevance to multi-&lt;br/&gt;user quantum cryptography. There is perhaps only a handful of experts in quantum information&lt;br/&gt;theory currently in the US; the way to improve this it through education. The funding of this&lt;br/&gt;proposal would enable the training of PhD students in this area, and facilitate the introduction&lt;br/&gt;of this new material into the University of Southern California course curriculum. The Principal&lt;br/&gt;Investigator is developing a course on quantum information theory to be ordered in Fall 2005,&lt;br/&gt;covering topics not ordered at any other US university. He is also writing a book with co-authors&lt;br/&gt;A. Winter and P. Hayden entitled \Principles of Quantum Information Theory".&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
