    <AbstractNarration>Professors Arhangelskii and Eisworth will focus on open problems regarding&lt;br/&gt;the interaction between compactness and topological homogeneity. The project&lt;br/&gt;is loosely organized around a famous question of van Douwen: Does there&lt;br/&gt;exist a homogeneous compactum containing a family of disjoint open sets of&lt;br/&gt;size greater than the continuum?&lt;br/&gt;Prior work has yielded a meager supply of techniques for building&lt;br/&gt;homogeneous compacta, all of which have fallen short of answering van&lt;br/&gt;Douwen's question. Similarly, research over the past twenty years has&lt;br/&gt;provided a few techniques for proving that a space is not homogeneous, but&lt;br/&gt;still general methods are lacking. Work of Arhangelskii has started to&lt;br/&gt;illuminate the connections between various counterexamples, and the project&lt;br/&gt;uses this work as a springboard toward attacking more fundamental questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General Topology is one of the great unifiers of modern mathematics, and its&lt;br/&gt;language and ideas are ubiquitous throughout the mathematical canon. The&lt;br/&gt;subject is concerned with finding general ideas and structures that are&lt;br/&gt;common to diverse areas of mathematics, and two of the most fundamental such&lt;br/&gt;general ideas are homogeneity and compactness. Loosely speaking, a&lt;br/&gt;structure is homogeneous if it "looks the same everywhere", while&lt;br/&gt;compactness is a property capturing "completeness" properties of the unit&lt;br/&gt;interval [0,1]. The interaction between these two topics is not&lt;br/&gt;well-understood --- known results have demonstrated that the relationship&lt;br/&gt;is complex, but the subject resisted the development of general techniques&lt;br/&gt;for constructing examples and counterexamples. Recent work of Arhangelskii&lt;br/&gt;has begun to shed light on some of these problems, and the project&lt;br/&gt;integrates this together with Eisworth's work on applications of set theory&lt;br/&gt;in topology.</AbstractNarration>
