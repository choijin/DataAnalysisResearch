<AbstractNarration>                                                      ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Id: DMS-0504323  &lt;br/&gt;Institution: :  University of Connecticut  &lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Wang, Yazhen  &lt;br/&gt;Title: Multiscale Volatility Analysis for High-Frequency Financial Data   &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;      Volatilities of asset returns are pivotal for many issues in&lt;br/&gt;financial economics. They are the key ingredients for the pricing&lt;br/&gt;of financial instruments, portfolio allocation, managerial&lt;br/&gt;decision-making, and financial risk management. Existing financial &lt;br/&gt;modeling mostly employs parametric models like GARCH and stochastic &lt;br/&gt;models. These parametric models are used for modeling volatility &lt;br/&gt;dynamics of low-frequency interdaily data and generally fail to describe &lt;br/&gt;the volatility patterns in high-frequency intradaily data, partly because &lt;br/&gt;high-frequency data have complex structures such as jumps and market &lt;br/&gt;microstructure noise contamination.  The investigator initiates an &lt;br/&gt;innovative research on modeling and analyzing of high-frequency data.&lt;br/&gt;By taking advantage of the fact that jumps, volatility and microstructure &lt;br/&gt;noise tend to behave differently at different scales, he uses wavelets' &lt;br/&gt;multiscale structure as a platform to realize the fact and perform efficient&lt;br/&gt;volatility analysis for high-frequency return data. The proposed nonparametric &lt;br/&gt;multiscale methodology is very flexible and applies to high-frequency data &lt;br/&gt;with (a) microstructure noise, (b) jumps, and (c) leverage effect. It achieves &lt;br/&gt;the following goals: (1) utilize all available data efficiently, (2) test and &lt;br/&gt;detect jumps, (3) construct noise resistant realized volatility for estimating &lt;br/&gt;integrated volatility, and (4) separate the jump variation from the total &lt;br/&gt;quadratic variation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Financial data are collected at increasingly shorter time horizons. Over &lt;br/&gt;past decade there has been a radical improvement in the availability of &lt;br/&gt;high-frequency financial data (which is referred to as  intradaily data, &lt;br/&gt;while low-frequency data mean financial data at daily or longer time horizons). &lt;br/&gt;Nowadays high-frequency financial data are available for financial instruments &lt;br/&gt;on markets of all locations and at scales like minute and even individual bids &lt;br/&gt;to buy and sell. One example of high-frequency data is the currency &lt;br/&gt;transaction data that are collected at every minute. High-frequency finance &lt;br/&gt;is an emerging new and challenge research field. The proposed research &lt;br/&gt;invents new statistical techniques to analyze high-frequency financial data &lt;br/&gt;and accurately model and forecast financial markets. It &lt;br/&gt;advances the understanding of high-frequency volatility and provides better &lt;br/&gt;volatility evaluation for practitioners in financial industry, where mistakes &lt;br/&gt;and wrong judgments can lead to catastrophic consequence for the industry and &lt;br/&gt;the rest of society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
