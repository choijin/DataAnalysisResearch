<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;Here  we propose to use  our solid-state oxidative crosslinking process to rapidly micro  pattern &lt;br/&gt;inherently conductive polymer lines and to prepare inherently conductive polymer nanostructures.  &lt;br/&gt;Since our solid-state oxidative process involves the use of a processible precursor polymer, we &lt;br/&gt;can fabricate polymeric  structures from the macro to  the nanoscale.  Furthermore, the &lt;br/&gt;polymerization process  we utilize, namely ring-opening methathesis polymerization (ROMP)  is &lt;br/&gt;living with the capability of the facile preparation of random copolymers.  Therefore, we can vary &lt;br/&gt;the amount of conductive  polymer ultimately ending  up  in our solid-state crosslinked inherently &lt;br/&gt;conductive polymers allowing for us to attain a given optical density and conductivity.  We have &lt;br/&gt;already found that electrochromic devices prepared from our nanostructured polymers have &lt;br/&gt;tremendous potential for achieving submillisecond response speeds.  With the ability to prepare &lt;br/&gt;macro, micro, and nano lines of inherently conductive polymer, we will be able to study solid-state &lt;br/&gt;oxidative crosslinking kinetics (crosslinking propagation rates),  and ion  diffusion upon redox &lt;br/&gt;switching of the polymers across all size scales.  Through ion diffusion studies with our Spanish &lt;br/&gt;collaborator, Professor Toribio Otero,  Director  of the Center for Electrochemistry  and Smart &lt;br/&gt;Materials (CEMI) at the Polytechnic University of Cartagena, we  will understand the switching &lt;br/&gt;capabilities of our crosslinked inherently conductive polymers and learn strategies to optimize the &lt;br/&gt;switching speeds and to test their potential in application areas that Otero is an expert in, namely &lt;br/&gt;membranes and artificial muscles (actuators).   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;Due to the high processibility of our precursor polymers, we have the ability to fabricate inherently &lt;br/&gt;conductive polymers via our novel  process of solid-state oxidative crosslinking  into  a  variety  of &lt;br/&gt;macro, micro, and nanostructures potentially by numerous techniques. This work could ultimately &lt;br/&gt;lead to a procedure by which to mass produce flexible displays, wearable displays, nanodevices, &lt;br/&gt;polarizing  electrochromic lenses and  windows, fast switching electrochromics for laser  eye &lt;br/&gt;protection, and potentially  ion selective membranes and actuators.  With the ability  to  precisely &lt;br/&gt;load a  given amount of conductive polymer  within an insulating polymer through our solid-state &lt;br/&gt;crosslinking process,  we  could  potentially have  a  way to put the material  at the percolation &lt;br/&gt;threshold in order to generate micron and nanosized on/off switches.  Collaborative efforts with a &lt;br/&gt;world expert, namely Professor  Toribio Otero, on ion diffusion studies of these conductive &lt;br/&gt;polymers could allow for  us to design and further  optimize the next generation of inherently &lt;br/&gt;conductive polymer devices with extraordinarily rapid response times for charge/discharge cycles.  &lt;br/&gt;In addition to laser protection electrochromic goggles and polarizing filters, this work could lead to &lt;br/&gt;a new generation of polymeric capacitors and batteries. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Collaboration: &lt;br/&gt;Interchange of students with our  Spanish collaborators is proposed.  Two students from the &lt;br/&gt;Sotzing group  will spend  3  months/yr in Spain  learning about the study of ion diffusion and &lt;br/&gt;simulations while also involved in their research. Two students from Spain will spend 3 months/yr &lt;br/&gt;in the U.S. studying nano and micro fabrication of inherently conductive polymers and the study &lt;br/&gt;of crosslinking kinetics while also carrying out their expertise of research.  Within the collaboration, &lt;br/&gt;all of the researchers  involved in the collaboration  will be  involved in a two  week intensive &lt;br/&gt;collaborative effort in Spain for the first year and a two week concerted effort in the U.S.A. for the &lt;br/&gt;second year.  During these two weeks, we will hold biweekly presentations and intensive training &lt;br/&gt;on instrumentation in the respective laboratories, and short courses in both Professor.s areas of &lt;br/&gt;expertise. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Diversity: &lt;br/&gt;This collaboration between the U.S. and Spain will provide an excellent opportunity for Mexican-&lt;br/&gt;American and Puerto Rican-American underrepresented minorities, considering these type &lt;br/&gt;students would be fluent in both languages of this collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
