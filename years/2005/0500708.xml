    <AbstractNarration>Mountain Empire Community College (MECC) and its partners are establishing the "Today's Education and Careers in Geographic Information Systems" (TEC GIS) Partnership to integrate GIS technology into public school and community college classrooms and encourage students to pursue careers in the fields of environmental science, forestry and computer aided drafting and design. The curricula for these programs are being updated to include revised courses integrating GIS concepts. Students in these majors are being encouraged to complete the GIS Certificate and an internship to enhance knowledge and skills, as well as opportunities for future employment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Public school students participate in Governor's School sessions on GIS. Local public school teachers participate in workshops on how to use GIS to meet the Virginia Standards of Learning. The workshops are being conducted by OVERspace, a program jointly funded by the Virginia Space Grant Consortium and the Virginia Department of Education. Community college and four year college faculty members are participating in GIS Institutes to prepare them for curriculum development and articulation. The MECC Certificate in GIS is being articulated with a proposed minor in GIS at the University of Virginia's College at Wise, with the B. S. in Geography program at Radford University, and with the B. S. degree program in Surveying and Mapping at East Tennessee State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project meets local, state and national needs of business and industry to increase the number of GIS technicians. Faculty professional development sponsored by the project increases the utilization of GIS tools for discipline-based instruction.</AbstractNarration>
