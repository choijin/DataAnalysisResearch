<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      In 2003, the NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Lasers and Plasmas for Advanced Manufacturing was established at the Old Dominion University. In 2005, Southern Methodist University (SMU) joined this multi-institutional I/UCRC. The First Phase (a five-year period) for SMU's site expired in 2010 and this is a Project Outcomes Report for the First Phase of SMU's site.  SMU's site industrial partners include: the Army Research Laboratory, General Motors Technical Center, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, Halliburton Co., trinity Industries, Inc., Lee Laser, and Fruth innovative Technologies (Germany).  SMU's site was also financially supported through grants obtained from the U.S. Department of Education, U.S. Army Research Office, Spectra Physics, and Siemens-UGS PLM Software.  To date, SMU's site graduated seven Ph.D. students with an additional three Ph.D. students currently in the final stage of completing their graduate studies.  The siteÆs research results have been presented to the international research community through 20 published journal papers and a number of presentations at national and international conferences.  Additionally, three undergraduate students worked in the center through the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates Program.  SMU's I/UCRC site, in collaboration with its industrial partners, has conducted a number of research projects and a short summary of the outcomes of these projects are shown below.  Halliburton Company financially supported a project entitled: "Creating and testing of functionally graded materials (FGM) resistant to slurry erosion by laser cladding."  The long-term goal of this research is to create a commercially valuable method for producing products consisting of FGMs resistant to slurry erosion.  FGMs consisting of Ni-WC (nickel-tungsten carbides) powders with different concentration of tungsten carbide particles are successfully deposited by a laser-based direct metal deposition (LBDMD) process on AISI4140 steel substrate. An extensive numerical simulation of heat transfer and evolution of residual stresses with experimental verification has been successfully performed.  General Motors financially supported a project entitled: "Laser welding of advanced lightweight materials."  The main goal of this project is to develop welding procedure for welding galvanized high strength steels in a lap joint configuration through the use of high-power fiber lasers.  A hybrid welding process based on a high-power fiber laser combined with the traditional arc welding process (gas tungsten arc welding) has been developed to successfully mitigate the effect of zinc vapor on the quality of welding sheets made of high-strength dual phase steel for the automotive industry in a lap joint configuration. In order to optimize the hybrid welding process, the process parameters related to the laser beam, the electric arc, and the interaction between the laser and arc have been investigated.  In this study, an experimentally based finite element model was developed to simulate temperature distribution for purposes of calculating mechanical stresses in welded structures.  A strong correlation was found between the depth of weld and the airborne sound signature developed during the laser welding of high-strength steels in lap joint configuration.   Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control financially supported a project entitled: "Development of arc plasma-based process for building/repair high-value components made of Al-alloys."  The main goal of this project is to develop an economically justifiable rapid manufacturing/repair technique based on a variable polarity arc plasma.  A system to repair high-value Al-alloy components by using the variable polarity gas tungsten arc welding process has been developed.  A real-time machine vision system has been integrated to monitor the size of the molten pool and the cathodic cleaning of Al-oxides.  The Army Rese...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
