    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the Astronomy Learning in Immersive Virtual Environments &lt;br/&gt;(ALIVE) Project is to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of &lt;br/&gt;computer-generated immersive virtual environments (VEs) for teaching &lt;br/&gt;astronomical concepts in college introductory astronomy classes. The &lt;br/&gt;study will find optimal learning modes for astronomy, and quantify the &lt;br/&gt;benefits that immersive VEs may have for enabling spatial learning. The &lt;br/&gt;experiment will compare the advantages of immersive VEs over their &lt;br/&gt;non-immersive counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALIVE establishes a collaboration between a four-year urban university &lt;br/&gt;and a regional science museum. The study will take place in the &lt;br/&gt;introductory astronomy classes at the Metropolitan State College of &lt;br/&gt;Denver (MSCD), using the digital full-dome theater at the Denver Museum &lt;br/&gt;of Nature &amp; Science (DMNS). The three-year study will use MSCD's &lt;br/&gt;diverse urban student population as test subjects, and will be broken &lt;br/&gt;up into two stages. Phase I will develop the materials for the &lt;br/&gt;experiment, while the experiment and follow-up analyses will take place &lt;br/&gt;in Phase II. The study will use interactive, real-time software &lt;br/&gt;developed at the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science (DMNS). Astronomy &lt;br/&gt;class students at the Metropolitan State College of Denver (MSCD) will &lt;br/&gt;be surveyed to determine what astronomical misconceptions they already &lt;br/&gt;possess. From these frontend evaluations, learning modules using VE &lt;br/&gt;simulations will be developed to supplement the introductory astronomy &lt;br/&gt;curriculum. In the experiment, pre-course, post-course, and curriculum &lt;br/&gt;tests will be used to determine the efficacy of immersive &lt;br/&gt;visualizations presented in DMNS' Gates Planetarium versus the same &lt;br/&gt;visual simulations in non-immersive settings (i.e., shown on a flat &lt;br/&gt;screen in a normal classroom), as well as a control case using &lt;br/&gt;traditional classroom multimedia. The project will stimulate and &lt;br/&gt;support the development of astronomy education modules used in &lt;br/&gt;multi-user facilities such as smart classrooms and digital planetaria. &lt;br/&gt;Such modules can also be used for informal science education in &lt;br/&gt;immersive digital theaters. An important sub-study will look explicitly &lt;br/&gt;at gender-related trends, since there is evidence that women exhibit &lt;br/&gt;greater gains than men in certain virtual navigation tasks when using &lt;br/&gt;an immersive VE. These results may have the &lt;br/&gt;potential to increase female participation and retention in the &lt;br/&gt;sciences. These activities are strongly aligned with the goals of NSF &lt;br/&gt;GPRA Strategic Plan 2001-2006.</AbstractNarration>
