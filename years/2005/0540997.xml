<AbstractNarration>Background&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rapid increases in computer performance, according to Moores law, have enabled software architects to&lt;br/&gt;design software of ever increasing functionality and complexity. Consequently, consumers expect software&lt;br/&gt;that grows in functionality and can process larger data sets with every new release (e.g., huge spreadsheets&lt;br/&gt;or streaming high-quality video). Unfortunately, since Moores law will likely not hold in the near future,&lt;br/&gt;owing to physical limitations such as wire delays and heat dissipation, hardware speedups will not keep&lt;br/&gt;pace with the demands of software. Thus, to meet the performance requirements of new software, one must&lt;br/&gt;look to software techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will explore a new approach, algorithmic optimizations in&lt;br/&gt;virtual machines, to provide the performance for next generations of software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-A system for marking implementations of algorithms, data structures, and their uses. A VM that&lt;br/&gt;knows about this system can exploit the information for connecting uses with suitable implementations.&lt;br/&gt;A VM that does not know about this system still executes the code correctly but without its&lt;br/&gt;performance benefits.&lt;br/&gt;-An implementation within a Java virtual machine that exploits the information for improving performance.&lt;br/&gt;This implementation support includes modifications to the garbage collector (for migrating&lt;br/&gt;data from one representation to another), compiler (for inlining away the calls), and scheduler (for&lt;br/&gt;scheduling profile collection threads with lower priority).&lt;br/&gt;-A collection of libraries and applications marked to exploit algorithmic optimizations. This will form&lt;br/&gt;part of the evaluation for the proposed work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The infrastructure developed as part of this research will be used in undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;algorithms classes to give students deep knowledge about the strengths and limitations of &lt;br/&gt;commonly used algorithms and data structures. This research will provides the performance &lt;br/&gt;necessary for meeting the needs of future software systems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
