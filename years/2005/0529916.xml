<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL TO SUPPORT STUDENT ATTENDANCE AT THE ACM SYMPOSIUM ON SOLID AND PHYSICAL MODELING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In June 2005, MIT is hosting and co-sponsoring the International Convention on Shapes and Solids (website: http://deslab.mit.edu/SM-SMI-2005/). This Convention comprises two prestigious symposia that are being held consecutively, namely, the annual Solid and Physical Modeling Symposium (June 13-15), and the annual Shape Modeling International Conference (June 15-17). The first of these conferences, the ACM Symposium on Solid and Physical Modeling (SPM '05), website http://www.solidmodeling.org/spm.html, is the subject of this proposal. It is co-sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Computer Graphics (ACM SIGGRAPH) and is an annual international forum for the exchange of recent research in applications of spatial modeling and computations in design, analysis and manufacturing, as well as in emerging biomedical, geophysical and other areas. The second conference, the IEEE International Conference on Shape Modeling and Applications (SMI '05), website http://www.shapemodeling.org/, is co-sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers Computer Society (IEEE-CS) and provides a forum for the dissemination of new computational techniques for modeling and processing digital representations of shapes and their properties to a diverse community of experts across a wide range of areas. The two conferences have an excellent international reputation and they attract very high quality papers. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
