<AbstractNarration>Particles in the ocean are most often classified by size (e.g. optically, electronically, or acoustically) or both size and type (e.g. by experts or image analysis). In general, the first is rapid, broad-scale, in situ, and routine while the latter is slower, smaller scale, lab-based, and experimental. The PIs will use in situ imaging, and subsequent image analysis, to assess in situ measurements from the Laser Optical Plankton Counter (LOPC).  The PIs will be conducting this work in conjunction with their on-going NSF MRI project. The measurements will also address specific operational issues within the NSF MRI project.  SGER funds are appropriate because (a) the related, on-going project will end in two years and this work is best conducted in conjunction it, and (b) the work is novel and with risk. The proposed project consists of multiple, simultaneous deployments of the LOPC and an in situ camera to acquire optical and image data in conditions ranging from blue, oceanic water, to plankton-rich water, to water with abundant aggregates. The result will be an improved ability to infer particle type as well as size from routine deployment of the LOPC, be it from a ship, buoy, or float. Such information is needed for a better understanding of particles and plankton in pelagic processes, including the carbon cycle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The PIs will identify one or more educators to accompany them on their Spring 2005 cruise.  The educator(s) will interact with the PIs on the cruise and help with the instrument deployments and data acquisition.  The educator(s) will be able to use this shipboard experience to bring elements of the newly developed technology and research into their teaching and program development.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
