<AbstractNarration>Abstract DMS-0513727&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Chakravarty, University of Colorado-Colorado Springs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Conference on Nonlinear Waves, Integrable Systems and Their Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed conference will bring together a diverse group of &lt;br/&gt;world's leading experts under the complementary topics of nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;waves, integrable systems and their applications. The conference &lt;br/&gt;participants will be comprised of experts in both theory and &lt;br/&gt;applications. There will be a substantial emphasis on problems of &lt;br/&gt;optical communications, Bose-Einstein condensates, and ultra-short &lt;br/&gt;pulse lasers. Mathematical topics include inverse scattering and &lt;br/&gt;other theoretical aspects of integrable nonlinear evolution equations. &lt;br/&gt;The topics slated for discussion are in the forefront of research &lt;br/&gt;in nonlinear science, and have witnessed enormous progress at a &lt;br/&gt;phenomenal pace in recent times. In particular, the past few years &lt;br/&gt;has seen new applications of soliton theory to lightwave communication &lt;br/&gt;and rare event simulation of lightwave systems, and rapid experimental &lt;br/&gt;progress in the fields of Bose-Einstein condensation and ultra-short &lt;br/&gt;pulse lasers; all of these application fields are strongly corelated &lt;br/&gt;with the theory of nonlinear waves and integrable systems. Consequently, a comprehensive conference covering these topics is planned.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference speakers will report the latest theoretical and experimental results in the areas mentioned above. Participants, especially younger scientists, will benefit from becoming aware of the latest results in their respective fields, and will also be able to discuss with leading international experts. Because of the inter-disciplinary nature of the conference, experts will become aware of the latest work in fields related to but different from their own. Thus, the conference will provide a forum for cross-fertilization of ideas amongst various disciplines. In addition, the inclusion of students and scientists at the beginnings of their careers in the conference will promote the transfer of this expertise to the next generation of mathematicians and applied scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
