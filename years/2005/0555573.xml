<AbstractNarration>This research project brings some of the latest advances in atom trapping, cold collisions and quantum control to bear on two major challenges of neutral atom quantum computing. The main goals are: (1) To demonstrate a universal two-qubit quantum gate for atoms in optical lattices based on molecular control in the presence of a newly predicted trap-induced resonance. The group will use two-particle interferometry in ensemble experiments with cesium atoms in optical lattices to evaluate the gate performance in detail, while a tightly coordinated theory effort will develop new and optimized quantum logic protocols; (2) To design protocols for robust and individual addressing of atomic qubits in optical lattices and other trap geometries that are not resolvable in the diffraction limit. The basic approach is tomographic, using the light shift in optical tweezers to shift the target qubit into resonance with a pulsed microwave field. Control theory will be applied to the design of robust gates with minimal cross talk to neighboring qubits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work involves a team of researchers from the Universities of Arizona and New Mexico. The research will contribute significantly to the knowledge base of Quantum Information Science (QIS). Students will be involved in all aspects of the project, including training, research, and the dissemination of results. The project will maintain and further strengthen the partnership between the participating research groups, and provide an educational environment where the artificial division between theory and experiment is removed. An important tool for education and outreach is the Southwest Quantum Information and Technology (SQuInT) Network. SQuInT hosts an annual meeting and a biannual summer school and retreat focused primarily on graduate students and postdocs. The PIs will seek out exceptional students from outside their own research groups, in particular women, minorities and undergraduates, and sponsor their attendance at SQuInT meetings. There is currently no mechanism within SQuInT for carrying out this type of outreach. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
