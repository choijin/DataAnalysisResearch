<AbstractNarration>Non-technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The superconducting intermediate state is formed in elemental (type-I) superconductors as a&lt;br/&gt;complex pattern of normal and superconducting regions. Newly developed&lt;br/&gt;experimental techniques may lead to a substantial revision of our current&lt;br/&gt;understanding of this state. These techniques allow one to observe local&lt;br/&gt;magnetic fields of the intermediate state in real time and to measure them&lt;br/&gt;with extreemly high sensitivity. This research has connections to important&lt;br/&gt;questions of pattern formation in complex mathematical, geophysical,&lt;br/&gt;chemical and biological systems and even to the formation of galaxies. The&lt;br/&gt;project carries significant educational impact. Students of all levels will&lt;br/&gt;work on the project, each performing specific set of measurements. Some&lt;br/&gt;experiments will be part of the advanced solid-state physics laboratory. The&lt;br/&gt;project involves active domestic and international collaborations with the&lt;br/&gt;leading experts in the field, including those who initiated related studies&lt;br/&gt;decades ago. A workshop on pattern formation in type-I superconductors is&lt;br/&gt;planned at the end of the research term.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award will support comprehensive studies of the&lt;br/&gt;intermediate state in type-I superconductors. Unique experimental&lt;br/&gt;techniques, such as magneto-optical visualization of magnetic fields and&lt;br/&gt;pico-emu sensitive tunnel-diode susceptometry, combined with conventional&lt;br/&gt;methods, will be employed to understand the intermediate state in a broader&lt;br/&gt;context of pattern formation in highly nonlinear systems. The study of&lt;br/&gt;topological hysteresis and complex shape effects may lead to the&lt;br/&gt;identification of unusual thermodynamically equilibrium states and,&lt;br/&gt;ultimately, to substantial revisions of our current understanding of type-I&lt;br/&gt;superconductivity. The ability to continuously tune the system across a&lt;br/&gt;broad range of topologies using both temperature and magnetic field makes&lt;br/&gt;type-I superconductivity an ideal arena in which to study general questions&lt;br/&gt;of pattern formation in nonlinear systems. Connections to biological,&lt;br/&gt;chemical and astrophysical systems will be studied as part of this project.&lt;br/&gt;The project carries significant educational impact. Students of all levels&lt;br/&gt;will work on the project, each performing specific set of measurements. Some&lt;br/&gt;experiments will be part of the advanced solid-state physics lab. The&lt;br/&gt;project involves active domestic and international collaborations with the&lt;br/&gt;leading experts in the field, including those who initiated related studies&lt;br/&gt;decades ago.
