<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: Remarkable advances have been made in recent years in the development of small,&lt;br/&gt;agile, relatively inexpensive mobile autonomous vehicles and sensors, ultimately intended for a wide variety of&lt;br/&gt;purposes such as search and rescue, exploration, environmental monitoring, distributed sensing, the cleaning&lt;br/&gt;and maintaining of structures, etc. The existence of such devices and the anticipated development of still more&lt;br/&gt;advanced versions raises compelling questions: Can large numbers of small autonomous vehicles/sensors be&lt;br/&gt;successfully deployed in the form of a swarm or flock as a search team, an exploration group, or something&lt;br/&gt;similar, to cooperatively carry out a prescribed task and to respond as a group to high-level management&lt;br/&gt;commands? Can such a group reliably function with a centralized supervisor, with limited communication&lt;br/&gt;between members, with limited power capabilities and/or with the roles of its members not all the same and&lt;br/&gt;perhaps changing with time. In broad terms these are the issues which motivate this proposed research.&lt;br/&gt;In particular we propose two pronged assault on the issue of coordinating large groups of mobile autonomous&lt;br/&gt;agents/mobile sensors. First, our intention is to continue the work we are already doing with NSF&lt;br/&gt;support, on the applications of graph rigidity to the maintaining of vehicle formations and to the localization&lt;br/&gt;of sensors in a large, possible mobile network. Second we propose to continue studying prototype synchronization&lt;br/&gt;and formation forming problems such as flocking and rendezvous, which we considered in prior&lt;br/&gt;work, with the objective of uncovering new principles of cooperative control and new means to analyze such&lt;br/&gt;systems. In the former category, we plan to take a hard look at how one might modify the rigidity concept&lt;br/&gt;so as to make in applicable to leader-follower formations. We will also look carefully at just what is required&lt;br/&gt;global rigidity wise, to enable one to determine the position of a single sensor in a non-rigid network. We&lt;br/&gt;will address all aspects of the distance constrained sensor network localization problem, in an e.ort to devise&lt;br/&gt;a provably correct distributed localization algorithm, for a moderately general class of networks.&lt;br/&gt;We will explore synchronization problems and group pattern forming problems using simple high level&lt;br/&gt;point models. Our aim here is not so much to solve the problems we will pose as it is to rely on them to&lt;br/&gt;suggest interesting questions about cooperative control, which are potentially applicable to more realistic&lt;br/&gt;models in more realistic settings. We will look at rate of convergence issues. We will attempt to generalize&lt;br/&gt;and formalize the concept of analytic synchronization with the goal of creating a means of analyzing a large&lt;br/&gt;class of asynchronous multi-agent motion control problems. We will be particularly interest in the structure&lt;br/&gt;of the switched dynamical systems which result due to the changing of neighbors in a mobile network of&lt;br/&gt;vehicles. What we want to know is if there are inherent structural properties we can exploit {as we did in the&lt;br/&gt;.ocking problem} to obtain convergence results, so as to avoid the NP hardness associated with convergence&lt;br/&gt;questions with typical switched dynamical systems.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training&lt;br/&gt;and learning in at least two di.erent ways. First, graduate students involved in the project will be&lt;br/&gt;expected to attend and present there results at technical meetings. Second, project graduate students will&lt;br/&gt;contribute to and participate in a short course on the topic which we envision organizing and giving towards&lt;br/&gt;the end of the project. We cannot think of any especially unusual way in which this project might broaden&lt;br/&gt;participation of under represented groups, although we certainly would encourage such participation. This&lt;br/&gt;project will enhance infrastructure for research and education in at least two ways. First we expect to&lt;br/&gt;continue our cross-disciplinary collaboration with our environmental biologist colleagues with whom we've&lt;br/&gt;already been working for several years. Second, we expect to continue to collaborate with our experimentalist&lt;br/&gt;colleagues at Yale and UCSB who are building a mobile sensor network test beds for trying out various&lt;br/&gt;control algorithms. We hope to continue to contribute to broadening dissemination to enhance scienti.c&lt;br/&gt;and technological understanding by organizing and running boni .de interdisciplinary technical gatherings&lt;br/&gt;like the Block Island Workshop on Cooperative Control we co-organized and which took take place in June,&lt;br/&gt;2003. We also expect to give overview talks on the subject such as the plenary presentation we gave last&lt;br/&gt;July at the MTNS meeting in Belgium, and the Penner Lecture we gave last November to the engineering&lt;br/&gt;faculty at UCSD.</AbstractNarration>
