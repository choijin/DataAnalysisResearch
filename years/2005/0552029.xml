<AbstractNarration>International trade in services is growing rapidly. Coincident with increasing services trade, the&lt;br/&gt;composition of displaced workers in the US is changing - while manufacturing workers historically&lt;br/&gt;accounted for more than half of displaced workers, non-manufacturing workers accounted for 70 percent&lt;br/&gt;of displaced workers in the most recent recession. If these trends are related, the changing mix of&lt;br/&gt;industries exposed to international trade may have deep implications for the structure of US industry and&lt;br/&gt;labor markets in the future. Currently, there is little understanding of the size and extent of services&lt;br/&gt;offshoring or what impact it is having on the US economy. More fundamentally, there is little empirical&lt;br/&gt;research examining international trade in services.&lt;br/&gt;The broad availability of detailed product information on goods trade and access to firm and plant&lt;br/&gt;level information on producers has spawned a wealth of empirical research on the impact of trade on US&lt;br/&gt;manufacturing. The broad availability of data has also fostered an empirical literature on the labor market&lt;br/&gt;impacts of international trade, again focused on the manufacturing sector. No such literatures exist for&lt;br/&gt;trade in services. An important factor in the scarcity of empirical research on trade in services, and its&lt;br/&gt;implications for the domestic economy, is the relative lack of detail in official statistical data on services&lt;br/&gt;trade.&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project are to develop measures of the size and scope of trade in services&lt;br/&gt;and to construct estimates of the impact of this trade on US firms and US workers. To address the&lt;br/&gt;inadequacy of official statistical data, the project will develop a new empirical approach to identify, at a&lt;br/&gt;detailed level, service activities that are potentially exposed to international trade. The approach to&lt;br/&gt;identifying service activities that are potentially tradable is novel: the project uses an implication of&lt;br/&gt;theoretical models of trade to develop a measure of the geographic concentration of service activities to&lt;br/&gt;identify industries and occupations that appear to be traded within the US. The ability to identify both&lt;br/&gt;industries and occupations that are tradable is an important feature of the empirical strategy because many&lt;br/&gt;of the service activities that are reportedly being offshored are tasks within the service 'production'&lt;br/&gt;process (for example, the banking relationship is not relocated offshore, rather the customer service/call&lt;br/&gt;center component is moved); occupations correspond more closely to these types of activities than do&lt;br/&gt;industries. Service activities that can be traded within the US are inferred to be potentially tradable&lt;br/&gt;internationally.&lt;br/&gt;The project will refine the list of potentially traded services by developing and examining detailed&lt;br/&gt;firm-level microdata on what service activities are actually traded. The project will use information on US&lt;br/&gt;multinationals' services imports and exports collected by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and&lt;br/&gt;establishment-level microdata on US firms' services exports collected by the Census Bureau to identify at&lt;br/&gt;a detailed level service activities that are actually traded. The BEA and Census Bureau data provide a way&lt;br/&gt;to test and improve the tradability implications of the geographic concentration methodology.&lt;br/&gt;With the refined list of traded service activities, the project will examine the impact of trade in&lt;br/&gt;services on domestic firms using longitudinal plant-level microdata on service establishments at the&lt;br/&gt;Census Bureau. Lastly, the project will investigate the impact of trade in services on domestic labor&lt;br/&gt;market outcomes, including the risk of job loss, likelihood of reemployment, duration of joblessness, and&lt;br/&gt;earnings change, using the Displaced Worker Survey.&lt;br/&gt;The results from this project will make a significant contribution to the empirical literature in&lt;br/&gt;economics on international trade in services and the implications of services trade for US firms and&lt;br/&gt;workers. The project is also anticipated to have a significant impact on the ongoing public policy debate&lt;br/&gt;regarding the implications of international trade in services. In addition to analytical results, the project&lt;br/&gt;will develop new data resources at the Census Bureau and BEA that researchers can use to pursue&lt;br/&gt;additional research on trade in services.</AbstractNarration>
