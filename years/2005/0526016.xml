<AbstractNarration>This project investigates the Next Generation Network Technology and Systems capable of understanding and learning the high-level perspective of the network.  The proposed approach pursues a new cognitive intelligent networking paradigm that maintains the success of today's Internet but which also incorporates cognitive intelligence in the network--a new networking technique that provides the ability for the network to know what it is being asked to do, so that it can step-by-step take care of itself as it learns more. In particular, we explore new networking architecture and network elements that will lead to a future network with (a) improved robustness and adaptability, (b) improved usability and comprehensibility, (c) improved security and stability, and (d) reduced human intervention for operation and configuration.  This project pursues a set of comprehensive studies that seek innovations through the design and modeling of a new brain-reflex cognitive intelligence architecture, an intelligent programmable network elements architecture, and an intelligent network control and management design.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The team approach covering neuroscience, datamining, computer science, systems engineering, artificial intelligence, and networking will provide rich opportunities for students to learn beyond their primary fields of study.  New courses developed by the faculty members will disseminate the new material covering neuroscience and information technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
