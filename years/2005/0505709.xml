<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0505709&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Rafe Mazzzeo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes several activities, all fitting in the framework&lt;br/&gt;of linear and nonlinear elliptic problems arising in geometric&lt;br/&gt;analysis on noncompact and singular manifolds. He proposes&lt;br/&gt;continuing his collaboration with Vasy on new microlocal&lt;br/&gt;techniques for constructing the resolvent on locally symmetric&lt;br/&gt;spaces of arbitrary rank. This approach has already led to a new&lt;br/&gt;proof of a meromorphic continuation of this resolvent, which in&lt;br/&gt;turn will have applications in scattering theory and to nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;elliptic equations on asymptotically symmetric Einstein spaces. A&lt;br/&gt;goal of this portion of the proposal is to create versatile&lt;br/&gt;methods, adapted from N-body Schroedinger theory, to open the&lt;br/&gt;analysis on higher rank spaces to a purely microlocal approach.&lt;br/&gt;This should lead to advances in geometric scattering theory on&lt;br/&gt;these spaces. The other part of the proposal discusses&lt;br/&gt;deformation theory of noncompact Ricci flat Einstein spaces and&lt;br/&gt;of Einstein spaces with conic singularities. Even for surfaces,&lt;br/&gt;the PI expects these methods to give new results about the&lt;br/&gt;existence of constant curvature and Ricci soliton&lt;br/&gt;metrics. Finally, the PI proposes to continue his role as&lt;br/&gt;director and teacher in SUMaC, the residential summer program for&lt;br/&gt;mathematically talented high school students, and also to&lt;br/&gt;continue his other mentoring and outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall area of research in this proposal concerns a study of&lt;br/&gt;the relationship between the geometry of higher dimensional&lt;br/&gt;curved spaces and the behaviour of solutions of certain natural&lt;br/&gt;equations on these spaces. One example is a subject called&lt;br/&gt;geometric scattering theory, which seeks to describe the&lt;br/&gt;behaviour of waves, measured at large timescales, and to see how&lt;br/&gt;these are influenced by the curvature of the underlying&lt;br/&gt;space. The PI has developed methods to study such problems on a&lt;br/&gt;natural class of spaces which appear in several different&lt;br/&gt;branches of mathematics. Other examples include the study of&lt;br/&gt;solutions to the Einstein equations, which are supposed to&lt;br/&gt;describe possible configurations for the large-scale shape of&lt;br/&gt;space. There are many such solutions; one way to organize them is&lt;br/&gt;to describe their deformation theory, i.e. to see how they may be&lt;br/&gt;altered continuously. The PI proposes to study these questions&lt;br/&gt;for certain of these spaces. A key novelty of his methods is the&lt;br/&gt;development of techniques from a field called microlocal analysis&lt;br/&gt;to these geometric problems. The nature of these topics will lead&lt;br/&gt;to interactions with mathematicians in diverse areas as well as&lt;br/&gt;physicists, and it is hoped that the results of this proposal may&lt;br/&gt;have some impact in these other areas. The PI is also actively&lt;br/&gt;involved in training and mentoring at various levels. His SUMaC&lt;br/&gt;program, now entering its eleventh year, is a proven success in&lt;br/&gt;motivating gifted high school students to continue their&lt;br/&gt;mathematical studies. He has also been active in graduate&lt;br/&gt;training and in collaborating with young postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;researchers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
