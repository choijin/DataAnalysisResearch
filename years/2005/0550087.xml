    <AbstractNarration>The measurement of flood-stage discharge in mountain rivers is an enormous logistical challenge, particularly on large space and time scales, and the inevitable paucity of such data has impeded progress&lt;br/&gt;in our understanding of mountain landscape processes. We propose a novel solution that exploits new&lt;br/&gt;high resolution satellite imagery (2m, FORMOSAT-2) with unusually high revisit frequency (daily) over&lt;br/&gt;a region of very broad interest to the earth science community (Taiwan). Our proposed method entails&lt;br/&gt;the collation of a time series (2004-2005) of orthorecti*ed, georeferenced images of selected mountain&lt;br/&gt;river channels, in tandem with contemporaneous stage measurements of discharge at the nearest gauging&lt;br/&gt;station downstream. Patterns of inundation along selected channel reaches will be mapped in each&lt;br/&gt;image. With the aid of cross-channel profiles mapped in the field at low stage, we will make estimates&lt;br/&gt;of low width, depth, mean bed shear stress and mean low velocity. Once a broad range of discharges&lt;br/&gt;has been processed, we expect to be able to construct rating curves for these low measures as a function&lt;br/&gt;of the directly observed, at-station stage data. Combination of the rating models with the multi-decadal&lt;br/&gt;archive of station data in Taiwan will permit an assessment of the long-term probability distributions of&lt;br/&gt;low widths, depths and shear stresses along and across the selected bedrock channels. Measurements of&lt;br/&gt;this kind, albeit indirect, will be of enormous interest to the geomorphology community. However, the&lt;br/&gt;method is by no means guaranteed, because remote river gauging has never been attempted in mountain&lt;br/&gt;catchments; it remains to be seen whether the precision of the anticipated rating curves will suffice for&lt;br/&gt;rivers akin to those of the Taiwan Central Range. The main task of the pilot project will be to address&lt;br/&gt;this issue and to lay the foundation for a more comprehensive, longer-term assessment of Taiwanese&lt;br/&gt;mountain river discharge.&lt;br/&gt;Broader outcomes: While low measurements in steep mountain rivers are particularly sought after by&lt;br/&gt;those interested in bedrock channel processes, they are also of great interest beyond: from modelers&lt;br/&gt;of landscape evolution and the interaction between climate and tectonics, to hydrologists preoccupied&lt;br/&gt;with the assessment of flood hazard in populated mountain environments. Moreover, if the pilot project&lt;br/&gt;proves successful it will provide the Taiwanese space agency with an excellent example of the value of&lt;br/&gt;FORMOSAT-2 in natural hazard assessment, one of its principal missions. As a result, more attention&lt;br/&gt;will be paid to the regular acquisition of FORMOSAT-2 imagery in tropical mountain areas, an essential&lt;br/&gt;step if the elusive goal of a high-resolution, multitemporal image archive is to be achieved - at present,&lt;br/&gt;images of highland areas are a relatively low prioity (for FORMOSAT-2 and other equivalent satellites)&lt;br/&gt;and are only acquired daily during emergency periods (e.g. typhoons). Such an archive would be widely&lt;br/&gt;appreciated across the discplines of earth sciences, hydrology, ecology, not to mention in remote-sensing&lt;br/&gt;R&amp;D itself.&lt;br/&gt;A-1</AbstractNarration>
