<AbstractNarration>0510370       0510545        0510004&lt;br/&gt;Slater            Glaser             Reeve&lt;br/&gt;Biogenic gas emission from northern peatlands, by wicking from vascular plants and by&lt;br/&gt;episodic ebullition events, accounts for approximately 7% of the global annual emission&lt;br/&gt;of methane to the atmosphere. This proposal involves experiments to apply ground&lt;br/&gt;penetrating radar (GPR) for (1) estimating the amount of biogenic gas stored in peatlands,&lt;br/&gt;(2) determining the spatial distribution of biogenic gas within the peat, and (3)&lt;br/&gt;monitoring biogenic gas release to the atmosphere. Data from a large northern peatland in&lt;br/&gt;Maine (EAR-0242353) show that (1) higher CH4 and CO2 concentrations correlate with&lt;br/&gt;high velocity/high attenuation zones in cross-borehole GPR data as well as shadow zones&lt;br/&gt;(loss of reflections) in surface GPR data, (2) shadow zones (indicative of high gas&lt;br/&gt;content) are frequently observed in the +11 km of surface GPR data collected in this&lt;br/&gt;peatland. The experimental objectives are: (1) a laboratory evaluation of the relationship&lt;br/&gt;between dielectric permittivity and gas content for a profile of peat cores from the surface&lt;br/&gt;to the mineral soil; (2) a cross-hole GPR and surface GPR monitoring experiment,&lt;br/&gt;supported by measurements of water levels, hydraulic conductivity and time domain&lt;br/&gt;reflectometry, to observe rates of biogenic gas release to the atmosphere; (3) a surface&lt;br/&gt;GPR study, supported by in situ measurements of biogenic gas concentration, to estimate&lt;br/&gt;the volume of biogenic gas stored in two well studied northern peatlands (Caribou Bog,&lt;br/&gt;ME and Glacial Lake Agassiz, MN). Important milestones include (a) a predictive&lt;br/&gt;equation for gas content estimation in peat as a function of depth from dielectric&lt;br/&gt;permittivity measurements, (b) new insight into the temporal pattern of gas release and&lt;br/&gt;ebullition flux from peatlands, and (c) new estimates of the free gas content of peatland&lt;br/&gt;carbon reservoirs accounting for the spatial/depth distribution of the gas.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This proposal incorporates educational activities, curriculum development, community&lt;br/&gt;outreach and international collaboration within an applied research framework. Honors&lt;br/&gt;UnderGraduate (HUG) researchers from the Rutgers-Newark Honors College (HC) will&lt;br/&gt;partner with a postdoctoral scientist to obtain the research training required to complete&lt;br/&gt;four of the primary research tasks. Each HUG will complete a yearlong senior project on&lt;br/&gt;their research and contribute to a publication. The status of Rutgers-Newark as the topranked&lt;br/&gt;National US University with respect to campus UG diversity facilitates HUG&lt;br/&gt;opportunities to minority students. Students in Earth/Environmental Sciences at Rutgers-&lt;br/&gt;Newark frequently express interest in fieldwork experiences. Part of the fieldwork will be&lt;br/&gt;conducted by students participating in a new class, Summer Field Camp in Applied&lt;br/&gt;Geophysics, developed as part of this project. Community outreach will occur via guided&lt;br/&gt;tours, poster boards and presentations on the hydrology, ecology and carbon cycle in&lt;br/&gt;Caribou Bog, facilitated by the recently opened 2 km long Orono boardwalk that now&lt;br/&gt;provides public access to this bog. Finally, collaboration with a prominent peatland&lt;br/&gt;scientist in Europe will draw international attention to our work and provide an&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to conduct comparative work on a unique European peat bog.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
