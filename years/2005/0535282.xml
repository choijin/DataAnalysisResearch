<AbstractNarration>The goal of "Skill Acquisition Through Interactive Avatars" is to create a computer-based humanoid simulation that can teach humans how to move. The hardware requirements for such as system in its final stage would be an inexpensive state-of-the-art personal computer equipped with a camera system. The avatar will be able to demonstrate movements to its user, monitor the execution of these movements by the user, and suggest corrections in case of inadequate performance. In order to be effective, the avatar will take into account neuroscientific knowledge about the organization of human motor control and human motivation during learning. This research will be useful in a large number of applications, including rehabilitation of movement-impaired patients (e.g., stroke-patients), sport and exercise education, dance instruction, childcare and special needs education, and interactive entertainment industry. Additionally, the technology developed for this project has the potential to pioneer new algorithms for autonomous robot control using "teaching from demonstration", to contribute to the development of automated surveillance systems for human environments, to the generation of humanoid computer simulations, and also to gaining new insights into biological motor control and the functioning of the nervous system. &lt;br/&gt;As intellectual merits, it will be necessary to gain new understanding of how to recognize and classify human movement from real-time motion capture, how to create skilled movement, and how to teach humans effectively. The basic research problems of understanding human movement, both in terms of movement perception as well as movement generation, are central to advancing information technology in human-computer as well as human-robot interaction, i.e., the creation of autonomous artificial perception and movement systems. Research on intrinsic motivation in motor learning will advance important insights into how to help humans with learning disabilities, but also how to create machines that are motivating to interact with.&lt;br/&gt;As broader impact, the research of this project will make important steps towards creating interactive environments that can assist people in their professional and private lives. Such technology will soon become a major component of our world, starting with clinical, entertainment, and business scenarios, and finally finding its way into private households. Understanding how to create and teach skilled movement in a user friendly way will be useful in building autonomous robot systems that can assist humans, entertain humans, replace humans in hazardous environments, rescue humans, or simply become a companion&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
