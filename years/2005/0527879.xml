<AbstractNarration>HRD 05-27879&lt;br/&gt;The submitted nomination package is in support of a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM) to recognize outstanding mentoring efforts or programs that enhance the participation of historically underrepresented groups in science, mathematics, and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Jong P. Lee, a mathematician at SUNY College at Old Westbury, has established a number of local and regional programs at his institution for mentoring students, teachers, and faculty in mathematics.  He has also shown significant commitment to mentoring individuals personally.  He has a strong focus on K-12 math teachers, which should have significant impact on the teaching and learning of mathematics in pre-college classrooms in New York. The array of programs reflects a variety of mentoring methods that have enhanced the academic experiences of minority (and majority) students on Long Island and in New York City - literally hundreds of students and teachers. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
