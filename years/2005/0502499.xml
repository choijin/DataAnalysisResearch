<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator and her students and collaborators use&lt;br/&gt;computability theoretic methods to investigate various algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;phenomena on countable mathematical structures.  The project aims to&lt;br/&gt;better understand how algebraic properties of structures interact with&lt;br/&gt;the algorithmic ones.  Topics of investigation include: complexity of&lt;br/&gt;structures and their isomorphic copies, complexity of additional&lt;br/&gt;relations on their domains, complexity and structure of partial and&lt;br/&gt;total isomorphisms, and the correspondence between computability and&lt;br/&gt;definability.  The complexity is often expressed by computable&lt;br/&gt;infinitary formulae, and measured by Turing degrees or by other&lt;br/&gt;computability theoretic degrees.  Since these degrees are not invariant&lt;br/&gt;under isomorphisms, we investigate their spectrum, which consists of all&lt;br/&gt;degrees in the isomorphism type of a structure.  An important goal is to&lt;br/&gt;relate the degree spectra of relations to the degree spectra of&lt;br/&gt;structures by studying the so-called spectrally universal structures. &lt;br/&gt;The project involves investigations in general model theoretic setting,&lt;br/&gt;such as algorithmic versions of categoricity, but also more concrete&lt;br/&gt;well-known classes of algebraic structures, such as commutative groups,&lt;br/&gt;non-commutative groups, rings, fields, vector spaces.  Another goal of&lt;br/&gt;the project is to integrate computable algebra with algorithmic learning&lt;br/&gt;theory in Putnam-Gold's framework of inductive inference machines, which&lt;br/&gt;has so far been developed mainly for computably enumerable sets.  This&lt;br/&gt;study is also important in the philosophy of inductive reasoning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 1930's, Turing, Goedel, Kleene and others developed the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical theory of computability.  Their results paved the way for&lt;br/&gt;the invention of modern computers.  Model theory, which emerged as a&lt;br/&gt;distinct field in the 1940's through the works of Skolem, Goedel,&lt;br/&gt;Tarski, Malcev and others, provides a rigorous framework for the notions&lt;br/&gt;of language, meaning and truth.  A model, a concept used in all of&lt;br/&gt;sciences, describes a portion of reality by using a formal language to&lt;br/&gt;express properties under study.  Interaction of computability theory&lt;br/&gt;with model theory, as well as other areas of mathematics, has resulted&lt;br/&gt;in computable model theory and, more generally, in computable&lt;br/&gt;mathematics.  Goedel's incompleteness theorem is a striking early result&lt;br/&gt;in computable model theory.  While some mathematical constructions are&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic, or can be replaced by algorithmic ones yielding the same&lt;br/&gt;results, others are intrinsically non-algorithmic.  Problems that can be&lt;br/&gt;solved algorithmically are called decidable.  Examples of negative&lt;br/&gt;results in computable mathematics include the undecidability of the&lt;br/&gt;Hilbert's tenth problem, and the undecidability of the word problem in&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial group theory.  Undecidable problems can be more precisely&lt;br/&gt;classified by considering generalized algorithms, which require external&lt;br/&gt;knowledge.  Turing degrees, which play a significant role in this&lt;br/&gt;project, provide an important measure of the level of such knowledge&lt;br/&gt;needed.  An important goal of the project is to use Turing degrees to&lt;br/&gt;investigate structures of importance in other areas of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
