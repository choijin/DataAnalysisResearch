<AbstractNarration>This SGER (Small Grants for Exploratory Research), modeling auditory processing in children with learning disabilities and its corresponding treatments, builds, validates, and experiments with  computational models the processing of audio signals in the auditory nervous system of the human brain. With a long term goal for capturing into a computational model the knowledge related to the acoustic processing streams acquired by a speech and hearing scientist through experiments with the human auditory system, the short-term goals include:&lt;br/&gt;Understanding what portions of the auditory processing system ought to be included in the model, building a neural network model in consultation with researchers in speech and hearing sciences, and Validating the model by running computer simulations against experimentally observed data. Such a model is expected to predict brainstem responses to audio signals that come in via the human ear and partition into its finer spectral components in the cochlea from where the impulses travel via the auditory nerve and several specialized nuclei in the brainstem to the auditory cortex. The fact that the audio signals split into two distinct "what" and "where" streams in the auditory cortex or en-route to it motivates the research. Although many computational models of the auditory system exists, the novelty of the proposed research lies in&lt;br/&gt;Including the ventral and dorsal streams in the computational model and Validating the model against auditory brainstem responses observed in children with learning disorders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: A validated model "opens the door" to study the impact of proposed treatments for children with learning disabilities based on auditory deficiencies. Using this approach, computer approximations could serve as a fast and relative inexpensive precursor to possible treatments. Students will also gain expertise in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research will expand the discipline of neuro-computational modeling and should contribute in understanding the causes of learning disabilities in children, thus enabling development of the corresponding treatments.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
