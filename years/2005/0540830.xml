<AbstractNarration>The proposed research is in Geometric Group Theory, specifically on &lt;br/&gt;problems pertaining to the geometry, topology and asymptotics of the &lt;br/&gt;word problem, particularly along avenues initiated by Gromov in his &lt;br/&gt;seminal book "Asymptotic Invariants of Infinite Groups."  A first &lt;br/&gt;direction concerns isoperimetric and filling length functions, a &lt;br/&gt;meeting point of geometry and algorithmic complexity.  Examples of &lt;br/&gt;problems for attack here are whether Cohen's Double Exponential &lt;br/&gt;Theorem is sharp, and to establish long standing claims of Thurston &lt;br/&gt;about isoperimetric functions of the Special Linear Groups.  Also &lt;br/&gt;addressed in the proposal is a question of Gromov about the uniqueness &lt;br/&gt;of a limit of a group viewed from increasingly distant vantage points &lt;br/&gt;(an asymptotic cone); a line of attack is being pursued in &lt;br/&gt;collaboration with M.R. Bridson.  Another area is the "grammar of the &lt;br/&gt;Word Problem", where geometry meets linguistic complexity.  The P.I. &lt;br/&gt;proposes to investigate the combings of nilpotent groups as well as &lt;br/&gt;applications to the Andrews-Curtis Conjecture.  The proposal includes &lt;br/&gt;collaborative work and it is anticipated that the inter-disciplinary &lt;br/&gt;nature of the work will enable additional collaborative efforts both &lt;br/&gt;in the United States and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Word Problem was posed by Max Dehn in 1912, who presciently &lt;br/&gt;described it as a "fundamental problem whose solution is very &lt;br/&gt;difficult and which will not be possible without a penetrating study &lt;br/&gt;of the subject."  The Word Problem for a group (a fundamental &lt;br/&gt;algebraic object capturing symmetries) asks for a systematic method &lt;br/&gt;(in modern terms, an algorithm) which, given a finite list (a "word") &lt;br/&gt;of basic symmetries (distinguished group elements known as &lt;br/&gt;"generators"), declares whether or not their product is the identity &lt;br/&gt;(the trivial symmetry that moves nothing).  One of the crowning &lt;br/&gt;achievements of 20th century mathematics was the construction by Boone &lt;br/&gt;and Novikov of groups for which no such algorithm can exist.  However, &lt;br/&gt;that is by no means the end of the story.  The Word Problem transcends &lt;br/&gt;its origins in algebra, decidability and complexity theory, and turns &lt;br/&gt;out to be a bridge to geometry and topology, as well as to linguistic &lt;br/&gt;complexity.  To a group we can associate a topological space and vice &lt;br/&gt;versa.  Recognising a word to be trivial amounts to spanning a loop &lt;br/&gt;with a disc in a corresponding space, and geometrical features of this &lt;br/&gt;disc (such as area) translate to algorithmic complexity measures (such &lt;br/&gt;as time) of the Word Problem.  Moreover, words over a group form &lt;br/&gt;grammars whose linguistic features relate to the ease of navigating &lt;br/&gt;around the corresponding space.  Thus there are tantalising links &lt;br/&gt;between minimal surfaces (soap films) and algorithmic complexity, and &lt;br/&gt;between geometry of spaces and grammars.  These are the connections &lt;br/&gt;the P.I. proposes to develop and exploit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
