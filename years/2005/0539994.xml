    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to the Duke University Marine Lab under the direction of Dr. Joseph Ramus to provide research and teleconferencing equipment for the institution's new Ocean Science Teaching Center which will be ready for occupancy in spring 2006. The equipment, which will enhance the research, education and training roles of the new Center, includes shared-use instruments that will serve technology-dependent research and courses, and videoconferencing equipment that will facilitate information exchange and distance learning efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demonstrating truly effective use of the videoconference system for teaching and meetings will be a milestone for marine labs. This new marine lab facility is expected to provide excellent integration of research and education at both the undergraduate and graduate levels and to facilitate a shared experience that is of unusually high quality.</AbstractNarration>
