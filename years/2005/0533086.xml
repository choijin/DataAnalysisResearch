<AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;The Research for Disabilities Education Focused Research Initiatives (RDE-FRI) will permit Boston&lt;br/&gt;University to enhance its science education programs by expanding the School of Medicine's (BUSM)&lt;br/&gt;CityLab program to further address the needs and interests of students with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;In 1996, CityLab launched its Summer Biotechnology Program (SummerLab) for high school students&lt;br/&gt;who seek an intensive one-week exposure to a life sciences laboratory. With RDE (PPD)-DEI support&lt;br/&gt;over the past two years, we have expanded the Summer Biotechnology Program into a model program&lt;br/&gt;that fully integrates youths with disabilities into a genuine laboratory experience. Participants with and&lt;br/&gt;without disabilities work together in teams towards the common goals of learning and performing&lt;br/&gt;molecular biological techniques for recombinant protein synthesis, protein isolation, and protein&lt;br/&gt;purification. Students also work together to prepare and present a poster presentation for their parents,&lt;br/&gt;friends, and BUSM faculty members. SummerLab participants also discuss science career opportunities&lt;br/&gt;and tour local biotechnology companies such as Genzyme so that they can see how their experience at&lt;br/&gt;SummerLab might lead to future employment. This seminal experience serves as a basis for further&lt;br/&gt;laboratory science education through BUSM's CityLab Scholars and Academy programs.&lt;br/&gt;This RDE-FRI effort will enable us to continue to expand access to biotechnology and biological sciences&lt;br/&gt;for students with disabilities. We will continue to expand our summer and academic year laboratory&lt;br/&gt;experiences for students so that they can pursue advanced education at the undergraduate level. We will&lt;br/&gt;also expand the pipeline of students with disabilities who consider science education and careers by&lt;br/&gt;providing practical coursework and experience for science teachers who work with students with&lt;br/&gt;disabilities. We believe that by providing teachers with a mentored experience, they will be better able to&lt;br/&gt;encourage their students with disabilities to pursue science coursework.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit Criterion:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed program will provide physical (lab bench height, flexible seating without attached chairs,&lt;br/&gt;etc.) and material (large print for visually impaired youth, interpreter for hearing impaired youth, visual&lt;br/&gt;aids and note-takers for youth with brain injuries and learning disabilities) accommodations to facilitate&lt;br/&gt;career exploration. This program will further integrate the youth with disabilities so that the students with&lt;br/&gt;and without disabilities work together and learn from one another. Students who attend these programs&lt;br/&gt;will be encouraged to pursue additional science education, either at Boston University (through CityLab&lt;br/&gt;Academy and standard undergraduate science programs) or elsewhere. We will also seek to increase the&lt;br/&gt;number of science teachers who actively promote science careers as attainable goals for youth with&lt;br/&gt;disabilities. This program will also include on-going mentoring for both students and teachers to&lt;br/&gt;reinforce positive attitudes towards science. We will also evaluate student and teacher participants'&lt;br/&gt;attitudes towards science and science careers.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts Criterion:&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the most important characteristic of this proposal is that it opens doors for youth with disabilities&lt;br/&gt;who might not have had an opportunity to appreciate the tremendous career opportunities that are&lt;br/&gt;available in the sciences. There is a strong national interest in encouraging all students to pursue&lt;br/&gt;continued study of science and mathematics so that they have the requisite background to consider a&lt;br/&gt;science career. Students with disabilities are often particularly suited to pursue science because they&lt;br/&gt;possess the intellectual capacity to become independent thinkers, but often they (and their families and&lt;br/&gt;teachers) do not see the path to a science career. This program will provide a new pathway for students&lt;br/&gt;with disabilities to explore science careers and promises to build on CityLab's success in encouraging its&lt;br/&gt;students to pursue continued study of science. We will disseminate the materials and best practices that&lt;br/&gt;emerge from this project through conventional science education and disability networks.</AbstractNarration>
