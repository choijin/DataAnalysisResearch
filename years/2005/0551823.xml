<AbstractNarration>PI: Lindenstrauss&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0140497&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum Unique Ergodicity and Rigidity in Dynamical Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed lies at the interface of dynamical &lt;br/&gt;systems and several other mathematical disciplines, and &lt;br/&gt;in particular number theory and the mathematical theory &lt;br/&gt;of Quantum Chaos. It is well known that the collections &lt;br/&gt;of invariant probability measures and closed invariant &lt;br/&gt;sets for hyperbolic maps or flows is very large; remarkably,&lt;br/&gt;in many dynamical systems of algebraic origin where there &lt;br/&gt;are two (or more) commuting hyperbolic maps or flows it is &lt;br/&gt;conjectured that there are actually very few measures or &lt;br/&gt;closed sets invariant under this bigger action. Despite (or &lt;br/&gt;perhaps because of) important contributions by several &lt;br/&gt;authors, the mystery of this rigidity property of &lt;br/&gt;multidimensional actions is still one of the central problems &lt;br/&gt;in modern ergodic theory.While seemingly unrelated, the &lt;br/&gt;methodology of the study of rigidity of multiparameter actions &lt;br/&gt;is very suitable to study the arithmetical case of the Quantum &lt;br/&gt;Unique Ergodicity Conjecture, regarding the limit of the &lt;br/&gt;spatial distribution of a free particle on certain manifolds &lt;br/&gt;in a quantum steady state as the energy of the state tends to&lt;br/&gt;infinity (the semiclassical limit).  This question has been &lt;br/&gt;considered previously by many authors mostly using tools from &lt;br/&gt;analytic number theory; the approach proposed, using the &lt;br/&gt;dynamical approach, is new and has already borne fruits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of dynamical systems gives tools to study complex &lt;br/&gt;systems, for example the evolution of a complicated deterministic&lt;br/&gt;process over time. There is a rich and distinguished tradition &lt;br/&gt;of using these powerful tools in other mathematical disciplines, &lt;br/&gt;most notably in number theory and combinatorics. The research &lt;br/&gt;proposed is connected to several of the most exciting possible &lt;br/&gt;applications, including new implications to the theory of &lt;br/&gt;quantum chaos in mathematical physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
