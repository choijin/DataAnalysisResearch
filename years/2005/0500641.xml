    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PIs Geronimo and Woerdeman will continue their investigations into&lt;br/&gt;factorization and extension problems. In particular we hope to&lt;br/&gt;develop a constructive proof of the celebrated Ferguson-Lacey&lt;br/&gt;extension theorem and build on it using the results we have&lt;br/&gt;recently obtained on the spectral factorization of positive two&lt;br/&gt;variable trigonometric polynomials. We plan to investigate in more&lt;br/&gt;detail fast algorithms for computing the structured matrices that&lt;br/&gt;arise from the two variable trigonometric moment problem as well as &lt;br/&gt;study the orthogonal polynomials that arise in this case. The PIs&lt;br/&gt;also plan to continue their individual investigation into the&lt;br/&gt;important problems arising from quantum computing and the&lt;br/&gt;asymptotics of solutions to 2nd order difference equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The types of structured matrices under study here arise in many&lt;br/&gt;problems of practical interest such as two variable&lt;br/&gt;auto-regressive models and two variable filtering. The PIs will&lt;br/&gt;try to recruit more undergraduate and graduate students to help in&lt;br/&gt;these problems as well as give courses and lectures at conferences&lt;br/&gt;to increase the impact of their efforts. In order to make the&lt;br/&gt;intellectual merit of the proposal apparent the PIs will continue&lt;br/&gt;to publish their results in well respected journals, and also&lt;br/&gt;disseminate them via the PIs' homepages, preprint servers such as&lt;br/&gt;arXiv, software sharing websites, etc.</AbstractNarration>
