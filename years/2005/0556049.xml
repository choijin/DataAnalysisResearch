<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Gioev&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will work on four problems, all of which involve asymptotic &lt;br/&gt;techniques developed in Random Matrix Theory (RMT). Problems I and II &lt;br/&gt;are concerned with the proof of universality for orthogonal and &lt;br/&gt;symplectic ensembles of random matrices with varying polynomial weights &lt;br/&gt;on the line, and with polynomial weights on the half-line, respectively. &lt;br/&gt;Problem III deals with the rigorous proof of the asymptotic expansion &lt;br/&gt;for the partition function (free energy) for orthogonal and symplectic &lt;br/&gt;ensembles with varying polynomial weights on the line which has &lt;br/&gt;applications in graph enumeration problems arising in 2D quantum gravity &lt;br/&gt;and string theory. Finally, Problem IV concerns proving various &lt;br/&gt;asymptotic formulae for the entanglement entropy of fermion systems on &lt;br/&gt;the lattice and in the continuum (this problem has connections with &lt;br/&gt;RMT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past fifty years it has become clear that Random Matrix Theory &lt;br/&gt;(RMT), initially introduced into the theoretical physics community by &lt;br/&gt;Wigner in 1950's as a model for the scattering of neutrons off large &lt;br/&gt;nuclei, has a long and extraordinarily varied list of applications not &lt;br/&gt;only in physics, but also in pure and applied mathematics, and in other &lt;br/&gt;sciences, such as cardiology. More precisely, it turns out that (the &lt;br/&gt;statistical properties of) various seemingly unrelated objects, such as &lt;br/&gt;vibration frequencies of elastic plates, bus arrival times when the &lt;br/&gt;drivers try to optimize the traffic flow, zeros of the Riemann zeta &lt;br/&gt;function, the distribution of phone numbers in a large phone directory, &lt;br/&gt;and heartbeat peaks, for example, are all remarkably well-described by &lt;br/&gt;eigenvalues of a large random matrix (RM). The fundamental question is: &lt;br/&gt;Why does RMT model such a broad variety of phenomena? The answer is that &lt;br/&gt;there should be certain limiting distribution laws for the eigenvalues of &lt;br/&gt;large RM's that are independent of the precise distribution of the matrix &lt;br/&gt;ensembles. This loose statement is known as the Universality Conjecture, &lt;br/&gt;and it can be viewed as an analog of the Central Limit Theorem in &lt;br/&gt;probability theory, but now for certain classes of correlated random &lt;br/&gt;variables (which are the eigenvalues of a RM). Universality questions &lt;br/&gt;arose very early on in RMT, and universality is widely believed to be &lt;br/&gt;true. However, a mathematical proof of universality for the so-called &lt;br/&gt;unitary ensembles was found only in the late 1990's. The PI and Deift &lt;br/&gt;have very recently proved universality in the remaining two cases, viz., &lt;br/&gt;the orthogonal and symplectic ensembles, in great generality. Problems I &lt;br/&gt;and II, which deal with continuation and extension of these results, &lt;br/&gt;will significantly extend our understanding of universality to the &lt;br/&gt;important case where the underlying equilibrium measure consists of more &lt;br/&gt;than one interval. The asymptotic expansion of the partition function &lt;br/&gt;for the three types of RM ensembles has important applications in &lt;br/&gt;mathematics and also in 2D quantum gravity and string theory. Very &lt;br/&gt;recently, in the unitary case, the expansion was rigorously established &lt;br/&gt;by Ercolani and McLaughlin. In Problem III, the PI plans to prove &lt;br/&gt;rigorously the expansion for general orthogonal and symplectic &lt;br/&gt;ensembles. This will have implications in 2D quantum gravity models &lt;br/&gt;which are not covered by the unitary case. In the emerging field of &lt;br/&gt;quantum computation, a subject currently of great interest, one of the &lt;br/&gt;basic quantities of study is the so-called entanglement entropy which &lt;br/&gt;measures the number of maximally entangled pairs that can be extracted &lt;br/&gt;from a given quantum state. In Problem IV, the PI plans to prove various &lt;br/&gt;results concerning asymptotic expansions of the entanglement entropy for &lt;br/&gt;fermions as the size of a subsystem becomes large. These results will &lt;br/&gt;considerably extend the understanding of the entanglement entropy for &lt;br/&gt;the lattice and also continuous fermion systems in higher dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
