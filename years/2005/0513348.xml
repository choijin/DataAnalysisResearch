<AbstractNarration>This award to University of Delaware by the Solid State Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research is to study structure and property relationship in a new class of electroactive molecules. It has been demonstrated by several groups that discotic molecules have high mobilities, but in many of the discotic materials made to date, it is difficult to engineer highest energy occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest energy unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels.  The synthetic scheme developed by the PI's group by earlier studies for discotic star molecules that contain a tetra substituted phenyl core and 4 electroactive arms is quite versatile and allows for engineering the energy levels and liquid crystalline phases via symmetry changes in the molecules.  With this award, Professor Galvin and her collaborators at Zelinski Institute for Organic Chemistry will prepare new stars containing alternating donor [(2,5-bis(2-thienyl)-N-dodecylpyrrole) (TPT)] and acceptor [(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)  (B)] units, amine terminated oxadiazole, phenylenevinylene or thienothiophene groups. Using these new arms, the investigators will learn how to control HOMO and LUMO levels, make molecules that absorb in the red, a property critical to photovoltaics, and delineate the structure/property relationships that govern the performance of these materials.  Students, including undergraduate students, working on this project will obtain an interdisciplinary education, and prepare them to function in industry, where teamwork and collaborating across disciplines are essential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is aimed at developing an understanding of polymers and organic molecules, and engineering them correctly to produce flexible, sturdy and durable materials for potential applications in solar cells.  This award will address questions like how does the spacing between molecules and organization of molecules in films affect their performance in solar cells.  Use of renewable energy sources including solar cells is one of many approaches to reduce dependence of United States on foreign oil.  In addition, students working on this project will be trained at the forefront of materials science, chemistry and physics and well prepared to go into industry and lead the development of advanced materials and solar cells there.  Additionally, they will work in a team with other scientists, including organic chemists from the Zelinski Institute of Organic Chemistry in Moscow, adding to their preparation for assuming leadership positions in industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
