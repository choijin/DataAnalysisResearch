<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0541055&lt;br/&gt;Krishnendu Chakrabarty&lt;br/&gt;Duke University&lt;br/&gt;Project Title: Synthesis, Test, and Reconfiguration Techniques for Microfluidics-Based Biochips&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microfluidics-based biochips offer exciting possibilities for DNA analysis, proteomic analysis involving proteins and peptides, immuno-assays, and environmental toxicity monitoring. The complexity such devices is expected to become significant in the near future due to the need for multiple and concurrent biochemical assays on multifunctional and reconfigurable platforms. There is a need to deliver the same level of computer-aided design (CAD) support to the biochip designer that the semiconductor industry now takes for granted. The goal of this project is to develop top-down system-level CAD tools for the synthesis, testing and reconfiguration of electrowetting-based digital microfluidic biochips. These CAD tools will allow designers to harness new technology that is rapidly emerging for integrated biofluidics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CAD tools being developed as part of this project will allow biochip users to describe biochemical assays at high levels of abstraction. Synthesis tools will then map behavioral descriptions to a droplet-based microfluidic biochip and generate an optimized schedule of assay operations, the binding of assay operations to functional units, and the layout and droplet flow-paths for the biochip. Cost-effective testing techniques are being developed to detect faults after manufacture and during field operation. On-line and off-line reconfiguration techniques, being incorporated in these CAD tools, can easily bypass faults once they are detected. Thus the biochip user can concentrate on the development of the nano- and micro-scale bioassays, leaving assay optimization and implementation details to design automation tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project bridges several research communities, e.g., microfluidics, MEMS, electronic design automation, and biochemistry. The results of this project will lead to the development of miniaturized and low-cost biosensors. These sensors will revolutionize data acquisition and analysis for air quality studies and clinical diagnostics, enabling a transformation in environmental monitoring, healthcare, exposure assessment, emergency response, and public policy. The small size and high fault tolerance make these systems ideal for personal samplers, e.g., for clinical diagnostics, and to measure human exposure to air toxins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
