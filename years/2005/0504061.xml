    <AbstractNarration>The American Meteorological Society will publish a special edition of the Journal of Climate dedicated to the description of results and interpretations of long control runs of the Community Climate System Model, CCSM-3, recently conducted jointly by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), university, and other laboratory scientists. Invited contributions from a number of world experts in climate modeling will be included in this special issue. Depending upon the pace of the peer review process, the Special Issue is expected to be published in mid-to-late 2005. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Special issue will serve to document the latest version of the CCSM, the version used for the current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change science assessment. It will serve many university scientists and students who use the CCSM-3 and its simulated and projected climate output as climate research data tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The CCSM is a comprehensive climate model used by over one hundred U.S. scientists and advanced students. Documentation of the new version of the model, CCSM-3, is a critical contribution to both of these groups of users, as well as to the scientists who have developed the model. The Special Issue will serve as a reference document for climate scientists and climate impacts scientists and students who will be using model data to conduct their research and teaching.</AbstractNarration>
