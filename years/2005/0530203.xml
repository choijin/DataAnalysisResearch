<AbstractNarration>PIRE Microfluidic Technology and Applications:  A Collaboration with the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a new multidisciplinary, multinational model to internationalize engineering education and research. Twelve distinguished scientists from the Technical University of Braunschweig in Germany will partner with eight leading University of Rhode Island (URI) researchers to implement innovative strategies for integrating international research and graduate education. The partnership will build on the success of URI's distinctive undergraduate International Engineering Program (IEP) and the Dual Degree Master's Program to create a new International Ph.D. This international education and research partnership will work collaboratively to: 1) develop sustainable, multidisciplinary international research opportunities from the undergraduate through Ph.D. level, 2) capitalize on complementary research strengths to create innovative discoveries, 3) create international internship opportunities for graduate students, and 4) provide graduate students with a rich international research experience to increase their ability to compete in the global marketplace.&lt;br/&gt;  The proposed research will be directed towards developing microfluidic technology for two diverse applications. The first is to develop a prototype lab-on-a chip for detecting disease biomarkers. The technology could play an integral role in responding to bioterrorism by providing a tool for early detection of infection prior to developing disease symptoms. The second application will lead to a better understanding of the triggering of landslide tsunamis. The new model will integrate research and education, create an infrastructure that provides global research and internship opportunities for graduate as well as undergraduate students, and will erase traditional departmental and cultural boundaries.  This project receives support from NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering and Division of Chemical and Transport Systems.</AbstractNarration>
