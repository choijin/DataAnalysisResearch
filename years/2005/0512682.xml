<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop a novel class of versatile, high-yield, nanoparticle ceramic systems for Three-Dimensional Printing (3DP) of biocompatible composite materials for dental restoration applications. The project will focus on the innovation of nanoparticle ceramic materials systems for 3DP, which offer flexible composition, tailorable precursor viscosity, and produce a ceramic yield in the range 50-70 wt. percentage. Further yield increase can be obtained by introducing nanosized particle fillers to the binder inks. A key component in this effort is investigation of the interactions between the nanopowder and the transportation liquid, and the influence of the composition of the entire system on the sintering and densification behavior of printed parts. These issues are of immense technical importance for robust and reliable processing of inkjet printed ceramic objects, specifically with ongoing focus on improving the print resolution. Understanding the complex interplay between composition processing, processing-conversion and conversion-microstructure will provide fundamental ceramic processing knowledge as well as establish technical and commercial feasibility for producing competitive, commercially viable dental materials by 3DP rapid manufacturing using the novel nanoparticle inks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader (commercial) impact will be In addition to the commercial benefit and high potential economic payoff expected from a successful effort, the proposed project would have significant impact on broader inkjet and 3D printing research, as well as on the academic and career preparation of students at all levels. The impact on multipurpose, commercially viable inkjet and 3D printing derives from the detailed and systematic investigation of specific ceramic inks for inkjet printing, including the study of solid-solid interactions, solid-liquid interactions, and electrostatic repulsion in solution. The principles learned about processing parameters, thermal conversion, and final properties of the simple printed units will be applied to geometrically intricate parts, thereby enabling further discoveries and follow-on research.</AbstractNarration>
