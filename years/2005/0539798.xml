    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will establish the feasibility of detecting biological warfare agents (BWAs) using a holographic interferometer. Bio- and Nanotechnologies are enabling this innovation through the preparation of both affinity-based nanoparticles and biosensor unit of the detector system. Affinity-based superparamagnetic nanoparticles will be utilized as carriers to capture and deliver BWAs in a magnetic field gradient onto a chemically-matched biosensor element. The compact, sensitive and selective detector system will be modified to enable application of a switchable magnetic field gradient that will attract and repel biosample-loaded superparamagnetic particles from the analyte delivery stream onto and away from the detector's biosensor surface. Sequential interferometric measurements will be made and quantifiable signal will be processed from this data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology has already been demonstrated as effective in characterizing vapor phase chemicals. Application of the adaptive holographic interferometry technology for detection of biomolecules and particles represents an extraordinary opportunity, both in terms of scientific advancement and market potential. Such a device applied to medical diagnostics could revolutionize and economically simplify diagnosis of pandemic infections such as HIV in remote locations as well as point of care in physician's offices. It could help drug development companies to lower costs, which would slow the pace of ever-increasing healthcare expenses. &lt;br/&gt;Social uncertainty regarding the terrorist threat could be limited, based on ubiquitous deployment of a highly sensitive and selective yet economical biological and chemical warfare agent detection device.</AbstractNarration>
