<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes an international conference on partial hyperpbolicity and related topics to be held in Chicago in May, 2006. &lt;br/&gt;The goals of the conference are to disseminate recent breakthroughs in the field and to promote integration of and collaboration among the different approaches to the area that have developed in the past 10 years. This will be the third conference in a series that began with an NSF-supported conference organized by the PIs in May, 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topic of partial hyperbolicity emerged in the early seventies and has become a central direction in which the theory of complicated ("chaotic") dynamical systems has developed.  The study of partial hyperbolicity and related systems has extended significantly beyond the classical setting of hyperbolic dynamics, driven by the realization that many practical applications of dynamical systems to experimental phenomena do require a much broader theory.  The broader impact and intellectual merits of this proposal are multifold and interrelated:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  * Because of the conference focus on minicourses, graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s within the US will be exposed to cutting edge research in the area, even before this knowledge has been disseminated by other means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  *A portion of the plenary talks in this conference will be devoted to recent applications of the theory of partially hyperbolic systems to mechanical systems, as well as certain systems in biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  *The conference will bring together participants from four continents; the expectation is that the conference will lead to new collaborative ventures between these participants and US participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  *Finally, the conference will increase the worldwide visibility of US researchers in the area of partially hyperbolic and related dynamical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
