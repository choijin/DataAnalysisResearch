<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project, deploying a large-scale open sensor network testbed for urban monitoring (called CitySense), aims at building a large-scale, urban sensor testbed of nodes powered by city electricity and then operating it as an open facility for academic and industrial groups to experiment with novel distributed sensing architectures. The modular network nodes will be attached to streetlights for power. These nodes contain sufficient processing power and memory to handle a wide range of experimental software, plus radios to interconnect all the nodes by multi-hop networking across Cambridge to its wireline access points. Each node comes with software in flash to provide a robust sensor network architecture including reliable ad hoc networking. CitySense will be tested with a specific application: monitoring air pollution transport in a dense urban environment. Aiming at pushing the envelope for sensor network testbeds, CitySense contains a basic set of meteorological and air quality sensors supporting a broad range of research projects in large-scale sensor networks. Enabling many research experiments with a real large-scale in-situ WSN, the overall research focuses on:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-High-level programming models for WSN,&lt;br/&gt;-Resource sharing among multiple users of the testbed,&lt;br/&gt;-Data collection from geographically diverse sensor nets, and&lt;br/&gt;-Urban-scale air pollution monitoring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: By providing a permanent, extensible, public testbed, CitySense should have significant impact on the development of large-scale wireless sensor network systems. The open city-wide testbed allows external groups to remotely download their software images into all the nodes in the network, or into a sensor swath when multiple groups share the testbed. Monitoring air pollution transport in a dense urban environment, the application constitutes one of the first high-resolution studies of pollution and its effect on the urban population. Moreover, CitySense will be used as a tool to teach distributed systems concepts. Outreach involves curriculum development for K-12 in sensor networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Some of the key outcomes of this project were:  Design of a low-cost sensor node that withstands harsh outdoor environment Performance analysis of wireless networking in urban deployment Centralized web-site for managing configuration of sensor network Programmable outdoor wireless mesh testbed Watchdog process to reboot nodes into a stable OS image when network/node failure is detected.   By the end of the project in 2010, CitySense supported a number of users:   Public health and civil engineering researchers from Tufts University used the nodes to track particulate matter spread from roadways;  K-12 educators at Cambridge Friends School used data from our weather sensors in the design a middle school science curriculum;  RF antenna performance studies for mobile, multi-path rich environments Harvard graduate student studies on WiFi usage patterns in a city:   "Mapping the Urban Wireless Landscape with Argos," Ian Rose and Matt Welsh.
