<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposer plans to work on a variety of problems in number theory and &lt;br/&gt;combinatorics.  Among these are the problem of determining the structure of &lt;br/&gt;subsets of finite fields having few arithmetic progressions. For example, suppose &lt;br/&gt;S is a subset of the integers modulo p having about p/2 elements, and having the &lt;br/&gt;least number of three-term arithmetic progressions among all sets with about &lt;br/&gt;p/2 elements.  How many three-term progressions does S have, and what can &lt;br/&gt;one say about the structure of S?  The square dependence problem: pick integers &lt;br/&gt;at random less than x until a subset of these integers products to a square.  &lt;br/&gt;Determine the expected stopping time of this process.  This problem is central to &lt;br/&gt;running time estimates for integer factoring algorithms, problems related to &lt;br/&gt;sum-product estimates in finite fields (given a subset of a finite field, how large &lt;br/&gt;must the sumset or product set of that subset be?), and problems related to the &lt;br/&gt;complexity of inverting certain  number theoretical functions (how difficult is it &lt;br/&gt;to decide whether an integer n is in the image of the Euler phi function?).   The &lt;br/&gt;proposer has already made substantial progress on all of these problems, and &lt;br/&gt;forsees a rich research programme developing in the next several years. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Two good examples of the research problems on which the proposer plans to work, &lt;br/&gt;both from the same area of mathematics, but of a very different character, are the &lt;br/&gt;square dependence problem and the three-term progression problem:  When one &lt;br/&gt;uses the internet to make purchases, ones credit card information is encrypted &lt;br/&gt;using any of several coding schemes called ``public key encryption''.  There are &lt;br/&gt;methods to break these codes (for, example the quadratic sieve); however, just how &lt;br/&gt;fast they work is not well understood.  A good solution to the square dependence  &lt;br/&gt;problem would give one a very precise estimate for how quickly these methods &lt;br/&gt;work, as well as indicate how one might tweak them to make them run faster.  &lt;br/&gt;The other problem, the three-term progression problem, concerns triples of &lt;br/&gt;numbers which are equally spaced, such 3,5,7 or 11,22,33.  A fundamental, &lt;br/&gt;well-studied problem in combinatorial mathematics is to determine when dense &lt;br/&gt;collections of integers contain such triples;  for example, if you pick 100 numbers &lt;br/&gt;from among the numbers 1 through 1000, must your 100 numbers have one of &lt;br/&gt;these triples?  No one knows exactly what makes certain collections of numbers &lt;br/&gt;have no or few of these triples; however, the proposer has a research plan to &lt;br/&gt;partially answer this question, and already has an accepted publication in a &lt;br/&gt;peer reviewed journal (JCTA) on the problem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
