<AbstractNarration>     Applications of elastic rod theory range from modeling the&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of DNA to the coiling of oceanic cables.  The commonly&lt;br/&gt;used descriptive equations for elastic rods dynamics are due to&lt;br/&gt;Kirchhoff.  However, the Kirchhoff model is complex and only few&lt;br/&gt;classes of explicit solutions are known and analyzed.  In a series&lt;br/&gt;of papers, Goriely and coworkers obtained a reduced model&lt;br/&gt;consisting of amplitude equations for the dynamics of a twisted&lt;br/&gt;rod beyond the threshold of its first writhing instability. &lt;br/&gt;Solutions to these equations are known to correspond to fully&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional deformations of rods.  The goals of this project&lt;br/&gt;are twofold.  Firstly, the investigator studies existence and&lt;br/&gt;stability properties for a large class of explicit solutions of&lt;br/&gt;the amplitude equations.  Secondly, the methods developed to study&lt;br/&gt;the stability of these solutions are extended to partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations that are completely integrable or have&lt;br/&gt;certain symmetry properties.  More precisely, the first task&lt;br/&gt;involves a systematic study of existence and stability of coherent&lt;br/&gt;structures for amplitude equations.  Existence is studied by means&lt;br/&gt;of symmetry analysis, while stability is addressed using two&lt;br/&gt;different tools: the Evans function and Hamiltonian techniques. &lt;br/&gt;The second task is a general study of the Evans function.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator examines the relation between the Evans function and&lt;br/&gt;complete integrability and, in particular, is interested in the&lt;br/&gt;connections with a particular notion of integrability, the&lt;br/&gt;Painleve Test.  When integrability is not present, it is still&lt;br/&gt;possible for the equations to admit interesting Lie symmetries. &lt;br/&gt;The goal is to show that important information on the Evans&lt;br/&gt;function can be retrieved from these symmetries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Mechanics is a fascinating field of physics.  Its main&lt;br/&gt;purpose is the study of interactions of particles in the presence&lt;br/&gt;of forces such as gravity.  In contrast to the dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;particles, the study of continuous media, such as fluids or&lt;br/&gt;elastic bodies, is challenging and not yet entirely well&lt;br/&gt;understood.  This is due to the fact that continuous media behave&lt;br/&gt;in numerous and complex ways.  For example, it is difficult to&lt;br/&gt;describe mathematically the twisting and bending of elastic rods,&lt;br/&gt;but approximate models do exist.  The study of the dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;elastic rods is a field of research that is interesting in itself&lt;br/&gt;as it gives rise to beautiful and complex mathematical structures. &lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, understanding elastic rods is crucial for&lt;br/&gt;applications in several domains of science.  In biology, rod&lt;br/&gt;models are used to describe the coiling of different structures&lt;br/&gt;such as DNA.  In engineering, elastic rods are used to study the&lt;br/&gt;behavior of submarine cables.  In this project, the investigator&lt;br/&gt;focuses on a model that has been proven to be successful in&lt;br/&gt;describing the dynamics of rods: the Kirchhoff equations.  These&lt;br/&gt;are differential equations, that is they are equations involving&lt;br/&gt;derivatives.  The solutions to these equations represent possible&lt;br/&gt;behaviors for elastic rods.  The main purpose of the project is to&lt;br/&gt;study stability properties of elastic rod models.  Stability is a&lt;br/&gt;fundamental concept in physics: for example, in theory, it is&lt;br/&gt;possible to make a pencil stand on its lead but, in practice,&lt;br/&gt;because that is such an unstable state, it cannot be done.  In the&lt;br/&gt;example just described, the study of stability is very simple and&lt;br/&gt;there is no need for a mathematical analysis to prove or disprove&lt;br/&gt;the stability of the system.  The concept of stability carries&lt;br/&gt;over to solutions of differential equations such as the Kirchhoff&lt;br/&gt;equations.  In this context, stability takes an abstract form and&lt;br/&gt;its study often involves sophisticated mathematical tools.  The&lt;br/&gt;study of stability is of fundamental importance because only&lt;br/&gt;stable solutions can be realized experimentally.  Unstable&lt;br/&gt;solutions, just like in the case of the pencil balancing on its&lt;br/&gt;point, although they exist in theory will not be observed.  Hence,&lt;br/&gt;with stability studies, one can distinguish the solutions that can&lt;br/&gt;be realized experimentally from the ones that cannot.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator proposes new ways of investigating stability&lt;br/&gt;mathematically.  The methods he develops are applied to elastic&lt;br/&gt;rods and other applications.</AbstractNarration>
