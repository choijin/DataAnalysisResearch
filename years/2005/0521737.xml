<AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Page A&lt;br/&gt;Miriam R. Levin&lt;br/&gt;NSF Proposal&lt;br/&gt;Inventing and International Culture of Change (1870-1930)&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are asking for $17,736 from the National Science Foundation to fund three workshops&lt;br/&gt;over an 18-month period over two consecutive NSF fiscal years. Together these workshops&lt;br/&gt;will allow six scholars to move forward with a comparative study examining how scientific&lt;br/&gt;and technical change directed by groups of elites created a new form of industrial life in&lt;br/&gt;nations across the globe, including the United States, Western Europe and Japan. We are&lt;br/&gt;going to be examining the period from 1870 to 1930, a moment in which the forces of&lt;br/&gt;modernity experienced crises and a time that includes what is known as the second&lt;br/&gt;industrial revolution. This revolution was essentially an urban phenomenon, taking place&lt;br/&gt;in large metropolitan centers such as London, Paris, and Berlin. Our project will focus&lt;br/&gt;on how urban elites active in an international exchange of ideas constructed a new urban&lt;br/&gt;culture though the establishment of new science and technology related institutions,&lt;br/&gt;programs and projects that reconfigured the relationship between humans and nature&lt;br/&gt;resituated in time and space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We believe we are breaking new ground in two ways: First, exploring previously overlooked striking similarities, interconnections and differences among geographically distant industrializing centers. Second, by employing a research model that introduces the comparative mode and depends on the collaborative work of six scholars we can establish how and why these connections and differences came to be and helped structure cultural change on a global scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include encouraging comparative collaborative studies among historians of science and technology, providing a model for the integration of science and technology into urban studies, the history of urbanization, and the history of modernity, and the dissemination of this information and approach to the academic communities where workshops will be held.  The project emphasizes developments on a global scale, and  can thereby attraction the attention of those interested in global scientific and technological developments.  The project will not only interest scholars across the social sciences, but also those interested in mobilizing resources to transform urban economies, infrastructure, and communities. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
