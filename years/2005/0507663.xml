<AbstractNarration>AST 0507663&lt;br/&gt;Becker&lt;br/&gt;On the 20th anniversary of the Very Large Array, the best available survey of the&lt;br/&gt;Galactic Plane at centimeter wavelengths were the 5-10-arcminute resolution Effelsberg&lt;br/&gt;surveys at 20 and 11 cm. Two years ago, Drs David Helfand and Robert Becker began&lt;br/&gt;a program to improve the resolution and sensitivity of the image of the Galaxy by two&lt;br/&gt;orders of magnitude with MAGPIS, the Multi-Array Galactic Plane Imaging Survey. They&lt;br/&gt;have just completed imaging the Plane from longitude l = 5 to l = 32 with a resolution of&lt;br/&gt;5 arcseconds, a dynamic range of 1000:1, and a point-source sensitivity of " 1 mJy.&lt;br/&gt;These images are publicly available at the website http://third.ucllnl.org/gps, and will find&lt;br/&gt;use in a wide variety of applications ranging from the construction of a complete census&lt;br/&gt;of the Galaxy's star formation in conjunction with the ongoing Spitzer Plane surveys, to&lt;br/&gt;the discovery of the youngest supernova remnants in the Galaxy, to calculation of the&lt;br/&gt;expected rate of LIGO signals from merging neutron stars. This collaborative project&lt;br/&gt;award for Dr. Helfand at Columbia University and Dr. Robert Becker at the University of&lt;br/&gt;California at Davis will be used to continue the creation of this definitive image of the&lt;br/&gt;Galactic Plane and to support its public distribution, as well as to use the survey results&lt;br/&gt;in a variety of science programs now becoming possible as a consequence of new&lt;br/&gt;views through the Galaxy at radio, mid-IR, and X-ray wavelengths.&lt;br/&gt;The data products created in this project are all publicly available, and will find use in&lt;br/&gt;Galactic studies for decades to come. The tools created for accessing these data may&lt;br/&gt;well also find wide applicability. The project will also provide many opportunities for&lt;br/&gt;integrating graduate and undergraduate education with the research effort. These&lt;br/&gt;researchers have advised to date more than nineteen PhD physicists and astronomers,&lt;br/&gt;and several more will become involved with this project. Six of the last eight PhDs are&lt;br/&gt;women, and there will be a continuing effort to focus on redressing the&lt;br/&gt;under-representation of women and minorities in our discipline.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
