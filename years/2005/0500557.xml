<AbstractNarration>This project is in two separate major research areas. The general&lt;br/&gt;Theory of m-Quasi-invariants  and the Theory of Macdonald Polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;m-Quasi-invariants originally arose in the study of particle dynamics&lt;br/&gt;but have emerged as a truly fascinating Algebraic Combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;subject. For each Coxeter Group G there is an associated one parameter&lt;br/&gt;family of subspaces which interpolates between the ordinary polynomial &lt;br/&gt;ring and the ring of G-invariants. The m-Quasi-Invariants of $G$ are &lt;br/&gt;simply polynomials which, upon the action of the difference operator &lt;br/&gt;corresponding to a reflecting hyperplane of G, they  produce a factor that &lt;br/&gt;is divisible by the equation of the reflecting hyperplane raised to the &lt;br/&gt;power 2m+1. This theory has been extensively developped, from the &lt;br/&gt;algebraic point of view, in fundamental papers by Feigin-Veselov,  and &lt;br/&gt;Felder-Veselov, and  culminated in  certain conjectures  which were proved &lt;br/&gt;by Etingov-Ginsburg in 2002. Jointly with N. Wallach the PI discovered&lt;br/&gt;that  several constructs associated to $m$-quasi-invariants,&lt;br/&gt;such as the associated Baker-Achieser function, encode some truly&lt;br/&gt;remarkable combinatorial properties of the corresponding Coxeter group.&lt;br/&gt;The present project is to explore the theory from the combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;point of view. The early successes obtained in the study of the simplest &lt;br/&gt;cases of the dihedral groups strongly suggest  that such a study should be &lt;br/&gt;conducive to significant discoveries in various areas of Mathematics &lt;br/&gt;ranging from Combinatorics, Representation Theory and the Theory of &lt;br/&gt;special functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since its 1988 discovery, the Macdonald symmetric function basis has&lt;br/&gt;progressively emerged as a central element in the  connection between&lt;br/&gt;Representation Theory and the Theory of Symmetric Functions.&lt;br/&gt;After more than a decade of research in  the Theory of Macdonald &lt;br/&gt;polynomials, the PI,  M. Haiman  and collaborators have been led to a &lt;br/&gt;variety of conjectures in Representation Theory, Algebraic Geometry, &lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics and Symmetric Function Theory. Efforts in proving these &lt;br/&gt;conjectures have yielded fundamental facts and methods  in each of these &lt;br/&gt;areas. Recently J. Haglund discovered and in collaboration with Haiman and &lt;br/&gt;Loehr proved a remarkable purely combinatorial formula for a suitably &lt;br/&gt;modified family of Macdonald polynomials. This discovery opens up a &lt;br/&gt;variety of research problems involving some of the conjectures&lt;br/&gt;which up to quite recently appeared inaccesible. The Pi plans to dedidcate&lt;br/&gt;a substantial portion of the projected research effort in this area in&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with his PhD students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The   proposed work, involves extensive computer explorations and&lt;br/&gt;transfer of information across several mathematical boundaries, from&lt;br/&gt;Representation Theory to the Theory Special Functions and then to &lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics. These transfers provide an invaluable vehicle of discovery, &lt;br/&gt;since results and mechanisms which may be quite obvious in one of these &lt;br/&gt;areas often translate in highly  non trivial and unexpected facts in one &lt;br/&gt;of the other areas. It should be mentioned that symbolic manipulation &lt;br/&gt;software  such as MAPLE and MATHEMATICA combined with the present &lt;br/&gt;generation of fast processors have literally  transformed many  branches &lt;br/&gt;of mathematics into experimental sciences. Moreover computer data can be &lt;br/&gt;successfully used not only in the discovery of results but also in the &lt;br/&gt;construction of proof. The two basic projects that are the focus of the &lt;br/&gt;planned  research are also highly suitable for the training of young &lt;br/&gt;researchers and the opportunity that it provides them to discover and &lt;br/&gt;experience the manner in which research  can be carried out in the 21st &lt;br/&gt;century. Thus all the research problems created by this project&lt;br/&gt;are invariably brought  in the the class room to be shared with students&lt;br/&gt;and collaborators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
