    <AbstractNarration>0532858&lt;br/&gt;Shastry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports the U.S.-India Planning Visit: Momentum Dependent Theories for Strongly Correlated Electron Systems. US PI Sriram Shastry, University of California Santa Cruz will visit the Indian Institute of Sciences (IISc), Bangalore to meet with Indian counterpart H.R. Krishnamurthy. They will set up collaboration to study the effect of momentum dependent strong correlations, in an attempt to understand the nature of the fermi surface renormalizations. The problem of strong correlations is widely recognized as a frontier area in condensed matter physics. The work proposed here is of fundamental interest in that it concerns some outstanding problems in condensed matter physics, namely the role of strong correlations in magnetism and superconductivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This research deals with an important scientific problem. Professor Krishnamurthy's group at Bangalore is doing computational work that is complementary to the analytical approaches used by Professor Shastry and his group at Santa Cruz and lead to different non-linear numerical schemes. The PIs are both world-class scientists and have successfully collaborated in the past on problems in strongly correlated systems. The proposed effort is a natural extension of the earlier one and of greater scope. The US PI intends to submit the proposal that results from this planning grant to a competition in the Division of Materials Research.</AbstractNarration>
