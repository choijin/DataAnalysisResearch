<AbstractNarration>This project investigates modeling approaches for service provision planning using geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial analytical methods. The focus is on intended performance using location coverage models. The intent of such models is to ensure suitable service is provided to an entire geographic area, yet abstraction and representation of space may prohibit this from occurring. This suggests the existence of the modifiable areal unit problem in current coverage modeling approaches. To address this issue, spatial optimization approaches are proposed for regional coverage that can be characterized as frame independent. As such, these new approaches will not be significantly influenced by the abstraction and representation of geographic space, which is the case with current modeling approaches. Novel exact and heuristic approaches for solving proposed models will be pursued. The substantive context for regional coverage models is broad, ranging from service/personnel scheduling to emergency management to environmental sustainability. Thus, the project will make contributions through its intent to address issues associated with emergency service provision, and warning siren siting in particular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore quantitative approaches for supporting geographical siting decisions associated with emergency services, such as warning sirens, radar, and police/fire stations. This research will refine how this particular spatial problem domain is abstracted and modeled, and doing so in the context of expanding geographic information science theory.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
