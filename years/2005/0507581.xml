<AbstractNarration>AST-0507581&lt;br/&gt;Stanley Owocki&lt;br/&gt;University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;Radiation Hydrodynamics of Porosity-Mediated Mass Loss from Super-Eddington Stars&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nature of mass loss/wind generation from massive stars with luminosities near the Eddington limit will be investigated. The motivation lies in the need to understand the origin and consequences of extreme stellar winds and associated mass loss from Luminous Blue Variable stars such as Eta Carinae. Of special importance here is the potential role of continuum-driven mass loss which may play an important role in determining the fate of massive stars with low abundances of heavy elements, including the super-massive pure hydrogen/helium stars which may be responsible for the re-ionization of the early universe. Two key aspects will be explored in four complementary subprojects: the role of small scale density variations in reducing the coupling between radiation and matter; and the role of rapid rotation and accompanying equatorial gravity darkening which could lead to bipolar mass loss (as seen in Eta Carinae). Such mass loss may also lead to the rapid core rotation associated with the hypernova model of gamma ray bursts. The overall goal is the development of a self-consistent radiation hydrodynamic model of the spatial structure that can moderate radiative driving of extensive mass loss in very luminous stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow will be trained in developing, testing, and interpreting the hydrodynamic models used in this project. The work performed by the graduate student will form the basis of their Ph.D. thesis. Results will be disseminated through articles in popular journals and public talks at all levels (as well as professional journals in astronomy).</AbstractNarration>
