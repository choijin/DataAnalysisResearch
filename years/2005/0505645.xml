<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0505645&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Xiaodong Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the central themes in differential geometry is to&lt;br/&gt;understand curvature and its implications in terms of geometric&lt;br/&gt;and topological properties. Despite the enormous progress made&lt;br/&gt;during the last several decades, there remain many fundamental&lt;br/&gt;problems.  This project is to study several such problems&lt;br/&gt;involving the scalar curvature. The first one is to understand&lt;br/&gt;the boundary effect on manifolds with convex boundary and&lt;br/&gt;positive scalar curvature. This is closely related to&lt;br/&gt;understanding quasi-local mass in general relativity. A key&lt;br/&gt;specific case is whether a compact three-manifold with scalar&lt;br/&gt;curvature bigger or equal to six whose boundary is totally&lt;br/&gt;geodesic and isometric to the standard two-sphere is isometric to&lt;br/&gt;the three dimensional hemisphere. The second problem is whether&lt;br/&gt;on a compact hyperbolic three-manifold the Yamabe number is&lt;br/&gt;achieved by the hyperbolic metric. If true it will be a&lt;br/&gt;remarkable generalization of several deep results in Riemannian&lt;br/&gt;geometry. It is equivalent to the question whether the hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;metric has smaller volume than any other metric with the same&lt;br/&gt;scalar curvature. These problems definitely will serve as great&lt;br/&gt;source of inspiration and lead to many other fascinating&lt;br/&gt;problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have a broad impact outside the field of&lt;br/&gt;geometric analysis. These important problems are closely related&lt;br/&gt;to theoretical physics, particularly general relativity. Their&lt;br/&gt;solutions will greatly enhance our understanding of spacetime&lt;br/&gt;structures.  It is also conceivable that understanding boundary&lt;br/&gt;effect under various curvature assumptions will have applications&lt;br/&gt;in other areas of science and engineering. The author hopes that&lt;br/&gt;the project will also have a positive contribution to&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate education and training.  It will be&lt;br/&gt;part of the author's joint efforts with his colleagues to&lt;br/&gt;strengthen the graduqate program in geometric analysis at&lt;br/&gt;Michigan State University.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
