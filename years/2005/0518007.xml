<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metaphor is pervasive in both spoken and written communications.  Metaphorical statements can be used to describe an attitude object or issue (e.g., Drug abuse is a social cancer) or a person (e.g., Saddam Hussein is a contemporary Hitler).  Yet, scientific research that examines how metaphor influences persuasion and impression formation is severely lacking.  The proposed research is designed to fill this gap in the scientific literature.  This research focuses on four core theoretical hypotheses.  (1) When used appropriately, metaphorical language provides the listener with a coherent image of the communication topic that helps the listener to better understand and think about a communication.  (2) On the other hand, inappropriate use of metaphor can actually reduce comprehension of a communication and interfere with the listener's ability to carefully think about a communication topic. (3) Metaphorical language can provide the listener with a unified or holistic image of the communication topic, and thereby increase the listener's ability to think about the communication topic in an efficient and integrated manner.  (4) Metaphorical language can elicit an epiphany in the listener, and thereby stimulate interest in the communication topic.  Specific predictions derived on the basis of these four core hypotheses will be examined in eight scientific experiments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be of value not only to social psychologists; but also linguists, communication researchers, political scientists, political strategists, marketers, advertisers, education researchers, supervisors, and counselors.  The findings of this research can be used to develop communication strategies that facilitate learning in educational settings, facilitate the dissemination of health information to the mass public, increase the effectiveness of inter-cultural communication, increase communication effectiveness between therapists (or counselors) and their clients, and increase the public's motivation and ability to carefully evaluate political communications.  The present research also provides a foundation for future work that examines the metaphorical underpinnings of stereotyping, and the implementation of communication strategies that can be used to reduce prejudice and discrimination.  The present research will also provide research training and/or educational support for graduate (Ph.D.) students, and help introduce hundreds of university research participants to the field of social psychology.&lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
