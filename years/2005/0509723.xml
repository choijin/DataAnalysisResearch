<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0509723 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Zonglu Susan Hua, SUNY-Buffalo&lt;br/&gt;Title: Novel approach to microfluidic sensing and regulation for active flow control&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is focused on fundamental study aimed at developing a novel electrolytic bubble-based sensing mechanism that would enable accurate and sensitive measurement of fluid flow characteristics within the microfluidic channels. The approach to bubble-based sensing is based on that gas bubbles are electrical insulators and the resistance of a microfluidic channel containing the bubble is a sensitive measure of the bubble size, and hence factors that affect it - pressure, flow rate, etc. The approach would add a new group of flow sensing elements into the functional scheme of the microfluidic lab-chip. Both bubble volume and bubble deflation rate are  utilized as the sensing modalities. A family of generic sensors including pressure sensors, flow meters, and a novel flow regulator will be developed. These sensors will be designed, characterized, and calibrated in detail towards optimizing and enhancing their sensitivity and dynamic response. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit of the these activities include fundamental understanding of microfluidics, as well as broad applications in fields ranging from engineering, biotechnology, to combinatorial and analytical chemistry. Broader educational and outreach impact involve training of undergraduate, graduate, minority, and women students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
