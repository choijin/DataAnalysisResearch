    <AbstractNarration>The MPS Distinguished International Postdoctoral Fellowship Program (MPS-DRF) enables U.S. scientists to conduct research abroad. The fellowship allows awardees to establish long-term international collaborations that will benefit them and the U.S. scientific community by developing international connections and perspectives in future science leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a 24-month research fellowship for Dr. Jeremy S. Arey to work with Professor Ursula Rothlisberger and her group at the Laboratory of Computational Chemistry and Biochemistry, Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland. The proposed work will attempt to resolve the mechanisms governing: (1) the MutY search for DNA lesion sites; (2) MutY recognition of and binding to lesion sites; (3) the catalytic adenine cleavage by MutY; and (4) the MutY release step. These problems will be addressed using mixed quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical molecular dynamics simulations, applying enhanced sampling techniques to treat processes for long time scales (minutes to hours).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Rothlisberger is a leader in this area of research and has an international reputation in the sub-field of quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics. Prof. Rothlisberger's Lausanne Laboratory, with 7 postdoctoral students and 9 Ph.D. students currently in her research group, are ideally set up to provide superb facilities and good opportunities for collaboration. This broadening experience will provide Dr. Arey with a strong foundation to return to the U.S. to pursue his plans for an academic career in a research area of growing importance.</AbstractNarration>
