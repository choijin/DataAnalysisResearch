<AbstractNarration>Astronomy (11) This project is developing tools and materials that can combine science and technology experiences through radio astronomy for faculty and students at community colleges. Community colleges represent an important resource that can help fulfill national STEM education goals, and MIT Haystack Observatory is working with faculty and students at Middlesex Community College (Massachusetts) and at Roane State Community College (Tennessee) to develop and test the materials in preparation for wider dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project involves development of a very small radio telescope (VSRT) system to introduce students to radio science technology and astronomical observations. All components in the VSRT are commercially available through radio equipment outlets and can be easily assembled according to instructions being developed. The VSRT uses a 0.5 meter satellite TV antenna and operates at 12.5 GHz. It can be easily pointed at the Sun to observe its emitted radio flux and can be used with a second similar antenna for higher angular resolution radio interferometry experiments using transit or pointed observations of the Sun. Total cost of a dual-antenna system is estimated to be less than $500.  The VSRT provides an opportunity for students to learn the technical aspects of radio wave measurements through assembly and operation of the VSRT, and to make astronomical measurements and interpret them. The physical concepts of radio emission, radio wave propagation, interferometry, angular resolution, and solar bursts are examples of the educational projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The observatory is working with nearby Middlesex Community College to develop educational materials at increasing levels of challenge to accompany the instrumentation, Beta-testing of the VSRT is being carried out with Roane State Community College faculty and students to verify the feasibility of the system to be disseminated to a larger-community college audience. The associated community-college faculty and students are evaluating the effectiveness of the VSRT as an educational science and technology tool and its success in meeting the established goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The VSRT instrumentation is low cost, easily portable, and does not require large laboratory space.  It utilizes commonly available equipment, and it combines both technology and science. The VSRT therefore can also be used by high school teachers and students and will be a useful instrument for public outreach. Radio waves are prevalent in the many gadgets that we commonly use in daily life such as cell phones, satellite TV, and wireless networking, and the VSRT can help explain the principles associated with the operation of these devices. Haystack Observatory has successfully developed other tools and materials for undergraduate education using 2-m and 37-m radio telescopes. While these systems continue to be successfully used for advanced undergraduates, they are beyond the means of many community colleges and other small colleges.  The current project is an outgrowth of the prior work.</AbstractNarration>
