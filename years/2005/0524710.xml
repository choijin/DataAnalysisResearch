    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to carry out a study of metamaterials possessing the so-called negative refraction property. Alternatives to the geometrically complex materials studied so far will be considered, and a sound conceptual groundwork for the proper understanding of their behavior will be laid. The approach is first to undertake a critical examination of the fundamental principles of electromagnetic fields in metamaterials including "effective parameter" descriptions, validity of traditional boundary conditions, energy storage and transport. Second, a new class of metamaterials based on arrays of magneto-dielectric spheres will be investigated. Third, these metamaterials will be utilized for the design of novel spiral antennas. Fourth, the fundamental concepts will be applied to numerical modeling using the Finite Difference Time Domain method and Alternating Direction Implicit technique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metamaterials are important because of new possibilities presented for implementing antenna and circuit functions. Failure to start from sound first principles can hamper the achievement of these benefits. The proposed research effort clarifies these important issues and applies them to new antenna designs and numerical modeling techniques. This project will also have a significant impact on undergraduate education and research. Students from underrepresented groups will be recruited as part of the research team. The interest generated by involvement in the proposed research should influence some to continue their education at the graduate level. The results of the research will be presented at major conferences and published in leading technical journals, allowing the undergraduates to gain experience in oral as well as written communication.</AbstractNarration>
