<AbstractNarration>Sheldon Jackson College (SJC) proposes to increase the number of Alaska Native&lt;br/&gt;students matriculating in and completing its STEM programs by (1) adjusting its STEM offerings&lt;br/&gt;to more effectively meet the employment needs of the Alaskan economy , particularly the needs&lt;br/&gt;of resource-rich Alaska Native owned corporations, (2) preparing Native students for success in&lt;br/&gt;STEM programs through a summer academic enrichment program and ongoing academic support&lt;br/&gt;once students enroll in college, and (3) developing and implementing faculty development to&lt;br/&gt;enhance effectiveness in teaching Alaska Native students at Sheldon Jackson College with an&lt;br/&gt;emphasis on STEM faculty.&lt;br/&gt;Curriculum. GOAL: To strengthen the four degree programs requiring extensive&lt;br/&gt;STEM preparation : Ecology; Fishery Biology &amp; Culture; Marine Biology; and Secondary&lt;br/&gt;Education - Science by providing graduates with emergent job-ready knowledge. While the panel&lt;br/&gt;found these degree emphases generally responsive to employment needs within the Alaskan&lt;br/&gt;economy, they identified the following gaps to be addressed as objectives under this goal:&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES: 1) Establish and provide instructional capacity in the use of Geographic&lt;br/&gt;Information Systems (GIS); 2) provision of a stronger theoretical orientation in ecology, fisheries&lt;br/&gt;and marine biology coursework; 3) establish and offer a course that comprehensively surveys the&lt;br/&gt;enormously diverse Alaskan environment, its natural resources, and its resource management&lt;br/&gt;needs.&lt;br/&gt;Student needs. GOAL: To strengthen Native student success in STEM coursework that&lt;br/&gt;leads to degrees in sciences and mathematics. Data compiled by the Alaska Department of&lt;br/&gt;Education and Alaskan school districts reflect that Native high school students achieve far below&lt;br/&gt;average in comparison to other Alaskan students, especially in math. SJC's experience indicates&lt;br/&gt;that first-semester developmental coursework is insufficient to effectively prepare students for&lt;br/&gt;college level courses. Earlier intervention is required, and can be informed by data identified and&lt;br/&gt;quantified through High School Graduation Qualifying Exam and the No Child Left Behind Act&lt;br/&gt;testing provisions.&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES: 1) Establish and provide a summer academic enrichment program in&lt;br/&gt;math and science for Native high school students in partnership with school districts. 2) Provide&lt;br/&gt;campus-based academic support services wrapped around math and science course work.&lt;br/&gt;Faculty development. GOAL: To strengthen the effectiveness of SJC faculty in&lt;br/&gt;teaching and mentoring Native students in their STEM courses. Available literature indicates that&lt;br/&gt;intercultural classroom communications is complex and frequently counterintuitive, and yet,&lt;br/&gt;preparation for teaching in culturally diverse classrooms is seldom a requirement for college&lt;br/&gt;faculty.&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: 1) To establish and provide pre-academic-year cross-cultural education&lt;br/&gt;faculty workshops, and participation in ongoing workshops as opportunities arise. This will&lt;br/&gt;include 2) participation in school year-end assessment and refinement of the College's strategies&lt;br/&gt;in supporting Alaska Native student success, particularly in the sciences and math.</AbstractNarration>
