<AbstractNarration>Project Summary:&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation examines the development of recombinant DNA research and technology from its academic origins in the 1970s to its commercialization in the 1980s. The project focuses on its development and use at Stanford, as initially conceived by Paul Berg and his colleagues.  The literature on the development of genetic engineering focuses on Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer's recombinant DNA technology and subsequent patenting, and Boyer's venture into biotechnology. Yet historians have paid little attention to the role of Stanford's Biochemistry Department, and thus there is no analysis of recombinant DNA technologies in its full context. Inattention to the academic context has meant that Cohen and Boyer's indebtedness to scientists in the Biochemistry Department has not been a part of the narrative of the commercialization of biology.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;By resituating the development of recombinant DNA technologies in their broad scientific context, &lt;br/&gt;this project will add  new knowledge about their historical development. This study emphasizes that &lt;br/&gt;scientists involved in developing recombinant DNA technologies were not directly seeking to develop &lt;br/&gt;technologies for genetic engineering.  That unexpected feature makes fuller sense if examined in terms &lt;br/&gt;of ongoing experimentation and material culture. That emphasis will provide  new perspective on the &lt;br/&gt;commercialization of biology.  By analyzing experiments that unexpectedly led to the development of &lt;br/&gt;recombinant DNA technologies, the project will illustrate how the unpredictable nature of experimental &lt;br/&gt;systems influenced the emergence of biotechnology. By paying attention to the culture of sharing and &lt;br/&gt;exchanging research materials, the PI  will specify how the commercialization of biology challenged and &lt;br/&gt;changed the moral economy of science, including  material exchanges and distribution of credit.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The project will illuminate the commercialization of academic biology, including the changing relationship between academy, government, and industry and the proprietary claims on biomedical knowledge.  This dissertation will illuminate the process of how locally constructed experimental systems became globally significant. It will also have practical applications in policy-oriented research, including science policy, economic development/industrial policy, and policies regarding higher education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
