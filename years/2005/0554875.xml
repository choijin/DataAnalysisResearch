<AbstractNarration>How do different types of people respond to information gleaned from catastrophic events such as Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita?  In the wake of a catastrophic event, an individual's assessment of the risks encountered in his/her daily life is likely to be subject to frequent updating.  Over time, one's updated risk assessment may result in a decision to move from a city at risk of hurricane damage to one that is perceived to be safer.  With this project, the PIs intend to launch a survey of people that live in hurricane-threatened regions along the US Southeastern and Gulf Coasts. This survey will include an examination of at least four dimensions of an individual's choice to migrate or remain in a hurricane-threatened region: re-assessments of the probability and consequences of the exogenous event (the hurricane); perceptions and images of "place" associated with a region of residence that differ in the perceptions of individuals in that area; evaluations and beliefs concerning the policy programs put in place to mitigate future disasters, as well as the people responsible for managing them; and responses to the bundle of incentives that are structured to influence the recovery of a region after a major hurricane disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to explore the economic, cultural, and institutional dimensions of an individual's risk assessment.  The specific questions of focus are: &lt;br/&gt; How do people update their risk assessments after a catastrophic exogenous shock such as Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita?  &lt;br/&gt; What values or characteristics beyond risk assessment influence the formation of preferences?  &lt;br/&gt; How does one's perception of government competence, combined with various types of government incentives, influence decision-making under uncertainty?&lt;br/&gt;This multi-dimensional study of decision-making under uncertainty has profound public policy implications.  An efficient incentive system is one in which people who have the appetite for the risk select to stay in hurricane-threatened areas. In part this appetite may be influenced by perceptions of place. What is an efficient policy? Does an "economically efficient" policy have sociological implications? How will such a policy impact the socio-economic, cultural and racial make-up of a community?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
