    <AbstractNarration>Applying space weather information to the international aviation industry is of growing concern to the airline industry. It is known that space weather can cause degraded communications, radiation effects on passengers and crew, impact navigation systems, and cause single event effects on avionics. While the airlines are slowly understanding the operational and commercial impacts from solar storms, a thorough understanding of the risks and what actions to take is still lacking. In coping with space weather impacts on the aviation industry, there are tradeoffs that have to be made: use of information and forecasts to enable more efficient and safer operations; changes in the regulatory framework; and understanding mitigation strategies and the acceptance of different levels of risk. This project will conduct policy research leading to recommendations that will increase the safety, reliability, and efficiency of the nation's airline operations through more effective use of space weather forecasts and information. It will provide government and industry leaders with additional tools and information to make effective decisions with respect to investments in space weather research and services, and will advance our understanding of the policy issues involved in integrating space weather information into airline operations. The first part of the study will be devoted to background research of the issues and discussion with relevant aviation industry leaders, airline representatives, space weather scientists and information providers, and policymakers. The second part of the study will involve developing a policy paper that will provide the options that may be pursued to resolve policy issues facing the aviation community.</AbstractNarration>
