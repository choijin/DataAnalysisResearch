<AbstractNarration>This award will fund the First Summer School in Neuroeconomics for graduate students and post-docs in economics, neuroscience and psychology. The meeting will last 2 weeks and will be held in the Summer of 2006 at Stanford University. The first week of the meeting will focus on "computational neuroeconomics", which provides the unifying framework for the field and a common language for the three related fields. This part of the meeting will describe state-of-the art models of how the brain makes economic decisions (Which variables are computed? How are they computed? How do they interact with each other to generate choices?) The second week of the meeting will cover experimental techniques and their applications to neuroeconomics. The faculty for the program will consist of 12 of the leading researchers working in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The summer school program will seek to advance this new interdisciplinary field. First, it will provide an in-depth introduction to neuroeconomics to graduate students, post-docs, and some young researchers who are interested in doing work in this area. Second, it will help in the development of a common language and methodology for the field. This will be the first meeting of its kind and  it will help to attract top scientific talent into the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The meeting will foster relationships and collaborations between young and well-established researchers. This should prove especially valuable for underrepresented minorities, women, persons with disabilities, and scholars and institutions without the resources to get started with research in this demanding area.</AbstractNarration>
