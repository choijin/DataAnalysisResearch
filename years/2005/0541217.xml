<AbstractNarration>Background&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Memory management is a key component in the performance and reliability of virtually all software&lt;br/&gt;systems. Explicit reclamation of memory is error-prone, but efficient in time and space. On the other&lt;br/&gt;hand, automatic memory management via garbage collection eliminates memory errors, but requires a&lt;br/&gt;heavyweight run-time system that imposes a certain amount of run-time and memory overhead.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to explore novel compiler and run-time techniques for safe memory&lt;br/&gt;management with explicit memory deallocation and without garbage collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The PI will develop a  system that will provide memory management support for Java in the following forms:&lt;br/&gt;- It will augment Java bytecodes with primitive instructions for explicit memory reclamation;&lt;br/&gt;- It will provide novel compiler analyses and transformations to automatically augment programs&lt;br/&gt; with explicit memory deallocation&lt;br/&gt;- It will provide appropriate run-time support for explicit memory deallocation in an extended Java&lt;br/&gt;virtual machine.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will investigate two paradigms for memory management with explicit deallocation:&lt;br/&gt;- Region-based memory management, which groups data objects together into regions and deallocates&lt;br/&gt;all of the objects in each region at once.&lt;br/&gt;- Individual object deallocation, which reclaims storage for one object at a time. This approach&lt;br/&gt;will use a single operation free to deallocate one object instance at a time.&lt;br/&gt;-This research will leverage advanced static analyses such as pointer and shape analyses as key components of the proposed system to enable the accurate and safe reclamation of memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work proposes novel static analyses for pointer-based program structures, and their integration&lt;br/&gt;with novel program transformations, run-time techniques, and program verification approaches to address&lt;br/&gt;the memory management problem, an important problem in modern software systems. This research has the potential to lead to important advances in compiler technology. The PI proposes a broad dissemination of the developed tools, making them available to the public and to the research community; such tools have the potential to become useful to a broad class of consumers.In addition, he plans to use the results of this research to support several educational activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, it will serve as a research topic for his students, both graduate and undergraduate. Second, he&lt;br/&gt;intends to integrate the novel analyses developed as part of this research into the courses that he will&lt;br/&gt;teach: the undergraduate compiler course, and the advanced seminar on program analysis.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
