<AbstractNarration>The end-product of ongoing geoinformatics initiatives in stratigraphy and paleontology will be an online&lt;br/&gt;electronic stratigraphic record. It faces three challenges: to compile sufficient data, to integrate&lt;br/&gt;multiple databases, and to maintain tools that can assemble all the local data records into a geologic time&lt;br/&gt;line. The third challenge amounts to sequencing the fossil record and we propose to address three of the&lt;br/&gt;obstacles it faces: (1) Fossil biotas of the same age may differ as a result of habitat and preservation&lt;br/&gt;effects; (2) Very large data sets must be sequenced in smaller pieces and the results stitched seamlessly&lt;br/&gt;together; (3) Increasing numbers of dated and fingerprinted ash beds need to used more effectively. We&lt;br/&gt;propose a case study of manageable geographic and temporal extent that, nevertheless, raises these same&lt;br/&gt;issues. The Ordovician and Silurian periods span almost 100 million years of early Paleozoic time and are&lt;br/&gt;traditionally subdivided by graptolites and conodonts - two fossil clades with different ecological and&lt;br/&gt;preservational traits that restrict their use to largely mutually exclusive domains.&lt;br/&gt;The Mohawkian (Late Ordovician) of eastern North America presents precisely the type of&lt;br/&gt;challenging geological environment in which to build and test the temporal sequencing and stitching&lt;br/&gt;approaches that we envision. Mohawkian strata are widely exposed in the region and yield a rich fossil&lt;br/&gt;record that includes diverse, but somewhat endemic, conodont faunas. The epicratonic succession is&lt;br/&gt;rimmed along the Appalachian margin by deeper water sediments of the Taconic foreland basin. These&lt;br/&gt;strata contain a suite of inter-continentally distributed graptolite faunas, but few described conodont&lt;br/&gt;assemblages. Numerous altered volcanic ash deposits (K-bentonites) link these facies through a set of&lt;br/&gt;transitional facies along the interior basin margin. Despite these advantages, the prevalence of short&lt;br/&gt;sections, structural complexity, and facies limitation of the faunas impedes precise and reliable correlation&lt;br/&gt;between the cratonic and basinal successions, consequently limiting our ability to compare their disparate&lt;br/&gt;faunas and tectonic histories.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: We propose to combine (1) geochemical fingerprinting (tephrochronology) and&lt;br/&gt;U-Pb geochronology of K-bentonites from the Mohawkian and early Cincinnatian with (2) a restudy of&lt;br/&gt;late Mohawkian conodonts and graptolites from eleven regions across eastern North America and (3)&lt;br/&gt;computer assisted sequencing of the global Ordovician conodont and graptolite fossil record. This work&lt;br/&gt;will provide a detailed temporal and paleoecological framework within which to refine the application of&lt;br/&gt;biofacies information to the temporal sequencing of the fossil record via rigorous quantitative techniques.&lt;br/&gt;We will focus in steps 1 and 2 particularly on conodont and graptolite-bearing successions that contain Kbentonites,&lt;br/&gt;and especially on regions where conodonts and graptolites occur in close association.&lt;br/&gt;The results of our work in a time interval that remains troublesome in spite of a wide range of timestratigraphic&lt;br/&gt;information will bear upon fundamental questions in both local and global stratigraphy. In&lt;br/&gt;the course of this study we will test existing alternate correlation models for the mid Upper Ordovician of&lt;br/&gt;central and eastern North America. The results will provide an improved, age-calibrated basis for studies&lt;br/&gt;of faunal turnover and diversity change in the Ordovician and Silurian. Most importantly, the work will&lt;br/&gt;lead to the development of improved techniques for time scale construction and validation.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The data and tools we develop will be shared immediately through the CHRONOS&lt;br/&gt;project and will investigate technological solutions that are not being addressed by CHRONOS to&lt;br/&gt;sequence events. The project meets the EARTHTIME goal of cross-training stratigraphers and&lt;br/&gt;geochronologists in developing high precision time-scales. We will train two PhD students (one a&lt;br/&gt;minority), and three undergraduates. We will integrate the efforts of four institutions, two with large&lt;br/&gt;minority enrolment (UCR, UALR), in a new collaboration that will facilitate the interaction of all the&lt;br/&gt;students and PIs at each institution. Undergraduates will participate as field and lab assistants for the PIs&lt;br/&gt;and for the graduate students, and will be given pieces of the project as senior research projects. Each&lt;br/&gt;student will present aspects of the research at a professional meeting. The project will also include a&lt;br/&gt;secondary school teacher who will work alongside PI Leslie during the summer as part of the Arkansas&lt;br/&gt;STRIVE program. The teacher will develop class projects based on their experiences. The project thus&lt;br/&gt;impacts future generations of students by enhancing a secondary education teacher's knowledge base and&lt;br/&gt;scientific curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
