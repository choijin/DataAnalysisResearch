<AbstractNarration>Mosse-Wu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time-critical applications in embedded systems environments often have stringent quality of service (QoS) &lt;br/&gt;and timing requirements that need to be met to ensure proper operation and dependability, even in the &lt;br/&gt;presence of failures and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Achieving this goal, however, brings about a host &lt;br/&gt;of critical challenges which are unique or fundamentally different from those encountered in traditional &lt;br/&gt;wireless sensors and ad-hoc networks.  While significant progress is being made in specific technologies &lt;br/&gt;associated with micro-sensing and actuation, formidable barriers remain to large-scale deployment &lt;br/&gt;of fault-tolerant and secure embedded wireless systems for time-critical applications. This collaborative &lt;br/&gt;research project is pursuing integrated research at three levels: (i) reward-based, trustworthy QoS models, &lt;br/&gt;(ii) secure, fault-tolerant routing and data forwarding, and (iii) fault-tolerant data access and management. &lt;br/&gt;The emphasis of the proposed methodologies will be on the inter-relationships between different components &lt;br/&gt;and layers of the system and the consequent research and design issues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project is developing comprehensive analytical framework to establish bounds on performance guarantees &lt;br/&gt;when failure occurs or when the system is under denial of service attacks. In pursuit of dependable,robust and secure &lt;br/&gt;embedded systems, this research also focuses on secure and fault-tolerant routing and data management.&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing scalable and energy-efficient routing protocols &lt;br/&gt;that can tolerate both device failures and transient network overload. The project also is &lt;br/&gt;developing dynamic and adaptive risk-based schemes for data aggregation and management. &lt;br/&gt;The effort spans several research areas: distributed and embedded real-time systems, sensor networks, &lt;br/&gt;security, and information processing. The project aims for impact through a wide range of &lt;br/&gt;time-critical applications such as: ubiquitous and pervasive health care, infrastructure protection and &lt;br/&gt;homeland security, and real-time environment monitoring. The project seeks to stimulate cross-area &lt;br/&gt;research and include a diverse group of students from Computer Science, Information Science, and Engineering. &lt;br/&gt;Results and software tools are freely disseminated through the project website. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
