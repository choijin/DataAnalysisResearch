<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;0529369&lt;br/&gt;Gupta&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit of the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental study involving optimization of the CPP-GMR sensor stack is proposed. This will involve a fundamental theoretical study of the physics of the spintronic device, which will lead to an optimized device design, including selection of the materials, layer thicknesses, and device structure for optimized performance. The study in GMR stack deposition will emphasize optimization of thin-film deposition with particular attention being given to interfacial engineering. Furthermore, a thorough investigation of multilayer film nucleation and growth under various processing conditions, will lead to a better understanding of how to generate and control the properties of these films and their subsequent electrical and magnetic characteristics. Subsequent fabrication of the GMR sensor has sufficient complexity and will provide the student with substantial exposure to various state-of-the-art deposition, photolithography, e-beam lithography and dry and wet etch processing techniques and equipment. In-depth structural, magnetic and electrical characterization of these nanolaminates will be carried out using a wide range of advanced analytical equipment. Atomic scale characterization of the GMR stacks by transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography will greatly enhance the scientific merit of the proposed research. The technological motivation for this research is grounded in the desire to create novel materials, processes and structures for novel sensors for military and civilian applications. The research is  interdisciplinary, involving the Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering and Physics departments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is interdisciplinary, integrating faculty and students from three departments (Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering and Physics). Graduate students on this project, one a minority female will receive training in disciplines of materials selection, nanolayer processing, device fabrication, and atomic, microstructural, electrical and magnetic characterization, and will gain an understanding of physics and chemistry, metallurgical, materials and electrical engineering. The project will have collaboration with the Army Research Laboratories and Veeco Instruments, which will allow the students to be exposed to a broad range of technologies - from sensor design and fabrication to vacuum technology and cathode design and development, and have direct exposure to career options at the Army Research Laboratories as well as in industry. Recruitment of minority female undergraduate students from a neighboring HBCU is also planned. This, along with having a minority female graduate student as well as a female PI, will serve as a strong and positive role model for minority women entering science and engineering, both nationally and globally.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
