<AbstractNarration>The Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS), in collaboration with the All-Nations and the&lt;br/&gt;Pacific Consortia of the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP), requests&lt;br/&gt;funding to enhance the research skills and knowledge of Native American and Pacific Islander&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students in tropical biology. The proposed program will take place at the OTS&lt;br/&gt;Las Cruces Biological Station in Costa Rica, an important research station in the Neotropics and&lt;br/&gt;a major OTS center for hands-on training in field-oriented research.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Native American and Pacific Islander program is to provide an intensive field&lt;br/&gt;research experience for Native American and Pacific Islander undergraduate students. The&lt;br/&gt;program is structured around a four-week stay in Costa Rica and Panama, during which the&lt;br/&gt;participants will conduct research at OTS Las Cruces Biological Station, among other sites, and&lt;br/&gt;visit three indigenous communities. The focus of the program is the development of the&lt;br/&gt;students interest in biology and their capacity to conduct independent field research.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The strength of the program lies in engaging Native American and Pacific Islander students in&lt;br/&gt;pure and applied biological research, while introducing them to the biodiversity, cultural&lt;br/&gt;diversity and community-based conservation issues of the tropics. Under the guidance of the&lt;br/&gt;program staff and faculty mentors, the students will complete high quality research projects&lt;br/&gt;designed to sharpen their technical skills and enrich their professional development. In addition,&lt;br/&gt;by providing a broad range of scientific perspectives and research experiences, the students will&lt;br/&gt;gain a sense of career awareness to clarify and direct their future academic life.&lt;br/&gt;Project objectives&lt;br/&gt;1. Introduce Native American and Pacific Islander students to the biodiversity of the tropics.&lt;br/&gt;2. Help students analyze the role that Native Peoples in the Neotropics play in forest&lt;br/&gt;conservation and, by extension, examine the role of conservation in their own communities.&lt;br/&gt;3. Train students in the scientific method and in field research techniques.&lt;br/&gt;4. Develop the students research abilities by conducting guided field research projects.&lt;br/&gt;5. Encourage and facilitate the enrollment of these students in other field oriented biology&lt;br/&gt;programs, such as REUs and OTS undergraduate and graduate programs.&lt;br/&gt;6. Enhance the interest and commitment of the students in pursuing a science career by&lt;br/&gt;providing a unique and inspiring research experience.&lt;br/&gt;7. Provide the faculty mentors with tropical field research training to enhance their ability to&lt;br/&gt;encourage and support students at their home institutions.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This program is designed to impact the academic and professional development of Native&lt;br/&gt;American and Pacific Islanders students by providing a broad range of scientific and research&lt;br/&gt;skills to improve their academic competitiveness at the undergraduate and graduate levels and to&lt;br/&gt;encourage them to pursue careers in the environmental and biological sciences.</AbstractNarration>
