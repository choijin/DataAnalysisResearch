<AbstractNarration>The PI is working to attract more talented middle and high school students and undergraduates to careers in math and science by involving them in activities that use the integration of cutting edge research as a pedagogical tool. His activities have their foundation in the deeper results obtained by him and his research group and amplify these efforts in K-12 outreach and innovative undergraduate education. He is directing annual Summer Institutes for approximately fifteen high school students and undergraduate students. These students are actively engaged in an integrated structured research environment that he has successfully employed in the past. The PI also is directing a nationwide collaborative initiative between the American Mathematical Society and Science Service consisting of outreach visits to communities across America. On these visits, he lectures along side some of the nation's most distinguished scientists, such as winners of the Nobel Prize and the National Medal of Science, to middle school and high school students in innovative hands-on classroom activities. Each visit also features a game show, loosely based on the famous "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" TV program (aptly named "Who Wants to Be a Mathematician?"). Students compete for prizes and scholarships (provided by the American Mathematical Society), with local winners competing in a year end "Tournament of Champions" in Washington D.C.</AbstractNarration>
