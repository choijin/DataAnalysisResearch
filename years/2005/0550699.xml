<AbstractNarration>The project will model and trace the responses of individual workers and firms to changes in&lt;br/&gt;the global economic environment. To this end, the project will use an extensive and unusually&lt;br/&gt;rich matched data set on identified firms and identified employees between 1986 and 2001&lt;br/&gt;for Brazil. The worker data offer wage information and monthly employment records, and&lt;br/&gt;include detailed demographic information on the employees at establishments of all formally&lt;br/&gt;established Brazilian firms, along with information on the reasons for hires, the occupations&lt;br/&gt;filled, and causes for separations. Using tax identifiers, these worker records were matched&lt;br/&gt;to a sample of manufacturing firms for which detailed information on balance-sheet figures,&lt;br/&gt;investments, foreign factor uses, exports, and exits are available.&lt;br/&gt;Brazil's large-scale trade liberalization in 1990 and a 60-percent exchange rate devaluation&lt;br/&gt;in January 1999 provide salient variation in world market exposure. Resulting changes in&lt;br/&gt;foreign competition, and contemporaneous technical changes among Brazilian manufactur-&lt;br/&gt;ing firms, were accompanied by substantial labor displacements. Pilot research suggests that&lt;br/&gt;layoffs and hires are significantly related to trade exposure. However, contrary to classic and&lt;br/&gt;modern trade theory or frictionless macroeconomic models, resulting displacements can lead&lt;br/&gt;to extended delays before rehiring and long adjustment periods before firms with an individ-&lt;br/&gt;ual or sectoral comparative advantage start to absorb displaced workers.&lt;br/&gt;Objectives and intellectual merit. The project aims to illuminate workers' varying interac-&lt;br/&gt;tions with firms during employment and after separations and to explore the consequences&lt;br/&gt;of Brazil's exposure to world markets for its labor market performance. Together with co-&lt;br/&gt;authors, the grantee will investigate labor reallocations in response to Brazil's trade liberal-&lt;br/&gt;ization in 1990, analyze the returns to skills in the presence of endogenous switching between&lt;br/&gt;jobs and under changing world market exposure, evaluate the earnings effects of induced&lt;br/&gt;displacements, and assessmacroeconomic shock propagation through worker separation and&lt;br/&gt;imperfect re-contracting.&lt;br/&gt;Beyond prior assessments of output market share reallocations and labor turnover statis-&lt;br/&gt;tics, data of the present project allow the grantee to trace flows between types of firms within&lt;br/&gt;and across sectors, and to estimate at the individual worker level separation risks, rehiring&lt;br/&gt;likelihoods and subsequent earnings. The project will elucidate at what time horizon a lib-&lt;br/&gt;eralizing economy can expect factor markets to successfully reallocate resources according&lt;br/&gt;to comparative advantage, whether this process is associated with transitory or permanent&lt;br/&gt;earnings losses for workers with certain characteristics, and how the transition process might&lt;br/&gt;be alleviated through targeted reforms.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact. The public debate across industrialized and developing countries alike ex-&lt;br/&gt;hibits much concern with the impact of global integration on domestic labor markets. The&lt;br/&gt;expansion of world trade raises fears that jobs at all skill levels become increasingly sub-&lt;br/&gt;stitutable across locations. This project on Brazil's labor market performance contributes to&lt;br/&gt;the understanding of employment responses to global change in offering adequate matched&lt;br/&gt;employer-employee data for detailed econometric analysis. Findings will be relevant to the&lt;br/&gt;conduct of trade policy in countries that contemplate further liberalization, and can inform&lt;br/&gt;the design of labor market instruments comparable to the U.S. Trade Adjustment Assistance.</AbstractNarration>
