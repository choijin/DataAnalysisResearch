    <AbstractNarration>Increasing concern with security issues in the world has led to greater interest in improving the technology and methods available for detecting deception. Under direction from Congress, the NSF and the Office of Science Technology Policy are facilitating a series of six workshops to address current and future research on the science and technology of security evaluations. This workshop focuses on a range of psychological assessments used to target deception while understanding their strengths and limitations, and identifying strategies and techniques that can be applied in real world security evaluations. Prior to the workshop, invited participants will familiarize themselves with each other's work through the electronic dissemination of a series of relevant articles; with the workshop PI serving as the pre-workshop facilitator. The workshop will bring approximately 20 leading experts and practitioners together for two days in July 2005 at the NSF. Both small group and large group discussions will be used to focus the ideas and experiences of the participants in outlining the key issues and research questions leading to the formation of a series of proposed research directions. Participants will also address the ethical, legal and privacy concerns of current research. A final report will be prepared summarizing presentations and views of the workshop participants and the resulting research agenda.</AbstractNarration>
