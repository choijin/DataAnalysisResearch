<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This project, studying new architectural and programming models for the rapid application development of multi-model human computer interfaces for ambient computing devices, aims at establishing a lab that will design and develop the user interface to ubiquitous intelligent devices. With a developmental framework and programming model for integrating and configuring the low-level enabling technologies to produce a desired behavior for a user to interact (e.g., talk) with a computing device in an environment, this work in interactive programming development environments for configuring ambient (intelligent) environments shifts the burden of having to understand how to use advanced technology from the user to the programming environment. The experimental work focuses on the use of Storyboarding, a visual medium for defining scenarios describing the actions of people and expected behavior of intelligent devices in an ambient computing setting. The scenarios then produce the runtime behavior of the devices, providing an environment for end-users to design, test, and evaluate the interfaces to intelligent devices in an ambient computing setting. The approach is expected to increase the accessibility of environment control to general populations of users by replacing explicit programming with an illustrative interface. A visual programming language for scripting ambient computing activities is also contemplated. Computing resources, often embedded in devices like toasters, desks, doors, walls, etc., give the device a sense of intelligence. People interact with these devices explicitly through direct manipulation or implicitly through their mere proximity to the devices. Because these intelligent devices are pervasive and perhaps even invisible to the user, the complexity of designing and developing the user interface presents a major challenge addressed by this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The emerging area of ambient computing, also known as ubiquitous, pervasive, invisible, or calm computing, could become the next wave of computing. The framework, made part of an IDE (Integrated Development Platform), contributes to the development of courses and training of students within a minority serving institution.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
