    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is integrating green chemistry concepts and practices into the chemistry laboratory curriculum with the goal of engaging undergraduate STEM majors in the active learning of green chemistry topics. A second goal is the demonstration that green chemistry principles can be taught within and outside of the confines of the organic synthesis laboratory and can be introduced and reinforced in all undergraduate chemistry laboratories. Student learning objectives include problem solving, environmental awareness (both local and global) and critical scientific thinking. Laboratory experiments and research projects are introducing green chemistry at various stages of the curriculum. A three-day workshop is planned on campus for faculty participants from regional 4-year schools and community colleges and high schools to provide help and resources for green chemistry curriculum development. The results of new experiments and adaptations will be disseminated at the workshop. The expected broad impact is that a local green chemistry network of schools and colleges will form which will advance discovery and understanding via the exchange of ideas. The project is being evaluated using multiple assessment methods and the results will be disseminated at regional and national professional meetings and in journal and web publications.</AbstractNarration>
