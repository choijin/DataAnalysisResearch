<AbstractNarration>Professor Luis Colon of the SUNY at Buffalo is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate the synthesis and characterization of a new generation of permeable monolithic structures that are based on metal oxides (e.g., ZrO2, HfO2).  These monolithic structures are potentially applicable to the separation and purification of a broad spectrum of chemicals and biochemicals. Fundamental studies of the reaction conditions that lead to the final metal oxide materials, their physicochemical properties, and their chromatographic performance will be conducted.  The characteristics and compositions of the synthesized materials will be assessed using a variety of spectroscopic and physical probes.  These investigations are part of a long-term research program focused on the study of new and improved materials with applicability in chemical analysis, particularly in chromatographic separations.  This research project will contribute to the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, including members of traditionally underrepresented groups, in the synthesis and characterization of monolithic structures and in chromatographic separation and analysis methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HPLC continues to be an indispensable analytical tool that facilitates advances in the chemical, biological, pharmaceutical, medicinal, food, and agricultural sciences.  The development of chromatographic materials that withstand harsh and extreme pH conditions could lead to improved chromatographic separations and broaden the scope of applicability of the technique.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
