<AbstractNarration>This exploratory project would survey available instruments for annual teacher performance assessment, seeking those that are conceptually consistent with the reform-oriented mathematics and science instruction.  The PI expects to identify and analyze several instruments that have empirical support and are aligned with "the operating constraints of school districts."  The project would develop a web-based index of these protocols and their relevant support literature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory project is intended as groundwork for a larger project exploring the PI's hypothesis that an effective teacher assessment instrument coupled with feedback to teachers would drive significant and low cost school reform.  The larger project would study several school districts that use one of the highly rated assessment instruments, documenting the impact of the constructive feedback provided to teachers on their subsequent practice. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
