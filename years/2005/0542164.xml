<AbstractNarration>A focused plan is presented to investigate the role and importance of short period (&lt;1 hour) gravity waves on the dynamics of the Antarctic Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region (~80-100 km). Excited primarily by deep convection, frontal activity, topography, and strong wind shears in the lower atmosphere, these waves transport energy and momentum upwards where they have a profound influence on the MLT dynamics. Most of the wave forcing is expected to occur at mid-and low-latitudes where such sources predominate. However, short-period waves (exhibiting similar characteristics to mid-latitude events) have now been detected in copious quantities from research sites on the Antarctic Peninsula and the coastal regions exhibiting strong anisotropy in their dominant horizontal motions (and hence their momentum fluxes). Radiosonde measurements have established the existence of ubiquitous gravity wave activity at South Pole but, to date, there have been no detailed measurements of the properties of short-period waves at MLT heights deep in the Antarctic interior. In particular, the South Pole Station is uniquely situated to investigate the filtering and penetration of these waves into the MLT region, a substantial fraction of which may be ducted waves traveling over vast geographic distances (several thousand km). Novel image measurements at South Pole Station combined with existing measurement programs will provide an unprecedented capability for quantifying the role of these gravity waves on the regional MLT dynamics over central Antarctica. This research also contributes to the training and education of both the graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This program involved the development, testing, deployment, and initial operations of a novel Advanced Mesospheric Temperature Mapper (AMTM) at South Pole Station. Our primary research goal was to obtain first measurements of short-period (less than 1 hour) atmospheric gravity waves (AGW) over central Antarctica to investigate their occurrence frequency and characteristics.   AGW are generated mainly in the lower atmosphere by strong weather disturbances.  They can propagate large amounts of energy into the upper reaches of the neutral atmosphere (called the mesosphere) where they saturate and break (at heights around 50-60 miles) like ocean waves on a beach.  The energy and momentum deposited by these waves have been shown to have profound effects on the mesospheric wind and temperature environment.  This new study was designed especially to investigate AGW deep inside the wintertime Antarctic polar vortex where their sources are expected to be limited.  Our long term goal is to quantify their momentum deposition, dominant sources and year-to-year variability to better understand the impact of AGW on the high-altitude Antarctic climate.  The AMTM is a high-performance infra-red imaging system developed at Utah State University (USU) using expertise gained operating the NSF CEDAR Mesospheric Temperature Mapper (MTM).  This latter instrument uses a scientific grade CCD camera (similar in operation to an everyday digital camera) to measure mesospheric temperatures at the same time as imaging the wave structures.  The AMTM was developed especially for polar latitude research and is capable of high-quality observations of AGW and their temperature perturbations, even in the presence of strong auroral emissions (which can frequently occur at high-latitudes).  The AMTM comprises a high throughput specialized lens system that was designed in-house at USU by colleagues at the Space Dynamics Laboratory, coupled together with a newly-available infrared InGaAs (indium-gallium-arsenide) imaging array, resulting in an exceptional infrared imaging capability over the spectral range from 0.9 to 1.6 microns.  The AMTM detects AGW as they propagate through the naturally occurring hydroxyl (OH) emission layer which envelopes the Earth at an altitude of approximately  55 miles (within the upper mesosphere) and is typically 5-6 miles thick.   Sequential measurements are made of selected emission lines in two strong  infrared OH(3,1) and (4,2) bands (providing an approximately 70 fold increase in signal over our MTM observations),  from which precision maps of OH intensity and temperature are obtained with a high temporal resolution (1 map every 30 sec).   The AMTM was installed in the B2 wing of new South Pole Station in 2010 and initial measurements have been successfully obtained during the 2010 and 2011 winter seasons.   The high altitude (10,000 ft) and long polar night conditions enable unprecedented continuous observations of the upper mesosphere (weather permitting) and its variability, not possible from any other location on earth.  Our results indicate a surprisingly rich wave environment  suggesting that the South Pole region is bathed in a continuous "sea" of mesospheric waves of varying scale sizes and periodicities during the winter months. We plan to pursue new measurements to fully investigate this exceptional environment.          Last Modified: 11/03/2011       Submitted by: Michael J Taylor]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
