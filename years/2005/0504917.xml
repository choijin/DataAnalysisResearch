<AbstractNarration>An exciting recent development in geometric group theory is Zlil&lt;br/&gt;Sela's beautiful work on the Tarski problem. This problem asks whether&lt;br/&gt;the elementary theory of a non-abelian free group is independent of&lt;br/&gt;the free group in question.  Feighn proposes two projects in this&lt;br/&gt;direction, both joint with Mladen Bestvina. The first is a&lt;br/&gt;continuation of a project to simplify Sela's work. In the second,&lt;br/&gt;representing a new direction, a solution to a modified form of&lt;br/&gt;Tarski's problem is proposed. This will lead to new information about&lt;br/&gt;definable sets (objects of primary importance) and will answer&lt;br/&gt;questions of Rips and Sela. A third proposed project is to explore the&lt;br/&gt;extent to which the JSJ-decomposition of a group can be found&lt;br/&gt;algorithmically. The specific class of groups to be examined consists&lt;br/&gt;of graphs of free groups, which are of current interest on a number of&lt;br/&gt;fronts. With Guo-An Diao, the principal investigator has shown that&lt;br/&gt;the Grushko decomposition (a coarser decomposition than the JSJ) of&lt;br/&gt;these groups can be found algorithmically. There are two possible&lt;br/&gt;satisfactory resolutions, namely a construction of an algorithm to&lt;br/&gt;produce the JSJ-decomposition of a group in the class or a proof that&lt;br/&gt;this problem is unsolvable. For this class of groups, which exists on&lt;br/&gt;the boundary of what can be understood algorithmically, either&lt;br/&gt;resolution would be important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric group theory is a relatively young branch of mathematics&lt;br/&gt;that uses geometric methods to understand groups. The idea to take a&lt;br/&gt;problem in group theory, translate it into a problem in geometry, and&lt;br/&gt;then use geometric methods to solve the translated problem. The&lt;br/&gt;principal investigator proposes to use geometric methods to explore&lt;br/&gt;two general areas. The first is motivated by Zlil Sela's geometric&lt;br/&gt;solution to the Tarski problem which on the face of it is a problem in&lt;br/&gt;the intersection of group theory and logic. Roughly, the problem is to&lt;br/&gt;distinguish groups using the truth of statements formed using only the&lt;br/&gt;usual symbols of logic ("there exists", "for all", variables, etc) and&lt;br/&gt;group operations. For example, you can tell if a group is abelian by&lt;br/&gt;asking whether it is true that, for all elements x and y, xy=yx.  The&lt;br/&gt;first proposed project, joint with Mladen Bestvina, is to simplify and&lt;br/&gt;extend Sela's ideas. This project is ongoing and there has already&lt;br/&gt;been significant progress. The second proposed project follows another&lt;br/&gt;trend in group theory that is encapsulated by the question: How much&lt;br/&gt;group theory can a computer understand? Much as molecules can be&lt;br/&gt;decomposed into simpler pieces (atoms), groups can be often be&lt;br/&gt;decomposed into simpler groups. The project is to understand such&lt;br/&gt;decompositions for a class of groups called "graphs of free groups", a&lt;br/&gt;class which has attracted much recent attention. It turns out that&lt;br/&gt;decomposing groups translates into the geometric process of cutting a&lt;br/&gt;space into simpler pieces. The goal is to use this geometric idea to&lt;br/&gt;discover an algorithm that, given a group, finds its decomposition.&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator, with Guo-An Diao, has already constructed&lt;br/&gt;an algorithm for a related process that can readily be implemented on&lt;br/&gt;a computer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
