<AbstractNarration>The investigator proposes the study of back and forth error compensation&lt;br/&gt;and correction methods (BF) and their applications, in particular, to the&lt;br/&gt;level set method (Osher and Sethian, 1988) for interface computation in&lt;br/&gt;fluid dynamics and image processing etc. The level set equation and the&lt;br/&gt;associated redistancing equation (Sussman et al., 1994) are usually solved&lt;br/&gt;by high order non-oscillatory schemes (e.g., ENO, WENO). In addition,&lt;br/&gt;special techniques can be used in order to reduce the diffusion near&lt;br/&gt;singular points of the interface, such as the particle level set method&lt;br/&gt;(Enright et al., 2002). BF was initially developed by Dupont and Liu (2003)&lt;br/&gt;as a simple technique for reducing the diffusion in solving the level set&lt;br/&gt;equation. Further improvements are being developed with more and more&lt;br/&gt;promising results. When applied to the Zalesak problem (rigid rotation&lt;br/&gt;of a slotted disk), it approaches the resolution of volume of fluid&lt;br/&gt;methods, e.g., Youngs 1982 etc, and is simple with low computational cost.&lt;br/&gt;Some special properties are being found such as that when applied to some&lt;br/&gt;unstable schemes, it not only stabilizes them but also improves their&lt;br/&gt;accuracy. The investigator plans to collaborate with Todd F. Dupont and&lt;br/&gt;other researchers to further study this algorithm and its variants and&lt;br/&gt;applications. The particular issues examined in this proposal include:&lt;br/&gt;(1)further study of the properties of BF and the error and stability&lt;br/&gt;analysis of BF for irregular meshes; (2)the combination of finite element&lt;br/&gt;method and level set method with BF on triangular meshes; (3)further&lt;br/&gt;development of BF for level set method with applications in fluid dynamics&lt;br/&gt;and computer graphics; (4)study of possible applications of BF for other&lt;br/&gt;differential equations such as the Schrodinger equation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity in this project involves new methodologies in&lt;br/&gt;computational mathematics and opens new possibilities. The research&lt;br/&gt;approach will be a combination of theoretical analysis and their&lt;br/&gt;applications. An integrated cross-disciplinary curriculum will be developed&lt;br/&gt;suitable for students majoring in mathematics, physical sciences and&lt;br/&gt;engineering. The new methodologies developed in this project will enlarge&lt;br/&gt;the numerical recipes and can be applied to fluid dynamics, interface&lt;br/&gt;computation and their applications like atmospheric dynamics, ocean flow,&lt;br/&gt;ocean floor gas hydrate, crystal growth, biological fluid dynamics, elastic-&lt;br/&gt;plastic solids, astronomy, computer graphic, image processing, etc. The&lt;br/&gt;research results will be disseminated through conference presentations&lt;br/&gt;and publications. Progress in this project will also enhance the&lt;br/&gt;interaction among several subfields including level set method, finite&lt;br/&gt;element and finite difference methods etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
