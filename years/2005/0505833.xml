<AbstractNarration>Award abstract, DMS-0505833, S Shipman, Louisiana State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Electromagnetic Resonance in Periodic Structures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject is motivated by the abundance of analytical problems&lt;br/&gt;generated by interesting phenomena of scattering and resonance of&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic fields, which comprise a set of basic tools for the&lt;br/&gt;design of photo-electronic devices.  The driving phenomenon is the&lt;br/&gt;existence of photonic frequency stop-bands for periodically structured&lt;br/&gt;materials, called photonic crystals, which is the source of the&lt;br/&gt;richness of their resonant behavior.  One of the salient problems of current&lt;br/&gt;interest is anomalous transmission of source fields through periodic&lt;br/&gt;slabs near resonant frequencies, corresponding to weakly leaky guided&lt;br/&gt;slab modes.  The project addresses the mathematics of this and related&lt;br/&gt;problems on several fronts:  We use the complex-analytic theory of&lt;br/&gt;boundary-integral operators to obtain asymptotic formulas for the&lt;br/&gt;structure of transmission anomalies near non-robust slab modes; we&lt;br/&gt;pursue a development of the spectral theory for general open systems,&lt;br/&gt;such as leaky slabs, based on the concept of the unique conservative&lt;br/&gt;extension of a dissipative system; and we investigate the existence&lt;br/&gt;theory of modes and optimization of the associated resonant phenomena,&lt;br/&gt;as well as efficient numerical schemes for their simulation.&lt;br/&gt;Collaborators include S. Venakides, A. Figotin, D. Volkov, R. Lipton,&lt;br/&gt;and O. Bruno.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of their capacity to block electromagnetic waves at selected&lt;br/&gt;frequencies and to trap energy, photonic crystals have become a&lt;br/&gt;subject of intense research in recent decades.  Applications include&lt;br/&gt;high-efficiency lasers and filters, waveguides, and directional&lt;br/&gt;antennas.  Engineering of these devices relies on precise tuning of&lt;br/&gt;resonant frequencies, transmission-vs.-frequency profiles, and the&lt;br/&gt;interaction of open electromagnetic resonators with their surrounding&lt;br/&gt;medium.  This project aims to set the theoretical framework of these&lt;br/&gt;resonant phenomena on a solid mathematical footing.  The central theme&lt;br/&gt;is the frequency-response theory of open resonators, which provides&lt;br/&gt;the framework for the guiding of light and other radiation by&lt;br/&gt;structures, precise computation of the interaction of guided energy&lt;br/&gt;with applied sources, and optimization of resonant properties.&lt;br/&gt;Numerical computations and experimental results from the literature&lt;br/&gt;will guide the theoretical investigations.  The project involves an&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate student and a graduate student as research assistants.&lt;br/&gt;The undergraduate has been assisting the PI in numerical simulations&lt;br/&gt;and will be part of a collaboration with the computational&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetics group at Cal Tech.  The graduate student will pursue&lt;br/&gt;her Ph.D. on the subject of resonant scattering by periodic pillars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
