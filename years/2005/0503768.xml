<AbstractNarration>     The Euler equations, a set of partial differential equations&lt;br/&gt;that describe the motion of an inviscid fluid, are an&lt;br/&gt;exceptionally challenging system.  Friedlander studies issues&lt;br/&gt;related to these equations that involve important mathematical&lt;br/&gt;problems and at the same time reflect basic properties of fluid&lt;br/&gt;behaviour.  Friedlander and Pavlovic examine an infinite system of&lt;br/&gt;nonlinearly coupled ordinary differential equations that provide a&lt;br/&gt;simpler model of the Euler equations.  They use a variety of tools&lt;br/&gt;to examine the "closeness" of the model, for which they prove the&lt;br/&gt;existence of finite time singularities, to the Euler equations. &lt;br/&gt;In a separate line of research Friedlander and her collaborators&lt;br/&gt;continue a project that examines the stability and instability of&lt;br/&gt;fluid configurations.  They study the unstable spectrum of the&lt;br/&gt;Euler equation with the goal of a complete description of the&lt;br/&gt;structure of this spectrum over the energy norm for generic two-&lt;br/&gt;and three-dimensional flows.  This spectrum detects not only&lt;br/&gt;instability in the linear sense but also is closely related to&lt;br/&gt;natural physical questions about the transition from stability to&lt;br/&gt;instability for the full nonlinear system.  The investigator and&lt;br/&gt;her collaborators use a considerable range of mathematical&lt;br/&gt;techniques to carry out this research, including asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;methods, spectral theory, operator semi-group theory, dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems, and harmonic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The issue of stability or instability of a fluid flow is one&lt;br/&gt;of the central problems in fluid dynamics: stable flows are robust&lt;br/&gt;under inevitable disturbances in the environment, while unstable&lt;br/&gt;flows may break up, sometimes violently.  Even though the topic&lt;br/&gt;has been the subject for intense study over more than a century&lt;br/&gt;because of its connection with many branches of science, such as&lt;br/&gt;engineering, physics, oceanography, and meteorology, many&lt;br/&gt;questions remain open.  Friedlander uses mathematical techniques&lt;br/&gt;to answer some of these questions and her work shows that in some&lt;br/&gt;appropriate sense almost all fluid flows are unstable, although&lt;br/&gt;there are a number of different types of such instability.  A&lt;br/&gt;student is involved in the project, and the investigator continues&lt;br/&gt;various mentoring activities to encourage women to enter careers&lt;br/&gt;in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
