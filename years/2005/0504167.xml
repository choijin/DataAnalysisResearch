<AbstractNarration>0504167  Little  This project will develop a model to predict emissions of semi-volatile organic compounds from polymeric materials, focusing on emissions of the plasticizer di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DHEP) from PVC flooring materials. DHEP is present in concentrations as high as 30% by mass in PVC floorings. Specific research objectives include: (i) characterizing DEHP emissions from vinyl flooring in controlled stainless steel chambers with and without the presence of fine (aerosol) particles; (ii) determining equilibrium relationships for DEHP between vinyl flooring/air, stainless steel/air, and fine particles/air; (iii) measuring DEHP concentrations in vinyl flooring before, during, and after chamber tests; and (iv) integrating this information into an emissions model and validating it for DEHP. The project follows previous research to develop a model for emissions of volatile organic compounds from polymeric materials. The long-term goal is to use results of this study to design methods to reduce these emissions. The project will include the training of Ph.D. students and involvement of undergraduates in the research. The work will be integrated into graduate education by developing a laboratory exercise for a graduate environmental analytical chemistry course, thus bringing air quality issues into a course that previously focused only water issues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
