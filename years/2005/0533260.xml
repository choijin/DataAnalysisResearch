    <AbstractNarration>Support is provided under an SGER award to develop the load distribution factors (LDF) between loaded and unloaded carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) prestressed concrete box beams under traffic loads for highway bridges. This information is urgently needed for the first planned CFRP prestressed concrete bridge to be built in this country, which is already planned. In order to develop the LDF equations for this type of bridge two one-half scale CFRP concrete box beam bridge models with longitudinal and transverse CFRP prestressing strands will be built and fully instrumented. . Each bridge model will be post-tensioned at different unbonded transverse force levels. The bridge models will be subjected to eccentric and concentric truck loadings within the service load limit. The obtained LDF is of significant importance to bridge design engineers to properly size the prestressed concrete box beams. This investigation will result in valuable technical information that can be adopted in the design and construction of future CFRP prestressed concrete bridges in the USA. The data, design approach and construction information developed by the research team will offer design guidelines that can be implemented in future ACI and AASHTO design manuals.</AbstractNarration>
