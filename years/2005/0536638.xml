    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Wisconsin Fast Plants (WFP), a rapid-cycling (RC) line of Brassica rapa (mature seeds can be harvested 36 days after seed germination), is widely used for primary, secondary and undergraduate education. They have become the model organism for teaching plant physiology, nutrition and ecology and, to a limited extent, genetics. They have been used to help students develop quantitative skills as well as gain a deeper understanding of a number of biological processes and have been identified by the Council on Undergraduate Research as one of ten experimental systems ideally suited for undergraduate education. However, the use of WFP for teaching genetics is limited as there are only handful of modestly interesting qualitative traits available, a few qualitative traits defined (dwarf-stature, yellow-green leaves, and increased anthocyanin deposition) but only two quantitative traits (plant height and abundance of leaf and stem hairs). WFP are not self fertile and thus siblings need to be crossed to create populations that segregate for recessive traits. The lack of self fertility severely limits the ability to perform large-scale mutagenesis to identify interesting mutants. We have bred a self-compatible line and now are performing large-scale mutagenesis and identifying interesting mutants. We have begun to map these mutants and are also developing exercises in which teachers and their students can contribute to the creation of a genetic map based on phenotypic markers. In parallel, we are developing a physical map based on molecular(polymorphic) markers. This permits students to perform experiments that convey the concepts of linkage and the relationship between genetic and physical distance. Undergraduate students are involved in the development of both the mutant lines and the related educational modules. In addition the existence of the new lines provides a valuable tool for undergraduate research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Dissemination of information about this new genetic resource is being effectively achieved through the existing WFP outreach program (web, print and workshops). The WFP seeds are being redistributed by the Crucifer Genetics Cooperative and by a strong educational market distributor (Carolina Biological, North Carolina, USA). Many undergraduate faculty and K-12 teachers base laboratory and classroom exercises on WFP. They will now be able to add genetically malleable lines to their resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being partially supported by funds from the Plant Genome Research Program of the Directorate for Biological Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
