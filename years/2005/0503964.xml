    <AbstractNarration>In recent years there has seen a very fruitful exchange between ideas in the theory of kinetic &lt;br/&gt;equations and the theory of weak solutions for hyperbolic systems. At the core of this &lt;br/&gt;exchange lies the issue of deriving continuum theories from microscopic models of kinetic &lt;br/&gt;theory of gases or statistical physics. In this context transport properties play a crucial &lt;br/&gt;role whether in a framework of kinetic equations, or in a context of nonlinear transport &lt;br/&gt;as it appears with differential constraints in the context of polyconvex elastodynamics or &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear models for Maxwell?s equations. This proposal has the objectives to perform &lt;br/&gt;analytical and modeling work on the topics: (i) transport and oscillations in systems of two &lt;br/&gt;conservation laws, (ii) collisional kinetic models and their hydrodynamic limits, (iii) effect &lt;br/&gt;of differential constraints on the equations of polyconvex elastodynamics, (iv) mathematical &lt;br/&gt;aspects of kinetic theory of dilute polymers, and (v) development of kinetic techniques for &lt;br/&gt;homogenization problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hyperbolic systems of conservation laws express the basic laws of continuum physics and &lt;br/&gt;as such are central in modeling in the sciences. Kinetic modeling is becoming all the more &lt;br/&gt;pronounced, as microscopic modeling and the associated derivation of mesoscopic equations &lt;br/&gt;is commonplace in today?s engineering applications. Understanding of homogenization issues &lt;br/&gt;and the couplings in problems where multiple scales interact are necessary ingredients for the &lt;br/&gt;design of e &lt;br/&gt;cient computational algorithms that proceed without resolving all microscopic &lt;br/&gt;information of the problem. The mathematical analysis of issues related to the passage &lt;br/&gt;from small to coarser scales has significant implications on the design of high-performance &lt;br/&gt;computing algorithms, particularly when treating problems where scale interactions occur. &lt;br/&gt;Such problems are at the center of modern material science with several applications in &lt;br/&gt;chemical and materials engineering.</AbstractNarration>
