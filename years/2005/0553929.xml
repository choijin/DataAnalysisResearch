<AbstractNarration>This research is examining science and mathematics teacher learning in the context of an alternative certification program (designed for individuals with baccalaureate degrees in science or mathematics) employing two different models of field-based preparation.  In one model pre-service teachers are participating in an eight-week summer session and will become independent full-time teachers with complete responsibility for instruction.  In the second model pre-service teachers are participating in the same eight-week summer session followed by a guided yearlong internship under the mentorship of a veteran teacher.  In both models interns are continuing to enroll in university courses.  To examine teacher learning in these two models the researchers are collecting longitudinal data from 72 participants at five transition points in their programs.  Using a data collection cycle that includes lesson planning, observation, stimulated recall and reflection, the researchers are building a rich data set about teacher knowledge.  The intellectual merit of the project is derived from the qualifications and commitment of the investigators to advance knowledge concerning teacher learning in different models of alternative certification.  The findings are enhancing the science and mathematics education research literature where data on science and mathematics teacher learning in alternative certification programs and in field settings is scarce.  The project's broader impact is based on:  (1) its potential to inform the research community about science and mathematics teacher learning; (2) its implications for the design and implementation of alternative certification programs; (3) its implications for the design and implementation of field-based internships in science and mathematics teacher preparation; and (4) its potential to impact policymaking concerning teacher certification/licensure.  The ultimate beneficiaries of such research on teachers are K-12 students whose learning opportunities in science and mathematics will increase as the quality of the teaching workforce increases.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project is a longitudinal study of mathematics and science secondary teachers enrolled in an alternative certification program. Alternative certification programs are designed to address the shortage of teachers in our nation; yet we know little about how teacher knowledge develops in these programs.  We researched the teachersÆ incoming knowledge for teaching mathematics or science, and continued to examine their learning as they progressed through a one-year alternative certification program and into their first years of teaching.   Although the beginning teachers had strong content knowledge when they entered the alternative certification program, they needed to develop specialized knowledge for teaching mathematics or science. Many teachers entered the alternative certification program with traditional views of teaching focused on lecturing to students. As teachers took coursework in the alternative certification program and began to work with students in their internships, they became more aware of student difficulties. As a result, they developed more sophisticated knowledge about instruction, curriculum and assessment, as well as deeper knowledge of learners. Mathematics and science teachersÆ specialized knowledge for teaching is complex and differs from the knowledge of mathematicians and scientists. Beginning teachersÆ specialized knowledge development was often idiosyncratic, influenced by personal beliefs, the mentor teacher, school context and curriculum.  We compared the beginning teachersÆ knowledge development to the knowledge of experienced secondary mathematics and science teachers.  Experienced teachers had specialized knowledge for teaching that was highly integrated.  Their knowledge of student difficulties and assessment informed their instruction and sequencing of curriculum.  This research on beginning teachers and experienced teachers helps us begin to develop a developmental pathway for teachersÆ specialized knowledge, which in turn will inform the design of effective alternative certification programs and professional development for teachers in mathematics and science.
