<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The investigator plans to concentrate his efforts on large sample theory&lt;br/&gt;problems connected with self-normalized sums and functionals of the empirical&lt;br/&gt;distribution. His interest in self-normalized sums arose largely out of the&lt;br/&gt;question: When is the Student-t statistic asymptotically normal? Among his&lt;br/&gt;goals in this area, he hopes to complete the theory of the asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;distribution of self-normalized sums. The particular functionals of the&lt;br/&gt;empirical distribution that he plans to investigate include statistics and&lt;br/&gt;estimators based on distance measures such as the empirical Hellinger distance&lt;br/&gt;and a class of integral functionals of density estimators, which are used to&lt;br/&gt;estimate entropy and the integral of the squared density and its derivative.&lt;br/&gt;This will likely lead to the development of a theory of local U-statistics&lt;br/&gt;processes. This theory would be analogous to the local empirical process theory&lt;br/&gt;that he has worked out with a number of his long-term collaborators to study&lt;br/&gt;the large sample properties of kernel-type function estimators. These include&lt;br/&gt;kernel-type estimators of the density function, the regression function and the&lt;br/&gt;conditional distribution function. Local empirical process theory has shown&lt;br/&gt;itself to be a very powerful tool to determine exact rates of point-wise and&lt;br/&gt;uniform consistency of kernel-type nonparametric function estimators. A local&lt;br/&gt;U-statistics process theory should be at least as applicable. The research&lt;br/&gt;problems outlined in this proposal should lead to the creation of a number of&lt;br/&gt;new and useful methods to treat large sample theory problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator works in the borderline area between probability theory and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical statistics. He is delighted when he uncovers unexpected&lt;br/&gt;probabilistic phenomena that occasionally appear on this frontier. The problems&lt;br/&gt;that he is interested in are frequently motivated by questions about the limit&lt;br/&gt;behavior of statistical tests and estimators. They arise whenever one wants to&lt;br/&gt;make a decision on the basis of limited knowledge.  This is especially the case&lt;br/&gt;when it is not feasible to sample an entire population to settle a question&lt;br/&gt;about that population. Some typical examples are when a medical investigator is&lt;br/&gt;interested in deciding whether or not a proposed new drug or medical treatment&lt;br/&gt;is effective or a fisheries scientist wants to estimate the number of salmon&lt;br/&gt;that will return this season to spawn.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
