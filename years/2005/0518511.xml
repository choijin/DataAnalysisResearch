<AbstractNarration>Increasing evidence indicates that the Silurian, long viewed as "quiescent", was actually a very dynamic&lt;br/&gt;period from the standpoint of tectonics and ecological evolutionary events. However, correlations of strata&lt;br/&gt;and events, particularly during the mid-Silurian, remain ambiguous even in well-studied areas. This project&lt;br/&gt;proposes to establish a regional stratigraphic framework, paleogeography, and sea level history for the&lt;br/&gt;Niagaran (late Llandovery-Wenlock) in eastern North America (Laurentia), based on coupled K-bentonites,&lt;br/&gt;sequence stratigraphic, and biostratigraphic criteria. We will also evaluate the potential for international&lt;br/&gt;correlation by comparisons of newly discovered K-bentonite beds in North America and Avalonia. This&lt;br/&gt;research will: a) yield more precise correlation and bracketing of this interval in eastern North America,&lt;br/&gt;with emphasis on the Cincinnati Arch region; b) provide a test and extension of previous sequence&lt;br/&gt;stratigraphic interpretations; c) help to document the presence of and potentially, the position of volcanic&lt;br/&gt;activity and basin dynamics during early phases of the Salinic Orogeny (late Telychian-Wenlock); d)&lt;br/&gt;provide zircon-based radiometric dating of parts of the Niagaran Series (North American) and&lt;br/&gt;Llandovery/Wenlock Series (Britain); and e) explore the possibility of matching K-bentonite horizons or&lt;br/&gt;intervals of genetically similar ash beds, between Laurentia and Avalonia. High-resolution correlations will&lt;br/&gt;permit discrimination of regional sea level and tectonic history of late Llandovery-Wenlock strata within&lt;br/&gt;eastern Laurentia and provide tests for apparent synchroneity of various physical and biotic events&lt;br/&gt;regionally and globally.&lt;br/&gt;The specific benefits expected to emerge from this study can be summarized as follows:&lt;br/&gt;1) If K-bentonites and other event beds can be identified and traced within each paleogeographic area, as&lt;br/&gt;seems definite, this will permit a) high resolution stratigraphic correlation of late Llandovery-Wenlock strata&lt;br/&gt;within both eastern Laurentia and Avalonia; b) in turn, this will facilitate detailed linkage of stable platform&lt;br/&gt;areas with tectonically active basins; c) in both cases, but particularly in eastern North America (for which&lt;br/&gt;refined graptolite biostratigraphy is impossible). Such correlations will then permit tests for apparent&lt;br/&gt;synchroneity of various physical and biotic events. For example, similarities of relative sea level curves&lt;br/&gt;reconstructed from sequence stratigraphy suggest eustatic controls (Brett et al., 1990, 1998; Johnson et al.,&lt;br/&gt;1991); K-bentonites may provide independent high-resolution stratigraphic controls that will enable a&lt;br/&gt;definitive test of this inference. Bentonite correlations can also test for synchroneity of tectonic events, such&lt;br/&gt;as pulses of subsidence in the foreland and episodic uplift of the Findlay/Algonquin arch, and precursors of&lt;br/&gt;the Cincinnati arch (Ettensohn and Brett, 1998). Finally, refined correlations may provide a test of the&lt;br/&gt;coeval vs. diachronous nature of bioevents, such as the turnover pulses that separate intervals of relatively&lt;br/&gt;stable faunas (or ecological-evolutionary subunits) in the Appalachian Basin (Brett and Baird, 1995), and&lt;br/&gt;elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;2) At the very least, if synchroneity of stratigraphic sequences within each area can be established,&lt;br/&gt;and those patterns appear similar, then it will strengthen the case of allocyclic and probably eustatic, as&lt;br/&gt;opposed to strictly local autocyclic controls of facies fluctuations. Furthermore, if clusters of K-bentonites&lt;br/&gt;(as opposed to single fingerprinted beds) coincide approximately (within conodont biostratigraphic&lt;br/&gt;resolution) in Laurentia and Avalonia, this may corroborate models of shared tectonic histories, consistent&lt;br/&gt;with other tectonic evidence (Torsvik et al. 1996). Patterns of K-bentonite dispersal and thickness in each&lt;br/&gt;paleocontinent will aid in location of the volcanic source terranes and reconstruction of paleowind directions&lt;br/&gt;and paleogeography.&lt;br/&gt;3) Finally, the establishment of trans-Iapetus K-bentonite and sequence stratigraphic correlations: a)&lt;br/&gt;permit the first really detailed correlation of the Wenlock stratotype with the classic Niagaran provincial&lt;br/&gt;series of eastern North America; b) provide a test for global eustatic sea level curve recently proposed by&lt;br/&gt;Johnson and others (1991); c) provide a test for synchroneity of possible global bioevents.&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide a post-doctoral position for Michael DeSantis and give him further&lt;br/&gt;research experience in an area related to, but distinct from his doctoral studies. In addition, we intend to&lt;br/&gt;employ one or more undergraduates. These students will benefit from the training in field and laboratory&lt;br/&gt;research and may develop "capstone" projects resulting in senior theses and/or published abstracts and&lt;br/&gt;papers.</AbstractNarration>
