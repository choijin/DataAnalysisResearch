<AbstractNarration>Integrated Communication and Signal Processing for Wireless Sensor and Ad Hoc Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This integrative systems proposal focuses on the design of distributed sensor networks through an integrated communication and signal processing approach. Driven by the fundamental information processing inequality, we propose a new paradigm where the information transmission and processing are to be cohesively designed. Compared with the conventional separation approach, this proposed approach is both resource-efficient and superior in performance. Therefore, it is particularly suitable for resource and delay constrained sensor networks applications where all sensor nodes are engaged in a collective inference task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catering toward inference-centric sensor network applications, we will develop distributed joint source-channel coding algorithms that are superior in performance compared with the separation approach under stringent resource and delay constraints. In the absence of channel information, we offer a proactive signal processing design approach using the multiple description code idea. This distributed multiple description signaling scheme provides an intelligent and resource efficient way to exploit the source correlation at different sensor nodes and is robust to potential channel failures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad impacts of the proposed project are multi-faceted. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be actively engaged in the proposed research activities. While graduate students will play an integral role of the proposed research, undergraduate students will also be actively involved in well-structured research activities related to the proposed work. Exposure in carefully designed creative projects will help the students foster their long lasting enthusiasm in scientific research activities. Finally, the dissemination of the research results will be pursued through various educational initiatives, including new curriculum development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
