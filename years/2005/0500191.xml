<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    (mathematical)&lt;br/&gt;   This proposal is concerned with the analytic theory&lt;br/&gt;of automorphic forms. Specifically the study of the size&lt;br/&gt;of a general  automorphic L-function on the critical line&lt;br/&gt;and the size of an eigenfunction on an arithmetic locally symmetric&lt;br/&gt;space .In both cases the main goal is to establish a subconvex&lt;br/&gt;estimate . In the first case the sharpest form of such an estimate&lt;br/&gt;would follow from the Grand Riemann Hypothesis .However many of the&lt;br/&gt;desired applications of such estimates only require subconvexity.&lt;br/&gt;The applications are varied ,one such being the recent subconvex&lt;br/&gt;estimate by Cogdell,Piatetsky-Shapiro and the proposer which allows&lt;br/&gt;for the resolution of Hilbert's 11th problem on the representation&lt;br/&gt;of integers by quadratic forms in a number field.Other applications&lt;br/&gt;are to problems in mathematical physics ,specifically the behavior&lt;br/&gt;of quantum states in quantizations of classically chaotic systems. The&lt;br/&gt;second problem of the size of an eigenfunction on such locally&lt;br/&gt;symmetric spaces is closely associated with the first and the proposal is &lt;br/&gt;concerned with understanding this more difficult problem.It constitutes a &lt;br/&gt;generalization of the Ramanujan conjectures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(general):&lt;br/&gt;   The proposal is concerned with the study of special types of geometric &lt;br/&gt;spaces  which  are defined via arithmetic and number theoretic &lt;br/&gt;constructions. This has been an active area of investigation for the last &lt;br/&gt;60 or so  years ,primarily since it carries some of the most powerful tools &lt;br/&gt;that we know in number theory (to diophantine problems&lt;br/&gt;as well as ones  associated with prime numbers).  Specifically the&lt;br/&gt;seemingly technical issues that are being investigated have applications&lt;br/&gt;to resolve some  simple well known problems in number theory. One such is&lt;br/&gt;one of Hilbert's problems from 1900 concerning which numbers are sums of&lt;br/&gt;3 integer squares in an extention of the ordinary whole numbers to&lt;br/&gt;integers in a number field. Other applications of this theory are perhaps&lt;br/&gt;less traditional and are to Mathematical Physics,specifically Quantum&lt;br/&gt;Chaos. These spaces provide one of the few (in fact the only one) classically &lt;br/&gt;chaotic Hamiltonian systems whose quantization can be satisfactorally studied &lt;br/&gt;mathematically. The techniques to do so are number theoretic and the results &lt;br/&gt;are often quite surprizing.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
