<AbstractNarration>The PI proposes to study properties of B-mesons with the aim of extracting &lt;br/&gt;fundamental parameters from precision data obtained at B-factories and other &lt;br/&gt;accelerators. He will perform detailed calculations of B-Bbar mixing and &lt;br/&gt;develop factorization theorems for the two-body decays of B-mesons into a &lt;br/&gt;charmonium state plus a light meson. In this way he plans to separate the &lt;br/&gt;effects of strong interaction matrix elements from those of fundamental &lt;br/&gt;parameters such as CKM matrix elements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the broader aspects of the proposal, the PI plans an active program of &lt;br/&gt;outreach to African-American students and other under-represented groups in &lt;br/&gt;Detroit schools. In particular he will establish a network of computers in &lt;br/&gt;the schools which will be used to train students during the school day and &lt;br/&gt;to perform particle physics calculations at other times. He will also be involved in the local REU and RET programs and develop courses on the ?History of the Universe? to instruct high school teachers and students about particle physics and astrophysics and cosmology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
