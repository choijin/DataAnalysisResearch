<AbstractNarration>0540686&lt;br/&gt;Natland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Chapman Conference, "The Great Plume Debate", will be held in Fort William,&lt;br/&gt;Scotland in August, 2005. A global debate is now in progress concerning the existence&lt;br/&gt;of mantle plumes, the number of deep mantle plumes, and the viability of alternative&lt;br/&gt;models. Recent meetings have focused either on plume theory or alternatives, and it is&lt;br/&gt;now timely to hold a discussion meeting that brings together representatives of both sides&lt;br/&gt;of the debate. The primary objectives will be to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a) Clarify and define both the plume and alternative theories, their predictions and how&lt;br/&gt;they may be tested;&lt;br/&gt;b) Match them against one another; and&lt;br/&gt;c) Identify the most important avenues of future research that may ultimately lead to&lt;br/&gt;resolution of the debate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will be balanced and structured to present both pro-plume and alternative&lt;br/&gt;points of view in sessions dealing with theory, mantle physics and dynamics, field&lt;br/&gt;evidence, age dating, seismology, temperature, petrology and geochemistry, and&lt;br/&gt;planetary aspects. The conveners include two who are arranging the pro-plume side of&lt;br/&gt;the discussion, and two who are arranging the plume-skeptic side. The venue in Scotland&lt;br/&gt;was chosen to facilitate international participation, and to allow participation in field&lt;br/&gt;trips. These will be to several of the major central volcanic complexes and intrusive&lt;br/&gt;centers of the Scottish Hebrides that have long provided many of the important concepts&lt;br/&gt;of igneous structural geology and petrogenesis in what is now termed the North Atlantic&lt;br/&gt;Large Igneous Province.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Average expenses for this meeting for US participants, based on the current&lt;br/&gt;dollars to sterling exchange rate will be about $2100, including $1000 for air fare.&lt;br/&gt;Presently, there are 52 U.S. applicants who have submitted abstracts including 5 students.&lt;br/&gt;Many of these have requested financial assistance. This award ($20,000) will defray costs for 25 participants, especially students and young scientists, by an average amount of $800.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
