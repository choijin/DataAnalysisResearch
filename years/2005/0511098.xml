<AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pervasive Computing is becoming more and more prevalent in our society. Rapid developments in wireless technologies and Sensor-network-based smart spaces are creating an urgent need for well-trained engineers in Pervasive Computing. Unfortunately, most universities have only graduate-level Pervasive Computing courses, which may not be suitable for undergraduate learning. Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) is currently undertaking an effort to enhance the pervasive computing skills of our undergraduate students in two programs, Computer Engineering (in College of Engineering) and Computer Science (in College of Science). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project is enhancing RIT undergraduate computing skills by adapting and implementing some of the exemplary Wireless &amp; Mobile Computing lab environments at Benchmark Universities (Cornell, Rutgers and UIUC). RIT is establishing a Pervasive Computing Laboratory (PCL) that provides an integrated wireless-plus-wired networking platform, including current pervasive computing platforms such as Wireless LAN based on IEEE standard 802.11g, personal area networks based on Bluetooth technology and wireless sensor networks. The PCL is providing the Computer Engineering students with an understanding of computer networking issues on different mobile hardware platforms, and is providing the Computer Science students with an understanding of data management needs within pervasive computing environments. Three new courses (Pervasive Computing Architecture &amp; Design, Principles of Wireless &amp; Mobile Networks, and Data Management for Pervasive Computing) and a series of laboratory assignments are being developed to enhance the undergraduate curriculum of both majors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The PCL is providing an excellent opportunity for the students and faculty to foster inter-college cooperation between two of the traditionally well-known undergraduate programs at RIT. By leveraging the multi-disciplinary character of RIT, the PCL is enhancing the diversity of pervasive computing skills in our nations' high-technology workforce since the students will be engaged in exploring several pervasive computing environments for monitoring/analyzing the physical world. In addition, RIT is using the PCL equipment and basic materials to train high school students through workshops. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
