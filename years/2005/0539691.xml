    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the ability to produce an innovative thermal management solution for electronics components and electronics packaging. The dual trends of electronics miniaturization and increased power consumption have caused many electronics components to hit a "thermal wall." Improved thermal management materials are needed that provide high thermal conductivities, low coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), low density and low cost. This approach combines an ultrahigh thermal conductivity carbon fiber combined with a unique matrix that produces a composite with conductivity in excess of 1000 W/m-K. This is achieved with a production time on the order of days rather than months. The end result will be an innovative, commercially-viable method for producing a thermal management material that outperforms existing materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This innovative approach for carbon-carbon composite fabrication will test the feasibility of producing dramatically improved, thermally- and mechanically-robust carbon-carbon composites for thermal management materials. Improved thermal management materials will find use in electronic devices with increasing power output levels required for future advanced systems such as aircraft, spacecraft, and supercomputers. Industries that would benefit from these innovations include consumer electronics, communications systems, high precision manufacturing, satellites and other aerospace applications.</AbstractNarration>
