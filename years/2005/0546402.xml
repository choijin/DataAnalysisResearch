<AbstractNarration>Wireless ad-hoc networks enable high utility applications for disaster recovery or military situations, mesh networks of homes, and wireless sensing networks. This work considers multiple-layer modeling, optimization, and design of multi-hop wireless ad hoc networks. It includes the two, currently debated, architectural choices - cross-layer and layered. The project contributes to practical design as well as fundamental/theoretical understanding. It considers three canonical problems: optimal correlated data aggregation, (cooperative) data relaying, and delay-throughput optimality. Mathematical tools used include information theory, stochastic decision processes, queuing theory and algorithm complexity. Simulations of the new models complement the mathematical analysis. Some of the resulting designs are prototyped experimentally. The project involves undergraduate and graduate students, a jointly developed outreach plan with a high school teacher, and course/laboratory development. Results, including software code, are disseminated through the project web page as well as regular publications.</AbstractNarration>

The gains attained by mobile sensors over static sensors and the optimal motion strategies for mobile sensors are not well understood. In this research we consider the problem of event capture using mobile sensors. The events of interest arrive at certain points in the sensor field and fade away according to arrival and departure time distributions. An event is said to be captured if it is sensed by one of the mobile sensors before it fades away. For this scenario we analyze ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
