<AbstractNarration>The proposed research project develops models for multivariate categorical&lt;br/&gt;data by mimicking Gaussian models with a desired model structure that can&lt;br/&gt;be captured in terms of the non-parametric concept of conditional&lt;br/&gt;independence.  This method has a long history: graphical log-linear models&lt;br/&gt;can be induced in this way by Gaussian models defined by zero constraints&lt;br/&gt;on the inverse covariance matrix. The project seeks to greatly extend the&lt;br/&gt;scope of the approach.  It is proposed to define and study marginal&lt;br/&gt;independence models for contingency tables, discrete-valued time series&lt;br/&gt;with moving average-like dependence structure, seemingly unrelated&lt;br/&gt;regressions with discrete response variables, and discrete graphical&lt;br/&gt;models based on the recently introduced AMP chain graphs and ancestral&lt;br/&gt;graphs.  The main objectives of the study are development of&lt;br/&gt;parameterizations, construction and implementation of efficient algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for maximum likelihood estimation, and investigation of procedures for&lt;br/&gt;model selection. A particular focus of the project will be on employing&lt;br/&gt;modern tools from computational algebra in the analysis of the structure of&lt;br/&gt;parameter spaces and properties of likelihood functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multivariate statistical models seek to describe the complex relationships&lt;br/&gt;between a large set of variables. A particular class of such models,&lt;br/&gt;called graphical models, has found wide-spread application in fields like&lt;br/&gt;artificial intelligence, bio-informatics, biology, epidemiology, and&lt;br/&gt;speech recognition.  The models proposed in the project extend the realm&lt;br/&gt;of graphical models and it is anticipated that they will be applied in&lt;br/&gt;many of these fields.  Moreover, the proposed methodology will provide new&lt;br/&gt;tools for the analysis of data of public interest such as census data.&lt;br/&gt;The researchers also plan to make software tools freely available as part&lt;br/&gt;of a larger open source statistical software package called R.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
