    <AbstractNarration>The Caribbean region is recognized as a "biodiversity hotspot" due to the high proportion of Caribbean species found nowhere else in the world (e.g., 58% of terrestrial plant species and 51% of terrestrial vertebrate species) combined with the low amount of intact native vegetation remaining (estimated at only 10 - 15%). On Caribbean islands, as elsewhere in the world, ants are a very important component of virtually every terrestrial ecosystem. Although native ant species are integral to the functioning of intact natural ecosystems, the native ant diversity of most Caribbean islands remains largely unknown. Now several destructive exotic ant species, including the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), are spreading through the region, acting as economically important pests and threatening native invertebrate diversity. Although the presence of certain exotic ant species is a reliable bio-indicator of ecosystem degradation, few local researchers currently are capable of distinguishing native ant species from invasive exotic pests. Researchers on this project will survey and inventory ants on all 30 major islands (&gt;50 km2) in the Eastern Caribbean, including the Greater Antilles east of Hispanola (Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands), the Lesser Antilles, the Leeward Antilles, and the South American Shelf islands. In addition, researchers on this project will train local researchers in the Eastern Caribbean and undergraduates in ant research techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The research component of this project will form a solid foundation for all future studies of Caribbean ants. Research products will include descriptions of new species, faunal inventories for each island, biogeographic and ecological analyses, and distribution and impact assessments for different species of invasive ants. Technological products will include a web accessible database of all specimen information and a web-based interactive key for identifying Caribbean ants. The education component of this project will train local researchers to help limit the impact of invasive ants and help preserve the unique biodiversity of Caribbean islands.</AbstractNarration>
