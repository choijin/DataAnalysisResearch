<AbstractNarration>This award initiates the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Child Injury Prevention Studies at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.  The Center's research will study how children experience trauma in vehicles and what can be engineered to make them safe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center's research agenda will be initiated with projects in Effect of High Back Booster Seat Seating Angle and Seat Belt Positioning on Injury Metrics of a 6-Year-Old; Misuse Study of LATCH Attachments:  A Series of Sled Tests; Lower Extremity Injuries in Children Seated in Forward Facing Child Restraint Systems; Identifying Motor Vehicle Crash Characteristics for Anatomic-specific Fatal Injuries in Child Occupants; Cervical Range of Motion in Young Children. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
