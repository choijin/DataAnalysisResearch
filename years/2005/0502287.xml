<AbstractNarration>A departmental honors program at a moderately selective public research &lt;br/&gt;university can play a significant role in the mathematics education of &lt;br/&gt;talented American students. Such universities cast a wide net. Large merit &lt;br/&gt;awards draw a few students with sterling high school records while thousands &lt;br/&gt;arrive each year having, for whatever reason, not amassed the high SAT/ACT &lt;br/&gt;scores and leadership roles needed to gain admission to highly selective &lt;br/&gt;institutions. Sifting through the latter group reveals a small but significant &lt;br/&gt;number with latent high mathematical talent. These 'sleeper' students come to &lt;br/&gt;life during their first exposure to abstract math, and their work in advanced &lt;br/&gt;courses can match or exceed that of their peers who excelled in high school. A &lt;br/&gt;strong departmental honors program can be the framework that identifies and &lt;br/&gt;supports this diverse group, drawing on the department's graduate and research &lt;br/&gt;resources as it guides them as rapidly as possible through the transition to &lt;br/&gt;advanced abstract and applied mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Tennessee Math Honors Program provides early identification &lt;br/&gt;of talent, a flexible curriculum that places undergraduates in graduate &lt;br/&gt;courses as early as the sophomore year, an honors seminar, and significant &lt;br/&gt;mentoring and advising. The program draws on the surrounding rural Appalachian &lt;br/&gt;region, providing opportunity to students who may have received little support &lt;br/&gt;and stimulation in high school for their mathematical abilities. More than 75% &lt;br/&gt;of the grant is devoted to direct financial support to students in the form of &lt;br/&gt;merit and need-based scholarships, research stipends and summer tuition &lt;br/&gt;remission. Scholarships will be awarded to a few incoming freshmen, but mainly &lt;br/&gt;to current UT students who decide to follow an accelerated track through the &lt;br/&gt;honors program. University cost sharing of close to 10% of the grant total &lt;br/&gt;will allow the program to offer multi-year scholarships extending beyond the &lt;br/&gt;five-year term of the grant. Additional funding supports graduate students as &lt;br/&gt;summer research mentors for undergraduates, administration and assessment of &lt;br/&gt;the program. A 'math ambassadors' program funded by the grant will send honors &lt;br/&gt;students to high schools to increase interest in mathematics in general and &lt;br/&gt;the UT Math Honors program in particular. The funding is expected increase the &lt;br/&gt;size of the UT Math Honors program by more than 50%.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
