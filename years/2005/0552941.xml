<AbstractNarration>Abstract for REU Site: Projects in Complex Fluids and their Applications&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL)&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Ramesh K. Agarwal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU award for a Site in Complex Fluids supports 8 undergraduates each year for three years in a 10-week summer research experience at Washington University.  The faculty team is diverse, has broad research interests, and an outstanding record of mentoring undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several faculty members from various departments (Mechanical &amp; Aerospace, Chemical, Environmental, Biomedical, and Electrical Engineering) have been engaged in cutting edge research in the analytical/computational and experimental study of transport and interfacial dynamics of complex fluids, and in related areas such as nanoparticle transport in micro-scale systems and their formation in chemically reactive flow systems, folding and self-assembly of proteins, nematic-isotropic phase transitions in micro-channels, nanofabrication, etc.  In many of their research projects, undergraduate students have been involved and have been a significant contributor. This REU site will build upon that established research activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site program will provide a meaningful research experience to some of the best undergraduate students from across the nation, including underrepresented minorities.  The specific goals of the program are to provide the students with (1) an introduction to research in complex fluids, micro-fluidics, nanoparticles transport in micro-scale systems, etc., in an integrated fashion through research projects and workshops, (2) training and practical experience with experimental design, data collection, and data analysis from both experiments and computations, (3) an opportunity to develop abilities to communicate technical information in a professional manner through written reports and oral presentations, (4) exposure to real-world applications through visits to local engineering companies, (5) exposure to ethical issues in conduct of research and in engineering practice, and (6) encouragement to pursue advanced degrees in science or engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
