<AbstractNarration>Proposal to Fund an International Workshop on&lt;br/&gt;Networked Sensing, Information and Control&lt;br/&gt;Support is requested for organizing an international workshop on networked sensing,&lt;br/&gt;information and control. The workshop will be held in Boston area over two days, Friday&lt;br/&gt;and Saturday, in Jan-Feb 2006 time frame. The meeting will be organized around the&lt;br/&gt;technical domains dealing with informational and mathematical aspects of networked sensing.&lt;br/&gt;On account of breadth and diversity of work in this topic, we expect very broad interest&lt;br/&gt;and participation from the systems community (systems and control, signal processing and&lt;br/&gt;information theory). We are requesting $49,500 in funds to support travel and subsistence&lt;br/&gt;for workshop participants.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The aim of the proposed workshop is to bring together researchers&lt;br/&gt;studying informational &amp; mathematical aspects of networked sensing systems. The impor-&lt;br/&gt;tance and timeliness of this workshop is evidenced by the explosion of several independent&lt;br/&gt;special sessions devoted to specific aspects of sensor networks in reputed international confer-&lt;br/&gt;ences. Despite these efforts the focus has been on specific and isolated aspects of networked&lt;br/&gt;sensing and there is a need for cross-disciplinary efforts to integrate ideas from the various&lt;br/&gt;research communities. The workshop will bring together internationally reputed researchers&lt;br/&gt;from control, information theory and signal processing focused on the common theme of&lt;br/&gt;distributed sensing, inferencing, and control over networks.&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact: On account of the contemporaneous nature of the topic, we have no doubt&lt;br/&gt;that there will significant interest evinced by the both the research and industrial community&lt;br/&gt;at large. The workshop will organize panel discussions to address gaps between educational&lt;br/&gt;curricula and research, as well as between industry and academia. We will also attempt to&lt;br/&gt;organize panel sessions focused on identifying critical divides between the different research&lt;br/&gt;communities and constructive ways of bridging these gaps. The workshop will disseminate&lt;br/&gt;the outcome of the workshop through publication of a volume of papers and essays edited&lt;br/&gt;by the organizers as well as some members from the program committee.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
