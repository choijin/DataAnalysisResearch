<AbstractNarration>The Milagro Gamma Ray Observatory at Fenton Hill, New Mexico, is designed to study "Very &lt;br/&gt;High Energy" (VHE) astronomical gamma rays and cosmic rays, for which a single particle carries &lt;br/&gt;about an erg of energy. Milagro is the first detector capable of continuously monitoring the full &lt;br/&gt;overhead sky at these energies. It complements the lower energy satellite experiments, higher &lt;br/&gt;energy air-shower experiments, and narrow field-of-view air-Cherenkov telescope experiments. &lt;br/&gt;A VHE gamma ray or cosmic ray interacting in the Earth's atmosphere initiates an extensive &lt;br/&gt;air shower, a cascade of interacting particles. The Milagro 22 million liter man-made pond is &lt;br/&gt;instrumented with detectors that measure light produced by those fast moving cascade particles &lt;br/&gt;that survive to detector altitude and enter the pond. Combining pond measurements with those by &lt;br/&gt;an array of detectors surrounding it allows determination of the energy and arrival direction of the &lt;br/&gt;primary particle that generated the cascade. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the energy of particles emitted by astronomical sources is determined by the physical &lt;br/&gt;processes occurring in the source, measurements at VHE energies, the highest at which astronomical &lt;br/&gt;sources have been observed, allows study of the most violent astronomical processes known. &lt;br/&gt;An example is gamma-ray bursts, currently believed to arise from either supernovae explosions or &lt;br/&gt;neutron star collisions. Active galactic nuclei, understood to contain massive black holes that swallow &lt;br/&gt;neighboring matter, are a detected source of VHE particles. Milagro has recently presented &lt;br/&gt;evidence for the first detection of VHE gamma rays emitted at the equator of our own Milky Way &lt;br/&gt;Galaxy. Milagro also detects solar coronal mass-ejection events, as an increase in detector rates, &lt;br/&gt;before they disrupt radio communication on Earth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The particle energy and direction distribution generated by a source may be modified during &lt;br/&gt;the particles' interstellar or intergalactic path to Earth by interactions with background particles &lt;br/&gt;or bending of charged particle trajectories by magnetic fields. Measurement of VHE particles &lt;br/&gt;therefore also teaches us about the interstellar infrared radiation and sources of magnetic fields &lt;br/&gt;such as galactic clusters. The Solar magnetic field is studied by observing the shadowing of arriving &lt;br/&gt;VHE cosmic rays by the Moon and Sun. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to randomization of their arrival direction by galactic magnetic fields, cosmic rays arrive at &lt;br/&gt;the Earth nearly uniformly in direction. At VHE energies, however, small deviations are predicted &lt;br/&gt;due to the orbital motion of the solar system about the galactic center. Anisotropies observed by &lt;br/&gt;Milagro at the level of one part in a thousand are under study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Searches for exotic VHE photon sources, such as weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) &lt;br/&gt;annihilation or evaporation of primordial black holes, are also performed. As VHE sources without &lt;br/&gt;known lower energy counterparts have just begun to be discovered in the last few years, full-sky &lt;br/&gt;coverage is likely to provide additional surprises. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cooperation between Milagro and various experiments at other energies allows symbiotic studies. &lt;br/&gt;The statistical power of the Milagro gamma ray burst analysis is enhanced when satellite &lt;br/&gt;detections are used as a trigger. Milagro will in turn be notifying the astrophysics community &lt;br/&gt;in real-time of any statistically significant signals it detects. Combined measurements by various &lt;br/&gt;experiments at different energies constrain models of particle production and interstellar background &lt;br/&gt;light absorption. Similar advantages exist when Milagro measurements of coronal solar &lt;br/&gt;mass-ejection events are combined with those of neutron monitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
