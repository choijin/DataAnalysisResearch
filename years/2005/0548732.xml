<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase II project advances Syandus's interactive learning platform by integrating multiplayer game technology.  Syandus's current interactive delivery platform allows pharmaceutical firms and content experts to communicate complex concepts to physicians and patients through interactive presentations, discussion groups or self-directed learning.  The addition of network-enabled collaboration afforded by this proposed project creates the opportunity for interaction between users and content experts without the constraints of geography.  The integration of multiplayer game technology into Syandus's platform requires the innovative application of this technology to serve a new purpose.  This proposal will support modification of the existing platform to function in a collaborative setting, building a collaborative engine to synchronize application data between users, integration of a third party multiplayer networking solution and development of a prototype application to test collaborative functionality.  Syandus has completed projects with several of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies for the delivery of innovative medical education products based on the existing platform.  In the first business application derived from this proposed concept, physicians will be able to remotely connect with nationwide content experts to interactively learn the latest best practices and medical science in a more compelling way than currently available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pharmaceutical industry strives to communicate medical science innovation and new treatment methods through an information cascade from international and national level thought leaders, to regional physician thought leaders, to practicing physicians and their patients. The anticipated results from the proposed concept will be a learning tool for pharmaceutical companies that allow groups of physicians nationwide to have an interactive dialog about a disease state and appropriate treatment.  Longer term, in the educational realm, Syandus's technology could be used to develop more sophisticated collaborative learning environments that allow students, regardless of geographical location, to assemble in a virtual biological world or system (such as a cell or organ) and work together as individuals or in groups to solve problems and optimize processes.  A highly rewarding learning experience can be created through the free exchange of information and ideas enabled by a collaborative network coupled with compelling visuals, rich interactivity and the underlying intelligence of mathematical models.  Transforming Syandus's existing platform with multi user capability adds rich human interaction into the remote learning process, brings scientific models to life, and allows greater dissemination of knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
