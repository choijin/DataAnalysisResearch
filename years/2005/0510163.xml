<AbstractNarration>NSF 0510163&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental Simulation Studies of Mixing at Sliding Interfaces  &lt;br/&gt;PI - Falk, University of Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator and student supported by this grant employ computer simulation on the atomic scale to model the mixing that occurs at the surface when two materials slide against one another.  During sliding the way the material responds to elevated stress is intimately connected to the way in which mixing proceeds.  These processes are important to several areas of engineering including the prediction of friction, which results in the inefficient use of energy, and wear, which results in the degradation and failure of machines and devices.  A greater understanding of mixing at sliding interfaces is also critical for the development of new solid-state joining processes such as friction welding and friction-stir welding that can potentially obviate the need for environmentally harmful and/or toxic processes currently used to join metals.  These joining processes have proved important in providing safe, cost-effective and reliable methods for joining of aluminum alloys. The increased use of these lightweight alloys in automotive applications will be critical for increasing fuel economy standards of vehicles to decrease their environmental impact.  New alloys can also be created by using such processes to mix metals in the solid state.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variety of different metallic materials are being simulated including metallic glasses and nano-crystalline metals, and the simulations are being compared with the experimental literature.  This research provides new ways of understanding the connection between surface treatment, microstructure and mechanical properties.  The aim of this research is to establish the foundation for predictive models of microstructure development and mechanical mixing in metal alloys. In addition the investigator is developing graduate education methodologies that provide expertise in relating simulation to experiment.  Computational methods developed as part of this research are being incorporated in the introductory computer programming class the investigator teaches to approximately 200 first-year students and in to outreach efforts.  These efforts aim to encourage students to pursue careers in computational science and computer-related disciplines by showing the potential impact of simulation on society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
