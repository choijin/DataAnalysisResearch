<AbstractNarration>Human domination of the earth has led to rapid changes in ecosystem &lt;br/&gt;functioning, and has degraded many functions that are essential to human &lt;br/&gt;survival, such as climate regulation, water purification and crop &lt;br/&gt;pollination. Research on ecosystem function has traditionally been done at &lt;br/&gt;small spatial scales using artificially-assembled communities. We therefore &lt;br/&gt;lack a full understanding of how human activities influence function in &lt;br/&gt;real landscapes where the changes are occurring. The proposed study will &lt;br/&gt;investigate a critical ecological function, pollination, in the context of &lt;br/&gt;human-induced land use change. The researchers will examine pollination &lt;br/&gt;provided to native plant species growing in natural habitat fragments, and &lt;br/&gt;to crop plants in agricultural areas. Both systems will be considered &lt;br/&gt;across a gradient of land use intensity, i.e., with study sites surrounded &lt;br/&gt;to varying extents by agriculture and urban/suburban development. The &lt;br/&gt;following questions will be investigated: (1) How do pollinator communities &lt;br/&gt;change (in terms of number of species, community composition, abundance and &lt;br/&gt;biomass) with increasing land use intensity? (2) What are the functional &lt;br/&gt;consequences of pollinator community change for native plant and crop &lt;br/&gt;pollination? (3) What environmental factors most strongly influence &lt;br/&gt;pollination function?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will benefit society at large, because as human populations &lt;br/&gt;grow, it becomes increasingly important to maintain ecosystem services that &lt;br/&gt;prevent shortages of water, energy and food. Crop pollination provided by &lt;br/&gt;wild species, which depend on natural habitats, can provide economic &lt;br/&gt;incentives for conserving these habitats. The investigators will transmit &lt;br/&gt;the results of their study to land owners and land managers through &lt;br/&gt;workshops, manuals, the media, and collaborative projects with conservation &lt;br/&gt;and farming organizations.  The broader impacts of this work will also &lt;br/&gt;include promoting teaching, training and learning by providing &lt;br/&gt;opportunities for independent and collaborative undergraduate projects, &lt;br/&gt;focusing on women from Bryn Mawr College.</AbstractNarration>
