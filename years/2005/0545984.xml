<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0545984&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Dan F. Knopf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad goals of the investigator's research program are to find and&lt;br/&gt;classify optimal geometries using curvature flows. This subject is&lt;br/&gt;currently enjoying a period of intense interest and rapid progress,&lt;br/&gt;inspired by Perelman's landmark results in Hamilton's program to&lt;br/&gt;resolve the Poincare and Geometrization Conjectures by Ricci flow. In&lt;br/&gt;applications of Ricci flow, one evolves a Riemannian metric on a&lt;br/&gt;manifold to simplify and improve its geometry. In many cases, these&lt;br/&gt;improvements involve changes in topology that are triggered by&lt;br/&gt;singularity formation. Such improvements are possible because&lt;br/&gt;solutions of Ricci flow (like many other nonlinear PDE) are expected&lt;br/&gt;to exhibit very special, highly symmetric profiles in a space-time&lt;br/&gt;neighborhood of a developing singularity. A thorough and deep&lt;br/&gt;understanding of singularity formation is therefore of critical&lt;br/&gt;importance for extracting topological and geometric information from&lt;br/&gt;Ricci flow behavior. The investigator's immediate objectives focus on&lt;br/&gt;singularity formation for curvature flows, particularly (1) analytic&lt;br/&gt;aspects (asymptotics) of singularity formation, (2) the structure of&lt;br/&gt;singularities in dimension four, (3) singularities of Kaehler-Ricci&lt;br/&gt;flow, (4) the structure of Perelman's entropy and reduced distance,&lt;br/&gt;and (5) applications of geometric flows to problems in&lt;br/&gt;physics. Progress toward these objectives will lead to new&lt;br/&gt;applications of Ricci flow in the geometry and topology of manifolds,&lt;br/&gt;productive insights into parallels between various geometric flows,&lt;br/&gt;and new applications of curvature flows to problems motivated by&lt;br/&gt;materials science and physics. These objectives are well suited to&lt;br/&gt;collaborations with other researchers in geometric evolution equations&lt;br/&gt;and in related fields like comparison geometry, low-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;topology, and nonlinear analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The partial differential equations that arise in curvature flows are&lt;br/&gt;remarkably similar to equations used to model heat propagation, the&lt;br/&gt;movement of oil in shale and thin films, combustion in porous media,&lt;br/&gt;and certain effects in plasma physics. By increasing our understanding&lt;br/&gt;of singularity formation for such equations, the research elements of&lt;br/&gt;this project may contribute to progress in these applications. The&lt;br/&gt;education elements of the project are very tightly integrated with its&lt;br/&gt;research focus. The cornerstone of this integration is a series of&lt;br/&gt;annual workshops: each will contain a graduate education component, a&lt;br/&gt;research component, and an undergraduate outreach component. The&lt;br/&gt;education component includes an organized seminar to prepare graduate&lt;br/&gt;students for participation in the research component. The outreach&lt;br/&gt;component includes invitations to local undergraduate students to&lt;br/&gt;interact with the visiting researchers with the goal of attracting&lt;br/&gt;those students to further studies in mathematics. The project will&lt;br/&gt;benefit undergraduate education in two other ways: the investigator&lt;br/&gt;will develop a new course in optimal geometry and integrate it into&lt;br/&gt;the liberal-arts honors curriculum at the University of Texas, and the&lt;br/&gt;investigator will organize and direct an undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;learning-by-discovery project in which students investigate&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial curvature flows.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
