<AbstractNarration>The problem of the existence of a constant scalar curvature Kahler &lt;br/&gt;metric in a given Kahler class is an important and difficult problem &lt;br/&gt;and has provided the motivation for much current research in Kahler &lt;br/&gt;geometry.  For the special case of Kahler-Einstein metrics on Fano &lt;br/&gt;manifolds, existence was conjectured by Yau to be equivalent to the &lt;br/&gt;stability of the manifold in the sense of geometric invariant theory.  &lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes to study three parabolic flows of &lt;br/&gt;Kahler potentials which arise naturally in this context.  The first is &lt;br/&gt;the J-flow, which is the gradient flow of a functional appearing in &lt;br/&gt;Chen's formula for the Mabuchi energy.  The study of the J-flow has led &lt;br/&gt;to significant advances in understanding the lower boundedness and &lt;br/&gt;asymptotics of the Mabuchi energy.  The second is the Kahler-Ricci &lt;br/&gt;flow.  Its behavior in the Fano case is not yet well understood, and it &lt;br/&gt;is proposed that the method of multiplier ideal sheaves may capture the &lt;br/&gt;necessary information about its singularities to be able to provide a &lt;br/&gt;link with stability.   The third is the Calabi flow.  It is a fourth &lt;br/&gt;order parabolic PDE about which little is known in general.  The &lt;br/&gt;principal investigator intends to study the problem of long time &lt;br/&gt;existence of this flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important problem in geometry and physics is whether a given space &lt;br/&gt;has a special notion of distance.  Take, for example, the two &lt;br/&gt;dimensional sphere - the surface of a ball.  With our usual sense of &lt;br/&gt;distance, this space is curved in the same way at every point.  We say &lt;br/&gt;that the sphere admits a 'metric of constant curvature'. Not all spaces &lt;br/&gt;admit such metrics, and it is an interesting and deep problem to find &lt;br/&gt;conditions under which they do.   A natural and beautiful approach to &lt;br/&gt;this problem is the parabolic, or 'heat flow' method.  The idea is &lt;br/&gt;simple.  The distribution of heat in an object (not subject to outside &lt;br/&gt;sources) will flow in time, becoming more even and finally constant - &lt;br/&gt;no matter what the initial distribution looked like.  In a similar way, &lt;br/&gt;if we start with an arbitrary notion of distance on a space, then we &lt;br/&gt;can apply a natural 'heat flow' and hope to prove, under the right &lt;br/&gt;conditions, that we obtain convergence to a metric of constant &lt;br/&gt;curvature, or some other special metric, as time evolves.  If no such &lt;br/&gt;metrics exist, then we expect the flow to go wrong - to develop &lt;br/&gt;singularities. The PI intends to study the question of convergence and &lt;br/&gt;singularities of three such parabolic flows corresponding to different &lt;br/&gt;types of special metrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
