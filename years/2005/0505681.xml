    <AbstractNarration>Abstract, DMS-0505681, J Moeser, University of Colorado &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Mathematical Analysis for Problems in Nonlinear Optics &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this project is to develop and implement &lt;br/&gt;analytical techniques for the study of problems arising in nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;optics. The array of applications ranges from light pulse propagation in &lt;br/&gt;optical fibers and nonlinear waveguides to stabilization of &lt;br/&gt;spatio-temporal solitons, both for deterministic systems and systems &lt;br/&gt;with a stochastic component. Depending on the particular application, &lt;br/&gt;the relevant mathematical models are nonlinear partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations, integral equations, or discrete equations. &lt;br/&gt;The core mathematical issues are fundamental &lt;br/&gt;understanding of asymptotic theories, both analytically and &lt;br/&gt;numerically, well posedness or blow up for the modeling equations, and &lt;br/&gt;the search for solitary wave solutions via direct methods of calculus &lt;br/&gt;of variations. This project focuses on three major applications in &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear optics: systems with randomness, discrete systems, and &lt;br/&gt;generalized dispersion managed systems. Randomness arises &lt;br/&gt;ubiquitously in nonlinear optics and an important goal of this project &lt;br/&gt;is to study noise models that are physically relevant and analyzable &lt;br/&gt;in a rigorous probabilistic sense. Such models have already yielded &lt;br/&gt;new types of fundamental solitons and their study may help engineers &lt;br/&gt;to design optical devices whose performance is actually enhanced by &lt;br/&gt;small amounts of randomness. Discrete equations arise in many &lt;br/&gt;important contexts, including the study of nonlinear waveguides, &lt;br/&gt;all-optical switches, and Bose-Einstein condensates. Discrete models &lt;br/&gt;have very different properties than those of their continuous &lt;br/&gt;counterparts, and though regularity of solutions in the spatial &lt;br/&gt;variable is no longer an issue, the lack of scaling invariances in &lt;br/&gt;general makes their analysis more difficult. Thus discrete problems &lt;br/&gt;invite the development of new analytical tools which ultimately will &lt;br/&gt;help explain experimental observations. Finally, the P.I. will study &lt;br/&gt;generalized dispersion managed systems. The technique of dispersion &lt;br/&gt;management has been instrumental in enabling higher bit rate &lt;br/&gt;communications and has provided the impetus for many interesting &lt;br/&gt;mathematical investigations. The approximate models that arise have a &lt;br/&gt;nonlocal nonlinearity which presents interesting mathematical and &lt;br/&gt;numerical challenges. Often the nonlocality in the modeling equation &lt;br/&gt;reflects a stabilizing effect in the original physical system, and an &lt;br/&gt;important recurring question is how to exploit the nonlocal structure &lt;br/&gt;in order to help explain the observed stabilization. The P.I. will &lt;br/&gt;examine the application of dispersion management technology in &lt;br/&gt;contexts other than fiber optic communications, such as the search for &lt;br/&gt;spatio-temporal solitons, where the P.I. expects to obtain new &lt;br/&gt;information on it's possible stabilizing effects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental mathematical understanding of nonlinear optical &lt;br/&gt;systems is central to the development of technologies that will be able to &lt;br/&gt;support the ever increasing demands of future Internet expansion. Fast, &lt;br/&gt;stable data transmission is critically important to a wide array of &lt;br/&gt;sectors of national interest, ranging from banking, the stock exchange, &lt;br/&gt;and insurance to health services, transportation, and homeland security. &lt;br/&gt;The information gleaned through the proposed research will aid in the &lt;br/&gt;design and implementation of novel optical systems that will help meet the &lt;br/&gt;growing need for bandwidth.</AbstractNarration>
