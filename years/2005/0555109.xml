<AbstractNarration>Prejudice and stereotyping are dynamic processes that shift over time as a function of individuals' experiences with stigmatized groups.  Changes in prejudice and stereotyping can be caused by numerous factors; for example, positive intergroup contact and new information about the personal characteristics of stigmatized group members can reduce prejudice and stereotyping, whereas perceptions that another group threatens the well-being of one's own group can increase those biases.  However, very little research has examined the course of prejudice and stereotyping over time or the interactive effects between the different factors that influence intergroup bias.  The relocation of African American victims of Hurricane Katrina into predominantly European American communities provides a unique opportunity to examine dynamic processes in prejudice and stereotyping as a function of different mechanisms.  Residents of relocation communities will undergo substantial increases in contact with and knowledge about African Americans, as well as have the responsibility for providing the evacuees with resources (e.g., shelter, education, social services), which could lead to perceptions of threat.  In the current research, prejudice against and stereotyping of African Americans among residents of relocation communities will be assessed at three points in time to examine temporal changes.  In addition, we will investigate how perceived threat, intergroup contact, and personal information independently and interactively contribute to changes in intergroup bias.  This research is significant because its findings will expand theoretical models of prejudice and stereotyping as dynamic processes that both reflect and predict experiences with stigmatized groups.  These findings will also inform interventions that can reduce intergroup hostility, and may be particularly useful for developing plans to relocate disaster victims while minimizing racial tensions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
