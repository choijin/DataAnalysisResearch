<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;It is the intent of this project to focus efforts, during the 2005-06 academic year and 2006&lt;br/&gt;summer, on enhancing the mentoring capabilities of faculty members at Elizabeth City&lt;br/&gt;State University with regards to their ability to motivate and train minority students&lt;br/&gt;within The Mathematics and Computer Science Department and The Geological,&lt;br/&gt;Environmental and Marine Science Department.&lt;br/&gt;In support of the NSF Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM) program, this proposed project will increase the&lt;br/&gt;number of faculty at ECSU, who are well trained, in mentoring underrepresented groups&lt;br/&gt;in mathematics, computer science, marine and environmental science. The supplemental&lt;br/&gt;funds will support expansion of faculty mentoring efforts of minority majors within the&lt;br/&gt;targeted departments. The project will also provide faculty with training based on best&lt;br/&gt;practices of the NSF PAESMEM program.&lt;br/&gt;Faculty members will be expected to work during the academic year or summer with a&lt;br/&gt;team of undergraduate STEM majors. During the academic year, structured meeting will&lt;br/&gt;be held between faculty and students on Tuesday and Thursday evenings from mid&lt;br/&gt;September through early April and for 8 weeks during the summer of 2006. The&lt;br/&gt;emphasis will be on promoting the professional development of students while teaching&lt;br/&gt;them the fundamentals of research within their major fields. The faculty emphasis will&lt;br/&gt;be on promoting the ability of the faculty in interacting with students, providing&lt;br/&gt;supportive environment for students, and conveying the techniques of research in their&lt;br/&gt;respective fields. This will enhance faculty ability to provide the out of classroom&lt;br/&gt;experience that the students will need to be accepted into and successfully complete&lt;br/&gt;graduate school. During the summer program faculty will work on an intense 8 week&lt;br/&gt;project with a team of students. The proposed project will impact a total of 6 STEM&lt;br/&gt;faculty and 10 STEM students.</AbstractNarration>
