<AbstractNarration>0547330&lt;br/&gt;Luo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goals of this research focus on Nucleic Acid Engineering -- integrating&lt;br/&gt;DNA into biomaterial research, not by just mimicking biomolecules, but by actually using&lt;br/&gt;biomolecules themselves, DNA in this case, to construct new materials and nanodevices.&lt;br/&gt;Departing from the conventional concept of DNA being just a genetic material, it is proposed here to deliberately ignore DNA's various genetic roles and instead to use DNA as a generic building block for the construction of novel DNA-based biomaterials whose architectures can be controlled at the nanoscale, and whose properties can be further tailored towards specific biomedical and biotechnological applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Project Outcomes Report</p> <p>Supported partially by the NSF Career Award, we have transformed DNA from a genetic material to a bulk-scale, generic material. More specifically, we have created tree-shape DNA, DNA nanobarcodes, DNA gels, and DNA-organized nanoparticles. Noticeably many of these DNA-based materials were created under efficient catalysts such as enzymes. Light was also employed to engineer DNA. Real world applications have been explored including biosensing, drug delivery, artificial cell culture, cell-free protein production, and electric and plasmonic nanodevices. In particular, we have created DNA nanobarcodes where multiple pathogens can be detected simultaneously through a variety of detection methods (optical, electrical, etc.). A point-of-care device is also being developed that can be employed to detect pathogens on a site (or in a field). In addition, we have created, for the first time, DNA-based hydrogels that can be used to deliver drugs, cells, and vaccines; they can also be employed to produce functional proteins and enzymes without involving any live cell. This cell-free system is a platform technology enabling protein productions beyond physiological conditions and outside of biological confinement. Moreover, we have designed DNA molecules to be an organizer and created ordered gold nanoparticles in 1D (nanowire), 2D (superlatice, and freestanding film) and 3D (crystals).
