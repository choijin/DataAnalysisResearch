<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, there have been many deep connections found between&lt;br/&gt;homotopy theory and commutative algebra. This research continues this&lt;br/&gt;pursuit in several such directions. First, the study of topological spaces&lt;br/&gt;or structured spectra through algebraic invariants, such as homotopy or&lt;br/&gt;(co-)homology, can be studied from the global perspective on the&lt;br/&gt;algebraic side via a moduli space of structures. A fine invariant for&lt;br/&gt;studying such a moduli space is the cotangent complex associated to the&lt;br/&gt;given algebra. One part of this research, in joint work with Paul Goerss,&lt;br/&gt;will look to extend the study of Hopkins-Miller-Mahowald-Goerss on&lt;br/&gt;topological modular forms from, which realized Lubin-Tate algebras as&lt;br/&gt;E_\infinity ring spectra and calculated their endomorphisms, to more&lt;br/&gt;general Shimura varieties. In a similar vein, this research will&lt;br/&gt;seek to clarify, in joint work with David Blanc and Mark Johnson, how a&lt;br/&gt;variation of this cotangent complex controls the question of &lt;br/&gt;realizing a diagram of&lt;br/&gt;\Pi-algebras as a diagram of spaces, by looking for ways of connecting&lt;br/&gt;cohomological obstructions to things like Toda brackets.  Finally, this&lt;br/&gt;research will seek to extend Grothendieck's program for classifying smooth&lt;br/&gt;schemes to more general schemes in the setting of derived algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;The driving mechanism will be to take the cotangent complex to be the proper&lt;br/&gt;analogue of the Kahler differentials and generalize accordingly. This would&lt;br/&gt;frame the approach of characterizing commutative algebras using the&lt;br/&gt;simplicial resolutions (as ultimately articulated by M. Andre and D. &lt;br/&gt;Quillen) in&lt;br/&gt;an algebraic geometric setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the history of string theory in theoretical physics, &lt;br/&gt;surprising connections&lt;br/&gt;have been made between several areas of pure mathematics - in &lt;br/&gt;particular, number&lt;br/&gt;theory and topology. One such connection has been made between the &lt;br/&gt;arithmetic of&lt;br/&gt;elliptic curves and modular forms, important in A. Wiles resolution &lt;br/&gt;of Fermat's Last&lt;br/&gt;Theorem, and cohomology theories in topology - the connection&lt;br/&gt;being relevant to string theory via the concept of elliptic genera. &lt;br/&gt; From the topologist's&lt;br/&gt;standpoint, some of the relevant properties being sought can be &lt;br/&gt;expressed in terms of&lt;br/&gt;whether the cohomology's associated spectrum possesses a suitable &lt;br/&gt;multiplicative structure.&lt;br/&gt;The question of realizing such structures can lead to questions &lt;br/&gt;regarding ways in which&lt;br/&gt;commutative algebras and homotopical structures in topology interact. &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this&lt;br/&gt;research is to further understand such interactions in two ways. The &lt;br/&gt;first is to collectively&lt;br/&gt;study all possible multiplicative structures on a spectrum with a &lt;br/&gt;prescribed algebraic data&lt;br/&gt;via the concept of a moduli space. The other approach utilizes a &lt;br/&gt;global geometric device,&lt;br/&gt;called a stack, to understand these multiplicative spectra &lt;br/&gt;collectively in the context of a&lt;br/&gt;more homotopical notion of algebraic geometry. The aim of this &lt;br/&gt;research will then focus&lt;br/&gt;on studying other possible multiplicative spectra associated to &lt;br/&gt;cohomology theories which arise&lt;br/&gt;from more general arithmetic forms, such as automorphic forms. &lt;br/&gt;Involved in this project&lt;br/&gt;is also the aim to characterize basic types of objects in this &lt;br/&gt;homotopical algebraic geometry&lt;br/&gt;and drawing connections to recent homological characterizations of algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
