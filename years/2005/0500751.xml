<AbstractNarration>The project addresses questions in the representation theory&lt;br/&gt;of affine Lie algebras and their quantum analogs.  The&lt;br/&gt;problems to be studied are motivated by  applications to&lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics  and  combinatorics.  One of the goals of&lt;br/&gt;the project is to make a rigorous connection between&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial results on crystals and the corresponding&lt;br/&gt;results on representations of the affine Lie algebra.    This&lt;br/&gt;involves studying the category of finite dimensional&lt;br/&gt;representations of the affine algebra, the closely related&lt;br/&gt;current algebra and the quantum analogs of these algebras for&lt;br/&gt;generic values of the quantum parameter. This category of&lt;br/&gt;representations is not semisimple and exhibits features&lt;br/&gt;similar to modular representation theory.  This  is an&lt;br/&gt;important motivation for the study of Weyl modules and of&lt;br/&gt;extensions between irreducible representations of these&lt;br/&gt;algebras   undertaken by the project.  The study of Weyl&lt;br/&gt;modules and the conjecture on their dimension made by Chari&lt;br/&gt;and Pressley is related to the conjectures of Feigin and Loktev&lt;br/&gt;on the fusion product of finite dimensional irreducible&lt;br/&gt;representations of a simple Lie algebra   coming from their&lt;br/&gt;study on conformal field theory . It is expected that the&lt;br/&gt;results on the Weyl modules and their quotients  the&lt;br/&gt;Kirrillov/Reshetikhin modules will provide further insight&lt;br/&gt;into and also lead to generalizations of the conjectures and&lt;br/&gt;constructions of Feigin and Loktev. An important open problem&lt;br/&gt; is to determine a character formula for the irreducible&lt;br/&gt;finite dimensional representations &lt;br/&gt; of the quantum affine algebras analogous to the Weyl&lt;br/&gt;character formula. A first step is to  study this problem for&lt;br/&gt;the Kirrillov/Reshetikhin modules and the project pursues this by&lt;br/&gt;seeing if a conjecture of Dorey made  in his study of affine&lt;br/&gt;Toda field theories is correct for these modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The representation theory of affine Lie algebras and the&lt;br/&gt;quantum algebras is an area where there  is intense research&lt;br/&gt;activity. It  has had significant impact on other branches of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics such as number theory, knot theory, combinatorics&lt;br/&gt;to name a few. It has had fruitful interaction with&lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics, in affine Toda field theories, and in&lt;br/&gt;solvable models in statistical mechanics where the tensor&lt;br/&gt;product of representations of affine algebras conjecturally&lt;br/&gt;describes the interactions or fusing of particles. The PI's&lt;br/&gt;study should confirm some of these theories and also have&lt;br/&gt;applications in the representation theory of affine Lie&lt;br/&gt;algebras of positive level and vertex algebra constructions of&lt;br/&gt;such representations.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
