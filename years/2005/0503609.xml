<AbstractNarration>Track 2:  Mentoring Through Research as a Catalyst for&lt;br/&gt;Success in the Geosciences (Phase 2)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project enlarges the scope of an earlier "Catalyst Program" at the Department of Geological Sciences at California State University, Northridge (CSUN), a project that combined research with peer mentoring. Cultural and financial barriers faced by students at CSUN are being removed during this project through the use of research teams as a means of building research skills and providing peer mentorship. The design of the program includes the following key elements: 1) building a critical mass of minority students that are involved with the project at various educational levels, i.e., high school, undergraduate, and graduate; 2) involving undergraduate and graduate geoscience students participate in research projects that are meritorious and scientifically sound; 3) increasing students' self-esteem by helping them achieve success in research; 4) connecting students with peer, near-peer and advisor mentors; 5) building a sense of community using research teams; 6) involving students throughout multiple years; 7) providing for geoscience teaching opportunities (teaching assistantships and development of research/mentoring class); and 8) increasing the educational and research capabilities of the Geological Sciences Department at CSUN. In this Phase 2 project, a new petrology/geochemistry research project, integration with the American Geological Institute's EARTHCOMM curriculum in the local high schools will occur, and a new summer geoscience program for science-math oriented students participating in the CSUN LSAMP program are added to the components of the original Phase 1 project. In addition, the outreach program for local high-school students and their earth-science teachers is expanded, and based on the results of evaluation of the Phase 1 project, increased monitoring of undergraduate academic performance and enhancement of the 'Catalyst Course' will take place during Phase 2. The project engages students in activities meant to enrich their overall educational experience, to promote peer and near-peer mentoring, and to keep students in the 'geosciences pipeline'.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
