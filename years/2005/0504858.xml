<AbstractNarration>Abstract: DMS-0504858, A Kim, University of California - Merced&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Mathematical investigation of light propagation in tissues for physiological monitoring and tissue imaging  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We study light propagation in tissues for biomedical &lt;br/&gt;applications. In particular, we study three problems: &lt;br/&gt;i) inverse problems for physiological monitoring, ii) &lt;br/&gt;fluorescence imaging, and iii) direct and inverse &lt;br/&gt;obstacle scattering in tissues. For the physiological &lt;br/&gt;monitoring problem, one seeks to detect changes in &lt;br/&gt;tissue structure and composition, especially in &lt;br/&gt;superficial tissue layers of organs where most &lt;br/&gt;pre-cancers form. For the fluorescence imaging problem, &lt;br/&gt;tumor-seeking fluorescent molecules are introduced into &lt;br/&gt;deep tissues and are excited by a laser. By detecting &lt;br/&gt;the emitted fluorescent light, one wishes to determine &lt;br/&gt;the support, and fluorescent efficiency and lifetime. &lt;br/&gt;For the direct obstacle scattering problem, one seeks &lt;br/&gt;the light scattered by an obstacle (e.g. a tumor) &lt;br/&gt;inside tissue due to a light source. For the inverse &lt;br/&gt;obstacle problem, one seeks to determine distinguishing &lt;br/&gt;characteristics (e.g. support, strength, etc) about the &lt;br/&gt;obstacle from scattered light measurements. The key &lt;br/&gt;challenge in all of these problems is to understand the &lt;br/&gt;complicated light-tissue interactions because tissues &lt;br/&gt;multiply scatter light strongly. This proposed research &lt;br/&gt;aims to develop more accurate theory to predict and &lt;br/&gt;interpret diagnostic data. In particular, this research &lt;br/&gt;begins with the theory of radiative transport for light &lt;br/&gt;propagation in tissues. Computational methods for &lt;br/&gt;boundary value problems of the radiative transport &lt;br/&gt;equation will be developed to solve the direct and &lt;br/&gt;inverse problems proposed here. We pay special &lt;br/&gt;attention to computing quantitative resolution &lt;br/&gt;estimates for these three problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the significant advances in biology and &lt;br/&gt;medicine correlate directly with technological advances &lt;br/&gt;in biomedical imaging systems. In particular, &lt;br/&gt;laser-based imaging systems offer great potential for &lt;br/&gt;safe, portable and economical monitoring and imaging of &lt;br/&gt;tissue function and health. This research project &lt;br/&gt;involves the theoretical and computational study of &lt;br/&gt;laser-based imaging of biological tissues. In &lt;br/&gt;particular, we seek mathematical results that impact &lt;br/&gt;directly applications in physiological monitoring, &lt;br/&gt;fluorescence imaging and direct and inverse obstacle &lt;br/&gt;scattering. The interaction of laser light with &lt;br/&gt;biological tissues is complicated to model because &lt;br/&gt;tissues scatter light very strongly. Hence, the &lt;br/&gt;overarching goal of this research project is to gain a &lt;br/&gt;better understanding of multiple scattering of light in &lt;br/&gt;tissues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
