<AbstractNarration>The PI and his associates will carry out research to explore the development &lt;br/&gt;of superhard materials, i.e., materials that have a degree of hardness &lt;br/&gt;comparable to or larger than that of diamond. The search for such materials is &lt;br/&gt;driven by both their importance in a wide range of applications and by the &lt;br/&gt;challenge to design and synthesize them. Superhardness has recently been &lt;br/&gt;achieved in a number of nanostructured composites prepared by means of thin-&lt;br/&gt;film technology methods. While significant research is being conducted &lt;br/&gt;worldwide on the synthesis and characterization of superhard materials, &lt;br/&gt;further developments (such as optimization, modification, and manipulation) &lt;br/&gt;are hampered by the lack of understanding of the atomic-scale mechanisms. The &lt;br/&gt;proposed research will combine experimental synthesis and characterization &lt;br/&gt;with quantum theory and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the &lt;br/&gt;mechanical, structural, and electronic properties of a series of &lt;br/&gt;nanostructured composite films which are made up of nano-sized crystallites of &lt;br/&gt;a titanium nitride or tungsten nitride embedded in an amorphous silicon &lt;br/&gt;nitride or boron nitride matrix. The main objectives of the project are to &lt;br/&gt;investigate the relationships between the processing conditions, residual &lt;br/&gt;stress, hardness, microstructure and composition of these materials, and to &lt;br/&gt;elucidate the mechanisms underlying superhardness at the atomic scale. The &lt;br/&gt;role of the composite structure (type of interfaces, size and volume fraction &lt;br/&gt;of nano-particles, etc.) in inhibiting dislocation activity will be elucidated &lt;br/&gt;and guidelines will be extracted for the optimum design of superhard &lt;br/&gt;nanostructured materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful fabrication of nanostructured superhard materials would have &lt;br/&gt;significant impact on industry because they would be less expensive than &lt;br/&gt;diamond. The new materials would be used as anti-corrosion and wear protective &lt;br/&gt;coatings, cutting tools, load-bearing components, and micro-mechanical and &lt;br/&gt;microelectronic devices. In particular, significant socio-economic benefits &lt;br/&gt;would be achieved by the applications of the superhard nanocomposite materials &lt;br/&gt;on high-speed cutting and forming tools for 'green' machining operations &lt;br/&gt;without the aid of toxic coolants, which offers a clean work environment for &lt;br/&gt;machining processes with reduced wastes. This project will also develop an &lt;br/&gt;international collaboration involving both theorists and experimentalists in &lt;br/&gt;the U.S. and Hong Kong. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be &lt;br/&gt;involved in the research. K-12 teachers will participate in the project &lt;br/&gt;through Vanderbilt's summer Research Experience for Teachers programs. New &lt;br/&gt;knowledge will be translated into modules and lessons that can be used in K-12 &lt;br/&gt;classrooms. Thus, the project will contribute to education at various levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
