<AbstractNarration>Tees&lt;br/&gt;0547165&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During inflammation and sepsis, white blood cells can get trapped in capillaries, especially in the lung. Based on the physics of the capillary environment, it is hypothesized that cell arrest in capillaries can involve both mechanical and biochemical adhesive forces. To test this hypothesis, an adhesion assay has been devised in which cells are aspirated into capillary-sized micropipettes coated with endothelial cell adhesion molecules (ECAMs). The project will: 1) verify by both experiment and simulation that much lower surface densities of ECAMs are needed to mediate firm adhesion in capillaries than are required in larger vessels; 2) test the hypothesis that changes in contact area and mechanical properties for cells aspirated into micropipettes can enhance adhesion in the capillary environment; 3) validate theoretical predictions for the mechanical arrest position of cells in tapering vessels. The work has implications for treatment of sepsis and also for prevention of cancer metastasis, since many cancer cell types also get trapped in the lung. Techniques and concepts at the interface between the physical and biological sciences are increasingly required for research in industry and academia. A laboratory course in biophysics will be developed to fill this need and to create an online database of educational resources. Both the research and educational work will involve the training of physics and engineering students in techniques and concepts at the interface between the physical and biological sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
