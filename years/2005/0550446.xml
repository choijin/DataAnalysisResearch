<AbstractNarration>This research involves the  conduct of a public opinion study of the Nicaraguan&lt;br/&gt;national elections to be held in November of 2006. It builds on the authors' previously&lt;br/&gt;published analysis of national presidential elections and regime transition in Nicaragua&lt;br/&gt;from 1990 through 2001. That study, Learning Democracy: Citizen Engagement and Electoral Choice in Nicaragua 1990-2001 (University of Chicago Press, 2005), was supported in part by NSF funding.&lt;br/&gt;The previous study examined the capacity of the poor and poorly educated Nicaraguan&lt;br/&gt;electorate to engage in reasoned vote choice amidst severe systemic crisis that threatened&lt;br/&gt;their everyday lives. In doing so, it looked extensively at citizen attitudes and evolving&lt;br/&gt;vote intent during the 1990 presidential election in which the two major candidates&lt;br/&gt;proposed different regime directions to resolve the systemic crisis, which included civil&lt;br/&gt;war, economic embargo and economic deterioration. The study then analyzed the processes&lt;br/&gt;through which the new conservative democratic regime addressed the crisis and the voting&lt;br/&gt;behavior through which citizens reaffirmed its hold on power in the 1996 and 2001&lt;br/&gt;elections. Across the three elections, the study documented the sophisticated reasoning&lt;br/&gt;capacities -- both retrospective and prospective -- that Nicaraguans brought to their vote&lt;br/&gt;decisions. These findings suggest that such citizens may be more capable of democratic&lt;br/&gt;citizenship than dominant public opinion studies suggest, even when faced with system&lt;br/&gt;crisis.&lt;br/&gt;The current study returns to Nicaragua in 2006 to examine citizens'&lt;br/&gt;decision-making capacities as the nation faces new crises -- issues of constitutional&lt;br/&gt;authority, power usurpation, party system upheaval and electoral manipulation -- that&lt;br/&gt;could derail democratic consolidation. At issue is the ability of the voting citizenry to&lt;br/&gt;comprehend and respond to institutional/procedural crises that are relatively removed from&lt;br/&gt;their everyday lives but can nevertheless have disastrous consequences for them and the&lt;br/&gt;democratic structure of their nation. The study thus speaks directly to the roles that&lt;br/&gt;third-world voters can play in struggles for democratic consolidation as their nations&lt;br/&gt;move beyond the initial transition to electoral democracy and confront the 'dark and&lt;br/&gt;hidden side' of democracy, including parliamentary intrigue, complicated struggles over&lt;br/&gt;constitutional power, and electoral and party rules that can inhibit rather than foster&lt;br/&gt;responsive democratic choice.&lt;br/&gt;The investigation examines citizen attitudes and vote decision&lt;br/&gt;making across the six months prior to the November elections and during the weeks&lt;br/&gt;following them. Surveys are national in scope.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal's intellectual merit lies in addressing a core puzzle in survey research that&lt;br/&gt;has received scarce attention: the capacity of poorly educated third world citizens to&lt;br/&gt;reason in their vote decisions in systematic ways analogous to voters in established&lt;br/&gt;democracies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include (1) clarifying for national policy makers the&lt;br/&gt;expectations they can hold of third world citizens as they craft policies in support of&lt;br/&gt;democratization;(2)fostering reassessment of views that stress the limited decision&lt;br/&gt;capacity of poorly educated citizens in an established democracy, including among ethnic and racial minorities; and (3) spurring rigorous public opinion research by other scholars and advanced doctoral students into vote decision making by third world citizens and poor&lt;br/&gt;citizens internationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
