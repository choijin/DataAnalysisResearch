<AbstractNarration>0510750&lt;br/&gt;Harvey&lt;br/&gt;A-1&lt;br/&gt;We are now in a position to solve the puzzle of why dissolved arsenic concentrations are&lt;br/&gt;dangerously high in the groundwater of the Ganges Delta. Over the last five years several research&lt;br/&gt;groups have provided detailed characterizations of the static geochemical characteristics of groundwater&lt;br/&gt;and sediments in arsenic-contaminated aquifers. The challenge now is to determine how groundwater&lt;br/&gt;flow transports chemicals in and out of the subsurface, and hence controls subsurface&lt;br/&gt;biogeochemistry. We propose to develop novel hydrologic methods to characterize the complex spatial&lt;br/&gt;and temporal patterns of groundwater flow, and then to employ hydrogeologic models to study the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of groundwater geochemistry. By combining dynamic hydrological models with geochemical&lt;br/&gt;characterization we intend to answer key scientific questions that have thus far eluded us:&lt;br/&gt;Why has arsenic not been flushed from some aquifers? Combined estimates of groundwater&lt;br/&gt;residence times and arsenic retardation factors indicate that arsenic residence times are only decades to&lt;br/&gt;centuries, implying that arsenic should be flushed from the aquifers that are thousands of years old. Is&lt;br/&gt;dissolved arsenic supplied by a continuous source, or are high concentrations transient?&lt;br/&gt;Will arsenic concentrations change in the future? Our field injection-withdrawal experiments show that&lt;br/&gt;arsenic concentrations respond within days to biochemical perturbations. The adoption of dry-season&lt;br/&gt;rice cultivation has dramatically altered geochemical input and outputs from aquifers. How does this&lt;br/&gt;change affect subsurface geochemistry and dissolved arsenic concentrations?&lt;br/&gt;Why do arsenic concentrations differ between neighboring wells? Arsenic concentrations at nearby&lt;br/&gt;locations in grey-colored anoxic aquifers often differ greatly, despite similar sediment characteristics. Do&lt;br/&gt;these dramatic gradients result from the pattern of groundwater flow and recharge?&lt;br/&gt;What are the intellectual merits of the proposed activity?&lt;br/&gt;These questions can only be resolved by determining how groundwater dynamics control&lt;br/&gt;chemical input and output to aquifers over two timescales: (1) Seasonal cycle: The hydrology of Bangladesh&lt;br/&gt;annually cycles between Monsoon flooding and dry-season arid conditions when evapotranspiration&lt;br/&gt;greatly outstrips precipitation and irrigation water is pumped from aquifers to meet the transpiration&lt;br/&gt;demands of crops. This cycle drives water table oscillations that create seasonally varying oxic/anoxic&lt;br/&gt;conditions in soils and also drives water exchange between aquifers and surface water (rice paddies,&lt;br/&gt;ponds and rivers). (2) Anthropogenic changes over decades: The Ganges Delta has been&lt;br/&gt;dramatically altered over the last three decades by population growth and the advent of irrigated&lt;br/&gt;agriculture. Groundwater irrigation has changed the location, timing and chemical content of recharge.&lt;br/&gt;Anoxic irrigation water is ponded in rice fields over much of the land, thereby changing both the&lt;br/&gt;hydrologic budget and the biogeochemistry of recharge, potentially mobilizing arsenic from soil layers that&lt;br/&gt;may be rich in arsenic and iron (oxy)hydroxides. Furthermore, pumping changes flow-paths deep in&lt;br/&gt;aquifers, affecting both the rates and locations of recharge as well as groundwater exchange with surface&lt;br/&gt;water bodies that now receive much higher loads of untreated waste.&lt;br/&gt;We propose to: (1) Build on our successful field program in Bangladesh by extending our field&lt;br/&gt;characterization from vertical geochemical profiles at one location to three dimensional flow around this&lt;br/&gt;location; (2) Characterize recharge and discharge and map transient flow-paths through the aquifer by&lt;br/&gt;applying novel combination of natural isotope data and numerical inverse methods for groundwater flow;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Conduct a detailed study of geochemical fluxes through the bottom of a rice field, now a principle&lt;br/&gt;source of groundwater recharge at our site, and a very likely source of dissolved arsenic; (4) Construct&lt;br/&gt;predictive numerical models that couple groundwater flow and recharge with the biogeochemical&lt;br/&gt;transformations that control arsenic.&lt;br/&gt;What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project is built on our successful and productive partnership over the last five&lt;br/&gt;years. We will continue to place a significant emphasis on the education and transfer of technology, with&lt;br/&gt;further exchange of students between BUET, MIT and Tufts. We also will continue to collaborate with&lt;br/&gt;other research groups including Stanford, EAWAG in Switzerland, UBC in Vancouver and UCLA. Our&lt;br/&gt;research findings should answer some key scientific questions and also help evaluate alternative arsenic&lt;br/&gt;mitigation strategies and better manage water resources in Bangladesh.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
