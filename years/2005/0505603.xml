<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0505603&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Michael Wolf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These projects concentrate on problems concerning complete&lt;br/&gt;minimal surfaces in Euclidean three-space, harmonic maps onto the&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic plane, and projective structures on Riemann surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator, working with D. Hoffman and M. Weber,&lt;br/&gt;hopes to prove the existence of embedded helicoids of arbitrary&lt;br/&gt;genus, following up on their existence result in genus one but&lt;br/&gt;pursuing a different approach that is already known to simplify&lt;br/&gt;the genus-one argument.  A basic uniqueness question on minimal&lt;br/&gt;surfaces is also going to be studied: In how many ways can one&lt;br/&gt;desingularize the intersection of two planes?  The principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator has studied harmonic maps onto the hyperbolic plane&lt;br/&gt;for several years, leading to a natural conjecture on extensions&lt;br/&gt;of quasi-symmetries of the circle to the hyperbolic disk.  The&lt;br/&gt;planned work on projective structures on Riemann surfaces will be&lt;br/&gt;pursued jointly with a postdoctoral fellow, David Dumas, and aims&lt;br/&gt;to develop fine asymptotics for such structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A minimal surface is the mathematical idealization of a soap&lt;br/&gt;bubble spanning a wire.  A stable soap bubble ordinarily assumes&lt;br/&gt;the least area of all possible surfaces spanning that wire, and&lt;br/&gt;the mathematical statement of the fact that varying the surface&lt;br/&gt;must increase its area translates into a partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equation.  Versions of these problems have been studied intensely&lt;br/&gt;since the 19th century and before, for both physical and&lt;br/&gt;geometric reasons.  The helicoid referred to above is a surface&lt;br/&gt;shaped like a corkscrew or parking ramp, and the genus-one&lt;br/&gt;version of the helicoid could be described as a parking ramp with&lt;br/&gt;an airshaft -- some interesting and appealing pictures of these&lt;br/&gt;and other minimal surfaces are available on M. Weber's Web pages,&lt;br/&gt;http://www.indiana/edu/~minimal.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
