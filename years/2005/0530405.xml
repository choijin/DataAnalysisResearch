<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;A workshop to examine the paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental framework of human&lt;br/&gt;evolution is being planned for fall 2005. Co-convenors are Gail Ashley, Anna K.&lt;br/&gt;Behrensmeyer, Andrew Cohen, Craig Feibel, Richard Potts, and Jay Quade. We believe&lt;br/&gt;the time is ripe to bring anthropologists, archaeologists, geologists and climatologists,&lt;br/&gt;currently involved in the human evolution debate, together with the continental scientific&lt;br/&gt;drilling community. We propose to hold a workshop with a) paleoanthropologists,&lt;br/&gt;archaeologists and paleontologists, b) geologists who have worked closely with the&lt;br/&gt;paleoanthropological community, and c) paleoclimatologists involved in collecting and&lt;br/&gt;interpreting sediment records. This workshop will integrate the record of hominin&lt;br/&gt;evolution and their ecological communities, local and regional climate change history&lt;br/&gt;and paleoenvironmental records from outcrop and deep drilling, We would focus this&lt;br/&gt;workshop primarily on the African record, where the longest and most continuous&lt;br/&gt;records of human evolution is found.&lt;br/&gt;The hominin fossil record reaches back in time to &gt;6 million years ago and stone tools&lt;br/&gt;&gt;2.6 million years, but the details of paleoenvironmental framework particularly on the&lt;br/&gt;continents are not well known. Traditional geological studies of hominin-bearing&lt;br/&gt;deposits have focused on correlation and chronology of sites, with usually only local sitebased&lt;br/&gt;descriptions accompanying each find. There have been few attempts to&lt;br/&gt;synthesize within regions or to place key sites within a broader temporal and spatial&lt;br/&gt;context. With the growing realization and understanding of astronomic climate forcing&lt;br/&gt;during the Plio-Pleistocene, there is an opportunity to integrate what is known about the&lt;br/&gt;paleoclimate and paleoenvironment from the continental geologic record and the&lt;br/&gt;evolutionary history from archaeological and paleoanthropological records.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Up to six advanced graduate students whose research involves an aspect of the&lt;br/&gt;Workshop topic will be active participants in the discussions. The experience they gain&lt;br/&gt;as members of different disciplines with different vocabularies, as well as seeing the&lt;br/&gt;variety of approaches to, and perhaps different interpretations of, the same data set will&lt;br/&gt;guide them in developing a consensual working hypothesis.&lt;br/&gt;The results from this workshop will be widely disseminated electronically hoping to reach&lt;br/&gt;a broad audience. The importance of the interdisciplinary approach and specifically&lt;br/&gt;utilizing "geoscience" in paleoanthropological research was highlighted by WoldeGabriel&lt;br/&gt;et al., in the July 2004 issue of EOS, a publication not normally read by&lt;br/&gt;paleoanthropologists. The article describes the need of groups that have not&lt;br/&gt;traditionally worked together to collaborate on problems that neither group are likely to&lt;br/&gt;solve on their own.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to bring together researchers with a variety of perspectives on the role that&lt;br/&gt;climate and climate change might have played in human evolution. Topics such as these&lt;br/&gt;are interdisciplinary and often fall through the 'cracks' between normal funding&lt;br/&gt;programs. They are also short-changed by scientific societies in terms of critical mass at&lt;br/&gt;conferences and by publishing outlets. Extra effort must be made to get groups together&lt;br/&gt;who would not normally attend the same scientific meeting. This Workshop will help&lt;br/&gt;address this need.</AbstractNarration>
