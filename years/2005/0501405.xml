<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to fundamentally understand the electric, dielectric and magnetic behaviors of novel polymer-based low-processing temperature ultrahigh-k and high-Q nanocomposites and to explore their applications in embedded passive components. The approach is to study and optimize the interfaces between carbon black and its polymer matrix to reduce the dielectric loss of ultrahigh-k (&gt;13,000) polymer/carbon black composites. The dielectric loss will be controlled by various methods such as carbon black surface modification/treatment, and chelating agent inclusion, and Coulomb blockade effects. Another approach is to synthesize and study the core-shell structured nanoparticles with various passivation natures, mimicking ultrahigh-k nancomposites filled with self-passivation aluminum particles. For high-Q embedded inductors, the approach is to synthesize and study nanophase ferromagnetic and soft ferromagnetic particles and investigate their composites as the core material for high-frequency applications.&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental understanding of the polymer-based low-processing temperature ultrahigh-k and high-Q nanocomposites from this prosposed research will be a key enabling technology for the application of low cost and high performance components for next-generation electronics. This technology can be readily transferred to industry. This will certainly speed up the pace of microelectronic industry, and retain numerous high tech jobs in the US. The broader impacts also resulting from the proposed research include recruiting and advising students at pre-college, undergraduate and graduate levels, especially those from the underrepresented groups in the research and education activities. The PI will continue his practice of providing resources to the greater Atlanta area with an emphasis on those underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
