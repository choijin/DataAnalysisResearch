<AbstractNarration>The overall scientific objective of this study is to understand how groundwater, supplied to rivers via inter-basin transfers (i.e., from outside the immediate watershed), affects how tropical streams function in the long term (&gt;25 yrs).  The project is based in lowland Costa Rica, where solute-rich groundwater account for over half of stream discharge in the dry season.  This groundwater is naturally-rich in nutrients such as phosphorus (P), with levels higher than those typically found below sewage treatment plants.  Prior research has shown that landscape patterns in stream chemistry (resulting from variation in solute-rich groundwater inputs) reflect rates of primary production and decomposition.  This project continues to build a long-term (1988-present) data set on stream solute chemistry, which is the only one for lowland primary rainforests of Central America.  The investigators are relating long-term trends in stream chemistry to large-scale climatic phenomena: solute-rich groundwater (also rich in bicarbonates) buffer receiving streams against increases in acidity during periods following El Nino-related droughts, while those streams that do not receive solute-rich groundwater experience dramatic increases in acidity. An outgrowth of the project is the development of an environmental outreach program that focuses on water quality and quantity issues in tropical regions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report:  LTREB: Emergent Landscape Patterns in Stream Ecosystem Processes Resulting from Groundwater/ Surface Water Interactions.  This project is showing us how temporal changes in precipitation associated with climate change are altering stream solute chemistry and changing ecosystem processes in a Neotropical watershed in lowland Costa Rica.  Moreover, we have found that interactions between regional ground- and surface- waters within the watershed mediate stream responses to these changes: streams that receive interbasin transfers of regional solute-rich groundwater appear to be well-buffered and resistant to resultant declines in pH, while poorly-buffered streams influenced by local groundwater are vulnerable.   While acidification in temperate freshwater systems has been extensively studied, our understanding of acidification in tropical streams has been constrained by the lack of long-term data sets.  Analysis of our long-term (25 yrs) data set on stream solute chemistry in Costa Rica (the only one that we are aware of for lowland primary rainforest of Central America) shows that stream pH in poorly-buffered streams naturally declines throughout the wet season and increases during the dry season.
