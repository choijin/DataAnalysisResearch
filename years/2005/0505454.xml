<AbstractNarration>The adequate numerical treatment of nonlinear phenomena governed by partial differential equations (PDE) with several disparate space-time scales is a formidable mathematical and computational challenge.  Modern algorithms should be able to resolve fine scales for certain physical quantities without overresolving others, thereby optimizing the computational effort and making realistic three-dimensional simulations feasible.  This proposal deals with fundamental mathematical questions for the design, testing, and analysis of adaptive finite element methods (AFEM) as well as their application to a variety of multiscale problems for which AFEM are among the most powerful computational techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project considers mathematical models in materials science (such as epitaxial and crystal growth), in biophysics (such as biomembranes), in fluid and solid mechanics (such as the Navier-Stokes equations), in image processing and in finance.  They are typical, yet quite distinct, examples of multiscale phenomena which exhibit singularities, fast transients, and topological changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal builds upon, and in fact extends and enhances, the prior NSF Grant DMS-0204670.  It is organized in a number of small and seemingly independent projects, which are however related through the interplay of nonlinearity, error estimation, numerical analysis and computation, the unifying themes of the proposal.  It is a collaborative endeavor involving a number of scientists in the US and abroad, as well as several graduate students and postdocs.  Resources are requested to support them partially.  A substantial effort is devoted to education and human resource development.</AbstractNarration>
