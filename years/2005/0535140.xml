<AbstractNarration>Technical description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this project is to automate the construction and  &lt;br/&gt;manipulation of very high-level, three-dimensional structural and  &lt;br/&gt;appearance representations of humans from un-instrumented monocular  &lt;br/&gt;video. This technology would enable a broad spectrum of applications  &lt;br/&gt;including video browsing and indexing (content-based access to  &lt;br/&gt;digital libraries), entertainment, virtual reality or human-computer  &lt;br/&gt;interaction. Our methodology involves an alliance between supervised  &lt;br/&gt;and unsupervised statistical modeling and learning methods, non- &lt;br/&gt;linear optimization and sampling techniques and computer vision. The  &lt;br/&gt;goal of these procedures is to automate the model construction  &lt;br/&gt;process. We aim for compact representations that have the optimal  &lt;br/&gt;level of complexity in order to ensure stable and reliable perceptual  &lt;br/&gt;inferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad project significance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this research is to derive artificial systems that are  &lt;br/&gt;able to recover accurate three-dimensional models of human structure  &lt;br/&gt;and appearance from video sequences filmed with a single camera (this  &lt;br/&gt;include movies, sports or cultural events like ballet, or home  &lt;br/&gt;recorded videos). Human are the prevailing subjects in the existing  &lt;br/&gt;video data, which typically records their motions, actions or  &lt;br/&gt;expressions, the fine or coarse details of their behavior, the way  &lt;br/&gt;they collaborate and communicate. Visualizing or analyzing scenes  &lt;br/&gt;with complex life events based on reconstructed human models is an  &lt;br/&gt;important problem for the advancement of a variety of technological  &lt;br/&gt;fields including digital libraries and archives, video coding,  &lt;br/&gt;entertainment, animation and virtual reality, as well as intelligent  &lt;br/&gt;human-computer interfaces, protection and security&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Human analysis in video is an open research problem facing important  &lt;br/&gt;scientific and computational challenges. The proportions of the human  &lt;br/&gt;body vary across individuals due to gender, weight, age or race.  &lt;br/&gt;Aside from this variability, any single human body has many degrees  &lt;br/&gt;of freedom due to articulation and the individual limbs are  &lt;br/&gt;deformable due to muscle and clothing. Finally many real-world scenes  &lt;br/&gt;involve multiple interacting humans occluded by each other or by  &lt;br/&gt;other objects. The scene conditions may also vary due to the camera  &lt;br/&gt;motion or lighting changes. These factors make accurate 3d human  &lt;br/&gt;models difficult to build and difficult to reconstruct reliably from  &lt;br/&gt;flat 2d images. In order to address these challenges, this research  &lt;br/&gt;will involve synergies between optimization algorithms, computer  &lt;br/&gt;vision and image processing technologies. A key component of our  &lt;br/&gt;approach is the use of large scale statistical learning methods in  &lt;br/&gt;order to automatically acquire compact models of humans directly from  &lt;br/&gt;videos filmed in the real world. In this respect, this research can  &lt;br/&gt;lead to fruitful connections with other computer science disciplines  &lt;br/&gt;like computer graphics or computer animation. These areas are known  &lt;br/&gt;for their highly realistic, but extraordinary complex to construct  &lt;br/&gt;models of the physical world, which often require intensive  &lt;br/&gt;laboratory design by skilled artists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;URL: http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~crismin/human_models_from_video.html&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
