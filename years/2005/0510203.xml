<AbstractNarration>The problem of computing a Fourier representation of data is a&lt;br/&gt;fundamental one, that arises in many areas of mathematics, science,&lt;br/&gt;and technology.  Recently, a class of algorithms has been proposed to&lt;br/&gt;approximate the Fourier transform, with provable quality guarantees,&lt;br/&gt;in dramatically less time than required by traditional exact&lt;br/&gt;algorithms.  The investigator and his colleagues evaluate competing&lt;br/&gt;variations of the algorithm, both proposed and new, and choose the&lt;br/&gt;best from among them for general purpose use as well as for specific&lt;br/&gt;application to Magnetic Resonence Imaging and solution of partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations, including advection-diffusion equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fourier Transform is a fundamental technique with many&lt;br/&gt;applications.  The investigator and his team investigate recent&lt;br/&gt;approximate methods that are dramatically more efficient than&lt;br/&gt;traditional methods.  The team directly addresses applications to&lt;br/&gt;biomedical Magnetic Resonance Imaging and the modeling of liquid and&lt;br/&gt;gas behavior, which has further applications to studying the&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere and bodies of water in the environment, as well as&lt;br/&gt;applications to manufacturing.  The investigator and his team also&lt;br/&gt;make available fundamental tools that will be useful to others in a&lt;br/&gt;broad range of scientific, educational, and engineering settings&lt;br/&gt;including modeling the interactions of tiny particles, reliable&lt;br/&gt;telecommunications, and imaging generally.  The project combines&lt;br/&gt;cutting-edge techniques from several disciplines and trains a graduate&lt;br/&gt;student in these techniques and their integration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
