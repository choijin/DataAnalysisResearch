    <AbstractNarration>Time series with long-range dependence have been recently the focus of&lt;br/&gt;much attention. They appear in a number of applications, for example,&lt;br/&gt;in the analysis of traffic in computer networks. In finite variance&lt;br/&gt;time series, long-range dependence is characterized by a covariance&lt;br/&gt;function which decreases slowly to 0 as the lag increases. The&lt;br/&gt;decrease is so slow that the corresponding spectral density blows up&lt;br/&gt;at very low frequencies, a phenomenon also known as ''long-range&lt;br/&gt;dependence'', ``long memory'' or ``1/f noise''. There are many&lt;br/&gt;empirical procedures which are graphical in nature but rigorous&lt;br/&gt;estimation procedures are few. The better ones use a semi-parametric&lt;br/&gt;approach because long-range dependence does not involve the short&lt;br/&gt;range dependence structure. The most successful methods have been&lt;br/&gt;Fourier-based. One approach involves a regression on the logarithm of&lt;br/&gt;the periodogram. Another is the local Whittle approach. It is a&lt;br/&gt;pseudo-likelihood approach which uses the periodogram at low&lt;br/&gt;frequencies only. The investigator proposes to use a pseudo-likelihood&lt;br/&gt;approach based not on the Fourier spectrum but on wavelets. The&lt;br/&gt;advantage of wavelets on Fourier is that there is no need to&lt;br/&gt;difference the time series if these are not stationary and, in&lt;br/&gt;general, they are much more robust against departure from&lt;br/&gt;stationarity. Since wavelets are associated with scaling it is,&lt;br/&gt;moreover, natural to attempt to use wavelets in order to estimate the&lt;br/&gt;intensity of long-range dependence. Wavelets have been successfully&lt;br/&gt;used as an alternative to the regression on the logarithm of the&lt;br/&gt;periodogram but wavelets have not been&lt;br/&gt;used as an alternative to the Fourier-based local Whittle approach.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator proposes to do so. This would provide a robust&lt;br/&gt;semi-parametic pseudo-likelihood based method to estimate the&lt;br/&gt;intensity of long-range dependence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject of time series analysis has sparked considerable research&lt;br/&gt;activity over the past several decades. Essentially concerned with&lt;br/&gt;measurements over time of various kinds of phenomena --- from yearly&lt;br/&gt;income, exchange rates, to the level of a river --- the goal is to&lt;br/&gt;develop suitable models and obtain accurate predictions for such&lt;br/&gt;measurements, the core ingredient being the notion of time dependence.&lt;br/&gt;Benoit Mandelbrot in the sixties suggested using models involving&lt;br/&gt;long-range dependence. Long-range dependence, to put it concisely,&lt;br/&gt;affects phenomena in which correlations between the present and the&lt;br/&gt;past decay slowly with time and thus they cannot be easily ignored.&lt;br/&gt;Time series with long-range dependence and their variations have been&lt;br/&gt;used in hydrology, geophysics and biophysics, and more recently, in&lt;br/&gt;finance and in analyzing traffic in computer networks. It is thus&lt;br/&gt;important to be able to estimate effectively the intensity of&lt;br/&gt;long-range dependence. The purpose of this research is to develop a&lt;br/&gt;new methodology to achieve this goal. It is wavelet-based and hence&lt;br/&gt;insensitive to the effects of trends and other deviations from the&lt;br/&gt;model.</AbstractNarration>
