<AbstractNarration>Award Abstract 0504720, J Szeftel, Princeton University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Numerical computation and qualitative properties of nonlinear Partial Differential Equations  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes to work on three problems in applied &lt;br/&gt;mathematics. The first problem is related to the design of absorbing &lt;br/&gt;boundary conditions for nonlinear partial differential equations. The main &lt;br/&gt;goal is to obtain absorbing boundary conditions for systems such as those &lt;br/&gt;of fluid dynamics. This work will contain numerical computations as well &lt;br/&gt;as advanced microlocal analysis. The second problem deals with the &lt;br/&gt;optimization of the transmission conditions in domain decomposition &lt;br/&gt;methods. The principal investigator intends to use the absorbing boundary &lt;br/&gt;conditions designed for nonlinear partial differential equations to &lt;br/&gt;optimize the transmission conditions. This project will contain in &lt;br/&gt;particular numerical computations. The third area of work deals with &lt;br/&gt;long-time existence for nonlinear partial differential equations on &lt;br/&gt;compact manifolds. The aim is to improve the estimate on the time of &lt;br/&gt;existence given by the local existence theory for solutions of nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations. The mathematical techniques will involve &lt;br/&gt;advanced tools in analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on three problems, two problems being related to &lt;br/&gt;numerical analysis and one to qualitative properties of nonlinear partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations. The suggested works involve very interesting &lt;br/&gt;mathematical questions and at the same time are important for &lt;br/&gt;applications. The first and the second problem tackle with the numerical &lt;br/&gt;computation of huge systems and have therefore applications in numerous &lt;br/&gt;areas such as environmental sciences (oceanography and meteorology) as &lt;br/&gt;well as medicine (simulation of blood flows in human vascular system). &lt;br/&gt;While it is too soon to appraise the wide societal impact of the third &lt;br/&gt;problem, the last decades have seen stunning applications in many fields &lt;br/&gt;(e. g. environmental sciences and dynamic of populations to name just a &lt;br/&gt;few) of the study of qualitative properties of partial differential &lt;br/&gt;equations. These three proposed problems will solidify important &lt;br/&gt;connections between area of modern mathematical research such as numerical &lt;br/&gt;analysis, nonlinear partial differential equations and advanced microlocal &lt;br/&gt;analysis. The principal investigator will disseminate results of the &lt;br/&gt;project among both applied and pure mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
