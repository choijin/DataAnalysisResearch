<AbstractNarration>Abstract: SGER proposal CMS-0503910&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conventional surface/interface theories and microfluid mechanics have failed in explaining the experimental results of forced absorption of nanoporous materials. The predicted infiltration pressure could be several times lower than the measured data, and the pore size dependence on the hysteresis of absorption isotherms could not be captured at all.  This poses significant challenges in applying nanoporous materials in important fields such as energy storage, energy absorption, processing of new materials, advanced actuators, environmental engineering, etc.  Currently, the study in this area is at its early stage. The experimental data of the infiltration pressure and absorption effectiveness are scarce.  The limited testing results obtained from different research teams are often contradictory to each other, primarily due to the lack of accurate control of environmental factors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In view of the above considerations, the investigator is proposing a one-year exploratory experimental research on the behavior of liquids confined in nanopores under various conditions. A number of promising systems will be investigated. Both quasi-static and dynamic infiltration behavior will be analyzed. The system performance, as characterized by the infiltration pressure, degree of hysteresis, and the displacement, will be related to control variables including temperature and potential difference. The optimum surface treatment techniques and chemical admixtures will be identified.  The proposed study not only promises to lead to the development of advanced mechanical elements with high energy densities, large displacements, and simple structures, but also will shed light on the fundamental mechanisms and processes that govern interfacial properties in nanoscale environments.  A number of students will be actively involved in the project and acquire comprehensive research experience.  Results of this study will have significant impacts on the syllabuses on subjects of mechanics and materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
