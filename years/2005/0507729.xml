    <AbstractNarration>AST-0507729&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: University of California, Santa Cruz&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jean Brodie&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Globular Cluster Sub-Populations - Understanding Galaxy Formation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Jean Brodie at the University of California Santa Cruz, and Dr. John Huchra at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, will carry out a program to address a number of questions relating to globular cluster systems and their host galaxies. Among the questions are: 1. How and when did globular cluster systems and their host galaxies form? 2. To what extent do morphology and/or environment reflect the formation history of galaxies? What can globulars tell us about the formation of galaxy disks? Can young massive clusters be regarded as proto-globular clusters? To address these questions, a program of observational, theoretical, and numerical research will be undertaken. The main observational efforts will be selected among: 1) High Resolution Optical and Near-Infrared Spectroscopy to determine abundances of young and old star clusters in galaxies from M31 to the Virgo Cluster; 2) Low-Resolution Optical Spectroscopy to derive kinematics, ages and abundances of large samples of globulars s in a wide range of galaxy types and environments, and 3) Wide Field Imaging to probe the spatial distributions, specific frequency and luminosity function evolution of cluster subpopulations. Theoretical research necessary to put these new observations in context will also be undertaken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact will result through a program of professional and public outreach, and efforts to include women, undergraduates and minorities in the research. A publicly accessible website database will be also be improved and augmented.</AbstractNarration>
