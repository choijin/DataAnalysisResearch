<AbstractNarration>Primary production in the ocean is probably the least known part of the ocean's carbon cycle. One reason that primary production is little known is the lack of understanding of the geographical and temporal variability in phytoplankton physiology. For example it is only  recently  that  the  importance  has  been  revealed,  of  the  so-called  photoprotectant pigments,  pigments  that,  in  effect,  shield  the  photosynthetic  apparatus  from  too  much sunlight. This project will investigate the geographic and temporal variability of a fundamental property of oceanic photosynthesis: the quantum yield, or the ratio of the available  light  to  the  amount  of  carbon  fixed in photosynthesis. The PIs propose an hypothesis based on earlier measurements, that in the lower parts of the euphotic zone in the stratified ocean, the upward flux of nutrients regulates the value of the quantum yield, while in the upper parts, irradiance governs its value, through the pigment composition of the  phytoplankton.  This  hypothesis  will  be  tested  by  making  estimates  of  the  quantum yield's  maximum  value  through  very  careful  and  comprehensive  measurements  of  the bio-optical  properties  and  species  composition of the phytoplankton, as well as the submarine  light  environment,  hydrography,  and  nutrients.  These  measurements  will  be along  both  temporal  and  spatial  gradients  in  the  ocean  to  create  the  basis  for environmental regulation of quantum yield. These  measurements  will  be  used  to establish  precisely  how  the  maximum  value  of  the  quantum  yield  is  regulated  by  solar flux  and  plant  nutrients.  This research provides a mechanism  to  understand  how  the  processes  of  nutrient  supply and light affect the physiology  of  natural  populations  of  phytoplankton,  a  long-standing  problem  in biological oceanography. It also provides a means for improving the modeling primary productivity, including estimating productivity in the global ocean from space. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research will aid in developing a  better  understanding  of  the  role  of phytoplankton  in  the  global  carbon cycle, and also the affects  of  climate  change  on primary  production  in  the  ocean.  The project provides for the training of a post-doc and one or more graduate students, and results will be disseminated public web sites that serve an educational function.</AbstractNarration>
