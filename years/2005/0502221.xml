<AbstractNarration>0502221&lt;br/&gt;Dixon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support acquisition and installation of a 9 station network of continuously operating GPS stations (CGPS) and 3 boreholes broadband seismometers and tiltmeters on the Nicoya Peninsula to investigate slow slip events and episodic seismic tremor at the Costa Rican subduction zone. The new instrumentation will augment 3 existing CGPS stations deployed by Japanese and Costa Rican colleagues, and 6 borehole seismic observatories, being installed by German colleagues.  These international collaborations will greatly enhance the ability of the network to address fundamental questions about earthquake processes in this hazardous region.  Slow slip events or "silent earthquakes" are a recently observed mode of strain release where slip occurs over an intermediate time scale, usually days to months. This type of motion has been detected at a few subduction zone faults where continuous GPS or borehole tiltmeter networks exist. The processes responsible are poorly understood but slow slip events have been associated with low frequency seismic tremor, possibly caused by the migration of fluids through the shallow subduction system.  Increased fluid pressure on the interplate fault could act to weaken it bringing it closer to failure. As a result, slow slip events may indicate pre-rupture fault breakdown prior to the occurrence of a large earthquake.  The Nicoya Peninsula borehole seismic and CGPS networks will have sufficient density and sensitivity to detect and study slow slip events and seismic tremor and investigate the processes responsible for their generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
