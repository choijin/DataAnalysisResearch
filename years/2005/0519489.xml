<AbstractNarration>This technical component of this project deals with certain fundamental principles&lt;br/&gt;underlying the application of ionically functionalized conducting polymers, so called&lt;br/&gt;conjugated ionomers, to electronics. The three primary goals of the project are: (1) to&lt;br/&gt;elucidate the mechanism of current rectification at pn junctions based on conjugated&lt;br/&gt;ionomers; (2) to elucidate the mechanism of steady-state rectification in a new class of&lt;br/&gt;heteroionic junctions formed between an undoped anionic and cationic ionomer; (3) to&lt;br/&gt;explore a non-traditional method of doping conjugated polymers that relies on non-&lt;br/&gt;Faradaic processes. To achieve these goals, a comprehensive suite of electrical and&lt;br/&gt;electrochemical characterization methods are applied to study a series of rationally&lt;br/&gt;designed polymer bilayer structures. These studies are complemented by studies on&lt;br/&gt;single layer structures and rely heavily on the availability of a family of conjugated&lt;br/&gt;ionomers or varying ionic functional group density. The results of the characterization&lt;br/&gt;methods are to be compared to both theories developed for inorganic semiconductor&lt;br/&gt;analogues as well as those developed for molecular systems.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposal stem from better understanding the relation&lt;br/&gt;of polymeric to inorganic semiconductors as well as the unique properties of interfaces&lt;br/&gt;between mixed ionic/electronic conductors. In doing so, these studies will help guide the&lt;br/&gt;future development of electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as transistors and lightemitting&lt;br/&gt;diodes, based on conjugated polymers. The project will also impact the training&lt;br/&gt;of both undergraduates and graduate students in the basic science of materials. Graduate&lt;br/&gt;students working on the project will be part of a comprehensive training program that&lt;br/&gt;integrates chemists and physicists and includes targeted technical training in the area of&lt;br/&gt;semiconductor devices as well as off-campus internships. A broad range of&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates will be reached by the project both through their contributions to research&lt;br/&gt;and through curriculum development. A new non-majors undergraduate course will be&lt;br/&gt;developed that teaches basic chemical and physical principles using everyday materials&lt;br/&gt;and the devices upon which they are based as a context.</AbstractNarration>
