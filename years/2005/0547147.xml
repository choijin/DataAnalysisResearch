<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract -- &lt;br/&gt;A key research problem in condensed-matter physics is the investigation of quantum coherence at the scale of circuits on a chip. Progress in this area could accelerate the pace of improvements necessary for implementing large-scale quantum computers and advance fundamental understanding of quantum mechanics at large scales. The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development project at Syracuse University is to build and measure circuits which can probe the quantum coherent properties of vortices that are guided through nanofabricated superconducting structures. Vortices are quantized bundles of magnetic flux which thread many different superconductors over a particular range of applied magnetic fields. The research project will make extensive use of the nearby, NSF-funded Cornell Nanoscale Facility. Quantum coherent circuits are currently outside the realm of the standard undergraduate curriculum and are unfamiliar topics to the general public, but are becoming highly relevant because of the emerging field of quantum information. Therefore, a new course on applied topics in quantum mechanics will be developed for the undergraduate physics program which will treat important modern problems. New experimental projects involving investigations of quantum coherence will be built for the upper-level undergraduate lab courses. Several public lectures on quantum coherent circuits will be given as part of an ongoing series at Syracuse. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract -- &lt;br/&gt;A key research problem in condensed-matter physics is the investigation of quantum coherence at the scale of circuits on a chip. Progress in this area could accelerate the pace of improvements necessary for implementing large-scale quantum computers and advance fundamental understanding of quantum mechanics at large scales. The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development project at Syracuse University is to probe the quantum coherent properties of vortices that are guided through nanofabricated superconducting structures with feature sizes down to 100 nm. The research project will make extensive use of the nearby, NSF-funded Cornell Nanoscale Facility. Experiments will be developed to measure the quantum interference of a vortex that is permitted to follow two different paths and detect the tunneling of a single vortex by coupling the vortex to another quantum coherent superconducting device. Quantum coherent circuits are currently outside the realm of the standard undergraduate curriculum and are unfamiliar topics to the general public. Therefore, a new course on applied topics in quantum mechanics will be developed for the undergraduate physics program which will treat important modern topics, including the emerging field of quantum information.
