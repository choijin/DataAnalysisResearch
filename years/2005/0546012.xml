<AbstractNarration>0546012&lt;br/&gt;Wang&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to develop a platform to assess mRNA expression using a novel quantum dot FRET probe within a microfluidic environment. Characterization of the molecular probe and the microfluidic systems are proposed followed by a demonstration of the integrated system using a gene expression model. The education goals include BioMEMS course development, introducing a seminar series on Bio/Nano topics, undergraduate mentoring and an outreach component focused on involving high school students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
