<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0503506&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Jeff A. Viaclovsky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first project supported by this award deals with compactness&lt;br/&gt;results for certain classes of Riemannian metrics in dimension&lt;br/&gt;four, particularly for anti-self-dual metrics and extremal&lt;br/&gt;Kaehler metrics.  With certain geometric noncollapsing&lt;br/&gt;assumptions, the appropriate moduli spaces can be compactified by&lt;br/&gt;adding metrics with generalized orbifold singularities.  A&lt;br/&gt;long-term goal of this project is to use this compactification to&lt;br/&gt;define new smooth invariants of four-manifolds. The second&lt;br/&gt;project considers conformal deformations of metrics, certain&lt;br/&gt;fully nonlinear curvature equations, and relations with&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian functions in dimensions three and four.  A crucial&lt;br/&gt;problem in this direction is to prescribe a symmetric function of&lt;br/&gt;the eigenvalues of the Ricci tensor, generalizing the Yamabe&lt;br/&gt;problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A recurring theme in geometry is the relationship between&lt;br/&gt;topology, a soft or stretchy version of the shape of a space, and&lt;br/&gt;the possible geometries on that space.  In the same way that the&lt;br/&gt;familiar round geometry on the two-dimensional sphere is more&lt;br/&gt;appealing and geometrically distinctive than any of the nearby&lt;br/&gt;geometries obtained by pushing in or pulling small regions on the&lt;br/&gt;sphere, one likes to hope that most manifolds of low dimensions&lt;br/&gt;will carry geometries that are somehow optimal - especially&lt;br/&gt;symmetric geometries, or minimizers for some sort of total energy&lt;br/&gt;measurement.  The projects described above seek to discover such&lt;br/&gt;optimal or extremal geometries in some important three- and&lt;br/&gt;four-dimensional cases.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
