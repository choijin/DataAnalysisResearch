<AbstractNarration>With support from a National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation Award, the Zoological Society of San Diego, through its Conservation and Research for Endangered Species (CRES) facility will acquire two major pieces of research instrumentation.  The instruments, an automated DNA analyzer (for determining DNA sequences and analyzing DNA variability) and a microscopy work station specially equipped for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH - a procedure allowing the identification of the location of DNA sequences on chromosomes) will be located at the recently constructed Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center for Conservation Research located at the San Diego Wild Animal Park in Escondido, California. The studies to be undertaken will provide new information about the structure, organization and evolution of primate and other mammalian chromosomes and to detect chromosomal abnormalities in primate chromosomes.  Leaf-eating monkeys native to Asia, e.g., colobines, gorillas and New World primates will be specific subjects of these studies.  DNA sequences from the nucleus and cellular mitochondria will be analyzed from a variety of primate species to broaden the understanding of the evolutionary relationships of primates and to provide molecular documentation that may be used in other scientific studies to confirm that DNA samples are correctly identified with respect to their species of origin.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CRES is the multidisciplinary research and conservation branch of the Zoological Society of San Diego, a non-profit corporation. CRES actively engages in conservation-oriented research through laboratory studies, field programs, and applied conservation projects around the world. CRES is involved in the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral and visiting scientists. Genetic characterization will be undertaken utilizing chromosomes and DNA obtained from tissue cultures that are part of the Zoological Society's Frozen Zoo.  With over 144 primate taxa in the Frozen Zoo, the research to be undertaken can add significantly to existing data. Analysis of variation of DNA microsatellite loci can be used for kinship and demographic history studies in primate populations. With our large collection of western lowland gorilla samples, we can provide the most detailed description of microsatellite genetic diversity yet assembled for this species utilizing the equipment provided by this award and the genetic resources of the Frozen Zoo. Using the requested microscopy system the researchers will undertake studies utilizing FISH to examine segmental duplications and centromere repositioning, rearrangements that have been shown to be significant events in the chromosomal evolution of humans and other primates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Efforts are underway to make high quality DNA and other primate resources available to the broader research community through the NSF-supported IPBIR (Integrated Primate Biomaterials and Information Resource). Data produced by our research activities will strengthen the IPBIR through documentation of samples. This research also extends to fundamental comparative studies of the structure, variation, and evolution of primate genomes. Unfortunately, approximately 30% of primate species are currently endangered, making the proposed research also relevant to conservation efforts. Opportunities to participate in this exciting area of scientific study will be a factor attracting students of all backgrounds. Our educational outreach programs and partnerships with local schools and universities will allow increasing numbers of students from under represented groups to take advantage of the new facilities at CRES, engaging a new generation in conservation-oriented scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
