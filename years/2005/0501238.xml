<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary for Dynamics Days 2005&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal request funds to support the Annual International Conference on Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics: Dynamics Days 2005, to be held at the Coast Long Beach Hotel, Long Beach, CA on January 7 - 10, 2005. Dynamics Days is an annual conference whose purpose is to gather a variety of researchers with overlapping interests in topics in nonlinear dynamics. It has become well-known in the field as a most productive way for researchers with common interests but varied background to disseminate their own results and learn about recent developments in related areas. Though the regular attendees are primarily in the fields of mathematics and physics, the interdisciplinary field of nonlinear dynamics has continued to grow rapidly in recent years. This is in part due to the development of more sophisticated analytical and numerical techniques and more refined experimental procedures that permit the study of systems with greater complexity. Researchers in physics, mathematics, chemistry, engineering, fluid mechanics, biology, physiology and economics have all given invited talks at previous Dynamics Days conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Dynamics Days 2005, some twenty invited speakers, an additional twenty contributed oral presentations, and approximately 125 posters are expected. This year, problems in soft-condensed matter physics (broadly defined) and biological systems in which nonlinear dynamics plays a substantial role are being emphasized. However, sessions covering a broad range of topics, including pattern forming systems, characterization and control of nonlinear systems, synchronization of nonlinear systems, and complex systems are being planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will be hosted by the Department of Physics and Astronomy and the Department of Biomedical Engineering of U. C. Irvine. The members of the organizing committee for the January 2005 U.S. Dynamics Days conference are Michael Dennin (co-chair) (UC Irvine), Vittorio Cristini (co-chair) (UC Irvine), Eli Ben-Naim (Los Alamos National Laboratory), Douglas Durian (UCLA), Joshua Socolar (Duke University), Herbert Levine (UCSD), Guenter Ahlers (UCSB), Rajarshi Roy (U. of Maryland).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of its interdisciplinary nature, Dynamics Days has a broad impact on the dissemination of knowledge across fields. The meeting also has a significant impact on the training of young scientists. It is a very successful forum for young scientists, especially graduate students and postdoctoral students, to interact with experts from a variety of fields. This exposure across disciplines is very important for the continued health of the general nonlinear dynamics effort. This success derives from two sources. First, the structure of the meeting encourages active participation from young scientists through contributed oral presentations of 15 minutes each, and two poster sessions. Because there are no parallel sessions, attendees are exposed to all of the represented topics. Finally, of the approximately twenty invited lectures, a fraction is reserved for outstanding young researchers. Second, the budget for past meetings has included sufficient funds for fellowships to support the travel for younger scientist.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
