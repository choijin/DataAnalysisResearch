<AbstractNarration>Research Internships in Science of the Environment (RISE) Program at Arkansas State University provides students a unique cross-disciplinary research experience under the broad disciplinary umbrella of Environmental Science. The research program is unified through a common research field site, a common set of research objectives, and the inclusion of REU participants in a collaborative research team comprised of two REU participants and two faculty mentors.  Research efforts center on the relation between agricultural land-use and impact on the environment including environmental chemistry, contaminant fate and transport, habitat quality, and biodiversity.  Research at a centralized field area, the Judd Hill Plantation, and collaborative research training in the field and laboratory provides students with hands-on training in state-of-the-art analytical technologies while providing training in a number of environmental disciplines ranging from chemistry to ecology to geology to social sciences. RISE is specifically designed to provide integrated research and training opportunities to under-represented minority students.  RISE particularly encourages the participation of rising sophomore and junior students in biology, chemistry and/or social sciences interested in research.  Included in RISE is an ethics component comprised of seminars on topics such as environmental justice, the social dimensions of science and technology, and ethics in science.  The program features seminars that include guest lectures from minority scientists in academia, government, and the private sector.  RISE students present their research at a national scientific meeting and are provided mentorship by the program after the summer has ended.  The goal is to provide young scholars the opportunity to be immersed in the "doing" of science providing the touchstone experience they need to thrive and excel at the undergraduate and graduate level.  More information and application materials can be found at http://www.cas.astate.edu/rise or by contacting Dr. Robyn Hannigan (hannigan@astate.edu; 870-680-4360 or 870-972-3269).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The most important outcome of this project is the percentage of students who have graduated within five years with a degree in a STEM discipline.  With the exception of one student with whom we have lost contact (and who might have graduated), every student who went through this program either completed a degree or is on track to complete a degree within five years.  This is a remarkable accomplishment for two reasons.  The first is that completion rates along all demographic lines are not good for STEM majors.  The recent figures for completion rates within five years are 42% for Asian American, 33% for Caucasians, 22.1% for Hispanics, 18.8% for Native American, and 18.4% for African American (HERI, 2010).  The near 100% completion amongst students in all demographic categories in this program is a significant increase above what is normally found.  The second reason this is quite an accomplishment is that the majority of the participants in this program were minority students, who normally have the lowest completion rates.   This increase in graduation rates might be due, in part, to the increase in student confidence as a result of participating in this program.  All students were given pre and post surveys developed to gauge their attitudes to various aspects of the project.  The latter third of the surveys used a 6-point Likert scale for measuring their responses (Strongly Disagree, Moderately Disagree, Slightly Disagree, Slightly Agree, Moderately Agree, and Strongly Agree) to statements about their attitudes to STEM issues (67-100).  Of particular importance are the responses to statements about their confidence to design a study, understand research in their area, and apply various laboratory techniques, as well as their desire to complete a graduate degree.  The table below shows the average pre and post scores to these statements.  As one would hope, the post survey responses show a significant increase over the pre survey responses.         Statement    Pre   Survey (n=26)    Post   Survey (n=31)      I am confident in my ability to design an environmental science   research study.    3.64    4.77      I am confident in my ability to understand research in the area   of environmental science and in particular my sub-discipline.    4.52    4.90      I am confident in my ability to apply various laboratory   techniques to research in the area of environmental science and in particular   my sub-discipline.    4.08    5.20      I intend to complete a graduate degree in the environmental   sciences.    4.00    4.40         These results give a lot of support for the emphasis on undergraduate research being a standard component in STEM degree programs.  While it is certain that there are other confounding factors in this project, such as students having to self select into the program and the stipends paid to them, the near unanimous graduation result is similar to other sponsored undergraduate programs we have at ASU (McNair, RISE-UP).  Because of this, we are looking at starting a program in our STEM education program that will investigate if requiring research at the undergraduate level aids those students in completing a degree.
