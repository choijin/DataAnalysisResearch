<AbstractNarration>The project is developing and evaluating a model for online engineering technology education that includes hands-on, remote laboratory learning experiences. It combines the investigators' experience in distance learning with their background in developing and implementing instructional strategies for promoting student success in engineering technology career pathways. The investigators are developing a template and instructional guide format for online laboratories that maximizes student learning.  Using this template and format, the project team is installing hardware and related software to allow virtual remote control of a set of expensive laboratory equipment.   To make the experience more realistic, the investigators are developing an affordable package of laboratory equipment that students can purchase and use at home to support interaction with the centrally located equipment.  They also are producing video instructions for the laboratory activities in 71 different on-line laboratory experiments and an on-line resource for dealing with frequently asked questions.  The project will provide remote access to on-campus laboratory equipment for on-line courses for students that maximize the potential for success of students with varying learning styles and hands-on learning needs. The laboratory model for distance learners is being disseminated via the South Carolina ATE National Resource Center, through a faculty workshop, and through conference presentations.  The evaluation effort is comparing course success rates, program graduation rates, student attitudes, and achieved competencies for students using the remote laboratory to those physically present in the laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
