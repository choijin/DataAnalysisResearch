<AbstractNarration>Because melt transfer affects the thermal and rheological behavior of the crust during orogenesis, it has become important to understand the mechanism by which melt is transferred from source to sink. This record is in the geometry, petrography, geochronology and geochemistry of granites associated with migmatites at all scales (matrix-mineral to pluton scales). Within migmatites the geometry of smaller-volume granites may have recorded a quasi-steady network of melt migration, partly controlled by deformation during melt production. Although the geometry of these bodies may be fragments of the full-flow network due to periodic closing and opening of conduits, some vein-like bodies may travel as a whole during deformation. The presence of granite in structurally controlled sites suggests melt flow during deformation, as is supported by experimental data.&lt;br/&gt; This work is focused upon a complete interdisciplinary approach to the question of orogenic granite melt flow. The 3-D documentation the geometry of migmatitic structures (e.g., leucosomes and smaller-volume granite bodies) and associated plutons is essential information as these data amount to some sort of plumbing, with migmatitic fabrics/structures as the conduits. Despite the possibility that this geometry may be fragmentary or composite, the base of understanding can come only from this detailed analysis. Subsequent geochronological and geochemical data is placed in a solid, meaningful framework. Work is focused on single large exposures, small sets of closely-spaced outcrops and along a series of transects in western Maine, and continues into in New Hampshire. &lt;br/&gt; The outcome of the research is the better understanding of melt-transit through the crust in orogens, as well as the capacity to use the results to better constrain regional tectonics. We approach this outcome through connection between detailed (labor-intensive) mesoscale and microscale observation of key exposures. The study fundamentally incorporates several small-scale field and laboratory studies that are performed by many workers, operating simultaneously within a given region. Each part of the study, therefore, sums to a larger-scale project aimed at a singular goal. Therefore, the work is perfectly suited for undergraduate student projects that necessarily operate on single-semester to single-year time scales. &lt;br/&gt; An important impact of this study is the involvement of a team of undergraduate students from both PIs' institutions. Research experiences take the form of year-long Honors Theses and one-semester Independent Studies with foci related to distinct parts of the overall project. The focus on team participation in a larger project allows students to reap the benefit of being invested in a significant piece of high-level science. This allows for teamwork while conducting independent work, and seeing how individual projects are important components in the larger effort. Some students will gain additional experience by visiting other facilities in order to perform some of the lab work. The collaborative nature supports exchanging ideas and learning from one another.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
