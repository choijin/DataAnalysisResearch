<AbstractNarration>Neepa Maitra of Hunter College, City University of New York is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for research to develop accurate functionals for use in time-dependent density functional studies of eletronic excitations  and dynamics in systems of chemical interest.  The Atomic Theory program within the Physics Division provided partial support for this award.  The project involves fundamental theory development and a completely new extension of the theory to a time-dependent one-body density-matrix theory.  The research is impacting our understanding of both strong-field calculations, such as quantum control phenomena, and photo-ionization and also linear response phenomena. Specific applications to double excitations, autoionizing resonances, long-range charge transfer across molecules and molecular dissociation are being studied. Coupled electron-ion dynamics are being studied in a scheme involving semiclassical nuclei coupled to a TDDFT description of electrons; the methodology is being developed and applied to systems of light nuclei, such as photodissociation of molecules involving hydrogen. The PI will also use TDDFT to study the effects of electron interaction on quantum chaotic properties of electronic systems such as quantum dots.  The work is having a broader impact on our understanding of systems of chemical interest, and is having an additional broader impact through the inclusion of underrepresented minority groups in the research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The award resulted in several fundamental developments in time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), some new theoretical tools, and progress in our understanding of electron correlation in atomic, molecular and chemical dynamics and excitations.  TDDFT reformulates the quantum mechanics of systems of many interacting indistinguishable particles, such as electrons in atoms, molecules, solids, and quantum dots, in such a way that enables quantum calculations for systems of chemical, biochemical and materials interest, too large for traditional wavefunction methods. Topical applications include optical spectra of biomolecules, charge-transfer processes in nano-scale devices such as solar cells, and attosecond dynamics with a view to quantum control of dynamical processes.  This project focused on areas in which the approximate functionals used in TDDFT perform poorly, and on developing improved approximate functionals from first principles, as well as new formalisms for both electron dynamics as well as coupled electron-nuclear dynamics.  The progress of TDDFT for real time electron dynamics in external (laser) fields has been slow and challenging because of limitations in the functional approximations available today that are particular severe when the system is exposed to non-perturbative external influences. We have developed a new phase-space extension of TDDFT, that treats electron correlation via semiclassical dynamics and our initial tests shows that it overcomes the major limitations the usual approaches have. It brings two fundamental approaches to time-dependent quantum mechanics together for the first time to treat electron-dynamics: density-functional methods used to treat many electrons, and semiclassical methods used to simplify and interpret quantum dynamics.

Developing methods to treat coupled electron-nuclear dynamics is crucial to understand what is going on in most of the topical applications e.g. solar cell design.

We have established rigorously the concepts of the exact time-dependent potential energy surface and time-dependent Berry (geometric) phase. This has led to interesting insight on mechanisms of ionization and dissociation in simple model systems and our formalism is the correct starting point upon which to build approximate methods.  In other work, we clarified and extended the rigorous theorems upon which TDDFT is based, we derived an approximate TDDFT kernel to describe auto-ionizing resonances that arise from bound-double-excitations with energy in the continuum, explored a modified current-density functional approach to treat polarizabilities of long-chain molecules, and performed the first studies of electron-interaction induced chaos using TDDFT.     The research described above has had a broad societal impact through the training of many undergraduate and graduate students involved, many of whom have gone on, or wish to go on, to a teaching career, enabling them to pass on research skills, scientific understanding, critical-thinking and communication skills ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
