<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: Nonparametric location and scatter functionals&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given n independent observations, each with distribution P, one&lt;br/&gt;can form an empirical measure by taking the average of point masses&lt;br/&gt;at the observations. For a functional T  of P, evaluating T at the&lt;br/&gt;empirical measure gives an estimator of T(P) which will converge&lt;br/&gt;to it almost surely if T is suitably continuous at P. The project &lt;br/&gt;will continue a search for functionals continuous at as many P's as &lt;br/&gt;possible, which may be all P in one dimension, but in higher &lt;br/&gt;dimensions an open dense set. Then if T is also differentiable at &lt;br/&gt;P in a sufficient sense, the estimators will be asymptotically&lt;br/&gt;normal and converge to T(P) at a rate of 1 over square root of n.&lt;br/&gt;Functionals of location include the mean mu when it is finite. &lt;br/&gt;In one dimension, another location functional is the median m,  &lt;br/&gt;and scale functionals include the standard deviation sigma and &lt;br/&gt;median absolute deviation. The classical mu and sigma can be &lt;br/&gt;undefined or infinite at laws decreasing too slowly at infinity. &lt;br/&gt;For some laws P there is an interval of medians, whose midpoint &lt;br/&gt;gives a unique choice of m, but m is discontinuous at such P. &lt;br/&gt;Simultaneous maximum likelihood estimation of location and scale &lt;br/&gt;for t distributions with degrees of freedom nu larger than 1 extends &lt;br/&gt;to location and scale functionals defined and continuous at every &lt;br/&gt;probability distribution on the line, and infinitely differentiable &lt;br/&gt;at distributions having no atom as large as nu over nu plus one.&lt;br/&gt;On multidimensional spaces, the square of a scale parameter&lt;br/&gt;is replaced by a scatter matrix analogous to a covariance&lt;br/&gt;matrix, and the continuity and differentiability will be sought on&lt;br/&gt;a dense open set of distributions, via t functionals and by other&lt;br/&gt;methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Location and scale or scatter functionals are some of the most basic &lt;br/&gt;in statistics. But by far the two best known functionals of location, &lt;br/&gt;the mean and median, each have serious drawbacks. Using the mean, one&lt;br/&gt;assumes in effect that all data are correct. The mean can be overly &lt;br/&gt;influenced by outlying, extreme observations such as gross errors. &lt;br/&gt;Using the median, on the other hand, guards against the possibility&lt;br/&gt;that nearly half the data may be incorrect. If a distribution &lt;br/&gt;has more than half its probability in an interval, the median must be &lt;br/&gt;in that interval and may very poorly represent the rest of the distribution. &lt;br/&gt;Functionals combining some of the advantages of the mean and median while&lt;br/&gt;avoiding the worst drawbacks of either can and should be more widely studied &lt;br/&gt;and used. Then one can have kinds of averages that guard against a more&lt;br/&gt;realistic possibility that some small fraction of the data may be&lt;br/&gt;incorrect.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
