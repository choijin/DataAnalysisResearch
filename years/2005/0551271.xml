<AbstractNarration>This project consists of two parts. The first part is concerned with estimation of moment&lt;br/&gt;condition models. A new estimation method that achieves an asymptotic minimax efficiency&lt;br/&gt;property is proposed. The second part explores nonparametric identifiability for finite mixture&lt;br/&gt;models, and develops a semiparametric estimator.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit of the proposed activities&lt;br/&gt;The first part aims at providing a method for estimating moment condition models, which&lt;br/&gt;are usually estimated by the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) in the current applied&lt;br/&gt;literature. This research is motivated by the recent concerns that the performance of GMM&lt;br/&gt;may be problematic under empirically relevant data generating processes. The conventional&lt;br/&gt;local first-order efficiency theory is of limited use for analyzing this problem. This part of the&lt;br/&gt;proposal develops a global first-order efficiency theory for moment condition models using the&lt;br/&gt;large deviation principle (LDP), which is a major subject in probability theory. It then proposes&lt;br/&gt;a new estimator that achieves the asymptotic minimax efficiency bound in a large deviation&lt;br/&gt;sense. The new estimator uses Owens empirical likelihood as a crucial ingredient; indeed, it&lt;br/&gt;can be interpreted as a robustified version of the conventional empirical likelihood estimator.&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary simulation results imply that the new method outperforms competing estimators,&lt;br/&gt;though more experimental studies will be undertaken in the project. Empirical applications of&lt;br/&gt;the method to panel data models and further theoretical extensions of the method are planned.&lt;br/&gt;The second part considers finite mixture models. Finite mixture models allow applied&lt;br/&gt;researchers to deal with parameter variations, such as unobserved heterogeneity or unobserved&lt;br/&gt;regimes, in a convenient and interpretable way. The existing literature on finite mixture models,&lt;br/&gt;however, focuses on parametric models. The proposed research develops nonparametric&lt;br/&gt;identification theory for finite mixtures, where components of a mixture model are treated&lt;br/&gt;nonparametrically. While a few studies have succeeded in treating such models, they demand&lt;br/&gt;specifications such as symmetric distributions or multiple independent observations from each&lt;br/&gt;observation unit. This research takes an approach that is very different from these studies and&lt;br/&gt;shows that nonparametric identification is possible by using variations in covariates. It also proposes&lt;br/&gt;a new estimation algorithm for a semiparametric finite mixture model. Generalizations of&lt;br/&gt;these results, including their extensions to dynamic models, will be explored.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the proposed activities&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the results from the proposed activities include the following. First,&lt;br/&gt;the project will produce computer programs that will be made accessible to public. For example,&lt;br/&gt;the research on minimax estimation will yield computer software for the new procedure. This&lt;br/&gt;effort, as a byproduct, will include developing a reliable program for implementing empirical&lt;br/&gt;likelihood methods, which have been attracting a great deal of attention among practitioners.&lt;br/&gt;This will benefit a broad range of communities. Second, graduate students will be supported&lt;br/&gt;directly and indirectly by the proposed project. Past NSF support enabled graduate students to&lt;br/&gt;participate in projects of the PI as research assistants. This provided them with financial support&lt;br/&gt;as well as opportunities to learn state-of-the-art econometrics and programming skills. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed project will continue to support graduate students and provide them with the skills and&lt;br/&gt;knowledge necessary for their thesis research and early career development. Third, econometric&lt;br/&gt;methodologies from this project will be used to analyze empirical economic problems. This&lt;br/&gt;includes applications of the new minimax estimation method to models of income dynamics,&lt;br/&gt;which have important policy implications. The proposed methods are expected to shed new&lt;br/&gt;light on economic problems that are highly relevant to a broad audience.</AbstractNarration>
