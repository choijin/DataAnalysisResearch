<AbstractNarration>CAREER: Energy Scalable Signal Processing for Energy Harvesting Microsystems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Rajeevan Amirtharajah&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No: ECS-0547113&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER proposal focuses on developing integrated circuits for energy harvesting microsystems.  Advances in digital technology have brought computation out of the machine room and made it nearly ubiquitous.  Integrating computation with sensing and actuation enables new applications in transportation systems, environmental studies, and public safety.  However, battery technology has not kept pace - limiting size, operating lifetime, and raising costs.  Energy harvesting from external sources can enable the next generation of ubiquitous computation, but energy-harvesting microsystems are still in their infancy.  Moreover, the desire for smaller devices and high integration limits the power available from energy harvesting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This proposal addresses these issues by developing microarchitectures and circuits for sensor signal processing that are energy efficient, energy scalable, and robust to voltage variations, which characterize energy harvesting transducers.  The approach is to develop computational elements that do not require DC power supplies by using energy recovery and self-timed circuits adapted to energy harvesting operation from AC supplies.  The project culminates in the development of a custom DSP integrated circuit with a target energy efficiency of 10 TeraOps/W, which will demonstrate critical enabling technologies for future energy harvesting microsystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: To broaden the impact of this work, the project will bring energy scalability ideas into new and revised courses through design projects and laboratory experiments. The goal is to reintroduce physical constraints into digital design, which is currently dominated by logic synthesis, and link education with the research program.  The project will involve underrepresented minorities in the proposed research through the NSF California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) program.  The project will contribute to the energy harvesting and low power research community by disseminating methodologies, results, and tools online and through interdisciplinary collaboration with researchers at the University of California at Berkeley and with industry researchers at Motorola and Xilinx, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Electronics are a fundamental part of everyday life in today's highly technological society.  People everywhere in the developed world and the developing world depend on mobile phones, pacemakers, and sensors,from accelerometers in automobile air bags to thermostats for home heating control.  Batteries provide the energy for these devices, but batteries have a downside: they run out.  Replacing them takes timeand effort and the toxic chemicals they contain can hurt the environment.  One approach to reduce our society's dependence on batteries is to build electronics that can harvest the energy they need from their environment, through sunlight, heat, or motion.  In this project we have focused on creating computer chips which consume so little power that they can get by on small amounts of energy harvested from light and motion.  We have built transducers that can convert energy from motion into electrical energy.  These transducers can be made out of certain ceramics, which create electricity when they are bent, or magnets and coils of wire, which create electricity as the magnet moves.  We designed tiny solar cells which can be made right on a computer chip next to all the other circuits.  We also made other chips that can put the electricity produced by these transducers into a form that devices like mobile phones can use.  Because reducing power consumption is such an important problem for society, we made it a focus of two classes (one for undergraduates, the other for graduate students) that are now regularly offered at the University of California, Davis.  As we continue to reduce power consumption andenergy harvesting technology matures, future generations may ask whywe ever needed to replace batteries!
