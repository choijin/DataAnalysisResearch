<AbstractNarration>  &lt;br/&gt;Awodey is requesting funding to send two Ph.D. students in Pure and Applied Logic&lt;br/&gt;at Carnegie Mellon University to a week-long summer school in topos theory.&lt;br/&gt;The school will be held in Belgium, and is partially sponsored by the Department&lt;br/&gt;of Mathematics of the University of Louvain-la-Neuve. In addition&lt;br/&gt;to the PI, several distinguished researchers are participating as instructors.&lt;br/&gt;The primary aim of the meeting is to provide students with an opportunity&lt;br/&gt;to acquire advanced training in topos theory. Topics to be covered include:&lt;br/&gt;general sheaf theory, classifying toposes, descent theory and groupoid representations,&lt;br/&gt;homotopy and cohomology of toposes, algebraic set theory, and&lt;br/&gt;realizability.&lt;br/&gt;The students have successfully completed M.S. studies in Carnegie Mellon's&lt;br/&gt;Logic and Computation program and are now doctoral students in&lt;br/&gt;Carnegie Mellon's PhD program in Pure and Applied Logic. They are&lt;br/&gt;judged to be promising logicians of outstanding ability, in a field that is&lt;br/&gt;under-represented in U.S. logic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topos theory occupies a unique position in mathematics, connecting&lt;br/&gt;logic, topology, and algebraic geometry. The notion of a topos originated&lt;br/&gt;in the Grothendieck school of algebraic geometry as a generalized notion&lt;br/&gt;of "space", but in logic it also subsumes Boolean-valued models, Cohen&lt;br/&gt;forcing, and Kripke semantics, as well as topological and sheaf models. It is&lt;br/&gt;also related to the logical notion of a deductive system of higher-order logic&lt;br/&gt;or type theory.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed project include not only promoting&lt;br/&gt;graduate education, but also enhancing infrastructure for research and&lt;br/&gt;education through international partnerships; and the broad dissemination&lt;br/&gt;of results, enhancing scientific and technological understanding.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
