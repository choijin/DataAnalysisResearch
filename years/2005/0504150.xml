<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to investigate, experimentally, numerically, and analytically, the formation, evolution, and possible control mechanisms of premixed cellular flame patterns.  The proposed approach incorporates ideas and methods at the forefront of dynamical systems theory and equivariant bifurcation analysis with new computational methods.  In particular, the project seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms that govern the flame dynamics as well as understanding the effects of noise on the flame characteristics, including velocity of propagation and flame shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lean premixed combustion is an emergent technology for attaining ultra-low Nitrogen Oxide emissions in advanced gas turbines.  The technology, however, generates cellular flame instabilities that can damage the combustor hardware through overheating or vibration, producing cycle fatigue and worn combustor seals.  Consequently, the task of understanding and controlling cellular flame instabilities is an important problem with a strong potential to reduce environmental impact of combustion.  This research analyzes the mechanisms that govern flame dynamics.  The project will educate graduate students in Applied Mathematics and in Computational Sciences through involvement in the research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
