<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0537160&lt;br/&gt;Sandeep K. Shukla&lt;br/&gt;Virginia Polytechnic Institute @ State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today's computing is no longer limited to servers, work stations and desktop computing, but they are embedded everywhere, most importantly in the medical space, as well as in the safety critical systems such as avionics control, automotive control etc. However, historically hardware and software have been built separately, and both being extremely complex, the methodologies that ensure correct construction of hardware or software are themselves research topics. Yet, we are faced with the need for formal and mathematical techniques to model and analyze systems which integrate both hardware and software,&lt;br/&gt;because of the increasing reliance of human society on ubiquitous and pervasive computing.&lt;br/&gt;In 2003 the First International ACM/IEEE Formal Methods and Models for Co-Design (MEMOCODE) conference, for the first time, brought together researchers who apply formal methods in software engineering fields, and those who apply formal methods to design and validate hardware systems. It was felt by attendees that formal method practitioners from both sides have a lot to share in terms of knowledge, experience and techniques. In 2004 the Second International ACM/MEMOCODE was held in San&lt;br/&gt;Diego, California. It was emphasized that the hardware-software co-design problem imposes an ever than before need for this symbiosis, which was the original aims of creating this series of conferences. More importantly, the US researchers present at the conference last two years felt that there is a lack of research activity in this important area of formal methods in the US, compared to the initiatives and research activities in Europe.</AbstractNarration>
