    <AbstractNarration>0507802&lt;br/&gt;Perry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a twelve-month research fellowship by Dr. Randall S. Perry to work with Dr. Martin D. Brasier at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one-year project will critically test evidence suggested for an early appearance (~3500 Ma) of life on Earth. The PI expects the following outcomes: The morphology of newly discovered phosphatic microtubules- of potential bacterial microboring origin will be micro-mapped and compared to basaltic glass&lt;br/&gt;microborings from the Pacific Ridge and the South Pacific, and mineralogy, elemental chemistry, and isotopes (C , N, S, and O) associated with the microtubules, will be micro-mapped across transmission electron microscope (TEM) wafers prepared using focused ion beam (FIB) (Dualbeam). Wafers will be analyzed using high resolution TEM and using Nano-Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (Nano-SIMS) and Micro-Raman uniquely available at Oxford. This will test the distribution pattern of potential biogenic carbonaceous compounds, of potential bioproducts and isotopic fractionations and especially the presence of any biomineral or organomineral. The research will enable an improved understanding of the environments occupied by early life on Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will be disseminated through a program of public outreach, including articles, lectures, and web pages. Materials appropriate to educators will be made available to the NASA Teaching and learning center at City College of New&lt;br/&gt;York (CCNY)- an outreach resource center for materials on space and early evolution for educators. Faculty from the NASA Center, the Science Department, and the School of Education will collaborate with the applicant to design a workshop for middle school teachers, using information obtained in this project. All useful datasets will be placed in the public domain by submission of results and methods in internationally recognized scientific journals.</AbstractNarration>
