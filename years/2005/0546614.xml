<AbstractNarration>Cryptography is the science of communication in the presence of a potential adversary and is an essential component in computer security.   The past three decades of the study of cryptography continue to have a tremendous impact on society, having enabled, for example, world-wide ATM networks, pay TV, private email, VPNs, and electronic commerce.  This project is developing cryptography that is more user-friendly, fault-tolerant and secure, thus broadening its applicability to our increasingly electronic lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the past study of cryptography, while very successful, has made many implicit assumptions about the environments in which cryptographic constructions operate. Such assumptions often turn out to be untrue in real-life deployments, resulting in serious security&lt;br/&gt;vulnerabilities.  This project focuses on freeing cryptography of the following unrealistic assumptions: that users have uniformly random long keys, which are remembered perfectly, never accidentally disclosed to the adversary, and used in computing devices that leak no information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As just one example, little work has been done on tailoring cryptographic schemes to real users, who cannot remember thousand-bit-long secret keys. Thus, despite all cryptographic achievements, the most commonly used method of user-authentication today is via passwords.  Passwords, as they&lt;br/&gt;are currently used, do not provide good security and inconvenience users unnecessarily.  This project is developing alternatives to passwords that enhance security and user convenience. It is developing means of biometrics identification that do not require storage of the biometric template, thus reducing privacy risks.  It is also studying the possibilities of using small inexpensive hardware tokens for opening virtual doors to those authorized, similarly to how physical keys are used to open physical doors.  This project is also studying techniques that will recover gracefully and automatically from security breaches, such as unauthorized disclosure of passwords or keys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to innovative cryptographic research, the educational components of the project focus on enabling students to think rigorously about computer security and to be able to critically evaluate various (often unjustified) security claims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Cryptography is the science of communication in the presence of a potential adversary and is an essential component in computer security. It has had a tremendous impact on society, having enabled, for example, world-wide ATM networks, pay TV, private email, VPNs, and electronic commerce.  This project developed cryptography that is more user-friendly, fault-tolerant and secure, thus broadening its applicability to our increasingly electronic lives.  More specifically, the project has made advances in the following areas.  AUTHENTICATION AND ALTERNATIVES TO PASSWORDS  Despite all cryptographic achievements, the most commonly used method of user authentication today is via passwords.  Passwords, as they are currently used, do not provide good security and inconvenience users unnecessarily.   This project developed techniques that can be used as alternatives to passwords to authenticate users and devices.  In particular, we showed how noisy data, or data that users cannot recall exactly, can be used securely.  MEASURING AND INCREASING RANDOMNESS  Unpredictable randomness in crucial for security protocols.  Pseudorandomness can often be used as an alternative to randomness. This project developed new ways to measure pseudorandomness and derive pseudorandom bit strings.  ENCRYPTION FOR THE CLOUD  Ideally, we would like our files to be encrypted before they are stored on cloud servers.  However, traditional public-key encryption is not well-suited for the cloud, because it is randomized: the same file can result in multiple different ciphertexts, which makes it hard to search and synchronize multiple devices.  This project developed new techniques for secure deterministic encryption, in which the same file always gives the same ciphertext.  HASH FUNCTION DESIGN  Cryptographic hash functions are used billions of times daily in almost every security application.  The National Institute of Standards has recently announced a replacement hash function standard, as the current one is getting out of date.  This project contributed to the competition that resulted in the new standard.  LEAKAGE-RESILIENT CRYPTOGRAPHY  Most cryptographic models implicitly assume that parties operate as black boxes, with the adversary able to observe only the inputs and outputs. However, because in reality a cryptographic algorithm must be run in a physical device, it is often possible for an adversary to use the physical nature of computation in order to find a weakness in an execution of the algorithm.  For example, researchers have been able retrieve the secret key by measuring power consumed by a smart card, electromagnetic radiation emitted by a circuit, or even sound emanating from the CPU.  (Such extra information is called ``side-channel leakage.'')  This project has developed new ways to model such side-channel leakage and help protect against it.  SIGNATURES FOR INTERNET ROUTING  The current system used to determine routes on the global internet is insecure.  This project helped develop digital signature schemes to secure the internet's routing system.       Last Modified: 01/14/2013       Submitted by: Leonid Reyzin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
