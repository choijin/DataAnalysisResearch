<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funds to support the Second Purdue Minisymposium on&lt;br/&gt;Financial Mathematics, to be held on April 15-16, 2005. A first edition&lt;br/&gt;was held at Purdue University on April 3, 2003, gathering 40 participants.&lt;br/&gt;The planned format for this short conference includes: one afternoon one&lt;br/&gt;morning, with expected attendance 60 to 80 participants; three main&lt;br/&gt;invited one-hour talks, full travel reimbursement for these senior&lt;br/&gt;speakers, 6 invited 25-minute talks, with partial travel reimbursement for&lt;br/&gt;3 junior speakers; modest funds for coffee breaks, and one conference&lt;br/&gt;dinner for invited speakers; partial travel reimbursement for 7 Ph.D.&lt;br/&gt;students or postdoctoral scholars (people who obtained their Ph.D. no more&lt;br/&gt;than 3 years ago), and the possibility to present their work in a poster&lt;br/&gt;session.  The three main speakers will be important researchers in&lt;br/&gt;quantitative finance, known for their world-class work in both theoretical&lt;br/&gt;financial mathematics and applied quantitative finance. The P.I.'s&lt;br/&gt;scientific motivation for the conference includes exposing the&lt;br/&gt;participants to an array of cutting-edge research topics in financial&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, including stochastic volatility in option pricing, American&lt;br/&gt;options, stochastic control and portfolio optimization under partial&lt;br/&gt;information, interacting particle methods in finance, Monte-Carlo&lt;br/&gt;financial simulation techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed conference on Financial Mathematics at Purdue University will&lt;br/&gt;provide evidence to the participants that the interaction between Finance&lt;br/&gt;and Mathematics is bidirectional: beyond receiving answers to its applied&lt;br/&gt;questions, Finance provides great problems for probability theory,&lt;br/&gt;statistical science, and applied mathematics, motivates the development of&lt;br/&gt;new tools of intrinsic mathematical interest, and helps mold and improve&lt;br/&gt;the image and the purpose of Mathematics with the general non-scientific&lt;br/&gt;public. The conference will create an opportunity for the education of&lt;br/&gt;graduate students and beginning researchers with an interest in&lt;br/&gt;quantitative finance, by bringing local Purdue students in contact with&lt;br/&gt;like-minded peers from other academic institutions, by providing role&lt;br/&gt;models -- the main speakers, and by inspiring and uncovering possible new&lt;br/&gt;research topics. The P.I. will encourage underrepresented minorities to&lt;br/&gt;participate in the conference, and will target such groups for financial&lt;br/&gt;support by selecting invited speakers and supported graduate and&lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral participants appropriately.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
