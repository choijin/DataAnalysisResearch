<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research on "Regulation of Polymer Blend Morphology Using &lt;br/&gt;Nanospheres and Nanorods, "aims to understand how phase separation in polymer blend&lt;br/&gt;films affects the dispersion of nanoparticles (NP) and how NP affect phase evolution,&lt;br/&gt;wetting and film stability.  Whereas prior studies focus on neat blends, the current study&lt;br/&gt;will investigate how particle characteristics, in particular, surface chemistry and shape,&lt;br/&gt;influence how NP disperse and organize in a multi-phase morphology.  Nanospheres of&lt;br/&gt;silica and nanorods of CdSe will be investigated.  To control their location, NP are&lt;br/&gt;functionalized by acid-groups, neutral brushes, and attractive brushes.  By tuning the &lt;br/&gt;surface properties, which control partitioning and organization, NP can be driven into one&lt;br/&gt;domain or towards the interface between phases.  The location of NP dictates film&lt;br/&gt;characteristics including wetting layer growth rate, mprphology, phase evolution, and&lt;br/&gt;film stability.  By controlling the location of NP, a new route for engineering phase size is&lt;br/&gt;expected from these systematic studies.  For example, stable biocontinuous structures can&lt;br/&gt;be produced by NP "jamming" resulting in highly efficient photovoltaic devices.  The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research requires a palette of complementary depth and lateral profiling&lt;br/&gt;techniques including ion beam etching combined with scanning electron microscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polymer nanocomposites (PNC) are foundin everyday materials such as tires and&lt;br/&gt;golfballs as well as high technology devices for energy conversion and sensor&lt;br/&gt;applications.  PNC are examples of nano-based materials, which are driving the&lt;br/&gt;revolution in nanotechnology.  This exploding field has received worldwide investments&lt;br/&gt;totaling $8 billion in 2004 with an anticipated impact of $2.6 trillion by 2014.  Although&lt;br/&gt;highly versatile and widely used, a fundamental understanding of PNC is lacking and&lt;br/&gt;basic science is necessary to produce PNC based devises that are reliable, efficient and&lt;br/&gt;economical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the past 3.5 years, this NSF project has provided research training for 25&lt;br/&gt;engineering undergraduates (10 females) and 6 high school teaching (2 female, 2&lt;br/&gt;minority).  Two of these have received NSF Graduate Fellowships.  Lectures about&lt;br/&gt;polymer science to teachers in the Philadelphia School District has lead to great&lt;br/&gt;enthusiasm about developing laboratories for a Science Van that will reach out to &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented nimorites in middle school.  With University encouragement, the &lt;br/&gt;Science Van project is in the planning stages.  International collaborations with scientists&lt;br/&gt;from the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic will provide students with a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding about research in these countries.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
