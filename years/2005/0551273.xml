<AbstractNarration>Poor households in developing countries are subject to considerable risk. Although the&lt;br/&gt;Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH) predicts that households will fully adjust consumption to&lt;br/&gt;changes in permanent income and smooth consumption over changes in transitory income,&lt;br/&gt;evidence suggests that both of these predictions may fail (Paxson, 1992; Fafchamps, Udry, and&lt;br/&gt;Czukas, 1998).&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to identify the specific factors that might prevent households from&lt;br/&gt;smoothing consumption over changes in transitory income and to evaluate the effectiveness of&lt;br/&gt;two interventions designed to facilitate consumption smoothing. This project will focus&lt;br/&gt;specifically upon income shocks caused by household illness.&lt;br/&gt;As credit is rare in developing countries, one obvious reason that households may be unable to&lt;br/&gt;smooth changes in transitory income is that they lack a secure place to save. The first goal of this&lt;br/&gt;project will therefore be to provide a formal savings account to a randomly selected subset of&lt;br/&gt;daily income earners.&lt;br/&gt;Even with formal savings vehicles, however, households may be unable to save transitory income&lt;br/&gt;if their preferences for consumption are time-inconsistent. The second goal of this project will be&lt;br/&gt;to provide one of two types of commitment savings accounts to two randomly selected treatment&lt;br/&gt;groups. The first group will be offered target accounts that will feature a strictly enforced selfchosen&lt;br/&gt;weekly savings goal while the second group will be offered health accounts that will&lt;br/&gt;encourage withdrawals for health expenditures but discourage withdrawals for all other purposes&lt;br/&gt;by introducing relatively large withdrawal penalties for non-health purposes and eliminating such&lt;br/&gt;penalties for health withdrawals.&lt;br/&gt;This project will collect information on a variety of outcomes, including the difference in savings&lt;br/&gt;between the treatment and comparison groups, the difference in the labor supplied between the&lt;br/&gt;groups, and the extent to which the accounts serve to substitute for other, costlier types of income&lt;br/&gt;smoothing (such as choosing to invest in lower-yielding but less risky assets). The most&lt;br/&gt;important outcome, however, will be the differential responsiveness of consumption to transitory&lt;br/&gt;income between the treatment and comparison groups. As this experiment is randomized at the&lt;br/&gt;individual level, the effect of the standard savings accounts can be estimated directly from the&lt;br/&gt;differential responsiveness between the standard savings and comparison groups and the effect of&lt;br/&gt;the commitment savings accounts can be estimated from the differential responsiveness between&lt;br/&gt;the commitment savings and standard savings groups.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This project will be of academic interest for several reasons. First, it will provide experimental&lt;br/&gt;evidence on the specific mechanisms by which the Permanent Income Hypothesis tends to fail.&lt;br/&gt;Second, it will add to the growing literature on the empirical relevance of commitment savings&lt;br/&gt;accounts. Third, it will test the responsiveness of consumption to transitory changes in income&lt;br/&gt;due to health shocks, in contrast to most studies which focus upon shocks to agricultural income&lt;br/&gt;caused by changes in rainfall.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The results obtained from this research could potentially also have valuable policy implications.&lt;br/&gt;First, providing such accounts could represent a novel approach in designing savings accounts in&lt;br/&gt;developing countries and in developing risk-coping mechanisms for poor households. Second, to&lt;br/&gt;the extent that the accounts allow households to medically treat illness and so increase their labor&lt;br/&gt;income, the accounts could represent a specific mechanism for increasing income by improving&lt;br/&gt;health.</AbstractNarration>
