<AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;AAAS proposes to develop a database and an electronic directory that will be the&lt;br/&gt;4 th edition of the Resource Directory of Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities. The&lt;br/&gt;Directory will fill a continuing need of NSF and other Federal agencies, educators,&lt;br/&gt;parents, counselors, disability organizations, and the media to find role models and&lt;br/&gt;existence proofs in all fields of science and engineering, with a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;disabilities. In addition the individuals listed in the Directory will be able to serve as peer&lt;br/&gt;reviewers, consultants, and sources for stories.&lt;br/&gt;AAAS has the only complete repository of this information. Names and contact&lt;br/&gt;information are regularly requested by NSF and the other agencies and organizations. In&lt;br/&gt;the efforts to include underrepresented groups in the STEM workforce, and especially&lt;br/&gt;those groups underutilized because of disabilities, this information is critical.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project will be the research and documentation of&lt;br/&gt;the existence of person with disabilities, currently in the STEM workforce as a crucial&lt;br/&gt;element in diversifying the science and engineering workforce. Recording that persons of&lt;br/&gt;both genders, varied in age, ethnicity, geography, discipline, disability, and educated in&lt;br/&gt;many types of undergraduate and graduate institutions will be a crucial base to change&lt;br/&gt;attitudes and actions about including persons with disabilities in the science and&lt;br/&gt;technology enterprise of the country. It is essential that educators, funders, families, and&lt;br/&gt;counselors capitalize on the experience of these accomplished scientists and engineers to&lt;br/&gt;assist them in opening up STEM education and broadening the participation of persons&lt;br/&gt;with disabilities in STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from the dissemination of the proposed activity&lt;br/&gt;will be advancing the understanding of educators and employers on the possibilities of&lt;br/&gt;STEM education and careers for preschool and precollege students, undergraduates, and&lt;br/&gt;graduate students with disabilities. It will also serve scientists and engineers who become&lt;br/&gt;disabled mid-career, or acquire a chronic disability by making it possible for them to&lt;br/&gt;connect with other scientist with related experiences. It will contribute to overturning&lt;br/&gt;traditional stereotypes of persons with disabilities as to career and occupational&lt;br/&gt;limitations that exclude science, engineering, and technical fields. The listings will be a&lt;br/&gt;first step in identifying and contacting potential advisors and collaborators from all fields&lt;br/&gt;of science and a wide range of disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;Annual updating of the database will ensure the freshness and sustainability of the&lt;br/&gt;information and will encourage others to come forward and share information.</AbstractNarration>
