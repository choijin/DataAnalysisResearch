<AbstractNarration>REU Site: Research Experiences in Computer Science for Students at Undergraduate Institutions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will encourage students enrolled at undergraduate institutions to pursue graduate study and research careers in Computer Science by involving them in a ten week, team-oriented, summer research experience.  The research projects are drawn from a number of important fields of Computer Science, including pen-based computing, computer supported cooperative work, assistive technology (text navigation for the visually impaired), natural language processing (text summarization), functional programming languages, programming pedagogy, and virtual reality.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faculty mentors will sponsor orientation activities to help students appreciate the nature of research and the value of working cooperatively. Students will be encouraged to collaborate formally and informally; this will be facilitated by having the students live in University housing.  Students will present their work to other participants in the REU program, as well as externally.  Finally, students will have the chance to learn about the graduate school application process in part by visiting a major research university.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will encourage a diverse group of undergraduates to consider attending graduate school and embarking on research careers.  This addresses the important national need of attracting a diverse group of students to research-oriented science careers.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
