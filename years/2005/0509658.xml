<AbstractNarration>0509658&lt;br/&gt;H. M. Nepf&lt;br/&gt;Spatial heterogeneity in water temperature, and thus density, will drive horizontal flows&lt;br/&gt;that carry fluxes between chemically distinct regions of a surface water body. The spatial&lt;br/&gt;gradients in water temperature may arise from differences in water depth or differences in&lt;br/&gt;light penetration. For example, a spatially uniform heat flux causes the temperature&lt;br/&gt;within a shallow region to rise and fall more rapidly than an adjacent deep region. It is&lt;br/&gt;now well recognized that the resulting buoyancy-driven exchange between the littoral&lt;br/&gt;and pelagic zones plays an important role in setting lake-scale chemistry and ecology.&lt;br/&gt;The presence of emergent and submerged aquatic vegetation is a common feature of&lt;br/&gt;the littoral region, yet only a handful of studies have considered the impact of vegetation&lt;br/&gt;on littoral-pelagic exchange. Because vegetation provides significant drag, it can modify&lt;br/&gt;the thermally-driven exchange current. Indeed, a scale analysis presented in the proposal&lt;br/&gt;shows how vegetation can control the rates of exchange. In addition, by partially or fully&lt;br/&gt;shading regions of the water column, the presence of both emergent and submerged&lt;br/&gt;vegetation can produce temperature gradients that drive flow between the vegetated&lt;br/&gt;region and the open water. Because a distinct bio-chemical environment often exists&lt;br/&gt;within the vegetated zone, these exchange flows provide an important hydrodynamic link&lt;br/&gt;between biologically and chemically distinct regions of surface water.&lt;br/&gt;To fully evaluate the impact of these flows on lake-scale chemistry and ecology, one&lt;br/&gt;must be able to predict their frequency, duration and spatial footprint. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;project will provide this predictive ability. A series of laboratory experiments have been&lt;br/&gt;designed to observe the formation and magnitude of thermally-driven exchange flows&lt;br/&gt;between open water and water with vegetation of different morphology. The velocity&lt;br/&gt;field will be measured using digital particle imaging velocimetry (DPIV). Both emergent&lt;br/&gt;and submerged vegetation canopies will be considered. Further, the depth of heat&lt;br/&gt;penetration will be varied using water colorant to block more deeply penetrating&lt;br/&gt;wavelengths.&lt;br/&gt;The results of the proposed work will enable researchers and lake managers to make&lt;br/&gt;better evaluations of how changes in the littoral zone, e.g. due to land development, may&lt;br/&gt;impact the hydrodynamic link between the littoral and pelagic regions, and thus may&lt;br/&gt;impact the lake-scale nutrient budget and ecology.</AbstractNarration>
