<AbstractNarration>     The investigator studies mathematical models for interfacial&lt;br/&gt;phenomena.  The objective is to provide a systematic study for&lt;br/&gt;multi-phase transitions based on both existing and newly developed&lt;br/&gt;models.  These are macroscopic free boundary models, based on&lt;br/&gt;observable quantities and needed to deal with singularities due to&lt;br/&gt;topological changes of free boundaries, and microscopic continuum&lt;br/&gt;models, derived at the molecular level and (always) well-posed. &lt;br/&gt;One goal of the project is to derive critical information from&lt;br/&gt;continuum models for free boundary models when the latter become&lt;br/&gt;indeterminate.  Another is to develop new microscopic continuum&lt;br/&gt;models for phase transitions among phases such as solid/liquid and&lt;br/&gt;different grains in polycrystals.  The project is aimed at the&lt;br/&gt;fusion of mathematics and material science and new developments&lt;br/&gt;for systems of differential equations.  The main tools used here&lt;br/&gt;are theories of partial differential equations, singular&lt;br/&gt;perturbations, asymptotic expansions, complex analysis,&lt;br/&gt;bifurcation, center manifolds, global analysis, dynamical systems,&lt;br/&gt;and geometric measure.  Computational simulations are used to&lt;br/&gt;stimulate, validate, and further extend theoretical conclusions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The interfacial phenomena studied in this project are&lt;br/&gt;commonplace in nature.  They occur whenever there is a continuum&lt;br/&gt;that can exist in at least two different phases and there is some&lt;br/&gt;mechanism that generates a spatial separation of these phases. &lt;br/&gt;The spatial boundaries that separate these phases, referred to as&lt;br/&gt;interfaces or free boundaries, evolve with time due to some&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms of transitions between phases.  A typical two-phase&lt;br/&gt;transition is a solidification process of a liquid.  A classical&lt;br/&gt;multi-phase transition arises from evolutions of grains in a&lt;br/&gt;polycrystal where alignments of atoms in different grains do not&lt;br/&gt;match at grain boundaries.  The growth of a solid polycrystal from&lt;br/&gt;a liquid involves a two-phase transition between liquid and solid&lt;br/&gt;and a multi-phase transition among grains.  The use of microscopic&lt;br/&gt;continuum models to study phase transitions has undergone a strong&lt;br/&gt;development in recent years, but major advances have been made&lt;br/&gt;mostly in the case of two-phase transitions.  This project focuses&lt;br/&gt;on multi-phase transitions.  These problems motivate new&lt;br/&gt;theoretical development in free boundary problems, systems of&lt;br/&gt;parabolic/elliptic partial/ordinary differential equations, and&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems.  Part of the project, involving the Riemann&lt;br/&gt;mapping theorem, is integrated into a graduate/undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;course on complex analysis to provide students with a real-life&lt;br/&gt;application of mathematical theory in material science.  In&lt;br/&gt;addition, graduate students are involved in the project.  New&lt;br/&gt;models developed here provide scientists with tools in&lt;br/&gt;understanding and designing new materials.</AbstractNarration>
