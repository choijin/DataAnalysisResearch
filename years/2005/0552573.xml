<AbstractNarration>The REU program at the Department of Mathematics, Missouri State University (MSU) will consist of three eight-week long research projects in the summers of 2007, 2008, and 2009 in the fields of algebra, &lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, numerical analysis and differential equations.  Each year, it will provide opportunities for nine undergraduate students from Missouri and neighboring states, especially for those from institutions &lt;br/&gt;where opportunities for undergraduate research are limited. At least two thirds of these students will be selected from outside the host institution.  Participating students must be juniors or seniors with a &lt;br/&gt;minimum GPA of 3.25 in mathematics, and they must be US citizens or permanent residents. Missouri State University believes a rich diversity of people and points of view enhances the quality of learning; special &lt;br/&gt;consideration will be given to students coming from traditionally underrepresented groups.  To this end, the support of the Office of Equal Opportunity, the Minority Student Office, and the Multicultural Resource &lt;br/&gt;Center at the host institution will be critical. Campus visits to undergraduate institutions and those that serve underrepresented groups will be an important part of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigators strongly believe that training undergraduate students for research is an invaluable investment.  The main goals of this program are to involve students in an active research group, to help them develop their full potential for rigorous research and independent thought, and to encourage them to pursue graduate studies.  To ensure a degree of program cohesiveness, the first two weeks will be devoted to short courses providing a common background to all participants followed by mid-summer and end-of-program presentations to all members of the project.  The Principal Investigators consider assessment and follow-up activities to be very important components of the project.  Dr. Gary Brinker of the Center for Social Sciences and Public Policy Research (MSU) will evaluate the project.  The Principal Investigators will maintain contact with participants after they complete the summer program.  They will also track the students' careers after graduation to provide feedback and measure the success of the program. &lt;br/&gt;Upon the successful completion of the REU summer program, the Principal Investigator will design a course on undergraduate research to be regularly offered during the academic year.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
