<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title:  Support for the 2005 North American Membrane Society Meeting&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: CTS-0517537&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  John Pellegrino&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of Colorado&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this travel grant is to provide stipends for graduate students and&lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral fellows to present their research at the 16th Annual Meeting of the North American Membrane Society (NAMS) in June 2005. The meeting will have 24 technical sessions covering the spectrum of leading-edge fundamental and applied membrane science and technology. The meeting will feature two plenary lectures and 20 keynote lectures to bring the latest developments in the field to this meeting. Additionally, four technical workshops will be offered just prior to the beginning of the meeting. These workshops are effective avenues to learn about fundamentals and advanced research topics in key areas of membrane science from leading academic and industrial practitioners. Membrane researchers from all parts of the world representing industry, government and academic facilities will participate. This meeting is the principal scientific meeting for American researchers working in the area of membrane science and technology. In addition, this year's meeting will reinstate a previous special session on University-Industrial Interactions. This venue provides the opportunity for a  dialog on the strengths and weaknesses of current membrane science and technology between researchers and practitioners.  The meeting has been announced worldwide through a series of fliers, and it is being advertised in the Journal of Membrane Science, the North American Membrane Society's Membrane Quarterly, and their European, Japanese, and Korean counterparts. Information about the meeting is also available on the Internet at www.membranes.org.  In terms of the broader impacts, the support will permit students to participate in a national meeting.  Many students as well as senior researchers present their work in posters, and the less formal atmosphere of this session typically stimulates meaningful discussions between students and leaders in the field.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
