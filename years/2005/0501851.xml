<AbstractNarration>Through a 2+2 partnership, students at Normandale Community College are able to complete the prerequisites for the Minnesota State University, Mankato elementary education program.  The Math-Science Education Training Academy (EdTrAc) is  preparing students to become highly qualified K-8 teachers and strengthening Normandale's role in K-8 education.  The project addresses state and national needs for:   &lt;br/&gt;- highly qualified teachers with solid content knowledge of the subjects they teach, &lt;br/&gt;- more teachers well-prepared in math and science, &lt;br/&gt;- encouragement, support, and retention of prospective and pre-service teachers, &lt;br/&gt;- teachers from underrepresented populations and teachers who are effective with diverse student bodies, and &lt;br/&gt;- coursework that keeps pace with changes taking place in K-8 school curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;The project is developing a physics course based on standards for pre-service teachers and a technology for mathematics course to prepare future teachers in the judicious and creative use of new technologies in the classroom. Recruitment work with high schools in area school districts seeks to publicize the elementary education program as a career choice.  A Teachers of Tomorrow Club is providing contacts with professional organizations and other future-teachers groups.  An Ambassador Outreach Program enlists faculty members to advise pre-service teachers, observe clinical experiences, and build relationships with K-8 classroom teachers.   Student Cohorts of preservice teachers are established based on core coursework and students' interest in a math or science middle school specialty.  Talented math or science students from &lt;br/&gt;partner high schools and students from Normandale who are interested in teaching are serving as tutors.   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
