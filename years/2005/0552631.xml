    <AbstractNarration>Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project objectives are to broaden participation in computing doctoral&lt;br/&gt;programs by providing a year-round research experience that will immerse&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates into the activities and culture of a research lab. The activities&lt;br/&gt;include a summer research experience and an academic year experience&lt;br/&gt;introducing students to computing research methodologies and a broad array of&lt;br/&gt;computing research disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will receive support from peer and faculty mentors. Students will&lt;br/&gt;take a GRE prep course and will be shown how to apply to and succeed in&lt;br/&gt;graduate school. The targeted student participants are women and&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minority students who are rising juniors,&lt;br/&gt;predominantly from non-doctoral institutions. The intended impact is that a high&lt;br/&gt;number of REU students will apply to computing doctoral programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NTELLECTURAL MERIT &lt;br/&gt;Project merit resides in the contributions to computing research that will be&lt;br/&gt;produced by the undergraduate students participating in the REU Site.&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the program evaluation will inform efforts to recruit undergraduate &lt;br/&gt;students to doctoral programs by demonstrating the success and challenges of this&lt;br/&gt;REU Site structure for motivating students to apply to doctoral programs in computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT &lt;br/&gt;The PIs anticipate increased numbers of students from underrepresented populations in&lt;br/&gt;computing who successfully participate in research and who apply to and are accepted into graduate &lt;br/&gt;programs in computing.</AbstractNarration>
