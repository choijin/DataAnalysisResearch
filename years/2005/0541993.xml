<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Red Raider Mini-Symposium, November 17-19, 2005 : "Geometry, Statistics &lt;br/&gt;and Image Analysis" focuses on nonparametric statistics on manifolds,&lt;br/&gt;analyzes on shape spaces, saddlepoint approximations and systems&lt;br/&gt;theory leading to frontiers of science in medical imaging, system&lt;br/&gt;reliability, survival analysis, pattern recognition and&lt;br/&gt;bioinformatics. Principal speakers are Rudy Beran, University of&lt;br/&gt;California Davis, internationally renowned for his contributions&lt;br/&gt;to robust statistics, directional data analysis, and&lt;br/&gt;bootstrapping; Rabindra Bhattacharya, University of Arizona,&lt;br/&gt;internationally renowned for his contributions to large sample&lt;br/&gt;theory, Edgeworth expansions and bootstrapping, statistics on&lt;br/&gt;manifolds and stochastic partial differential equations; Ronald&lt;br/&gt;Butler, Colorado State University, internationally renowned for&lt;br/&gt;his contributions to saddlepoint methods, systems theory and&lt;br/&gt;stochastic networks, special function approximations, robustness&lt;br/&gt;and likelihood inference; John Kent, University of Leeds, United&lt;br/&gt;Kingdom, internationally renowned for his contributions to&lt;br/&gt;multivariate statistics, shape analysis and stochastic models for&lt;br/&gt;protein structure, robustness, spatial statistics, tomography;&lt;br/&gt;Peter Kim, University of Guelph, Canada, internationally renowned&lt;br/&gt;for his contributions to the interface between geometry and&lt;br/&gt;statistics, density estimation on Riemannian manifolds and&lt;br/&gt;applications of statistics to image acquisition, Madan Puri,&lt;br/&gt;Indiana University, internationally renowned for his contributions&lt;br/&gt;to nonparametric statistics, splines, tests of normality, fuzzy&lt;br/&gt;sets and measures, stochastic processes, statistics of directional&lt;br/&gt;data, random sets, and time series and Anuj Srivastava, nationally&lt;br/&gt;renowned for his contributions to "image understanding" which aims&lt;br/&gt;to develop automated systems that can match human abilities in&lt;br/&gt;analyzing images.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium is conceived to bring together outstanding researchers&lt;br/&gt;working in the interface of geometry, statistics and image&lt;br/&gt;analysis and consists of a series of lectures by outstanding&lt;br/&gt;scholars in vibrant areas of mathematics and statistics, with&lt;br/&gt;important applications in astronomy and geophysics, homeland&lt;br/&gt;security, medical imaging, computer vision and pattern&lt;br/&gt;recognition. These lectures provide an opportunity to learn about&lt;br/&gt;new research venues for the members of the statistical community,&lt;br/&gt;especially early career researchers and graduate students&lt;br/&gt;including women and under represented minorities. This&lt;br/&gt;mini-symposium provides a perfect medium for interaction and&lt;br/&gt;collaboration between the conference participants and the&lt;br/&gt;distinguished speakers. It will be very helpful for shaping future&lt;br/&gt;directions of statistical research that address problems of high&lt;br/&gt;societal impact.</AbstractNarration>
