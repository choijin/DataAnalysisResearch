<AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed support of the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC). The Center collects, preserves, reproduces and distributes diverse seed and DNA stocks of the flowering plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. The ABRC provides access to lists of its stocks and other materials online, and uses a forms-based online ordering system to minimize the difficulty of identifying and ordering seeds and DNA reagents. Since the ABRC was established in 1991, Arabidopsis has become the model species of choice for basic studies of flowering plants. The ABRC serves a dynamic community of plant researchers involved in cutting-edge biology that impacts the fundamental understanding of the basic functioning of plants as well as applied research aimed at crop improvement. The value of the collection has been enhanced by the completion of the sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome, and demand for the services of the ABRC is expected to grow as interest in functional genomics increases.  On an annual basis, the Center currently distributes approximately 70,000 seed and 24,000 DNA stocks to about 2,500 scientists worldwide. This award will provide 55% of the ABRC's operating budget, with the remainder coming from user fees and institutional support.</AbstractNarration>
