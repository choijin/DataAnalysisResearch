<AbstractNarration>The investigator will develop particle simulation techniques for vortex sheet motion in &lt;br/&gt;two- and three-dimensional fluid flows. Vortex sheets are weak solutions of the ideal fluid equations &lt;br/&gt;in which the vorticity is concentrated on a surface and they are widely used in fluid dynamics to &lt;br/&gt;represent thin shear layers in slightly viscous flow. Vortex sheet simulations encounter severe difficulties &lt;br/&gt;due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, singularity formation, and chaotic dynamics, but the investigator has &lt;br/&gt;shown that these difficulties can be overcome by regularizing the Biot-Savart kernel in the equation &lt;br/&gt;governing the motion of material points on the sheet surface. The present project extends the capability &lt;br/&gt;of these regularized particle simulations by developing an improved treecode algorithm for evaluating &lt;br/&gt;the Biot-Savart integral, and adaptive quadrature and particle insertion schemes to maintain resolution &lt;br/&gt;as the sheet rolls up. In contrast to other approaches using spherical harmonics, the present treecode &lt;br/&gt;algorithm uses Taylor approximations in Cartesian coordinates which provides more flexibility and enables &lt;br/&gt;the method to be applied to nonharmonic functions such as the regularized Biot-Savart kernel. &lt;br/&gt;The quadrature and insertion schemes to be developed will make essential use of the Lagrangian &lt;br/&gt;sheet parameterization. The investigator will perform particle simulations of vortex ring dynamics and will &lt;br/&gt;compare the results to laboratory experiments and direct numerical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations.  Other topics to be studied include high precision computation of spiral formation in the Kelvin-Helmholtz problem, and extension of the present techniques to density-stratified flow. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer simulation is a well established tool in basic and applied research in all areas of science &lt;br/&gt;and engineering. For example, automobile manufacturers, as well as pharmaceutical companies, &lt;br/&gt;routinely use computer simulations in the design of new products. A successful computer simulation relies &lt;br/&gt;on several components: a mathematical model of the physical problem, numerical algorithms for &lt;br/&gt;implementing the model on a computer, and computer hardware to perform the simulation. &lt;br/&gt;The present project focuses on the first two components by developing better models and algorithms &lt;br/&gt;for the computer simulation of fluid flows which are dominated by vortices. Vortices in air or water are &lt;br/&gt;usually invisible, but they can exert strong forces on nearby solid structures. One example is the trailing &lt;br/&gt;vortex wake behind an airplane which is responsible for the lift of the airplane, but also poses a hazard &lt;br/&gt;for nearby aircraft. In crowded urban airports with few runways, it is often necessary for an airplane to &lt;br/&gt;wait several minutes before taking off, to ensure that the wake of the preceding aircraft has dissipated &lt;br/&gt;to a safe level. The present investigation will contribute better algorithms for simulating the trailing wake &lt;br/&gt;which can be used by aeronautical engineers in designing methods to enhance wake dissipation &lt;br/&gt;and reduce takeoff delays. The algorithms developed in this project are also applicable to evaluating &lt;br/&gt;electrostatic forces at the molecular level, a generic computational problem with many potential &lt;br/&gt;applications in areas such as chemistry and plasma physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
