<AbstractNarration>The University of Michigan, Western Michigan University, Michigan State&lt;br/&gt;University and Wayne State University propose to establish the Michigan-Louis Stokes&lt;br/&gt;Alliances for Minority Participation (MI-LSAMP) in order to significantly increase the&lt;br/&gt;quantity and improve the quality of students earning science, technology, engineering and&lt;br/&gt;mathematics (STEM) baccalaureate degrees from our institutions, and increase the&lt;br/&gt;number of under-represented minority (URM) students interested in, academically&lt;br/&gt;qualified for and matriculated into graduate study programs. The MI-LSAMP partners are&lt;br/&gt;recognized as isflagshipld institutions in the State of Michigan and represent the diversity&lt;br/&gt;of public Doctoral Research Extensive institutions in the nation. While the UM, MSU,&lt;br/&gt;WSU and WMU have demonstrated a deep commitment to increasing the diversity and&lt;br/&gt;excellence of their student bodies and have had long-standing collaborations with one&lt;br/&gt;another, they realize that the greatest gains will be achieved by formally allying. The&lt;br/&gt;mission of the MI-LSAMP not only supports the National Science Foundations strategic&lt;br/&gt;goal to help create ira diverse, competitive and globally-engaged U.S. workforce of&lt;br/&gt;scientists, engineers, technologists, and well-prepared citizens,lr it supports goals set forth&lt;br/&gt;by the Michigans Cherry Commission on Higher Education and Economic Growth.ln&lt;br/&gt;The overall goals for the MI-LSAMP are to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Significantly increase the number of URM students earning baccalaureate degrees&lt;br/&gt;from MI-LSAMP partners. An aggressive but balanced plan has been devised to&lt;br/&gt;increase the number of URM students earning baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields&lt;br/&gt;by 50% in 5 years, and 100% in 10 years. Programmatic activities focus on&lt;br/&gt;increasing the recruitment of new and transfer URM students, and increasing their&lt;br/&gt;graduation rates as a consequence of participation in Science, Engineering and Math&lt;br/&gt;Pre-First Year programs, research projects sponsored by the Michigan Undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;Research Consortium, internships and co-ops, and residential learning programs.&lt;br/&gt;2. Institutionalize MI-LSAMP strategies and practices. Programmatic activities will be&lt;br/&gt;evaluated and the most effective and efficient of these will be institutionalized in an&lt;br/&gt;effort to sustain, beyond the NSF funding period, growth in the number of URM&lt;br/&gt;students earning STEM degrees. In addition, MI-LSAMP offices, drop-in centers and&lt;br/&gt;learning centers will become permanent fixtures on each of the alliance campuses.&lt;br/&gt;3. Contribute to a significant increase in the number of under-represented minority&lt;br/&gt;students earning baccalaureate degrees in the State of Michigan and nationally.&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of project will result in nearly a 50% increase in the number of&lt;br/&gt;URM students earning baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields within the State of&lt;br/&gt;Michigan. iiBest practicesla of the MI-LSAMP will be attractive for adoption and&lt;br/&gt;could significantly improve national efforts to increase production in the STEM&lt;br/&gt;fields.&lt;br/&gt;4. Increase the number of students pursuing advanced degrees in STEM fields. The MI-&lt;br/&gt;LSAMP will collaborate with the Michigan AGEP Alliance (MAA), a recently&lt;br/&gt;established partnership of the same institutions, to ensure that students earning&lt;br/&gt;baccalaureate degrees are prepared for, and aware of opportunities to pursue&lt;br/&gt;advanced studies in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit and broader impact of this project goes beyond increasing the&lt;br/&gt;number of URM students graduating in STEM fields and dissemination of effective and&lt;br/&gt;efficient MI-LSAMP programs. The MI-LSAMP will expand outreach to the pre-college&lt;br/&gt;community, increase the persistence of STEM majors, increase faculty involvement in&lt;br/&gt;mentoring URM students, promote collaboration among faculty at Michigan institutions&lt;br/&gt;of higher education, and increase the diversity of our communities and workforce.</AbstractNarration>
