<AbstractNarration>The rapid pace of genomics research, the reporting of that research by media, and the translation of research into medical and public health technologies, has a significant effect on our perceptions of racial and ethnic identity.  It is essential that we understand these current and potential effects if we are to guide the research and its applications in ways that help and do not harm society.  We intend to create and sustain a research community to further the understanding of the societal implications of genomic research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A year-long series of monthly seminars will study the impact of genomics research and technology as agents of change on perceptions held by individuals and groups regarding racial and ethnic identity and the implications of these changes for society.  A core group of three senior investigators and an additional 10-12 participants will include senior and junior level faculty representing a variety of disciplinary backgrounds in the life sciences and social sciences, who have pursued research and teaching relevant to the seminar series theme.  Each seminar will be led by one of the senior level faculty participants, with background readings selected in advance.  Several ad hoc participants will be invited to each seminar, based upon their expertise and interest in the specific topic to be discussed.  Written proceedings will be prepared after each seminar, and a volume will be prepared at the end of the series to include the individual proceedings and an introductory chapter identifying common and contrasting themes and findings and recommendations for future research and teaching.  The sequence of topics to be discussed and faculty to lead each seminar will be selected with a dual purpose:  (1) to broaden and deepen the understanding of the way genomic research and technology are changing societal views of race and ethnicity, and (2) to develop new collaborative relationships among scholars leading to future transdisciplinary research.  The Life Sciences and Society Program of the University of Michigan, sponsor of the seminars, will provide broad dissemination of the seminar proceedings and will continue to support and expand the resulting research community through seed grants supporting pilot research projects and partnerships, development of race/ethnicity curricula, and guest lectures.</AbstractNarration>
