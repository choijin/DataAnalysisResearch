<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0504202&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Wolfgang Ziller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will continue his work on manifolds&lt;br/&gt;with non-negative and positive sectional curvature.  In this&lt;br/&gt;subject, which has been studied extensively in the early years of&lt;br/&gt;global Riemannian geometry, only few obstructions are known, the&lt;br/&gt;major one being Gromov's Betti number theorem. On the other hand&lt;br/&gt;there are also very few known examples, mainly arising by taking&lt;br/&gt;quotients of left invariant metrics by a group of&lt;br/&gt;isometries. Recently significant progress has been made by&lt;br/&gt;studying positively curved manifolds under the presence of a&lt;br/&gt;large group of isometries, partly in the hope of finding good&lt;br/&gt;candidates for new examples of this type. We recently obtained a&lt;br/&gt;partial classification of positively curved cohomogeneity one&lt;br/&gt;manifolds, i.e. manifolds where a group acts isometrically with&lt;br/&gt;one dimensional quotient. In this classification one is left with&lt;br/&gt;a very interesting sequence of 7-manifolds which are,&lt;br/&gt;surprisingly, connected to self dual Einstein metrics and&lt;br/&gt;3-Sasakian geometry. We plan to investigate whether these&lt;br/&gt;manifolds carry a metric with positive curvature. For&lt;br/&gt;non-negatively curved cohomogeneity one manifolds there are many&lt;br/&gt;examples, constructed by the author in previous grant proposals,&lt;br/&gt;including some on exotic spheres. On the other hand the author&lt;br/&gt;also showed that the exotic Kervaire spheres cannot carry such&lt;br/&gt;metrics. This makes a classification of non-negatively curved&lt;br/&gt;manifolds a very interesting although difficult question, which&lt;br/&gt;the authors plans to investigate in the future.  We also plan to&lt;br/&gt;study geometric and topological properties of the known examples&lt;br/&gt;of manifolds with positive, or more generally non-negative&lt;br/&gt;sectional curvature. As a next step, we plan to study positively&lt;br/&gt;curved manifolds with low cohomogeneity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the round sphere of constant positive curvature is the&lt;br/&gt;simplest and most symmetric Riemannian manifold, it is natural to&lt;br/&gt;ask what manifolds carry metrics with similar geometric&lt;br/&gt;properties, i.e. metrics with positive curvature. This fits into&lt;br/&gt;the natural question of what global consequences one can derive&lt;br/&gt;under local geometric assumptions, a major area of global&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian geometry. A basic unsolved question is whether exotic&lt;br/&gt;spheres, i.e. manifolds that look like spheres but on which&lt;br/&gt;ordinary calculus is quite different, can carry positively curved&lt;br/&gt;metrics.  Symmetries are an important aspect of many geometric&lt;br/&gt;questions and the principal investigator plans to study manifolds&lt;br/&gt;with positive or more generally non-negative curvature under the&lt;br/&gt;presence of a large symmetry group. One of the goals of this&lt;br/&gt;investigation is the search for new examples.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
