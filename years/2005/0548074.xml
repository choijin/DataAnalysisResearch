<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, this CAREER award adresses multi-electron transfer processes in nanoscale systems.  The goal of this work, carried out by Professor Obare and her coworkers at Western Michigan University, is to design, synthesize and characterize nanoscale multi-electron transfer catalysts.  Using stopped flow kinetic measurements, coupled with radical clock methods, the complex flow of electrons in these transfer catalysts are being examined.  The work provides a unified framework for multi-electron transfer at the nanoscale, which will impact both fundamental scientific understanding and applications in solar energy conversion, electrocatalysis, and photonics.  A well integrated program to incorporate this research into the education of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students is underway, and will result in the dissemination of information about nanomaterials and nanoscience and engineering to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrating research into the transfer of electrons in nanoscale composite materials with the education of graduate, undergraduate and high school students is the goal of this CAREER award supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  Information obtained from these studies of multi-electron transfer will be useful in the rational design of energy conversion devices and electrocatalytic systems.  Broad interaction with local schools and community institutions promise to extend the impact of this research in the development of an informed public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
