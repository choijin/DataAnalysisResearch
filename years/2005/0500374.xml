<AbstractNarration> &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The super representation theory is traditionally regarded as fairly different from &lt;br/&gt;the usual one for Lie algebras largely because the Weyl group for a simple Lie &lt;br/&gt;superalgebra does not suffice to control the structures of the irreducible representations. &lt;br/&gt;The PI intends to formulate and establish a new direct link, termed as super duality, &lt;br/&gt;between the representation theories of Lie superalgebras and of Lie algebras. The &lt;br/&gt;super duality asserts certain equivalences of module categories in a suitable infinite limit &lt;br/&gt;and the identification of the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for Lie superalgebras and Lie&lt;br/&gt;algebras. A main algebraic tool is a Fock space formulation of the Kazhdan-Lusztig &lt;br/&gt;theory. The super duality is expected to provide a new approach toward the &lt;br/&gt;Kazhdan-Lusztig type conjectures on irreducible characters for module categories over &lt;br/&gt;simple Lie superalgebras of various types and for module categories over quantum &lt;br/&gt;supergroups at roots of unity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are different manifestations of symmetries in nature, which one can find in, &lt;br/&gt;for example, a circle, a sphere, or one of the five regular polyhedra, and others. &lt;br/&gt;The mathematical language used to describe symmetries often involves the concept &lt;br/&gt;of groups or their infinitesimal counterparts such as Lie algebras. Representation &lt;br/&gt;Theory is a way of studying the groups and Lie algebras by expressing them in &lt;br/&gt;terms of matrices. On the other hand, different symmetries can be related to each &lt;br/&gt;other. In search for a unified theory of everything, physicists have proposed&lt;br/&gt;String Theory as a candidate theory. Supersymmetry adds another invisible &lt;br/&gt;dimension to such considerations and the study of Lie superalgebras is crucial to &lt;br/&gt;understanding the supersymmetry. Our project on Super Duality can be regarded &lt;br/&gt;as providing a precise and new way of relating supersymmetry to symmetry in the &lt;br/&gt;usual sense. This helps to provide a convincing evidence supporting the idea of &lt;br/&gt;supersymmetry and may have applications to String Theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
