<AbstractNarration>Gordan Savin is continuing his work on algebraic aspects of analysis,&lt;br/&gt;with applications in number theory. The main tools of this research are&lt;br/&gt;minimal representations (discovered&lt;br/&gt;by Kazhdan and Savin) which have been successful in dealing with certain&lt;br/&gt;aspects of Langlands conjectures.&lt;br/&gt;Indeed, several instances of Langlands conjectures, out of&lt;br/&gt;reach of standard methods, can be obtained through&lt;br/&gt;use of minimal representations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis, broadly defined, deals with&lt;br/&gt;functions satisfying certain differential equations. Analysis of&lt;br/&gt;differential equations, in general, is a very hard problem. For example,&lt;br/&gt;differential equations coming from the dynamics of fluids are notoriously&lt;br/&gt;difficult. One possible reason for this is a lack of symmetries. On the&lt;br/&gt;other hand, if there are plenty of symmetries to work with, then&lt;br/&gt;the corresponding analysis is easier, since algebraic tools can be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research deals precisely with situations&lt;br/&gt;when a large group of symmetries is present. The main purpose&lt;br/&gt;of this research is to construct small representations of&lt;br/&gt;groups of Lie type. Smallness, roughly speaking, refers to the fact that&lt;br/&gt;it is possible to combine together many symmetries acting on a&lt;br/&gt;relatively small space.&lt;br/&gt;Importance of having small representations&lt;br/&gt;can be illustrated  with the following example.&lt;br/&gt;One of the most famous (and most notorious) groups is the Reisz-Fischer&lt;br/&gt;Monster. Yes, this group is huge and hence its name,&lt;br/&gt;but the size is not the main difficulty&lt;br/&gt;here. The main problem is the lack of small representations.&lt;br/&gt;Indeed, the group of permutations of 60 letters - nobody would consider&lt;br/&gt;this group a ``monster'' - is in fact bigger then the Riesz-Fischer&lt;br/&gt;Monster. However, this group of permutations can be written down&lt;br/&gt;(i.e. represented) by means of&lt;br/&gt;60 by 60 matrices. The monster, on the other hand, requires use of&lt;br/&gt;(roughly) 2000 by 2000 matrices. It is our hope that the small&lt;br/&gt;representations will be a fruitful tool that can be used to answer&lt;br/&gt;some relevant questions in analysis and number theory.</AbstractNarration>
