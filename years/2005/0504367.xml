<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0504367&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Charles P. Boyer and Krzysztof Galicki&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professors Boyer and Galicki propose to investigate several&lt;br/&gt;projects in geometry and topology. The objective of all the&lt;br/&gt;projects is to study fundamental questions in Riemannian Geometry&lt;br/&gt;with two main focal points: Contact Geometry of orbifold bundles&lt;br/&gt;over Calabi-Yau and Fano varieties and the existence of some&lt;br/&gt;special (i.e., Einstein, positive Ricci curvature, transversely&lt;br/&gt;Calabi-Yau) metrics on such spaces.  The questions and problems&lt;br/&gt;proposed here are deeply rooted in the principal investigators'&lt;br/&gt;earlier work which exploited a fundamental relationship between&lt;br/&gt;contact geometry of Sasakian-Einstein spaces and two kinds of&lt;br/&gt;Kaehler geometry, namely Q-factorial Fano varieties with&lt;br/&gt;Kaehler-Einstein orbifold metrics with positive scalar curvature,&lt;br/&gt;and Calabi-Yau manifolds with their Kaehler Ricci-flat&lt;br/&gt;metrics. Most recently the principal investigators and J. Kollar&lt;br/&gt;have solved an open problem in Riemannian geometry. We have&lt;br/&gt;proved the existence of Einstein metrics on exotic spheres in a&lt;br/&gt;paper to appear in the Annals of Mathematics.  Furthermore, we&lt;br/&gt;have shown that odd dimensional homotopy spheres that bound&lt;br/&gt;parallelizable manifolds admit an enormous number of Einstein&lt;br/&gt;metrics. In fact, the number of deformation classes as well as&lt;br/&gt;the number of moduli of Sasakian-Einstein metrics grow double&lt;br/&gt;exponentially with dimension.  The techniques used by the&lt;br/&gt;principal investigators borrow from several different fields; the&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry of Mori theory and intersection theory, the&lt;br/&gt;analysis of the Calabi Conjecture, and finally the classical&lt;br/&gt;differential topology of links of isolated hypersurface&lt;br/&gt;singularities. These methods can be extended much further and in&lt;br/&gt;various directions.  More generally the principal investigators&lt;br/&gt;want to address several classification problems concerning&lt;br/&gt;compact Sasakian-Einstein manifolds in dimensions 5 and 7.  These&lt;br/&gt;two dimensions are important for two separate reasons.  In view&lt;br/&gt;of earlier work higher dimensional examples can be constructed&lt;br/&gt;using the join construction. At the same time these two odd&lt;br/&gt;dimensions appear to play special role in Superstring Theory. In&lt;br/&gt;the context of recent developements in String and M-Theory the&lt;br/&gt;principal investigators also propose to investigate some related&lt;br/&gt;problems concerning self-dual Einstein metrics in dimension 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics is the foundation upon which our modern technology is&lt;br/&gt;built, and much of its understanding and development must preceed&lt;br/&gt;technological progress.  Nevertheless, our research into a&lt;br/&gt;particular type of geometry is closely linked to some important&lt;br/&gt;problems in modern Theoretical Physics and should provide an&lt;br/&gt;important mathematical basis for their understanding. For&lt;br/&gt;example, the mathematical models that we are studying are&lt;br/&gt;currently being used in supersymmetric string theory which is a&lt;br/&gt;model for the unification of gravity with the other fundamental&lt;br/&gt;forces of nature. This also has applications to the Physics of&lt;br/&gt;black holes.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
