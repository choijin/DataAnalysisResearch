<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0503868&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Stephen S.T. Yau&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research proposal contains projects in five areas: (1)&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental problem in CR geometry, (2) Explicit computation of&lt;br/&gt;CR automorphism groups, (3) Simultaneous embedding problem for a&lt;br/&gt;CR family of compact CR manifolds, (4) Deformation of CR&lt;br/&gt;manifolds and deformation of isolated singularities, (5)&lt;br/&gt;Holomorphic De Rham cohomology and complex Plateau problem. Yau&lt;br/&gt;introduces a new Bergman function for any strongly pseudoconvex&lt;br/&gt;complex manifold, which is invariant under biholomorphic maps. He&lt;br/&gt;intends to use this Bergman function to study the CR equivalent&lt;br/&gt;problem of strongly pseudoconvex CR manifolds lying on the same&lt;br/&gt;variety with isolated normal singularities. He developed a new&lt;br/&gt;technique to define a continuous numerical invariant on strongly&lt;br/&gt;pseudoconvex CR manifolds lying on the same variety. He shows&lt;br/&gt;that his invariant varies continuously in R when the CR structure&lt;br/&gt;of strongly pseudoconvex CR manifold changes in the variety. Yau&lt;br/&gt;observes that his new Bergman functions put a lot of restriction&lt;br/&gt;on biholomorphic maps between strongly pseudoconvex CR manifold,&lt;br/&gt;from which the automorphism groups of the CR manifolds can be&lt;br/&gt;determined explicitly. He illustrates how this works in a&lt;br/&gt;concrete example. The proposed work in (3) builds on his joint&lt;br/&gt;work with Xiaojun Huang and Hing Sun Luk on simultaneous&lt;br/&gt;embedding of CR manifolds. It will be done in collaboration with&lt;br/&gt;Xiaojun Huang. They intend to use their prior work on further&lt;br/&gt;extensions to study the most subtle problem on simultaneous&lt;br/&gt;embedding of 3-dimensional CR manifolds. Yau plans to use the&lt;br/&gt;techniques developed in (1) and (3) above to understand the&lt;br/&gt;relation between the Kuranishi family of CR manifolds and versal&lt;br/&gt;deformation of isolated normal singularities in a more concrete&lt;br/&gt;manner. Finally the work in (5) is part of Yau's ongoing project&lt;br/&gt;on holomorphic De Rham cohomology and complex Plateau problem. He&lt;br/&gt;has shown that the vanishing of holomorphic De Rham cohomology of&lt;br/&gt;the CR manifold X gives a lot of restriction on the singularities&lt;br/&gt;of the variety which X bounds. He plans to use his result to&lt;br/&gt;solve the clasical complex Plateau problem for 3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;strongly pseudoconvex CR manifolds in 3-dimensional complex&lt;br/&gt;Euclidean space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research proposal has an important theme of unifying&lt;br/&gt;different fields such as CR Geometry, Complex Analysis,&lt;br/&gt;Singularities Theory and Algebraic Geometry together. The&lt;br/&gt;philosophy and technique of the proposal will also be useful in&lt;br/&gt;biotechnology. With the completion of human genomic sequence, it&lt;br/&gt;is an urgent task to accurate identify protein coding regions&lt;br/&gt;(exons) from genomic sequence. Similar to Yau's proposal, one can&lt;br/&gt;try to find numerical characters of exons which introns do not&lt;br/&gt;have. In this way, one may be able to identify all possible human&lt;br/&gt;proteins. The next important task is to predict the properties of&lt;br/&gt;these newly discovered proteins. Using the similar technique&lt;br/&gt;developed in Yau's proposal, one may able to represent each&lt;br/&gt;protein as a point in certain n-dimensional space.  Proteins&lt;br/&gt;which are closed to each other in this space should have similar&lt;br/&gt;properties. In this way, one can predict some properties of newly&lt;br/&gt;found proteins. Biologists can do experiment to verify these&lt;br/&gt;properties.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
