<AbstractNarration>The probe afforded by a beam of linearly-polarized photons allows &lt;br/&gt;one to gain access to several observables in photonucleon reactions, &lt;br/&gt;which otherwise would not be measureable.  This polarization axis &lt;br/&gt;of the photon beam breaks the azimuthal symmetry of the reaction, &lt;br/&gt;thereby introducing an azimuthal dependence in the differential &lt;br/&gt;cross section.   This additional information on the angular dependence &lt;br/&gt;opens the door to the measurement of a host of observables which are &lt;br/&gt;accessible only with a beam of linearly-polarized photons; consequently &lt;br/&gt;it provides important constraints on the nature of the photon-nucleon &lt;br/&gt;reaction.   Such polarization observables are necessary for extracting &lt;br/&gt;the spin/parity of the broadly overlapping baryon resonances.  Two PhD &lt;br/&gt;students at Idaho State University will analyze the g8b data set from &lt;br/&gt;Hall B of JLab.  Their thesis topics will primarily focus on the search &lt;br/&gt;for baryon resonances (N*s) that decay though either the rho meson or &lt;br/&gt;hyperon channel, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has been very active in coordinating research efforts with nuclear &lt;br/&gt;physicists in Latin America.  Over the past six years, he has been awarded &lt;br/&gt;five NSF grants, which serve to promote dialog among faculty members and &lt;br/&gt;students of North American and South American institutions.  Through these &lt;br/&gt;efforts, he seeks to strengthen existing links and forge new ones within &lt;br/&gt;the broad scope of the international nuclear physics community.  Such &lt;br/&gt;academic relationships, moreover, will further serve to strengthen the &lt;br/&gt;scientific research program between our respective continents.  The PI &lt;br/&gt;expects to use this NSF award as a platform towards attracting additional &lt;br/&gt;grant money for these broader impact activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
