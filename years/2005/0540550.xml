<AbstractNarration>The rapid and enormous improvements in sensing, control, high-performance computing, and communications have led to an explosion of potential applications of robotics, the study of machines with sensing, intelligence and mobility. These new applications present an exciting array of fundamental challenges that will shape both the research agenda and the technology to be developed in robotics. This project seeks funding to host a demonstration of significant accomplishments, which will be an opportunity to articulate the achievements of the community to scientific peers and the news media. It is timed to coincide with the presentation of a worldwide study partially sponsored by NSF, assessing the state-of-the-art in robotics science, technology and practice, internationally. The workshop will identify the significant accomplishments in robotics research and the potential for growth in this emerging industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this 2005 PI Demo Workshop is to bring together several PIs currently funded by the National Science Foundation In the area of robotics to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Present the research issues that are fundamental for further progress; specify areas where major breakthroughs appear possible; and identify research initiatives and facilities needed.&lt;br/&gt;2. Demonstrate current research results and significant accomplishments.&lt;br/&gt;3. Provide an opportunity to NSF program officers, other foundations and funding agencies, and industry representatives to learn more about the current research efforts and successes of projects funded by NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will create demonstrations which will archived in on-line as well as other tape media format. It will also articulate the challenges and achievements of the robotics field to the broader community, which spans high school students to the general public. The PI Demo Workshop will promote the benefits of robotics research in other sciences and the society in general.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
