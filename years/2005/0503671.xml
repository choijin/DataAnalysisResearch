<AbstractNarration>Summary &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;A workshop is proposed to discuss the scope and goals of developmental physiology, and to identify the scientific opportunities for investment in this emerging field at the interface of developmental biology and physiology.  This workshop will be held on November 15 and 16, 2004, at the Holiday Inn, Arlington ,VA. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit      &lt;br/&gt;Developmental biologists have, for many years, focused their efforts in understanding embryonic development by selecting a relatively few model organisms that are genetically tractable, and that can be used to study the fundamental processes of development at the genetic, molecular and cellular levels.  These efforts have often led to a detailed understanding of the genetic mechanisms that are involved in the control of &lt;br/&gt;many processes in embryonic development.  Developmental physiologists, on the other hand, have focused on postembryonic development and have been reluctant to adopt use of a relatively few model species, in part because the physiological principles that bind the science cohesively, such as the regulation and control of function, are known to differ between species.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;It is becoming increasingly clear that genetic and physiological approaches to development are complementary, and that a full understanding of development, arguably the most complex problem in biology, will require a research program that integrates both approaches.  The workshop brings together biologists with acknowledged expertise in the area of developmental physiology with biologists who practice modern developmental genetics, and with biologists who work in evolutionary developmental biology.  These &lt;br/&gt;participants will help to identify and frame the current scope and future goals of the field of developmental physiology and to identify the opportunities for research in this important emerging field at the interface of developmental biology and physiology.   The primary aim of this workshop will be to explore the many aspects of developmental physiology and to develop an organized and coherent set of goals for research in &lt;br/&gt;developmental physiology.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together researcher from many different disciplines to discuss the goals of developmental physiology and to determine how best to integrate developmental physiology with other approaches to understanding animal development.  These discussions will result in the formulation of a broad and coherent set of recommendations for research in this rapidly growing field of biology.  This workshop is &lt;br/&gt;therefore expected to have a substantial impact on research at the interface of physiology and development, and will be an aid in developing an effective infrastructure for this rapidly growing field. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
