<AbstractNarration>0510054&lt;br/&gt;Martin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. It has been recognized recently that the flow field of karst&lt;br/&gt;aquifers includes conduits, fractures, and intergranular porosity of the matrix and that full&lt;br/&gt;characterization of flow requires understanding flow in each component, coupling&lt;br/&gt;between the components, and how water recharges to the aquifer from the surface. Most&lt;br/&gt;well-studied karst aquifers have low intergranular porosity where diffuse flow is confined&lt;br/&gt;to a network of fine fractures surrounding conduits. In contrast, this proposed work&lt;br/&gt;centers on the Floridan aquifer, which retains high (up to ~20%) intergranular matrix&lt;br/&gt;porosity. Previous work on physical hydrogeology (discharge measurements,&lt;br/&gt;temperature tracing of flow rates, observations of hydraulic head), suggests that water&lt;br/&gt;exchanged between conduits and the matrix of the Floridan aquifer is controlled by&lt;br/&gt;reversals in head gradients between the matrix and conduits as a result of high allogenic&lt;br/&gt;input into the conduit system. The previous work has not quantified contributions from&lt;br/&gt;diffuse recharge from the surface, the magnitude of exchange between the conduits and&lt;br/&gt;matrix, the residence time of water that exchanges, or chemical modifications of the&lt;br/&gt;aquifer through dissolution reactions. Consequently, this proposed project will determine&lt;br/&gt;coupling between aquifer components and water sources by integrating new chemical&lt;br/&gt;measurements with previously used physical observational techniques.&lt;br/&gt;The field area will be the Santa Fe Sink/Rise system in north-central Florida.&lt;br/&gt;Observations to be made will include major element and isotope compositions of water&lt;br/&gt;from nested new and existing wells and lysimeters (soil water samplers) for ground water&lt;br/&gt;characterization, from the River Sink, Rise, and karst windows for characterization of&lt;br/&gt;conduit water, and from precipitation for characterization of the input sources. The&lt;br/&gt;chemical measurements will provide flow velocities to be compared with head gradients&lt;br/&gt;between the conduits and the matrix and saturation states with respect to carbonate and&lt;br/&gt;silicate minerals. The nested wells and data on chemical composition of precipitation&lt;br/&gt;will allow characterization of vertical differences in water chemistry to determine&lt;br/&gt;magnitudes of diffuse recharge from the surface. These data will be compared to other&lt;br/&gt;karst aquifers with low intergranular porosity using available deterministic models such&lt;br/&gt;as chemograph separation. Comparisons will also be made to results of previous and ongoing&lt;br/&gt;studies of other regions of the Floridan aquifer. Because of the higher&lt;br/&gt;transmissivity of the highly porous Floridan aquifer, it is anticipated that the intergranular&lt;br/&gt;porosity component will play a large role in the overall flow field of the aquifer.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. This work should improve the understanding and&lt;br/&gt;management of karst aquifers that have significant portions of their flow within matrix&lt;br/&gt;porosity. These aquifers commonly represent major water resources, but have previously&lt;br/&gt;been managed using conceptual models that consider either flow primarily through&lt;br/&gt;conduits or treat the system as an equivalent porous medium. In particular, these results&lt;br/&gt;will be directly applicable to management of the Floridan aquifer and results will be&lt;br/&gt;disseminated to critical water managers through Martin's participation in the Florida&lt;br/&gt;Springs Task Force. Human resources will be impacted through graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate education, both formally as a resource for currently taught courses and&lt;br/&gt;through graduate student theses. One second-year PhD student is currently working on&lt;br/&gt;this topic as part of his dissertation, and two masters students and several undergraduates&lt;br/&gt;will participate in the field, laboratory, and analytical work.</AbstractNarration>
