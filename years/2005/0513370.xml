<AbstractNarration>A diverse range of applications, from organic electronic devices and sensors to coatings&lt;br/&gt;and patterning, rely on the properties and performance of polymers under various conditions of&lt;br/&gt;confinement, particularly thin film geometries. Generally, interactions between polymer chain&lt;br/&gt;segments and interfaces impose enthalpic and entropic penalties on the chain structure, and these&lt;br/&gt;effects may be manifested in properties at length scales beyond the size of a chain, up to tens of&lt;br/&gt;nanometers (nano-scale). Properties such as the viscosity, chain diffusion coefficients, D,&lt;br/&gt;glass transition temperatures, Tg, phase separation temperatures of mixtures and copolymers, as&lt;br/&gt;well as morphological instabilities are known to exhibit film thickness dependencies. To date, a&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive understanding of such size-dependent phenomena in polymers remains elusive.                          &lt;br/&gt;The foregoing provides the basis for three problems examined in this proposal. (1) One&lt;br/&gt;goal is to understand how interfacial forces influence the chain dynamics and to understand the&lt;br/&gt;connections between chain dynamics and the film thickness dependent changes exhibited by the&lt;br/&gt;Tg in homopolymer and in miscible polymer-polymer systems. The strategy of our proposed&lt;br/&gt;experiments is predicated largely on the notion that the glass transition is a manifestation of&lt;br/&gt;underlying dynamical features in the system. (2) We also plan to examine how the concentration&lt;br/&gt;and spatial organization of nanoparticles affect the morphological stability, chain diffusion and&lt;br/&gt;average Tg of polymer-based nanocomposite thin film systems. (3) Finally, we examine the role&lt;br/&gt;of interfacial energetics and intermolecular interactions on the late-stage (coarsening) structural&lt;br/&gt;evolution in unstable and metastable thin polymer films on substrates.                                                                 &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: In simple liquids, the relation between diffusion and viscosity is&lt;br/&gt;established within the context of the Stokes-Einstein equation. With regard to bulk long-chain&lt;br/&gt;polymeric melts, the Doi-Edwards theory describes the interrelation between diffusion and&lt;br/&gt;various viscoelastic processes exhibited by these materials; the temperature dependence is&lt;br/&gt;understood in terms of the WLF (or equivalently the Vogel-Fulcher) equation. In thin films,&lt;br/&gt;however, the situation is unclear. Through a series of experiments, guided by predictions based&lt;br/&gt;on simulations and theory, connections between the thickness dependent quantities are examined&lt;br/&gt;for thin film polymer-polymer mixtures. The second part of this proposal is devoted to&lt;br/&gt;developing an understanding of the influence of polymer/nanoparticle interactions on the glass&lt;br/&gt;transition and on dynamics (segmental dynamics and morphological instabilities) in thin film&lt;br/&gt;polymer-nanoparticle nanocomposites. Questions regarding the effect of interfaces, coupled with&lt;br/&gt;size-scale dependencies, are unresolved, though simulations suggest strategies to examine them.&lt;br/&gt;Our goal for the third problem, is the development of an understanding of the role of interfacial&lt;br/&gt;energetics and intermolecular interactions on late-stage coarsening processes in morphologically&lt;br/&gt;unstable and metastable thin , supported, polymer films.                                                                                       &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This is an interdisciplinary program cross-cutting different fields, from&lt;br/&gt;physical chemistry of surfaces (wetting and self-organization), processing of thin films&lt;br/&gt;(morphological stability, viscosity, glass transition) to two dimensional coarsening phenomena&lt;br/&gt;(an issue also of interest for the processing thin films for microelectronics and is part of the&lt;br/&gt;broader ubiquitous phenomenon of coarsening). While it is true that we now understand a great&lt;br/&gt;deal about how to tailor properties of bulk polymers through blending etc. we are at a stage of&lt;br/&gt;infancy with regard to thin films. The thickness dependencies of the phase transitions, selfassembly&lt;br/&gt;and various morphological changes that result from the actions of intermolecular forces&lt;br/&gt;are endemic. An understanding of these issues will help us to develop new rules to design or to&lt;br/&gt;tailor properties of thin films for various applications. Clearly, the questions addressed in this&lt;br/&gt;proposal have scientific and technological implications. Students participating in this project&lt;br/&gt;develop an interdisciplinary background in areas that range from physics, materials and chemistry&lt;br/&gt;to engineering.</AbstractNarration>
