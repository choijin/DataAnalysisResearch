    <AbstractNarration>P.I.: Dove Bradshaw &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0537066&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artist, Dove Bradshaw continues her distinguished, Six Continents exhibition of sculptures made from local water and foreign salt. The artist, considered a major force in the development of the artistic concept of "indeterminacy", has chosen to use water and salt as materials because of their physical, symbolic properties. The artist states, "Their significance is clear --- wherever they occur there is life. Since the physical properties of salt are intimately tied to locale and symbolically in order that the entire planet be represented, the structure was set to include the six continents." Given the significance of salt from each continent, Antarctic salt is vital to round out the Six Continents sculptural exhibition. For this project the artist will not deploy to Antarctica, but will be supplied with Antarctic salt, collected from the desalinization plant at McMurdo Station.&lt;br/&gt;The artists has had numerous solo and group exhibitions. Her current work, Six Continents had its first show in the Larry Becker Gallery in Philadelphia in June 2003 and has since been shown in the Solway Jones Gallery in Los Angeles on October of 2005. The show will open at a permanent site at the Palazzo Durini, Bolognano in October of 2006. For more information about the artist and her work, visit: www.dovebradshaw.com.</AbstractNarration>
