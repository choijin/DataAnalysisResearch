    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will involve quantum confining a single atom in 2 to 5 nm size nanocrystal of ternary semiconductor, from which new and efficient nanophosphors will be developed. The band-gap engineering of nanophosphors allows improvement in the luminescence characteristics such as absorption and emission spectra, half-width, efficiency, life-time, etc. Indeed the role of conventional activators (rare-earths and transition metal impurities) in nanophosphors can be re-evaluated for different applications. Specifically, ternary wide band gap semiconductors such as ZnCdS with dopants like Ag, Cu, Mn offer very efficient broad-band visible spectra that is close to white light. The possibility of band-gap engineering in nanocrystals of ternary semiconductors, similar to that catapulted the optoelectronic devices from III-V semiconductors, opens the door to design of new nanophosphors that match well with the excitation spectra of LED's and compact fluorescent lamps. This development would lead to a new class of white light sources in this Phase II project. By developing different nanophosphors that can be excited by blue/UV LEDs, it successfully demonstrates that nanophosphors can significantly enhance the performance of not only white LEDs but also can improve the performance of compact fluorescent and arc lamps. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially this technological breakthrough of engineering of nanophosphors when used with current efficient lamps, is expected to enhance the efficiency of LED's by 40% and lamps by 15%, respectively. These improvements in overall power efficiency of these lamps, will significantly lower the cost of energy used and it is projected will help to save energy costs equivalent to $25 billion by 2025.</AbstractNarration>
