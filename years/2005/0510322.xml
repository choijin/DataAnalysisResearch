<AbstractNarration>0510322&lt;br/&gt;Zhang&lt;br/&gt;Groundwater recharge (R) from precipitation and discharge to rivers as baseflow (BF) are two of the main&lt;br/&gt;processes in the basin-scale water cycle. These processes vary with time and space. Effective management&lt;br/&gt;of water resources requires deep understanding of these processes. Due to the lack of data or the&lt;br/&gt;difficulties in measuring R and BF, however, our current knowledge and understanding of these complex&lt;br/&gt;processes are very limited, especially about their temporal and spatial variations. Various assumptions are&lt;br/&gt;made about spatial variations of R in existing studies and little attention has been given to temporal&lt;br/&gt;variations of R and BF. While it is difficult to measure R and BF, it is relatively easy to measure the water&lt;br/&gt;levels in observation wells (h) and runoff in rivers. Extensive groundwater level data sampled at various&lt;br/&gt;time intervals over periods of years or decades are often available. Fluctuations of the water table in a&lt;br/&gt;groundwater system are dynamic responses of the system to its recharge and discharge, and thus contain&lt;br/&gt;significant amount of information about the recharge and discharge. Our preliminary analyses of the&lt;br/&gt;observed water levels in seven monitoring wells at the Walnut Creek watershed of Iowa indicate that&lt;br/&gt;fluctuations of the groundwater levels is a temporal fractal whose fractal dimension (D) varies spatially.&lt;br/&gt;Baseflow from this and other four watersheds also behaves as a temporal fractal and, more importantly,&lt;br/&gt;has a transition time or break in scaling.&lt;br/&gt;Our objectives are: 1) to determine existence of fractal scaling of groundwater level and baseflow and&lt;br/&gt;their relationship with recharge; 2) to identify physical causes behind fractal scaling; 3) to study the effects&lt;br/&gt;of aquifers' physical heterogeneity on fluctuations of groundwater level, recharge, and discharge and on&lt;br/&gt;their scaling, and 4) to investigate the nature of groundwater recharge process. These objectives will be&lt;br/&gt;reached by testing six hypotheses. These hypotheses will be tested by collecting and analyzing the longterm&lt;br/&gt;groundwater level measurements in 42 monitoring wells in 6 groundwater regions and the&lt;br/&gt;streamflow at 58 gauge stations in 11 hydrological units over a period of 50 - 100 years at the USGG&lt;br/&gt;website, and by conducting an integrated hydrologic modeling (IHM), stochastic analyses, and numerical&lt;br/&gt;simulations. With data mining we will use the extensive data collected by USGS over the years to identify&lt;br/&gt;the existence of the temporal scaling. With IHM we will be able to assess impacts of temporal and spatial&lt;br/&gt;variations of P, ET, and ? on fluctuations of h and BF. With stochastic analyses and numerical&lt;br/&gt;simulations, we will investigate effects of spatial variations of aquifers' physical properties on the&lt;br/&gt;temporal variations of h and BF and their scaling as well as the nature of R process.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits. The most important merits of this research are to find the temporal scaling of h&lt;br/&gt;and BF and to provide physical causes behind the scaling. Temporal scaling of h may be pervasive in&lt;br/&gt;many aquifers as we show in this proposal by the spectra of the longest water level data in 14 USGS wells.&lt;br/&gt;There may be a simple explanation for the scaling: fluctuations of groundwater levels are due to various&lt;br/&gt;contributing hydrological variables (e.g., P, ET, and ?) with differing time and/or spatial scales. As a&lt;br/&gt;result, there is no characteristic time scale in the head fluctuations! We are anxious to do further&lt;br/&gt;investigation. Whether processes in the natural world are dependent or independent of the scale at which&lt;br/&gt;they operate is one of the major issues in hydrologic science . (Sposito, 1998). There has been a significant&lt;br/&gt;effort in searching for scaling in hydrology since an invariance property across scales as a fundamental&lt;br/&gt;should guide data analysis and modeling methods (NRC, 1991). Significant progresses in searching spatial&lt;br/&gt;scale invariance have been made during the last decade in hydrology. However, less attention was given to&lt;br/&gt;temporal scaling of subsurface hydrological variables. We have proposed a relatively new direction of&lt;br/&gt;stochastic research, as summarized by the panel on the original proposal, and are trying to make a forward&lt;br/&gt;step in application of stochastic approaches. The broad impacts include: 1) use of abundant groundwater&lt;br/&gt;level and streamflow data in trying to understand the patterns of temporal variations of h and BF make the&lt;br/&gt;methods and results of the proposed research widely applicable, 2) the proposed research is closely related&lt;br/&gt;to the NSF initiative: Water Cycle Research, 3) the knowledge obtained in this research is needed in longterm&lt;br/&gt;management and planning of water resources and in dealing with climate changes, 4) A current Ph.D.&lt;br/&gt;student is working on this topic. Two new students (one graduate and one undergraduate) will participate&lt;br/&gt;in this project if the proposal is funded, 5) Several publications are expected from this research as two&lt;br/&gt;papers have been written (one published and another submitted recently) based on our preliminary results.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, we want to say that addressing the comments made by the reviewers and panel on the original and&lt;br/&gt;second-submission of this proposal has greatly improved the proposal.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
