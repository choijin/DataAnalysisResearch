<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The East African Rift System (EARS) is the only place on the planet &lt;br/&gt;where the geochemical and isotopic compositions of continental mafic &lt;br/&gt;lavas spanning 40 million years of volcanism can be studied.  This &lt;br/&gt;geochemical information must be used in conjunction with modern &lt;br/&gt;geophysical and seismic information to address fundamental geodynamic &lt;br/&gt;questions about the relationship between features of the deep Earth &lt;br/&gt;and those at the surface. We focus on the evolution of upper mantle &lt;br/&gt;temperature and composition by using numerical models of limited &lt;br/&gt;mantle depth extent. Geological and geochemical observations in the &lt;br/&gt;EARS provide strong constraints on the timing and location of melt &lt;br/&gt;formation in the mantle. The dynamical modeling provides the ability &lt;br/&gt;to predict the formation of melt in a self-consistent manner and make &lt;br/&gt;quantitative estimates of the temperature, depth and rate of melting. &lt;br/&gt;We will also pursue a comprehensive geochemical study of select &lt;br/&gt;MgO-rich EARS basalts. New geochemical and isotopic (Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf-He) &lt;br/&gt;data, coupled with existing data from the literature, will be used to &lt;br/&gt;define the distribution of chemically distinct reservoirs that &lt;br/&gt;sustain EARS magmatism. Trace element and isotope geochemical data &lt;br/&gt;enable refinement of the compositional structure of the upper mantle &lt;br/&gt;and will help constrain reasonable dynamical models. Our main &lt;br/&gt;hypothesis is that one or more plumes bring hot material from the &lt;br/&gt;Earths interior to melt below the EARS lithosphere, since we find it &lt;br/&gt;difficult to understand how long-lived and voluminous volcanism can &lt;br/&gt;be generated without such deep transport. A sensitivity study will &lt;br/&gt;allow us to estimate whether and how non-plume models can predict the &lt;br/&gt;timing and location of melt generation observed in the EARS. For &lt;br/&gt;plume models, we will assess a variety of dynamical scenarios by &lt;br/&gt;incorporating tracer techniques to test whether the observed &lt;br/&gt;distribution of geochemical signatures and volumes of magmatic &lt;br/&gt;products along the EARS can be satisfied with a single &lt;br/&gt;compositionally heterogeneous plume. The resulting dynamical models &lt;br/&gt;will enhance our understanding of the origin of the EARS, the African &lt;br/&gt;superswell and eventually the African superplume. The collaboration &lt;br/&gt;between geochemists with mutually supporting areas of expertise &lt;br/&gt;(Furman  trace element geochemistry, Bryce  lithophile radiogenic &lt;br/&gt;isotope geochemistry, Graham  helium isotope geochemistry) and a &lt;br/&gt;geophysicist / numerical modeler (van Keken) will provide a &lt;br/&gt;much-needed interaction between observational and theoretical &lt;br/&gt;efforts.  The results of the work will be incorporated into &lt;br/&gt;residential and electronic delivery courses at the participating &lt;br/&gt;universities, including several Historically Black Colleges and &lt;br/&gt;Universities. We will support graduate students at Penn State, &lt;br/&gt;Michigan and New Hampshire, introducing this next generation of &lt;br/&gt;scientists to interdisciplinary research and collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
