<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports fundamental theoretical research and education in condensed matter physics on the nanoscale and on quantum coherence control. Research will be focused on (i) nonequilibrium superfluidity beyond the adiabatic regime, (ii) corruption of quantum states in nanoscale solid-state devices, and (iii) superconducting pairing near the superconductor-insulator transition. The PI aims to develop reliable theories of these phenomena and to verify them by detailed quantitative comparison with experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the research component includes:&lt;br/&gt;. systematic identification of the strengths and limitations of existing qubit designs,&lt;br/&gt;. developing the fundamentals of the theory of decoherence due to interaction with spin-like environments,&lt;br/&gt;. developing a microscopic theory of superconductivity near the superconductor-insulator transition, which explains and predicts a range of unusual phenomena in disordered superconductors,&lt;br/&gt;. Developing a comprehensive theory of non-stationary Cooper pairing beyond the adiabatic regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of superfluidity and superconductivity, and nanoscale physics provides excellent educational and outreach opportunities. The PI plans to develop a graduate course on mesoscopic and nanoscale physics and an outreach program: "The Promise of Physics on the Nanoscale." The outreach program, designed in collaboration with the PI's colleagues in science pedagogy, aims to nurture an appreciation of modern nanophysics in secondary school and undergraduate classrooms with a view towards creating a more scientifically literate general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports fundamental theoretical research and education in condensed matter physics on the nanoscale and quantum coherenece control.  One focus of this work lies in the study of how particular quantum mechanical states can be created and manipulated.  The states themselves occur in nanoscale superconductors, trapped ultracold atoms, and strongly correlated electron materials, and their nature is of fundamental scientific interest in their own right. This effort focuses, in part, on understanding such states, which open potential technological gateways, for example, new paradigms in computing. Another focus of this work is to advance understanding of the physical mechanisms that can defeat a device that exploits the manipulation of quantum mechanical states for its operation. The PI will focus on states made from electron spins, which are regarded as among the most promising for quantum computation in solid-state materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of superfluidity and superconductivity, and nanoscale physics provides excellent educational and outreach opportunities.
