    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0505835&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Xiaobo Liu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These projects emphasize Gromov-Witten invariants of compact&lt;br/&gt;symplectic manifolds, relations in the tautological rings of&lt;br/&gt;stable curves, and interactions of these topics with integrable&lt;br/&gt;systems. Roughly speaking, primary Gromov-Witten invariants&lt;br/&gt;count numbers of pseudo-holomorphic curves in compact symplectic&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. A larger class of invariants, called descendent&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten invariants, can be defined by taking into&lt;br/&gt;consideration powers of first Chern classes of some tautological&lt;br/&gt;line bundles over the moduli space of pointed pseudo-holomorphic&lt;br/&gt;maps. In the case when the manifold is a point it was&lt;br/&gt;conjectured by Witten and proved by Kontsevich that descendant&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten invariants are governed by the KdV hierarchy from&lt;br/&gt;integrable systems. The principal investigator is pursuing&lt;br/&gt;generalizations of the Witten conjecture and the Virasoro&lt;br/&gt;conjecture on by studying universal equations which come from&lt;br/&gt;relations in the tautological rings of the moduli spaces of&lt;br/&gt;stable curves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric descriptions of classical or quantum mechanical systems&lt;br/&gt;are based in symplectic geometry, which takes as its basic&lt;br/&gt;measurement the area of two-dimensional surfaces. The&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten invariants of a symplectic manifold can be&lt;br/&gt;described as a family of number that count the number of surfaces&lt;br/&gt;of a nice sort that satisfy certain constraints, such as&lt;br/&gt;intersecting specified subsets of the manifold. Enumerative&lt;br/&gt;invariants of this kind are an ancient concern in algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry, where we count the number of solutions to a system of&lt;br/&gt;equations, and the subject was recently found to be connected to&lt;br/&gt;high energy physical theory, where the partition functions of&lt;br/&gt;certain quantum systems on a manifold have been found to be&lt;br/&gt;related to generating functions that collect families of&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten invariants into a manageable form.</AbstractNarration>
