<AbstractNarration>Twin Cities Public Television is producing a new national initiative, the "Science Center Showcase" (SCS) for DragonflyTV, the weekly science television series targeted at children ages 9-12.  The initiative will entail six new episodes presenting children engaged in inquiry-based investigations, on-location in science centers across America.  The series presents authentic inquiry-based investigations, created by and for children.  The programs focus on children doing their own scientific investigations and sharing the excitement that comes from making their own discoveries.  Each investigation will demonstrate the direct connection between learning experiences in science centers and the application of those lessons in everyday experience.  The SCS will involve ten or more science center partners, and be coordinated with the assistance of lead partners, ASTC and the Science Museum of Minnesota.  Multimedia Research and RMC Research will conduct formative and summative evaluations, respectively. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SCS model combines DragonflyTV's unique strengths in media with the rich resources of the nation's science centers.  For informal science professionals, the SCS will define new ways media and museum professionals can work together and learn from each other.  It will also provide new opportunities for partnerships and collaboration between public television stations and science centers across the country.  For the television audience, the programs will demonstrate the richness and variety of sciences experiences for kids in science centers and beyond.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through new collaborative efforts with ASTC, the Science Museum of Minnesota, and other science centers, the DragonflyTV's "Science Center Showcase" project has the potential to communicate to a national television audience the richness and variety of engaging opportunities for authentic STEM inquiry that are available for young people at science centers across the country.  The project also has the potential to a) contribute to research into how knowledge is transferred from science centers to experiences in the natural world, and b) educate exhibit developers and television professionals in new approaches to informal science education. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
