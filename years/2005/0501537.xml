<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is the fabrication and study of Nonlinear-Mixing Lasers: a new type of mid/far-IR semiconductor lasers based on the original concept of difference-frequency generation by two self-generated optical fields in a composite, dual-wavelength laser cavity. Injection-pumped lasers with two vertically stacked active regions separated by thin tunnel junction that enables current flow through active regions in series will be developed. The edge-emitting and vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers will be implemented, as well as lasers with two butt-joint optically-coupled diodes. The concept of nonlinear self-mixing has been already demonstrated in our prior work using butt-joint lasers as well as quantum cascade lasers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The dual wavelength laser will be based on the all-epitaxial, lithographically-defined fabrication technique. Due to the nonlinear, inversionless nature of difference-frequency generation, the laser threshold is effectively defined by a low threshold for lasing on the interband transitions. Thus, the proposed laser is expected to have a low threshold current density, which enables stable continuous-wave room-temperature operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Nonlinear-Mixing Lasers combine unique features of standard near-IR diode lasers (high compactness, reliability, continuous-wave room-temperature operation, low threshold injection pumping, high efficiency) with possibility of a widely tunable operation in the mid/far-IR range, including THz range and atmospheric transparency windows. Due to this combination, and the lack of commercially available continuous-wave room-temperature semiconductor lasers in this range, they hold promise to find a wide range of highly demanded applications in pollution monitoring, defense, wireless communications, security systems, chemistry, biology, and medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have strong broader impacts. Two graduate students will be involved in the project on a permanent basis and supported by the grant. The proposed collaboration of two major research and education centers of the nation - TAMU and UT-Austin - creates unique opportunity for human resource development and enhancement of the infrastructure for research and education. The Investigators are committed to organize an exchange of students on a regular basis and research student seminars alternating between TAMU and UT-Austin as well as to engage students to participate in scientific meetings. The project supports an extensive use of the multi-user facilities, such as MOCVD and MBE epitaxial growth facilities at the UT-Austin, which serve as major sites of research and mentoring for large number of science and engineering students. Benefits to the society are evident from the above list of applications.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
