<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2005. The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of scientific leadership in US science. To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients.   It is expected that Fellows supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled "Genomic analyses of nutrient regulation of  plant root development."  A new fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) microarray technique is being used, along with in vivo analysis, to identify and characterize a set of root developmental genes differentially affected by deficiencies in nitrogen, phosphorous, and iron in Arabidopsis thaliana.  The Fellow is pursuing a career as a research scientist and teacher, with a focus on plant biotechnology. The proposed activity provides training in the areas of teaching, plant development and the use of genomics-based approaches in plant research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
