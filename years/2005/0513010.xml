<AbstractNarration>Stimuli-responsive polymers (SRPs) exhibit a change in properties upon application of an external&lt;br/&gt;stimulus, such as a change in temperature, ionic strength, pH, electric, magnetic or mechanical fields or by&lt;br/&gt;chemical or biological analytes. Examples include liquid crystal polymers (LCPs), polymer solutions and&lt;br/&gt;gels, which undergo a change in phase morphology, electro- and magnetorheological fluids and electroactive&lt;br/&gt;polymers (EAPs). SRPs have potential applications as smart films in sensors, actuators, electro-optic&lt;br/&gt;devices, etc., where the viscoelastic properties become important. A recent advance has been the&lt;br/&gt;development of metallosupramolecular polymers and networks based on metal:ligand binding. This project&lt;br/&gt;requests support to investigate the molecular origin of the viscoelastic behavior of a novel family of&lt;br/&gt;metallosupramolecular polymers, developed by S. J. Rowan and coworkers, which dissolve in various&lt;br/&gt;organic solvents, and which can be conveniently functionalized by incorporation of photonic or ionconducting&lt;br/&gt;moieties. Knowledge of the molecular origin of the viscoelastic and thermodynamic behavior of&lt;br/&gt;these materials is a key step towards rational molecular design, aimed at optimizing their properties, and to&lt;br/&gt;understanding how to process them into functional films. Such studies have not been systematically&lt;br/&gt;pursued to date, and are the subject of this proposal.                                                                                               &lt;br/&gt;Rowan et al. create supramolecular polymers and networks of controlled architectures from a bisligand&lt;br/&gt;functionalized monomer via addition of lanthanide and transition metal ions, which act, respectively,&lt;br/&gt;as crosslinkers and as chain extenders. Thus, the molecular weight and network architecture is determined&lt;br/&gt;by the ionic concentration and composition, and by the ion-binding strength and kinetics. These materials&lt;br/&gt;combine the functionality of the metal ions with the processability and mechanical strength of a dynamic&lt;br/&gt;polymeric network. We propose studies to first investigate the properties of the supramolecular polymers&lt;br/&gt;formed by mixing the monomer with transition metal ions. Viscometric, light scattering and small-angle&lt;br/&gt;neutron scattering studies will be performed as a function of monomer:metal ion ratio, in different solvents,&lt;br/&gt;and as a function of temperature. The role of the coordinating power of the metal ion and solvent will be&lt;br/&gt;explored. The results will be interpreted in terms of apparent chain molecular weight, in the context of&lt;br/&gt;theories of equilibrium chains and/or kinetically frozen chains. These studies will then be extended to study&lt;br/&gt;the effects of adding lanthanide as crosslinker. The onset of gelation and/or phase separation will be probed&lt;br/&gt;by scattering and rheological measurements. The structure and morphology of the gel phase will be&lt;br/&gt;examined by light, x-ray and neutron scattering techniques and by optical and transmission electron&lt;br/&gt;microscopy. These studies will provide the first comprehensive picture of the relationship between&lt;br/&gt;precursor structure and metal ion binding characteristics versus thermodynamic and viscoelastic behavior&lt;br/&gt;for this important new class of stimuli-responsive materials.                                                                               &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposal derives from the fact that the results obtained will generate&lt;br/&gt;important new fundamental knowledge on an important new class of stimuli-responsive materials. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, they will serve to test existing theories of self-assembling polymers and networks, and more&lt;br/&gt;importantly are expected to identify novel phenomena, which will provide new challenges for theorists.            &lt;br/&gt;Moreover, the project will have broader impact, in that it will serve to train two PhD graduate&lt;br/&gt;students, and is expected to provide research opportunities for undergraduate students in a vital area of&lt;br/&gt;polymer research. The results will be disseminated at national and international meetings and will be&lt;br/&gt;published in leading scientific journals. In addition, it is expected that our findings will generate empirical&lt;br/&gt;knowledge, which will be an important step toward practical commercial application of these materials as&lt;br/&gt;functional, stimuli-responsive coatings and films.</AbstractNarration>
