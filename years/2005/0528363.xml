<AbstractNarration>The  proposed  research is  to  apply  conformal  surface theory  to&lt;br/&gt;various    geometry    representations    to    compute    conformal&lt;br/&gt;structures.  Using  computed   conformal  structures,  new  geometry&lt;br/&gt;representation and analysis tools  can be developed, which will pave&lt;br/&gt;the   road  for  advances   in  multiple   fronts  of   science  and&lt;br/&gt;engineering. The work proposed  herein will especially explore these&lt;br/&gt;potentials  in  computer  graphics  and visualization.  Building  up&lt;br/&gt;conformal structures  recasts many three  dimensional (3D) geometric&lt;br/&gt;problems into two dimensions  (2D) and leads to efficient approaches&lt;br/&gt;for a number of fundamental geometric problems. These approaches can&lt;br/&gt;then  immediately benefit  a  wide range  of  applications, such  as&lt;br/&gt;surface  classification,   surface  matching  and   shape  analysis,&lt;br/&gt;geometric    modeling,    simulation,    graphics   rendering    and&lt;br/&gt;visualization.   Performing   conformal  parameterization   requires&lt;br/&gt;solving  large   least  squares   problems.  To  further   push  the&lt;br/&gt;application  of  the  conformal  structure to  interactive  or  time&lt;br/&gt;critical  operations,  the  research  team  will  investigate  novel&lt;br/&gt;iterative methods for least-squares  problems based on sparse QR and&lt;br/&gt;incomplete  sparse QR  algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Various  scientific and engineering  applications concern  about key&lt;br/&gt;operations  such  as  modeling,  design, analysis,  simulation,  and&lt;br/&gt;graphics  rendering.  All  these  operations  are  built  on  top  a&lt;br/&gt;foundation of  geometry representation. In  this project, scientists&lt;br/&gt;aim  to revolutionize  this  foundation by  introducing a  conformal&lt;br/&gt;structure  uniquely characterizing geometry  surfaces. Many  laws of&lt;br/&gt;physics  are governed  by  conformal structures.  For example,  heat&lt;br/&gt;diffusion  and  electromagnetic   field  distribution  on  surfaces,&lt;br/&gt;tension in  soap bubbles and  parts of string theory  in theoretical&lt;br/&gt;physics are  determined by conformal  surface structures. Encouraged&lt;br/&gt;by the existing success, the scientists strive to explore and unveil&lt;br/&gt;the  potentials  of  conformal  structures  for  computer  graphics,&lt;br/&gt;geometric modeling  and much of scientific  computing. To illustrate&lt;br/&gt;this potential, consider one  aspect of conformal structures, namely&lt;br/&gt;the canonical flattening of a  surface into a plane, resulting in an&lt;br/&gt;image like representation of seemingly complicated three dimensional&lt;br/&gt;geometry.  Overall, the  tools developed  in this  project  can help&lt;br/&gt;boost  the development  of  effective techniques  to  deal with  the&lt;br/&gt;emerging   problems   related   to   scientific   simulation,   data&lt;br/&gt;exploration,   and   identity  matching   or   shape  analysis   for&lt;br/&gt;surveillance and biological discovery.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
