<AbstractNarration>The Kavli Institute of Theoretical Physics (KITP), located on the Santa Barbara campus of the University of California (UCSB), serves the diverse goals of theoretical physics via a unique mode of operation and structure. The combination of visiting research programs with a small permanent faculty and postdoctoral fellows enables interactions among visiting scientists to occur with lasting impact. As a largely peer-managed institute, with essential input in the planning and implementation of its research programs from the community, the KITP responds to new scientific opportunities, encourages transformational research, and promotes diversity by ensuring broad representation. The goal is to promote progress by bringing together accomplished researchers for sufficient time to form new collaborations and to carry out substantive research that will transform the direction of research for the future.</AbstractNarration>
