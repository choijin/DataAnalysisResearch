<AbstractNarration>DEAD-box proteins are ubiquitous enzymes that facilitate RNA structural rearrangements through the disruption of RNA-RNA and RNA-protein contacts in reactions that are coupled to the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. DEAD-box proteins are essential in all aspects of RNA metabolism including splicing, ribosome biogenesis, RNA degradation, and translation in all organisms from bacteria to humans. The E. coli DEAD-box protein DbpA is unique among the DEAD-box protein family in that it is specifically activated by the peptidyl-transferase center (PTC) RNA of the ribosome. Research efforts focus on providing a complete kinetic and thermodynamic characterization of the RNA-activated ATPase cycle of DbpA and defining how ATP utilization is coupled to PTC-RNA binding and unwinding. The detailed analysis of enzymatic reaction mechanisms will define how ATP utilization, RNA binding and RNA duplex unwinding are coupled, and advance our understanding of how DEAD box proteins use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to control the structure and dynamics of RNA. Knowledge acquired from the research activities will help develop testable hypotheses regarding the functions and molecular mechanisms of related DEAD-box RNA helicases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The activities in this project will advance learning and education through graduate and undergraduate teaching and training, integrating chemistry with biology, and promoting the participation and contributions of underrepresented groups in the biomedical sciences. Undergraduate and graduate students will receive training in the methods of molecular biology, enzymology, and RNA and protein chemistry. A course on Enzyme Mechanisms will de developed further and include a comparison of ATPase reaction kinetics and energy transduction mechanisms of myosin and helicase molecular motors. The PI will continue to be active in underrepresented minority outreach activities, advising undergraduate and graduate students, and chairing the minority and graduate recruiting committees of the department.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Structural rearrangement of ribonucleic acid (RNA) is essential for all living organisms.  Transient RNA reorganization is necessary for messenger RNA synthesis and export, ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis, and genome stability.  RNA remodeling is also critical for the replication of several viruses, including those that cause HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, and influenza.    RNA structural changes are catalyzed by RNA helicase proteins, a class of "molecular motors" that unwind regions of double-stranded RNA to form single-stranded RNA in a biochemical cycle that is coupled to the energy of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis.  The DExD/H family of enzymes - named for a characteristic amino acid motif shared among all family members - is a ubiquitous class of RNA helicases that play essential roles in cell growth, differentiation, and survival.  The DExD/Hbox family is comprised of DEAD-, DEAH-, and DExH-box groups, with DEAD-box proteins forming the largest group within the family.  Loss of DExD/H helicase function can contribute to the development of several forms of cancer and some of the debilitating effects of aging.   The molecular mechanism that couples ATP utilization with RNA rearrangement by DExD/H proteins is a poorly understood area of active research.  The ATP utilization cycle is made up of discrete biochemical reaction steps that include ATP binding, chemical cleavage of bound ATP, and the release of the hydrolysis products adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi).  Knowledge of the time evolution and energy changes of these reactions provides valuable mechanistic insight into how these molecular motors function as energy transducing machines.  However, measuring the coupling between the steps of the ATP utilization cycle and RNA remodeling is a very challenging task because the minimum reaction cycle for any helicase is comprised of at least 75 reaction constants!  RNA rearrangement and unwinding can occur with any or several of these biochemical reactions.   Research activities supported by the National Science Foundation under this CAREER Award have revealed the molecular mechanism of how DEAD-box proteins couple ATP utilization with structural remodeling of RNA.  We developed real time (bulk and single molecule) spectroscopic assays that measure individual ATP utilization reactions, RNA binding interactions and RNA reorganization.  These methods were used to identify the molecular mechanism and pathway of ATP-dependent RNA unwinding (Figure 1).  Our work with DbpA, an E. Coli DEAD-box protein implicated in ribosome biogenesis, shows that consumption of a single ATP molecule is sufficient to unwind and displace an 8 base pair rRNA strand annealed to a 32 base pair PTC-RNA "mother strand" fragment. Strand displacement occurs after ATP binding and hydrolysis but before Pi product release. Pi release weakens binding to rRNA, thereby facilitating the release of the unwound rRNA mother strand and the recycling of DbpA for additional rounds of unwinding.  The research outcomes also established that although the ATP-dependent RNA unwinding pathway is conserved among DEAD-box proteins from divergent kingdoms, namely, bacteria and fungi, variations in the catalytic cycle reaction constants confer unique properties to different DEAD-box proteins.  Distinct distributions of populated biochemical intermediates contribute to the functional diversity of DEAD-box proteins, which allows them to fulfill specific biological functions.  For example, DbpA promotes conformational rearrangement of 23S ribosomal RNA and has been suggested to play a role in ribosome biogenesis and assembly.  DbpA populates a weak RNA binding state during steady-state cycling, such that competition with ribosomal proteins and assembly cofactors for rRNA binding is minimal. In contrast, RNA helicases that catalyze group I and group II intron splicing bind RNA strongly during steady-state cycling.  In this case, ATPase cycling promot...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
