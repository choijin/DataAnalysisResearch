<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The research objective is to develop a generic theory for model based feedback flow control. Accessible&lt;br/&gt;models, design and analysis methods and, indeed, clearer understanding of fluidic temporal actuation and&lt;br/&gt;system parameters influence of flow system behavior, as characterized by the onset or suppress of various&lt;br/&gt;instabilities, are the key components. This integrated theoretical and numerical research program&lt;br/&gt;combines unique fluid flow modeling expertise at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and system&lt;br/&gt;analysis and control theory capabilities at Northeastern University (NEU). We envisage a closelycoupled,&lt;br/&gt;well-coordinated synergy between the two institutions and with an already existing collaborative&lt;br/&gt;team in industry and academe. A set of case studies of increased complexity will be used to isolate key&lt;br/&gt;stumbling blocks and develop critical enablers. Well beyond these benchmarks, effective feedback flow&lt;br/&gt;control will provide critical enablers for substantial improvements in a wide range of applications,&lt;br/&gt;ranging from aircraft, automotive, semiconductor, imaging, air conditioning, the chemical process&lt;br/&gt;industry, bio-reactors, furnaces, to aeroengines &amp; ground-based gas turbines for power generation.&lt;br/&gt;The defining challenge in this nascent field arises from the deep chasm between the intrinsic complexity&lt;br/&gt;of unsteady and transient actuated fluid dynamics and the simplicity and robustness required of models&lt;br/&gt;useful for feedback design and analysis, and architecture (i.e., sensors and actuators placement and&lt;br/&gt;specifications) optimization. Addressing this challenge, the proposal is characterized by an analytic,&lt;br/&gt;physics-based approach and aims at the fundamentals of fluid dynamics in relation to actuation. Essential&lt;br/&gt;new modeling tools will be developed to efficiently characterized targeted dynamic manifolds, matched&lt;br/&gt;by controller and observer design and architecture optimization tools, geared to respect - and exploit - the&lt;br/&gt;exceptionally limited validity envelopes of such models. The selected benchmarks, characterized by&lt;br/&gt;significant unsteady motion and transient dynamics, include separation and stall of airfoils, the stability of&lt;br/&gt;the backward-facing step flow, the separated vortical wake flow behind a bluff body, the stability of&lt;br/&gt;shock waves over airfoils, and the transition to breakdown states in a swirling flow in a pipe. Each is&lt;br/&gt;important in its own right for both fundamental science and critical applications. More significantly, they&lt;br/&gt;highlight and isolated key technical issues in a framework which is both tractable and sufficiently rich.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. Dominant techniques in the emerging field of feedback flow control such as transfer&lt;br/&gt;and describing functions and empirical (POD) Galerkin modes are often limited to nearly linear systems&lt;br/&gt;or tend to exhibit very poor capability to capture transient dynamics and actuation, and to sustain&lt;br/&gt;parametric changes in the operating point. The need for new tools, fresh and innovative approaches in this&lt;br/&gt;field, and indeed the very evolution of feedback flow control as a new and well defined discipline, are an&lt;br/&gt;outgrowth of these gaps. The main thrust of the research will be to develop means to address these&lt;br/&gt;shortcomings by an appeal to the fundamental physics of the problems, combined with a system&lt;br/&gt;theoretical approach. We look to develop reduced-order models which are derived from the Navier-Stokes&lt;br/&gt;equation and phenomenological physical characteristics, such as energy production, absorption and&lt;br/&gt;transfer, and natural instabilities, and account for realistic boundary conditions and meaningful actuation&lt;br/&gt;techniques. The research will be characterized by tight coupling of the PIs knowledge bases in system&lt;br/&gt;theory and fluid dynamics and leverage prolific ongoing interactions with a cross disciplinary group of&lt;br/&gt;experts in numerical flow simulations and imaging, experimentalists, and industrial researchers; this range&lt;br/&gt;of expertise is imperative, and external collaborations will serve as a source of initial insight, an impetus&lt;br/&gt;for new directions, and an ongoing resource and for validation of developed tools and understanding.&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact. The proposed approach is unique in its synergistic use of classical and modern&lt;br/&gt;mathematical tools, fluid dynamics and control techniques to provide a comprehensive theory of feedback&lt;br/&gt;flow control, led by a collaboration between two experts in these areas. The project will lead to an&lt;br/&gt;improved understanding of the mechanisms that provoke instabilities and transition phenomena in various&lt;br/&gt;flow systems, the ways to actively control them for improved performance, and will provide rigorous&lt;br/&gt;means to explore and define the yet unclear feasibility scope of feedback control in fluid flow systems.&lt;br/&gt;These advances will impact both on the basic science and on a wide range of industrial applications&lt;br/&gt;involving fluid flow / aerodynamics, shear layer mixing and combustion. It will also contribute to&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear control theory, developing new design and analysis methods for a challenging class of systems.</AbstractNarration>
