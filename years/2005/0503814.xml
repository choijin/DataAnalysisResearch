<AbstractNarration>The overall theme of the investigator's research is the application of&lt;br/&gt;homotopy theory to other areas of mathematics and to physics, in&lt;br/&gt;particular to the understanding of strings and similar structures. Among&lt;br/&gt;these structures, most directly related to of string theory is conformal&lt;br/&gt;field theory, which also appears to be closely connected to elliptic&lt;br/&gt;cohomology.  This in turn has implications in the area of automorphic&lt;br/&gt;forms, and relations with Borcherds' Moonshine module.  There is also a&lt;br/&gt;remarkable connection with the absolute Galois group of Q, through&lt;br/&gt;Grothendieck's program of dessins d'enfants, and the action of&lt;br/&gt;Grothendieck-Teichmueller structures on the formalism that make up&lt;br/&gt;conformal field theories. By way of analogy, studying the space of loops&lt;br/&gt;in a topological space leads to the string topology, which is closely&lt;br/&gt;related to operads and deformation theory in more abstract contexts. To&lt;br/&gt;approach these questions, the investigator uses categorical Koszul&lt;br/&gt;duality.  Related to Koszul duality is the notion of Grothendieck/Verdier&lt;br/&gt;duality in various contexts, which led back to A^1- and equivariant stable&lt;br/&gt;homotopy theory, including Real-oriented homotopy theory. This is directly&lt;br/&gt;analogous to the A^1-homotopy theory constructed by Morel and Voevodsky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall theme of the investigator's research is the interaction&lt;br/&gt;between the area of algebraic topology in mathematics, and string theory&lt;br/&gt;in physics. String theory emerged in physics in the 70's and 80's as a&lt;br/&gt;theory providing new hope toward gaining a unified theory of all the&lt;br/&gt;forces of nature; its basic idea was that the fundamental units of the&lt;br/&gt;universe are not point-like particles, but tiny one-dimensional strings,&lt;br/&gt;which may form a closed loop, or may be open (with two endpoints). The&lt;br/&gt;theory since underwent a tumultuous development in which many additional&lt;br/&gt;structures emerged. Today it is still believed in physics that the&lt;br/&gt;unification program may be facilitated by some theory closely related to&lt;br/&gt;structures discovered by string theory. Despite the long history, many&lt;br/&gt;fundamental aspects of string theory are not well mathematically&lt;br/&gt;understood, which, it seems, has somewhat hindered the physical theory.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator studies some of these issues both directly, and by way of&lt;br/&gt;analogy and connection with similar structures elsewhere in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;Topology can be thought of as geometry in its purely qualitative aspects.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, algebraic topology has built up many powerful methods for&lt;br/&gt;studying topological spaces, by associating to them certain&lt;br/&gt;algebraic/numerical invariants. In physics, spacetime itself can be&lt;br/&gt;considered as a topological space.  However, to understand strings in&lt;br/&gt;spacetime, one needs to study not only the points in topological spaces,&lt;br/&gt;but loops in such spaces, which can be thought of as models for strings.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator studies the structures arising from the space of loops in&lt;br/&gt;topological spaces. This includes conformal field theory and string&lt;br/&gt;topology, as well as certain structures from the area of algebra, such as&lt;br/&gt;operads and Hochschild cohomology. The investigator also considers the&lt;br/&gt;structures arising from loops in certain purely abstract, general context,&lt;br/&gt;for instance that of categorical Koszul duality.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
