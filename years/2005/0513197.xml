<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL EXPLANATION                                                                                                                                         The objective of the project is to explore principles and develop strategies&lt;br/&gt;for transforming polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) into highly functional pH-, ionic&lt;br/&gt;strength- and/or temperature-responsive coatings which reversibly trap or release&lt;br/&gt;synthetic macromolecules and proteins. New knowledge generated in this project about&lt;br/&gt;physical and chemical ways to stabilize polymer films at surfaces will be a significant&lt;br/&gt;contribution to materials and polymer science. Specifically, the project will provide a wealth of&lt;br/&gt;information on issues pertaining to molecular design of building block for responsive polymer&lt;br/&gt;self-assembly, derivatization of PEMs into active surface coatings and potential capabilities&lt;br/&gt;in PEM-based regulation of surface adhesion and absorption properties.&lt;br/&gt;Our approach will be based on a combination of molecular engineering and synthesis of&lt;br/&gt;polymeric 'building blocks' of PEMs with the chemical composition necessary for further&lt;br/&gt;transformation of PEMs into an absorbing film. We will explore several routes of producing&lt;br/&gt;surface-attached active absorbing films using electrostatic or hydrogen-bonded polymer&lt;br/&gt;multilayers as a starting material. The first route will be based on the dissociation of components&lt;br/&gt;of electrostatically assembled multilayers at high concentrations of small ions combined with&lt;br/&gt;selective 'salting-out' of one of the film components. In another scenario, we will explore&lt;br/&gt;chemical crosslinking of hydrogen-bonding multilayers as a means to produce surface-attached&lt;br/&gt;hydrogels. One-component hydrogels of polycarboxylic acids will be produced by selective&lt;br/&gt;crosslinking of self-assembled polycarboxylic acids and further release of hydrogen-bonded&lt;br/&gt;polymers from the crosslinked polyacid matrix. Two-component hydrogels will be obtained by&lt;br/&gt;reacting end-functionalized hydrogen-bonding polymers with carboxylic groups of selfassembled&lt;br/&gt;polyacid. In the latter type of absorbing films, response and absorbing properties will&lt;br/&gt;be modulated through intermolecular adhesion between hydrogen-bonded polymer chains.&lt;br/&gt;Selective monitoring of film composition, ionization of functional groups and quantification of&lt;br/&gt;charge balance will be done using in situ ATR-FTIR. The data will be correlated with the results&lt;br/&gt;of film swelling as measured with in situ ellipsometry and in situ AFM. The question of how&lt;br/&gt;interpolymer interactions respond to environmental stimuli, and how they are translated into&lt;br/&gt;changes in film density and absorption properties will be addressed.&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION                                                                                                                             The use of produced films as re-loadable matrices that could reversibly and&lt;br/&gt;controllably absorb and desorb macromolecules and proteins from response to environmental&lt;br/&gt;stimuli, specifically valuable for separation, concentration, and controlled release of chemicals&lt;br/&gt;and proteins in environments with dominating effects of surfaces such as in a microfluidic&lt;br/&gt;channel. Results of proposed research will be made available to a broad scientific audience&lt;br/&gt;through conference presentations, invited talks given by the PI of this project, poster and oral&lt;br/&gt;presentations of graduate students, and archival literature.&lt;br/&gt;The educational impact includes building a stronger interdisciplinary polymer program at&lt;br/&gt;Stevens that will provide better training for students. The results of the proposed research will be&lt;br/&gt;included into recently developed advanced polymer courses, such as Polymers at Solid-Liquid&lt;br/&gt;Interfaces, and other core laboratory courses at both graduate and undergraduate levels.&lt;br/&gt;Participation of women in advanced research will be enhanced also through support of two&lt;br/&gt;female graduate students. Finally, economically disadvantaged high school students will be&lt;br/&gt;given an opportunity to be exposed to this research due to activities our group sustains in the&lt;br/&gt;ACS SEED program.</AbstractNarration>
