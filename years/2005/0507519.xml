<AbstractNarration>AST-0507519&lt;br/&gt;Adam Frank&lt;br/&gt;University of Rochester&lt;br/&gt;From Core to Outflow: Understanding the Driving and shaping of Asymmetric&lt;br/&gt;Planetary Nebulae&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Planetary nebulae form the linchpin in our understanding of how stars like the Sun die. They are the&lt;br/&gt;intermediate evolutionary stage between high mass-loss asymptotic giant branch stars and white&lt;br/&gt;dwarfs. As the final stage of mass loss for low and intermediate mass stars, the nebulae represent a&lt;br/&gt;critical step in the mass and chemical evolution cycle for more than half the material ejected into the&lt;br/&gt;interstellar medium. The ubiquity of planetary nebulae and their ease of observation have also made&lt;br/&gt;them premier laboratories for testing new astrophysical theories. Here, a program to better&lt;br/&gt;understand the formation of planetary nebulae and the late stages of stellar evolution for low and&lt;br/&gt;intermediate mass stars will be undertaken.&lt;br/&gt;High resolution images of planetary nebulae and their progenitors have triggered a critical reevaluation&lt;br/&gt;of the dominant paradigm for nebular shaping. The new data has revealed features such&lt;br/&gt;as non-axisymmetric episodic jets and multi-polar outflows which can not be embraced with purely&lt;br/&gt;hydrodynamic theories. In addition, data from studies of proto-nebulae show energetic winds&lt;br/&gt;forming from cool stars that lack sufficient luminosity for radiative driving. Thus the theory of&lt;br/&gt;planetary nebula evolution and, by implication, our ideas about processes at work in the late stages&lt;br/&gt;of stellar evolution, require fundamental revision. Previous work by Frank and collaborators has&lt;br/&gt;established the potential efficacy of magneto-centrifugal launching processes in planetary nebulae&lt;br/&gt;and proto-planetary nebulae. The central source driving the outflow is either a rapidly rotating&lt;br/&gt;stellar core or a binary-fed accretion disk or both. In all cases the magnetic field is likely to&lt;br/&gt;originate via dynamo processes. The goals of the present study, which build upon this earlier work,&lt;br/&gt;are three fold: (1) To understand the nature of magnetic field generation in single asymptotic giant&lt;br/&gt;branch (pre-nebula) stars, binary systems and in accretion disks. (2) To link magneto-centrifugal&lt;br/&gt;process at the core (star and/or disk) to global planetary nebulae and proto-nebulae morphologies,&lt;br/&gt;kinematics and ionization/chemistry states. This will be achieved through the use of a new Adaptive&lt;br/&gt;Mesh Refinement code, AstroBEAR, built at the University of Rochester in collaboration with the&lt;br/&gt;University of North Carolina Applied Math Department. (3) And to provide theoretical support for&lt;br/&gt;an ongoing series of laboratory astrophysics experiments conducted at Imperial College in London&lt;br/&gt;which have generated supersonic magnetically driven bubbles. These experiments are directly&lt;br/&gt;relevant to these planetary nebula models.&lt;br/&gt;While the work here is focused on planetary nebulae it will be of direct relevance to other fields&lt;br/&gt;both theoretically and observationally in the sense of allowing planetary nebulae to potentially act&lt;br/&gt;as a test-bed for theories of magnetohydrodynamic outflows. The work with the Imperial Collage&lt;br/&gt;group helps to deepen the rapidly growing field of High Energy Density Laboratory Astrophysics.&lt;br/&gt;The development the AstroBEAR code is of particular benefit as it includes new multi-physics,&lt;br/&gt;multi-numerics methods and the work on it here will help train the next generation of computational&lt;br/&gt;astrophysicists. Finally, an innovative outreach program is included which involves the creation of&lt;br/&gt;Sci-Interactives: simulation based learning modules which will be posted on popular science&lt;br/&gt;magazine websites.</AbstractNarration>
