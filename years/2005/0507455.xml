<AbstractNarration>AST-0507455&lt;br/&gt;Krolik&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will carry out three closely related projects using fully general relativistic three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of accretion onto black holes.  The first involves studying those properties that are specifically due to general relativity, such as frame dragging and the Bardeen-Petterson effect.  The second considers the role of radiation, and specifically radiation pressure, possible violently disruptive instabilities, any variation of the accretion rate dependent on local conditions, and the distribution of heat dissipation.  Finally, those results will be tied more closely to observables, making predictions about iron line profiles, the radiation expected from the Galactic center, quasi-periodic features in light curves, and the central engine of gamma ray bursts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black holes strongly catch the public's fancy, so that the PI from time to time gives talks to school or other lay audiences.  Data from the research simulations are also used in a separate NSF-funded project whose aim is to create new tools for computer-assisted three-dimensional visualization.</AbstractNarration>
