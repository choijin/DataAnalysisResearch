<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This proposal concerns research by Prof. Ted Chinburg on arithmetic geometry&lt;br/&gt;and Galois theory.  The first goal of the proposal is to study equivariant Riemann &lt;br/&gt;Roch theorems.  This subject concerns Euler characteristics associated to actions &lt;br/&gt;of groups on objects arising from arithmetic geometry.  New methods for &lt;br/&gt;determining coherent Euler characteristics will be developed and applied to &lt;br/&gt;study modular forms and conjectures about L-series.  In particular, some &lt;br/&gt;predictions about the Mordell-Weil groups and Tate-Shafarevich groups of&lt;br/&gt;Jacobians of modular curves will be considered.  The second goal of the proposal&lt;br/&gt;is to study equivariant Weil-etale cohomology and its generalizations, along&lt;br/&gt;with invariants in derived categories arising from group actions on schemes.&lt;br/&gt;The third goal of the proposal is to continue work on a fundamental finiteness&lt;br/&gt;problem concerning how finite groups of automorphisms act on the homogeneous&lt;br/&gt;coordinate rings of varieties in positive characteristic.  The final goal of&lt;br/&gt;the proposal is to study the liftability of group actions on curves in positive&lt;br/&gt;characteristic.  In particular, a conjecture about those groups for which lifts to &lt;br/&gt;characteristic 0 always exist will be considered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader context of this proposal is the study of symmetry as it pertains to &lt;br/&gt;algebra and number theory.  Symmetry has been a guiding principle in algebra&lt;br/&gt;since the work of Galois on the solvability of equations by radicals in the 1830's.&lt;br/&gt;By studying the symmetries which solutions of algebraic problems must have &lt;br/&gt;it they exist, one can in many cases show that no such solutions exist, or that &lt;br/&gt;the solutions are strongly constrained.  This proposal will develop this principle &lt;br/&gt;in some new directions.  The goal is to apply the principle to prove some &lt;br/&gt;central conjectures about L-series and the relation between being able to solve &lt;br/&gt;systems of equations modulo prime numbers and being able to solve them &lt;br/&gt;exactly with integers or with whole numbers.  The study of solutions&lt;br/&gt;of equations in integers and modulo prime numbers has been of practical &lt;br/&gt;significance to cryptography and to the construction of error correcting codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
