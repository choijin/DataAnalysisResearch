    <AbstractNarration>The investigator will explore theoretical properties of randomization &lt;br/&gt;procedures with applications to sequential randomized clinical trials. &lt;br/&gt;The first problem the investigator will address is sequential monitoring &lt;br/&gt;of randomization tests following restricted randomization, which will &lt;br/&gt;require extensive use of techniques in sequential analysis and &lt;br/&gt;nonparametric statistical inference. The second problem the investigator &lt;br/&gt;will address is the development and properties of response-adaptive &lt;br/&gt;randomization procedures, including procedures designed for continuous &lt;br/&gt;responses, and survival responses with censoring. The third problem the &lt;br/&gt;investigator will address is certain theoretical properties of &lt;br/&gt;covariate-adaptive randomization procedures, particularly &lt;br/&gt;randomization-based inference procedures following covariate-adaptive &lt;br/&gt;randomization. The ultimate goal of the investigator is to complete a &lt;br/&gt;systmeatic study of randomization, its properties, and its relevance in &lt;br/&gt;clinical trials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will explore properties of randomization, the hallmark of &lt;br/&gt;a well-designed clinical trial. The first problem the investigator will &lt;br/&gt;address is sequential monitoring of randomized clinical trials, which &lt;br/&gt;refers to making early decisions about the effectiveness of new therapies &lt;br/&gt;when compelling evidence is accrued at an interim point in a clinical &lt;br/&gt;trial. There are currently no sequential monitoring techniques available &lt;br/&gt;that allow the randomization itself to be incorporate into these &lt;br/&gt;decisions, and hence current methodology completely ignores the design of &lt;br/&gt;the trial in the analysis. The second problem the investigator will &lt;br/&gt;address is response-adaptive randomization, and he will develop new &lt;br/&gt;procedures for clinical trials where the outcome is time-to-event or some &lt;br/&gt;continous measure, e.g. cholesterol level. These response-adaptive &lt;br/&gt;procedures are attractive from an ethical point of view, because they seek &lt;br/&gt;to maximize power to detect a relevant clinical outcome, while &lt;br/&gt;simultaneously minimizing the expected number of treatment failures &lt;br/&gt;patients will experience while participating in the clinical trial. The &lt;br/&gt;third problem the investigator will address is proporties of &lt;br/&gt;covariate-adaptive randomization procedures, which is designed to minimize &lt;br/&gt;tial imbalances in important confounding variables that might bias results &lt;br/&gt;of the clinical trial. Each of these topics is relevant to today's &lt;br/&gt;clinical trials in the drug development phase of new pharmaceuticals.</AbstractNarration>
