<AbstractNarration>Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cosmogenic isotopes such as 10Be and 26Al are widely used to determine the age and&lt;br/&gt;exposure histories of landscape features. Such information is critical to understanding&lt;br/&gt;the timing and rate of geologic processes such as active fault ruptures, glacial advances,&lt;br/&gt;soil formation and erosion of mountain belts. However, the utility of these isotopes is&lt;br/&gt;limited by the high cost and intense labor associated with producing a single&lt;br/&gt;measurement. This project proposes development of cosmogenic 3He as a dating tool in&lt;br/&gt;common accessory mineral phases such as apatite, sphene and zircon. If successful, this&lt;br/&gt;technique will be unique in several respects. First, it will allow rapid and inexpensive&lt;br/&gt;cosmogenic dating of a wide range of rock types, thus increasing the number of samples&lt;br/&gt;that can be dated in a single study. Second, because 3He is stable and has a very high&lt;br/&gt;production rate, it may prove useful in combination with other cosmogenic nuclides to&lt;br/&gt;address problems such as paleoaltimetry, ancient exposure and burial histories (100 my&lt;br/&gt;time scales), and dating of archaeological sites and artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several technical challenges need to be overcome before 3He in apatite, sphene and&lt;br/&gt;zircon can be used as a cosmogenic dating tool. First, it is necessary to develop&lt;br/&gt;analytical procedures such that the measurement of small amounts of 3He in the presence&lt;br/&gt;of large quantities of radiogenic 4He is not hampered by the "tailing" of low energy 4He&lt;br/&gt;ions onto the 3He peak, or by space charge effects at high 4He pressures. The former is&lt;br/&gt;likely not a problem based on the demonstrated abundance sensitivity at mass 3, and the&lt;br/&gt;latter will be addressed using a "spike" of standard gas inlet during the measurement of&lt;br/&gt;an unknown to calibrate the instrument at that He pressure. A second challenge is to&lt;br/&gt;verify the production rate of 3He, which will be done using samples of known exposure&lt;br/&gt;age from glacial moraines in the Sierra Nevada and Nepal Himalaya. Implicit in this task&lt;br/&gt;is identifying and correcting for non-cosmogenic sources of 3He such as inheritance from&lt;br/&gt;fluid inclusions and production via 6Li(n, alpha) + time -&gt; 3He.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Explanation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Determining when rocks first appear at the Earth's surface is an important question in&lt;br/&gt;many Earth Science disciplines. For example, the boulders deposited when a glacier&lt;br/&gt;retreats provide an important record of past climate change. The "surface exposure age"&lt;br/&gt;of these boulders, the time when they were first deposited, can be determined by&lt;br/&gt;measuring the buildup of unusual isotopes produced by cosmic rays interacting with the&lt;br/&gt;elements of the uppermost tens of centimeters of the rock. This proposal seeks to improve&lt;br/&gt;existing methods of "surface exposure dating", using the appearance of a rare isotope of&lt;br/&gt;helium in several common minerals. The overarching goal is to develop a technique that&lt;br/&gt;is broadly applicable and inexpensive and which may lead to improved understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the timing and rates of processes that modify Earth's surface.</AbstractNarration>
