<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Finance not only has relevance to asset pricing, credit risk, &lt;br/&gt;and the term structure of interest rates (for example), but also presents &lt;br/&gt;to mathematicians a new way of looking at research in probability, since &lt;br/&gt;the types of questions that need to be answered are no longer motivated by &lt;br/&gt;physics or subjects such as electrical engineering.  Building on the &lt;br/&gt;foundation of the First Cornell Seminar in Finance, the Second will again &lt;br/&gt;bring together leading researchers from the Northeast and selected points &lt;br/&gt;beyond for an exchange of ideas in seminar format.  The basic themes will &lt;br/&gt;be asset pricing and hedging, viscosity solution based control theory, &lt;br/&gt;credit risk, interest rates, and numerical methods and data analysis using &lt;br/&gt;modern statistical techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental research in finance has helped to change the world of commerce &lt;br/&gt;during the last 30 years, and has arguably contributed to the explosive &lt;br/&gt;growth in wealth.  The key idea is the transfer of risk: modern financial &lt;br/&gt;tools allow one party to sell an aspect of a risky exposure to another &lt;br/&gt;party, and to do so at a fair price. Often a way for the buyer of the risk &lt;br/&gt;to hedge against the risk (a hedging strategy) can also be provided in &lt;br/&gt;terms of mathematical formulae.   A problem is, however, that while the &lt;br/&gt;models have led to huge advances, they are still often crude approximations &lt;br/&gt;of reality, and also most of the advances have come from the creation of &lt;br/&gt;financial derivatives in markets such as the stock market.  Of current &lt;br/&gt;interest is the development of analogous tools one could use in other &lt;br/&gt;markets, such as credit risk.  For example, two companies issuing similar &lt;br/&gt;bonds may command different prices due to the markets' differing &lt;br/&gt;assessments of their risk of not repaying the bonds.  How to model this &lt;br/&gt;risk mathematically is as yet poorly understood, and the subject of intense &lt;br/&gt;research efforts.  This conference will bring together leading scholars, &lt;br/&gt;young researchers, and advanced graduate students for an intellectual &lt;br/&gt;exchange involving both formal presentations of research advances and also &lt;br/&gt;private discussions of special research topics.  It will be held at Cornell &lt;br/&gt;University, one of the nation's leading institutions of higher learning.</AbstractNarration>
