<AbstractNarration>The goal of the proposed work is to understand the reactivity of iron (Fe) oxide nanoparticles in&lt;br/&gt;air, water, and soil environments. Fe oxide particles in the nanometer size range (&lt; 100 nm) are&lt;br/&gt;ubiquitous in nature and their occurrence ranges from ultra-fine mineral dust in the atmosphere to&lt;br/&gt;nanocrystalline precipitates in the hydrosphere. Research into the reactivity of nanoparticle Fe oxides has&lt;br/&gt;been primarily aimed at understanding the bonding characteristics of atoms adsorbed at the surface. It is&lt;br/&gt;now recognized, however, that the behavior of Fe in the environment is strongly influenced by bacterially&lt;br/&gt;driven redox reactions, as well as the local chemistry and nature of mineral surfaces in rocks and soils,&lt;br/&gt;and by the presence of water. Therefore, detailed investigations of the redox chemistry of Fe oxide&lt;br/&gt;nanoparticles under conditions analogous to nature are critical to understanding the role of these tiny&lt;br/&gt;particles in the cycling of Fe in the environment.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will use advanced spectroscopic and analytical techniques, in conjunction&lt;br/&gt;with selective isotope labeling, to investigate redox processes occurring at the surface of Fe oxide&lt;br/&gt;nanoparticles in the presence of water. Of particular interest is the bacterially driven interaction between&lt;br/&gt;aqueous Fe, and mineral and cell surfaces, as well as redox reactions occurring during (i) Fe isotope&lt;br/&gt;exchange, (ii) transport of atmospheric Fe mineral dust, (iii) pollutant reduction, and (iv) microbial Fe&lt;br/&gt;oxidation. The experiments will use well characterized Fe oxide nanoparticles in batch and column&lt;br/&gt;reactors designed to mimic natural conditions by varying biogeochemical conditions, including microbe,&lt;br/&gt;mineral, and water composition, as well as flow conditions.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. Despite the key role of Fe(III)-Fe(II) reactions in environmental and industrial&lt;br/&gt;applications, heterogeneous redox reactions occurring on nanoscale Fe oxides have been largely unexplored.&lt;br/&gt;This is due, in large part, to the analytical and spatial complexities of studying heterogeneous reactions of Fe&lt;br/&gt;in the presence of water. The proposed methodology overcomes this obstacle by using an innovative&lt;br/&gt;combination of 57Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy and high precision aqueous isotope ratio measurements to&lt;br/&gt;simultaneously measure isotope specific oxidation states and concentrations of Fe at the Fe oxide-water&lt;br/&gt;interface. This approach, in tandem with X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron&lt;br/&gt;microscopy (TEM), will provide new information on how and where redox reactions occur on Fe oxide&lt;br/&gt;nanoparticles. The synergistic blend of expertise in Fe geochemistry, microbial Fe respiration, and&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric Fe mineral dust brought together with the proposed NIRT provides an unparalleled opportunity&lt;br/&gt;to study redox reactions involving Fe oxide nanoparticles during multiple components of the Fe&lt;br/&gt;biogeochemical cycle. Observing reactivity . particle size trends for four diverse, but related reactions&lt;br/&gt;provide a powerful mechanism to identify new phenomena that are unique to oxide particles within the&lt;br/&gt;nanometer size range.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. An innovative combination of spectroscopic and isotopic techniques, in addition&lt;br/&gt;to comprehensive mineral characterization methods, will result in an improved understanding of the behavior&lt;br/&gt;of Fe oxide nanoparticles in air, water, and soil. Our findings will directly impact newly developing theories&lt;br/&gt;on global carbon cycling (via microbial Fe respiration and atmospheric deposition of Fe in the ocean), as well&lt;br/&gt;as challenge our current understanding of important environmental and industrial processes including&lt;br/&gt;degradation of soil, sediment, and water quality, the evolution of earth.s geologic/magnetic record (via Fe&lt;br/&gt;isotope biosignatures), accelerated rates of corrosion, and condensation processes (which may have led to the&lt;br/&gt;origin of life on earth and biological activity on Mars). The exploratory, interdisciplinary nature of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed activity will provide excellent training for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.&lt;br/&gt;Students, as well as participating scientists, will gain expertise in a variety of spectroscopic and microscopic&lt;br/&gt;tools through three hands-on Nanoscale Processes in the Environment Summer Workshops. During the&lt;br/&gt;workshop, students will collect, analyze, and interpret data from their own samples. Bimonthly .Fe Oxides in&lt;br/&gt;the Environment. student forums will also be established at each university. The overall goal is to expose&lt;br/&gt;students to new ideas and to provide a forum for the interdisciplinary discussion of students. ideas throughout&lt;br/&gt;the year. Finally, a new initiative, .Geology and Art., will be launched through the Geology Museum at&lt;br/&gt;U.W. Madison to educate the public about Fe nanoparticles. This NIRT addresses the NSE research and&lt;br/&gt;education theme .Nanoscale Processes in the Environment..</AbstractNarration>
