    <AbstractNarration>The Fort Worth Museum of Science and History will utilize the popular areas of criminal investigation and forensic science to create a 5,000 square foot national traveling exhibition and an accompanying web adventure. The project builds upon the work done during the planning grant (ESI-0307473). The target audience is families with middle-school aged children and school groups in grades four through nine. The project partners include Rice University Center for Technology in Teaching and Learning, the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, the Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative, Boys &amp; Girls Clubs and 14 science museums in EPSCOR states. The potential strategic impact of this project will be a new model for developing an exhibit and website that are fully integrated from the beginning with the same learning goals. The evaluation will provide information about how an integrated exhibit and website is developed and its impact.</AbstractNarration>
