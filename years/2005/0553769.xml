<AbstractNarration>This project is studying two RET models at Florida State University.  The first is offered by the Center for the Integration of Research and Learning (CIRL) at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.  The researchers characterize it as a traditional RET in which teachers are placed in individual faculty laboratories to participate in on-going research.  Participants in this program come together daily for discussion and activities focused on pedagogical issues.  The second is offered by the Office of Science Teaching Activities (OSTA) in the College of Arts and Sciences.  It is a non-traditional program with two scientists and two master teachers working full time with participants who develop their own scientific research agendas.  In the second program participants also engage in "inquiry on the process of inquiry" in which they conduct a pedagogical research project on the essential features of inquiry. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The researchers are examining the impact of these programs on teacher knowledge and practices, professional development and retention, and student learning.  The project will "generate a deeper and more generalizable knowledge of the necessary features of RET's."  The research goals are to (1) analyze the essential features of RET programs, (2) examine participants' understanding and enactment of inquiry, (3) study interactions with the personal characteristics of participants, and (4) assess the influence of inquiry teaching on student learning in science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Teaching students to engage in the practices of science should be a central focus of the science classroom, yet many teachers find such a teaching approach difficult because they lack  personal experience in conducting authentic research.  Research Experiences for Teachers (RETs) are a form of professional development designed to engage teachers in such research opportunities.  This project was designed to identify essential features of effective RETs. Findings indicate that RETs shape teacher classroom practice in two ways:   indirectly through shaping teachersÆ beliefs about teaching and learning and directly by shaping their use of specific classroom practices. Specifically, when RETs are structured to give teachers more social interaction with their peers centered around the research (i.e., discussing, arguing, problem-solving, etc.) they move toward more student-centered, inquiry-based beliefs about teaching that in turn shape their practice toward more student-centered instruction.

Findings further indicate that RET programs are successful in shaping many aspects of teachersÆ beliefs about teaching, especially their beliefs about "reformed" science teaching and decreasing their pedagogical discontentment. Of note, the RET program that focused more pointedly on close consideration of teacher practice was more successful in shaping teachersÆ beliefs, and was the only program to show an influence on teachersÆ practice.
