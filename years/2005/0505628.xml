<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator studies special wavelet decompositions of&lt;br/&gt;random processes and fields. These representations have a multi-resolution&lt;br/&gt;structure and share other nice properties of standard wavelet&lt;br/&gt;decompositions. In contrast to the standard case, however, the high&lt;br/&gt;frequency (small scale) terms in special wavelet decompositions have an&lt;br/&gt;elementary stochastic structure. Random processes and fields are&lt;br/&gt;considered under a wide range of assumptions: Gaussian, Gaussian&lt;br/&gt;subordinated, stable, stationary, self-similar, some non-stationary, and&lt;br/&gt;others. In addition to establishing and understanding special wavelet&lt;br/&gt;decompositions, questions regarding their use in simulation, analysis and&lt;br/&gt;modeling are also addressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project adds to the recent growth of the multi-scale&lt;br/&gt;(multi-resolution) approach where observed phenomena are considered at&lt;br/&gt;different scales (resolutions). This approach where wavelets play a&lt;br/&gt;central role, has found successful applications in numerous fields such as&lt;br/&gt;medical imaging, turbulence, de-noising, astronomical and Internet traffic&lt;br/&gt;data analysis. The goal of the project is to develop a new&lt;br/&gt;multi-resolution framework that is suitably adapted to random phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;Despite some progress, such multi-resolution framework has been missing at&lt;br/&gt;a fundamental level. The developed framework should provide novel analysis&lt;br/&gt;tools and conceptual perspectives, for example, establish new connections&lt;br/&gt;between models in discrete and continuous times, shed light on simulation,&lt;br/&gt;which has become an indispensable tool of any scientific research, or be&lt;br/&gt;useful in modeling through the multi-scale approach. The project should&lt;br/&gt;also be of direct interest to and enhance ties between researchers in many&lt;br/&gt;areas of Science such as Applied and Pure Mathematics, Physics, Signal&lt;br/&gt;Processing, Probability and Statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
