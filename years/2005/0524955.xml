<AbstractNarration>Christina Halperin, under the supervision of Dr. Wendy Ashmore, will conduct a study on Classic Maya figurines from the Motul de San Jose polity, Guatemala.  Clay figurines are hand-sized depictions of humans, animals, and supernatural beings and are often considered to have been used in rituals.  The research will investigate the centralized or decentralized nature of figurine production and distribution systems at the civic-ceremonial site of Motul de San Jose and its surrounding satellite centers.  It is proposed that centralized state control over figurine production indicates a corresponding control over the creation and dissemination of ritual objects and ideological symbols of identity.  On the other hand, commoners and non-elite groups possess relatively more autonomy in the domains of religious and social expression if production and distribution systems are decentralized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Motul de San Jose is an ideal location for a figurine study because previous test-pitting has revealed preliminary evidence of figurine production and has uncovered over 1,800 figurine fragments from the site and four of its satellite centers.  Building on this work, a geophysical survey and archaeological excavation program will target high probability areas of Motul de San Jose and a satellite center, Chakokot, to identify evidence of figurine production workshops.  Laboratory analysis of iconographic and technical attributes will detect distribution and consumption patterns of figurines, and a chemical paste composition analysis (Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis) will quantifiably assess relative differences in paste recipes and access patterns to non-local figurines.  Together, these data will provide multiple lines of evidence for understanding figurine production and distribution systems in a regional context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will contribute to an understanding of ritual items in the political economy of state societies.  This study is in the position to challenge existing models of craft production because most models are based on a dichotomy of "prestige" and "utilitarian" items to the relative exclusion of non-prestige ritual objects.  In addition, an examination of the economic nature of ritual objects like figurines sheds light on the ideological and social integration of a state system.  The extent to which a state controls the procurement and dissemination of such objects provides one avenue for assessing the degree to which religious and social symbols were state-integrated or state-imposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dissertation research will broaden the graduate student training of the co-PI (Halperin) and help train at least one Guatemalan student in the methods and techniques of archaeology.  Currently, a great deal of interest in the ancient Maya exists in the town of San Jose where the archaeological portion of the work is to be conducted.  Some of the Itza Maya women in the town have noted that they would like to start a women's organization revolving around traditional crafts and knowledge.  The documentation of ancient Maya craft production and distribution systems and the dissemination of this knowledge (by interacting with community members and providing photographs and archaeological reports to town officials and the local library) will bring greater awareness of past practices that are a concern to contemporary Maya peoples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
