<AbstractNarration>Models of landscape evolution in the face of repeated glaciation incorporate&lt;br/&gt;assumptions about glacial sliding that are in need of field verification. Temperate glaciers slide&lt;br/&gt;when water pressures are high. As primary subglacial erosion mechanisms are attributable to&lt;br/&gt;sliding of the glacier over its bed, the spatial and temporal pattern of sliding, and of the&lt;br/&gt;subglacial drainage network that control it, are important to understand. The proposed research&lt;br/&gt;acts upon hypotheses generated in two recently completed NSF-supported grants in which 1) the&lt;br/&gt;sliding field on the small Alaskan Bench glacier was carefully documented using continuous&lt;br/&gt;differential GPS, reaching its maximum speed at times of highest water storage within the&lt;br/&gt;glacier, and 2) the annual outburst flood of Hidden Creek Lake beside the much larger Kennicott&lt;br/&gt;glacier was shown to greatly perturb the hydrologic system. The 400 m thickness of the&lt;br/&gt;Kennicott Glacier allows much more rapid collapse of the subglacial drainage network than on&lt;br/&gt;the 150 m thick Bench Glacier during times of low snowmelt input to the glacier surface. As the&lt;br/&gt;snowmelt input increases again, the subglacial plumbing system must re-grow, during which&lt;br/&gt;time it should re-pressurize, promoting another period of sliding. If this is the case, then glacial&lt;br/&gt;thickness emerges as a primary control on the total annual sliding of a glacier, and therefore on&lt;br/&gt;the ability of a glacier to erode the landscape. The proposed research takes advantage of the&lt;br/&gt;accessibility and size of this Kennicott Glacier to investigate in detail the sliding history of this&lt;br/&gt;large temperate glacier and its association with both the seasonally-evolving water storage and&lt;br/&gt;pressure fields, and the inevitable annual Hidden Creek outburst flood.&lt;br/&gt;In this pilot project, the following hypotheses will be tested, in the hope that the data&lt;br/&gt;generated will serve as proof that the work is both tractable and productive of insight into the&lt;br/&gt;system.&lt;br/&gt;* Short-lived sliding increases will occur during ice dammed lake outbursts.&lt;br/&gt;* Sliding anomalies at the Kennicott Glacier occur in association with synoptic variations in&lt;br/&gt;melt inputs.&lt;br/&gt;* Long, thick glaciers, like the Kennicott glacier, will experience both more total sliding than&lt;br/&gt;thin glaciers, and multiple sliding events within a single melt season.&lt;br/&gt;The data to be collected include time series of: glacier surface motion, using multiple GPS&lt;br/&gt;receivers on the glacier run in differential continuous mode; water inputs by snowmelt and&lt;br/&gt;outputs from the exit river to constrain evolution of the water balance; englacial water pressures&lt;br/&gt;at several locations along the subglacial flood route that take advantage of side-glacier lakes and&lt;br/&gt;moulins; water chemistry at the outlet stream. Taken together, this data will directly test an&lt;br/&gt;existing model of linked glacial dynamics and subglacial network evolution.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. As the research will be accomplished near the Wrangell St Elias National&lt;br/&gt;Park's primary entrance near McCarthy, the research on the Kennicott Glacier is ideally situated&lt;br/&gt;to allow direct communication of both our scientific methods and results to the public. As in&lt;br/&gt;prior work, public talks will be given to national park visitors in formal seminars. Activities will&lt;br/&gt;be coordinated with the Wrangell Mountains Center, a private non-profit institute dedicated to&lt;br/&gt;education and research, through their Alaska Wildlands Studies, a 7-week field course accredited&lt;br/&gt;for college students through UC Santa Barbara. Guest lectures on principles and field techniques&lt;br/&gt;of glaciology and glacial geology will be given, and opportunities for involvement of its these&lt;br/&gt;students in the field work will be offered. The research will employ and train one Ph.D. student&lt;br/&gt;from CU, and at two undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
