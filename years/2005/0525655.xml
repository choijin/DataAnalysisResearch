<AbstractNarration>Metallic deposition by meteor ablation in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere is quantified by lidar observations of meteor trails, and the relationship between the quantified meteoric deposition and long-lifetime metallic layers is explored. The required observations are accomplished with upgraded resonant lidar systems at the Arecibo Observatory. The extant potassium resonant lidar system is first modified to sample every lidar return pulse, improving temporal resolution within the beam to 35 ms and altitude resolution to 150 m in the upper mesosphere. Following that upgrade, including development and application of real-time signal processing algorithms, the Fe, Ca, Ca+, and Na lidar systems are also upgraded. The ratios of meteor tail metals to metallic content in sporadic layers is used to improve our understanding of the dynamic and chemical processes that lead to metallic layering in the atmospheric region. The meteor trail metallic deposition rate is also used to calculate direct metallic deposition to the atmosphere on a global scale.</AbstractNarration>
