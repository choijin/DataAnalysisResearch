<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this major research instrumentation grant is to acquire a multimode scanning probe microscope, critical for the success of to an ongoing research at Milwaukee School of Engineering. The importance of the proposed equipment stems from the unique opportunities it offers to analyze materials at the mesoscale and submicron scale. The specific capabilities of the microscope will be used to achieve the following research objectives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perform chemical modification experiments at the submicron level to analyze friction and&lt;br/&gt;improve wear behavior of metal matrix composite (MMC) materials currently employed&lt;br/&gt;in Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF)-based processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gain and improve understanding about the fatigue development and failure mechanism in&lt;br/&gt;rolling contact powder materials used in the manufacturing of highly loaded gears&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The implementation of SPM in these and related research projects should result in&lt;br/&gt;substantial improvement of our fundamental understanding of the areas of interest. The research on MMC materials will bring deeper insight in the complex relationship between fundamental mechanical properties and microstructure parameters on one hand and wear resistance on the other. Probing the composite materials at the submicron scale using the SPM will allow us to enhance our knowledge about the fundamental interactions of chemical modifiers with the surfaces of the various phase particles and how exactly the frictional and wear properties of the particles change. Ultimately it will result in improving the wear properties of the MMC by finding appropriate modifiers and treatment conditions. In the area of rolling contact fatigue analysis crucial information for identifying and understanding the mechanisms in which failure occurs and progresses will be revealed. Based on theses results, the effects of process parameters such as material composition, heat treatment conditions and surface residual stresses will be assessed. These studies are essential for the development of materials especially suitable for rolling contact fatigue applications and manufacturing parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed major research instrumentation will substantially facilitate bringing the&lt;br/&gt;revolutionary ideas of nanotechnology to our current and future engineering students through laboratory experiments, undergraduate and graduate research activities. It will create challenging opportunities for students with solid foundation in engineering to participate in advanced analysis, design and fabrication research as part of MSOE's RUI and REU programs. The scanning probe microscope will become a merging point of the existing multidisciplinary research efforts at MSOE by bringing faculty with wide-ranging expertise together to solve the interdisciplinary problems of our future technologies. One of the reasons of the University's success has been its ability to establish novel programs and facilities whenever new scientific and technological developments provided opportunities. MSOE has strong ties with industry and&lt;br/&gt;the tradition of providing it with well educated engineers as well as technological expertise and solutions. The acquisition of the SPM and the research that it facilitates will clearly contribute to further success in this direction.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
