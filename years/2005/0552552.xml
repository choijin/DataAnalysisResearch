<AbstractNarration>This is a  summer  research opportunity to 1) educate students on the interconnected nature of the watershed; 2) mentor them in research  projects focused on the Maumee River and Lake Erie health from environmental, biological and social perspectives; and  3) encourage students to pursue careers in science. Due to the historic concern for the health of the Lake Erie watershed, the University of Toledo has developed key multidisciplinary  research initiatives focused on the Maumee River and Lake Erie. Among the Great Lakes, Lake Erie is unique in that its  water quality problems primarily result from specific anthropogenic factors of agricultural pollution and urbanization.  Major problems facing communities are soil erosion, transport and deposition in the mouths of streams; introduction  of invasive species; and contamination by heavy metals, pesticides and E. coli bacteria. The interdisciplinary approach  will emphasize the watershed system for this contribution to the REU program with water quality issues transcending  the geographic setting. Nationally, government agencies, industry and the public are at odds over how to improve water  quality in the nation's streams and lakes.     Students are paired with faculty and graduate students to undertake research projects that relate to  the students' specific areas of interest.  Projects are typically subsets of the faculty member's major research programs,  and thus involve the undergraduate student in important (funded) projects that will likely be published in peer-reviewed  journals. REU students gain a broad understanding of environmental issues through interaction  with mentors and community and agency collaborators through joint efforts to remediate watersheds and gain career  opportunities.  Students learn techniques of sample collection and analysis (soil, water, and biological), state-of-the-art  data analysis and oral and written scientific presentation techniques. This REU program will assist the nation in meeting the challenge of degraded urban waterways  and recruiting trained environmental scientists. The group has the expertise and research facilities to specifically  investigate these issues in Great Lakes watersheds.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
