<AbstractNarration>49 new Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, 5 advanced (including low frequency) ionosondes, and five fluxgate magnetometers are distributed throughout South America in response to a conspicuous community need to understand the day-to-day variability of the low latitude and southern magnetic latitude ionosphere. The data stream produces a real "now-casting" and forecasting capability of ionospheric irregularities known as equatorial spread-F. The primary research target is prediction of radio frequency communication and navigation scintillations that are caused by these ionospheric irregularities. Distributed along a chain near 70 degrees west (70o W) longitude, from 32 degrees south (32o S) to 8 degrees north (8o N) latitude, the ionosonde chain and magnetometers provide unprecedented information concerning traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs), and gravity wave morphology, in addition to the GPS information on total electron content (TEC).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funding provided by the MRI grant made possible to design and construct the first distributed observatory in South America.  The distributed observatory is a new concept and consists of using simultaneously several small instruments operating at different locations.  A region, as large as a continent, can be probed and studied when measurements from all the small instruments are assembled together.  By providing Internet connectivity and the necessary software to each instrument, the scientific information can be gathered in a real-time basis in a single server for further dissemination and analysis.  The new processing is oriented to forecast the state of the ionosphere (300 km altitude).  The low latitude ionosphere, as it exists over South America, is a very unstable media where large density depletions, structures, and irregularities commonly develop during the night that affect the integrity and performance of the global positioning system (GPS) navigation and communication systems.  Our distributed observatory consists of three (3) different types of instruments: GPS receivers, magnetometers and Vertical Incidence Pulsed Ionospheric Radar (VIPIR) ionosondes.  We are presently managing 47 GPS receivers, 5 magnetometers and 1 VIPIR ionosonde.  The GPS receivers used for scientific purposes measure both frequencies and are able to observe the total electron content between the receiver and the altitude of the satellite (~20,000 km).  Magnetometers are quite inexpensive instruments that measure any variation of the magnetic field of the Earth due to currents that circulate at 100 km altitude.  Magnetometers can provide the electric fields, which are one of the drivers of the ionosphere.  The 5 magnetometers have been placed at key locations across South America to measure the variability of the electric fields in the South American region.  The ionosondes are low&ndash;power radars designed to measure density profiles of the ionosphere.  Instruments belonging to the distributed observatory have been installed in the countries of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru.  The distributed observatory has measured for the first time the pronounced day-to-day variability of the longitudinal extension of density depletions that exist across South America, and it is providing clues on this variability.  We have also observed small changes in the ionospheric densities that are highly correlated with the maximum altitude of the Andes.  These observations imply that the presence of the Andes can modify the normal behavior of the densities at altitudes as high as 300 km.  During the tenure of this Grant, the Boston College distributed observatory has nurtured new technological expertise for space sciences in the form of scientific projects, equipment development, and graduate-level aeronomy courses in different South American countries.  These international activities have had a positive feedback on the distributed observatory project.  In Colombia, the distributed observatory has awakened interest in conducting investigations on the local ionosphere.  A Space Weather course is presently part of the curriculum at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia.  In Bolivia, our instrumentation has originated the establishment of collaborations between Boston College the Instituto Geografico Militar and the newly formed Bolivian Space Agency.
