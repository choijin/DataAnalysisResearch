<AbstractNarration>Proposal ID: 0524853&lt;br/&gt;Title: Multi-Model Anomaly Detection for Web-based Applications&lt;br/&gt;PI: Giovanni Vigna&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Web-based systems are a composition of infrastructure components, such as web servers and databases, and of application-specific code, such as HTML-embedded scripts and server-side applications.  While infrastructure components are usually developed by experienced programmers with solid security skills, application-specific code is often developed by programmers with little security training. As a result, vulnerable web-applications are deployed and made available to the whole Internet, creating easily-exploitable entry points for the compromise of entire networks. Unfortunately, existing signature-based intrusion detection solutions are not sufficient because Web-applications often implement custom, site-specific services for which there is no known signature or model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to develop intrusion detection tools that use novel anomaly detection techniques to autonomously learn the normal behavior of web-based systems. These tools will enable the detection of known and unknown attacks against both standard and custom-developed web-based applications without requiring expert knowledge.  This effort is developing a multi-stream, multi-model anomaly detection approach to provide a more effective characterization of the behavior of web-based applications.  The use of multiple anomaly models applied to different event streams (such as network packets, web requests, and system calls) allows for the creation of rich, multi-dimensional profiles that characterize different aspects of the behavior of web applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These intrusion detection tools have the potential of providing early warning against novel attacks and can be easily deployed on existing systems without requiring substantial security expertise. As a consequence, these tools will substantially improve the security of a wide range of critical applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
