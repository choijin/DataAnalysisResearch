<AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;A History of the "Coral Reef Problem," from Explorations to Explosions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to produce a history of what became known&lt;br/&gt;as the "coral reef problem," from European naturalists' first explorations&lt;br/&gt;in the Pacific to the mid-twentieth century, when new types of coral&lt;br/&gt;research were made possible through the aftermath of the U.S. nuclear&lt;br/&gt;weapons testing programs at the coral atolls of the Marshall Islands. This&lt;br/&gt;question consumed participants ranging from naval policymakers to&lt;br/&gt;science administrators, and it was taken up by a diverse but mutually&lt;br/&gt;recognized group of naturalists and scientists from a variety of distinct&lt;br/&gt;backgrounds and disciplines. What united them was a common discourse&lt;br/&gt;on the formation of coral reefs, but what divided them promises to offer&lt;br/&gt;insights into the practice of studying nature and the ways of formulating&lt;br/&gt;theories as they changed over this time.&lt;br/&gt;Scientists have used coral reefs as a place to juxtapose kingdoms of&lt;br/&gt;nature, the present and the past, and conceptions of the individual and the&lt;br/&gt;community. Reefs have constituted a point of intersection for many of the&lt;br/&gt;classic notions of how the study of nature should be divided: they are at&lt;br/&gt;once animal, vegetable, and mineral. The "life" of a single reef unites the&lt;br/&gt;present and the ancient past. They are renowned as complex ecosystems,&lt;br/&gt;but students of their growth and shapes have treated them as organic&lt;br/&gt;individuals.&lt;br/&gt;For these reasons, the coral reef problem at issue in this dissertation has&lt;br/&gt;been of sustained intellectual significance to scientists over the past two&lt;br/&gt;hundred years. The project will be a history of the ideas those scientists&lt;br/&gt;produced. And when science has commanded the attention of politics and&lt;br/&gt;the fascination of society-as over evolution and the Bomb-coral reefs&lt;br/&gt;have been the experimental and explosive proving ground for some of&lt;br/&gt;science and culture's deepest reaching questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project will be of interest, then, to anyone who hopes to understand&lt;br/&gt;how science has brought coral reefs from the periphery of our&lt;br/&gt;understanding to the center of our conceptions of what is most complex,&lt;br/&gt;fragile, and valuable about nature. It will also be of substantial relevance&lt;br/&gt;to historians, philosophers, and science teachers interested in the way that&lt;br/&gt;scientific problems have been asked, answered, challenged, and tested&lt;br/&gt;during the development of modern professional science. This project&lt;br/&gt;shows how members of very different scientific disciplines-natural&lt;br/&gt;historians, geologists, zoologists, ecologists, and physical geographers-&lt;br/&gt;set about attacking the exact same question: how are coral reefs formed?&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
