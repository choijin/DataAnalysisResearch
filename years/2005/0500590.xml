<AbstractNarration>In this project the principal investigator will apply methods from&lt;br/&gt;computability theory and other branches of logic and theoretical computer&lt;br/&gt;science to study the effective content and proof-theoretic strength of&lt;br/&gt;various areas of mathematics. In particular, he will concentrate on&lt;br/&gt;effective randomness, computable model theory, and reverse mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;effectiveness of combinatorial principles. He will study the relative&lt;br/&gt;randomness of reals, using methods from computability theory and&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic information theory, concentrating in particular on the&lt;br/&gt;K-trivial reals, a natural class of reals that are far from random with&lt;br/&gt;with many compelling properties and applications. In computable model&lt;br/&gt;theory, he will continue the development of methods to address issues&lt;br/&gt;raised by effectivizing model-theoretic notions, including the&lt;br/&gt;relationships between the different ways that a given structure may be&lt;br/&gt;effectivized; the relationships between the degree of effectivity of&lt;br/&gt;different models of theories with few models; and the degrees of special&lt;br/&gt;models, such as prime, homogeneous, and saturated models, of complete&lt;br/&gt;decidable theories. He will also study computability-theoretic and&lt;br/&gt;proof-theoretic aspects of combinatorial principles such as versions of&lt;br/&gt;Ramsey's Theorem and principles related to partial and linear orderings,&lt;br/&gt;exploiting the connections between effective mathematics and the reverse&lt;br/&gt;mathematics program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of the effective content of mathematics has received increasing&lt;br/&gt;attention in the last few decades. It is a natural outgrowth of the&lt;br/&gt;efforts to understand and formalize the notions of algorithm and&lt;br/&gt;computable function undertaken in the early part of the twentieth century.&lt;br/&gt;It is of both pure mathematical and foundational interest, and has&lt;br/&gt;important connections with computer science. This project aims to further&lt;br/&gt;our understanding of how structure affects computability, and how&lt;br/&gt;computability interacts with other fundamental notions of modern&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and foundations of mathematics, such as randomness and&lt;br/&gt;proof-theoretic strength. Computability theorists have developed a highly&lt;br/&gt;successful theory of relative computational complexity of sets of numbers,&lt;br/&gt;which, in addition to its intrinsic mathematical interest, has been&lt;br/&gt;influential in theoretical computer science. One of the goals of this&lt;br/&gt;project is to continue the development of an emerging parallel theory of&lt;br/&gt;relative algorithmic randomness, which can act as a theoretical framework&lt;br/&gt;in which to consider questions such as: When should we say that an&lt;br/&gt;infinite set is more random than another, and what consequences does the&lt;br/&gt;relative randomness of sets have for their relative computational&lt;br/&gt;complexity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
