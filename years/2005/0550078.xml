<AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS) a consortium of more than 60 colleges and&lt;br/&gt;universities requests support for its Advisory Committee for Academic Diversity (ACAD) to&lt;br/&gt;produce a manual of best practices that addresses identification, recruitment and retention of&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minorities in the environmental and biological sciences, a critical need within&lt;br/&gt;the scientific community. The foundation for the manual will data and information presented at a&lt;br/&gt;research symposium sponsored by ACAD and OTS at Howard University last summer.&lt;br/&gt;ACAD is a standing committee of the OTS Board of Directors and is responsible for providing&lt;br/&gt;advice and council to OTS on broadening participation of underrepresented minorities at the&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate, graduate and professional levels. Since 1999, OTS has increased its efforts to&lt;br/&gt;attract minority students to the field of tropical initiatives such as ACAD and the Minority&lt;br/&gt;Scholars Program.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Creation of a manual of best practices is an important next step to increasing the number of&lt;br/&gt;African Americans, Hispanic, Native Americans and Pacific Islanders who pursue careers in the&lt;br/&gt;environmental and biological sciences. The Organization for Tropical Studies for much of its&lt;br/&gt;42-year history has primarily focused on working with private, elite colleges and universities.&lt;br/&gt;The ACAD committee through this project will foster greater participation of state, HBCUs,&lt;br/&gt;Hispanic Serving, Tribal colleges and universities in the OTS consortium.</AbstractNarration>
