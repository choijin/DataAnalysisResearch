<AbstractNarration>SES-0545634&lt;br/&gt;Jason Owen-Smith&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project examines organizational efforts to innovate using networks under constraints imposed by the expectations of public (stock market) and private (venture capital) investors in order to explain how the high-technology industries that comprise the U.S. Knowledge Economy (USKE) have come to be characterized by distinctive markets for technology and capital. Markets, which emerge as actors forge relationships and stake out positions that shape their future opportunities and outcomes, are social environments that define and coordinate economic action.  Within the USKE, different industrial markets arise as organizations seek novel information that will enable technological innovation through their networks while striving for the recognition of investors and analysts.  &lt;br/&gt;This project will demonstrate the important relationship between inter-organizational networks and institutional fields in three related analyses that seek to explain: (1) inter-industry variations in the effect organizational networks and identities exert on financial and innovative outcomes; (2) the behavioral sources of those distinct industrial markets; and (3) the appearance and effects of radical innovations that sometimes emerge when different industrial orders collide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to making fundamental contributions to theoretical and substantive knowledge about innovation, industrial change, and the social underpinnings of economic life, this research effort will generate a unique dataset that can serve as a resource for scholarly investigation in multiple fields. Conducting these analyses requires the collection of a longitudinal dataset that matches institutional features of industries, organizational characteristics and dynamic relational data with a panel of innovative and financial outcomes for multiple related industries.  This data collection effort will cover an estimated 4,665 organizations in the 72 most research intensive industrial classifications and their partners for a 31 year period stretching from 1975 to 2005. The project also contributes to the development of an interdisciplinary undergraduate program and infrastructure for research and teaching as well as providing systematically validated substantive knowledge to the public and to policy makers in a number of arenas.  Corporate managers and public sector research administrators, state and local policy makers seeking tighter linkages between technological and economic development, and federal agencies tasked to expand national scientific, technological, and economic competitiveness will be well served by research that examines innovation and organizational outcomes across numerous industries.  The project's focus on collaborative networks at the cutting edge of science and technology will also contribute to ongoing efforts to understand and develop tools to support large scale, inter-disciplinary collaborations and technology development efforts that span industry and academe.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Young high-technology companies face a pair of strategic dilemmas. They must conform to existing industry models while differentiating themselves from competitors and they must use relationships to signal status while prospecting for novel information. High-tech business models are capital intensive. Thus, young organizations require repeated cash infusions. Their raison d'etre is innovation, but few possess all the capacities necessary to move a new product or service from conception to market. As a result, many high-technology organizations turn to networks to access the resources and information that fuel discovery.  Garnering public and private equity investments requires that firms signal their membership in established segments of existing industries while also indicating their distinctiveness relative to peers and rivals. Network connections to cohesive clusters of existing partners offer clear indications of membership and status, but far-flung ties to diverse collaborators are the best source of the new ideas. The networks and identities necessary to secure capital and to pursue novelty are contradictory.   This research project sought to determine how organizations at the radical edge of research-intensive industries solve these problems; what their solutions mean for the development and maintenance of characteristic, industry-specific markets for technology, talent, &amp; capital; and whether those differences can account for the sometimes radical innovations that emerge from collaborative research &amp; development efforts at the frontiers of the knowledge-economy.  While data analysis is still underway we have developed a set of key findings that shed new light on the dynamics and outcomes of high technology industries. For instance:    The economic (stock market) value of publicly traded high technology companies depends upon their ability to simultaneously signal membership in existing industrial categories while presenting the grounds on which they are distinct from predecessors and rivals. States that are home to law firms and venture capital firms which are connected to each other through shared past experiences taking companies public produce a more diverse set of technology driven firms. Universities provide both formal (e.g. intellectual property licensing) and informal (e.g. well trained personnel) contributions to high technology industries. Few insitutions manage to do both effectively.            Last Modified: 04/01/2013       Submitted by: Jason Owen-Smith]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
