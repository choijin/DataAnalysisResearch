<AbstractNarration>This research will answer theoretical and applied questions about ecosystem recovery across broad temporal and spatial scales, specifically focusing on the recovery of tropical montane rain forest in southern Costa Rica.  The research is the first stage in a long-term study testing a novel restoration approach, planting islands of trees to serve as nuclei for recovery, and evaluating the importance of proximity to existing rain forest patches for recovery.  To address these questions 12 replicate blocks of three 0.25-ha plots will be established in abandoned agricultural lands over a 100 km2 area in southern Costa Rica. Plots will receive one of three treatments: (1) control - no planting, (2) planting the plot with native tree "nuclei" of three sizes, and (3) planting the entire plot with native tree species. These blocks will be split between areas surrounded by "low" and "high" forest cover. We will monitor tree seedling establishment of forest species in these plots, as well as in six remnant forest plots. In the third year, seed rain, microclimatic conditions, soil water potential, soil phosphorus, and seed/seedling herbivory will be measured in selected plots to evaluate alternative mechanisms underlying patterns of seedling establishment. This research constitutes an innovative collaborative research effort between scientists and farmers interested in integrating agricultural production and biological conservation, and consequently will yield ecological, social, and educational benefits. The results of this work will help improve tropical forest restoration efforts both locally and regionally, which has important consequences for conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services.</AbstractNarration>
