<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This proposal concerns policy synthesis and performance evaluation for complex systems. Research&lt;br/&gt;will focus on the development of methods to achieve reliability in complex networks that&lt;br/&gt;are subject to substantial variability. Speci.c topics include resource allocation, performance&lt;br/&gt;evaluation, and new approaches to fast simulation and adaptation. Power transmission networks&lt;br/&gt;are taken as a primary application of this research, and will guide the directions for theoretical&lt;br/&gt;research.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will build upon recent advances in stochastic systems and stochastic networks&lt;br/&gt;to bring new approaches to model reduction and policy synthesis for complex, interconnected&lt;br/&gt;systems. The project will also serve as a bridge between researchers in economics and&lt;br/&gt;control systems to synthesize recent innovations from these .elds.&lt;br/&gt;The most basic issue addressed in this project is complexity management. In a variety of&lt;br/&gt;applications one seeks control solutions of reasonable complexity in spite of the complexity of the&lt;br/&gt;system to be controlled. It is very important that the solution provide some intuition to the user&lt;br/&gt;for the purposes of both prediction and policy improvement.&lt;br/&gt;Centralized optimal control solutions will be used as a benchmark in analyzing decentralized&lt;br/&gt;policies, and as a tool for constructing appropriate market mechanisms to ensure reliability in a&lt;br/&gt;decentralized setting.&lt;br/&gt;Traditional economic analysis to address reliability in power distribution systems is based on&lt;br/&gt;a static (equilibrium) model. While much insight has been gained, just as in the design of a&lt;br/&gt;control system for an airplane, a static equilibrium model is inadequate to address robustness and&lt;br/&gt;reliability. The PIs have shown recently that it is possible to construct tractable dynamic models&lt;br/&gt;of power distribution systems that reveal insight on the sources of low reserves in a decentralized&lt;br/&gt;setting. The discovery of new methods to combat these de.ciencies is a major goal of this research.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental research on accelerated algorithms for learning and simulation has potential impact&lt;br/&gt;in various .elds, including computer vision and data mining. Similarly, the control techniques&lt;br/&gt;to be developed are based on minimal structural assumptions, and consequently there is high&lt;br/&gt;probability of crossover into various .elds.&lt;br/&gt;Research on large-scale electric power has tremendous potential commercial impact. A clear&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the dynamics of deregulated markets will provide for the .rst time a proper&lt;br/&gt;evaluation of the social value of reliability, and the construction of e.ective incentives and policy&lt;br/&gt;tools to ensure e.cient market outcomes. These results will provide forecasting tools for policy&lt;br/&gt;makers to predict behavior of users and suppliers, and design mechanisms to ensure reliable and&lt;br/&gt;e.cient service.&lt;br/&gt;A CSL-ECE-Economics Department seminar series on distributed networks will be initiated.&lt;br/&gt;Professors will be invited from across the country, and as far away as India to present recent work.&lt;br/&gt;This will strengthen existing collaborations within the University of Illinois as well as the broader&lt;br/&gt;research community in the networks area. The seminar series will also provide excellent training&lt;br/&gt;for the students involved.</AbstractNarration>
