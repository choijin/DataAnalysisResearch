<AbstractNarration>This project from an HBCU, acquiring a parallel and configurable computing framework using conventional PCs equipped with a set of FPGAs, develops application implementations that execute much faster than the best single/parallel PC implementation. Configurable computing systems allow the same hardware to be used for various applications for distinct parallel algorithms. Hence, rather than replacing expensive system hardware, new versions of a hardware architecture can be loaded into the same configurable integrated circuit reducing the system costs. A major goal in developing this system consists in automating the process of mapping algorithms onto a configurable computer in a transparent fashion. Projects using this implementation include:&lt;br/&gt;-Parallel configurable digital signal processing,&lt;br/&gt;-Parallel algorithm development for problems in applied mathematics and the computational sciences,&lt;br/&gt;-Parallel implementation of 3D image reconstruction for PET scanner data,&lt;br/&gt;-Modeling of a configurable digital signal processing subsystem for handheld electronic nose,&lt;br/&gt;-Cubic spline interpolation, and&lt;br/&gt;-Sensor-based supply chains.&lt;br/&gt;Each of these applications will be mapped onto the parallel configurable computing system to perform comparisons with the best single/parallel PC implementation and to make the appropriate optimizations to execute orders of magnitude faster on this parallel configurable computer. Moreover, the infrastructure supports the following research activities:&lt;br/&gt;-Detection of cancerous tumors using 3-D PET image reconstruction,&lt;br/&gt;-Onboard processing for control of spacecraft and other science data processing required by NASA scientists and engineers,&lt;br/&gt;-High performance image processing,&lt;br/&gt;-Odor remediation and assessment, and&lt;br/&gt;-Sensor-based supply chains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The work exhibits potential to bring serious savings to product tracking through their life cycle. The Auto-ID Center has estimated potential global supply savings between $150 to $300 billion a year. Through RFID deployment, Wal-Mart alone could save $8.36 Billion annually, including $600 million through avoiding stock-outs and $575 million avoiding theft. Furthermore, enabling under-represented students and faculty, this research takes place at a major HBCU with collaboration with other universities and federal agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
