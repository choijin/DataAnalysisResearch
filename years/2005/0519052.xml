<AbstractNarration>Though the trophic structure of marine ecosystems is known to have&lt;br/&gt;increased in complexity over time, methods of quantifying this change are lacking. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;research will expand upon promising preliminary work using Ca isotope ratios as paleoecological&lt;br/&gt;indicators and develop this isotopic system as a proxy for the trophic level of extinct marine mammals.&lt;br/&gt;By combining Ca isotope analyses with C isotope ratios, which vary with foraging habitat in marine&lt;br/&gt;ecosystems, this project will provide a new means to examine the structure of ancient marine vertebrate&lt;br/&gt;ecosystems. Since the trophic structure of foodwebs has a significant influence on the pathways by which&lt;br/&gt;nutrients and energy move within and between ecosystems, analysis of the Ca isotope composition of&lt;br/&gt;biogenic hard parts may aid in elucidating how nutrient cycling and energy flow have fluctuated over&lt;br/&gt;time. Furthermore, by expanding current knowledge of how ancient ecosystems functioned and how they&lt;br/&gt;differed from today s ecosystems, a44Ca measurements can help improve interpretations of how climatic&lt;br/&gt;and environmental perturbations have impacted or were impacted by the Earth s biosphere. Ultimately,&lt;br/&gt;this project will provide new insight into the evolution of whales, whose from a terrestrial ancestor&lt;br/&gt;represents one of the most remarkable transitions in the history of life on Earth.&lt;br/&gt;Although the ultimate objective of this research is to understand the role of temporal changes in&lt;br/&gt;foraging behavior in the evolution of Cetacea (the clade that includes living whales, porpoises, and&lt;br/&gt;dolphins), the influence on Ca isotope ratios of factors other than trophic level must be examined first in&lt;br/&gt;modern species before Ca isotope ratios can be applied to extinct species. Samples of marine mammals in&lt;br/&gt;four, distantly related groups (sirenians, mustellids, cetaceans, and pinnipeds) will be analyzed as a means&lt;br/&gt;of addressing the impact of phylogenetic history on a44Ca values; the degree of similarity of a44Ca values&lt;br/&gt;for species at the same trophic level will verify whether a44Ca values reflect trophic level differences&lt;br/&gt;regardless of evolutionary history. The C isotope composition of each sample will be analyzed as a proxy&lt;br/&gt;for foraging habitat preference; a stronger correlation between a44Ca with trophic level rather than a13C&lt;br/&gt;values will indicate that trophic level has a stronger influence on a44Ca values than the foraging habits of&lt;br/&gt;a species. Variation in a44Ca within a single individual will be explored by analyzing the Ca isotope&lt;br/&gt;composition of multiple skeletal elements from a single individual from each of the four modern groups&lt;br/&gt;of marine mammals sampled. Once the factors influencing a44Ca values in modern marine mammals&lt;br/&gt;have been constrained, the Ca and C isotope composition of Eocene and Oligocene cetacean and sirenian&lt;br/&gt;bioapatite will be analyzed to assess the potential of this proxy for paleoecological studies. The&lt;br/&gt;diversification of cetacean feeding strategies in the Oligocene should coincide with a large change in&lt;br/&gt;a44Ca and a13C values of cetacean bioapatite, providing a clear signal of whether original a44Ca values can&lt;br/&gt;be preserved and interpreted from the fossil record. Fossil bones of sirenians will also be analyzed as a&lt;br/&gt;control for potential changes in seawater a44Ca values, since the trophic level of this group has remained&lt;br/&gt;constant over time and any changes in the a44Ca values of this group will reflect changes in seawater&lt;br/&gt;a44Ca values.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. The broader impacts of this project are threefold. First, the grant will further&lt;br/&gt;the training and development of a recent Ph.D. who will be supported as a postdoc. Under the&lt;br/&gt;supervision of the PIs, this researcher will have primary responsibility for refining the methodologies,&lt;br/&gt;acquiring and analyzing the samples, and interpreting and disseminating the results. Second, the research&lt;br/&gt;will provide a new and potentially powerful paleoecological tool to the broader community that can be&lt;br/&gt;applied to other ancient marine ecosystems and, after further development, may also have applications in&lt;br/&gt;terrestrial ecosystems. Finally, the results will complement our increasingly detailed knowledge of whale&lt;br/&gt;evolution. Once the proposed research is completed, the ecological and morphological changes&lt;br/&gt;associated with the evolution of whales will be one of the best documented cases of macroevolutionary&lt;br/&gt;change in the vertebrate fossil record. Given the historical place of whale origins in anti-evolution&lt;br/&gt;polemics, this research will surely have lasting impact in undergraduate and K-12 class rooms.</AbstractNarration>
