<AbstractNarration>The site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital technology has already moved from the machine room to the desktop, and is now embedding&lt;br/&gt;itself fully in our daily lives, becoming a designed artifact. Todays undergraduates love designed&lt;br/&gt;technology, and with justification: the outsourcing of purely technical work is more common every day,&lt;br/&gt;while creative technical design work remains truly value-added and secure. Yet oddly, there are few&lt;br/&gt;educational and research programs that train future professionals for this environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three-summer Design Tech program will begin to address this lack, inviting exceptional&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students in computer science and design to an interactive visual design hothouse. The&lt;br/&gt;program is organized around several principles common to design and technology: celebrating creativity&lt;br/&gt;feeding the spark that motivates successful designers and researchers; embracing critique &lt;br/&gt;encouraging bold thinking and original work by making critique less threatening; focus on product &lt;br/&gt;increasing the understandability of design and technical theory by placing it in an applied context; social&lt;br/&gt;creativity  emphasizing the group dialog of successful creativity to improve teamwork and diversity;&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary teamwork  using cross-disciplinary teams to improve research and design quality; team&lt;br/&gt;diversity  bettering designed technology with broader ethnic and cultural participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design Tech students will be recruited from local womens and historically black colleges, pass&lt;br/&gt;through an orientation, be formed into project-centered teams, and work with investigators in semi-weekly&lt;br/&gt;meetings. Less frequent critique sessions inspired by design pedagogy will encourage independent and&lt;br/&gt;critical thought. Projects will target delivery at a final session Showcase open to the public. Research&lt;br/&gt;topics will emphasize interactive visual design, and be drawn from the existing research agendas of the&lt;br/&gt;four investigators, who are experts in graphics, visualization, artificial intelligence and design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;By bringing together the design and interactive computing communities in a&lt;br/&gt;research and educational environment, Design Tech will generate powerful intellectual ripples. Obviously,&lt;br/&gt;the research successfully performed by the undergraduates will have value, as will their learning about&lt;br/&gt;research and design. As researchers and designers work together on these research problems, they will&lt;br/&gt;find new solutions and perhaps more important, generate new problems. Similarly, as they cooperate on&lt;br/&gt;pedagogy, they will synthesize new techniques for making better designers out of researchers, and better&lt;br/&gt;researchers out of designers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;With its emphasis on diversity, Design Tech will have a broad impact on the&lt;br/&gt;technical education of women and minorities. The investigators will publish their pedagogical successes&lt;br/&gt;and failures on the web and in print, disseminating the results of their experiment. PI Watson is already&lt;br/&gt;organizing a new SIGGRAPH course on graphics and design as well as an ACM campfire on interactive&lt;br/&gt;visual design; his experiences in Design Tech will shape the thoughts he brings to and the content&lt;br/&gt;disseminates at those events.</AbstractNarration>
