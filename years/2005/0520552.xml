<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*** NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT ***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The physics of competing lowest energy states of electrons in selected electronic systems, tuned using high pressure or by varying slightly the chemical composition, will be examined. Magnetic resonance is the principal tool of our research, which is sensitive to the formation of inhomogeneous phases, as well as electron spin dynamics. It can be applied in a diverse set of extreme conditions that we continue to develop and expand on, including low temperatures, high pressures, and as wide a range of applied magnetic fields as is available. The principal interest is in learning of the nature of low-temperature phases accessed by the manipulation, and what controls the stability of one phase over another. The project involves researchers at many stages of their training, including undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*** TECHNICAL ABSTRACT ***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the course of this project, solid state magnetic resonance techniques will be employed to address current questions related to novel and competing ground states in selected correlated electron systems. The materials fall into two classes known for very different microscopic physics: itinerant ferromagnets and molecular conductors. In both cases, Coulomb interactions between charge carriers lead to an interesting variety of phases, including liquid-like states with low-temperature properties inconsistent with existing theories. These studies will lead to new scientific understandings of correlated matter, and new experimental techniques suitable for a broad range of&lt;br/&gt;applications. Young scientists, at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels, will be trained in the course of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
