<AbstractNarration>Slaman proposes to investigate the effective aspects of randomness. The central question&lt;br/&gt;to be answered is, "How can we evaluate the random content of an infinite binary&lt;br/&gt;sequence?" One case is well understood, that in which an infinite sequence X of 0's&lt;br/&gt;and 1's is random if and only if each digit is chosen independently and with equal&lt;br/&gt;probability for the values of 0 and 1. In this case, X's being effectively random has&lt;br/&gt;been equivalently characterized by Martin-Lof in terms of X's having the properties&lt;br/&gt;of almost all infinite sequences and by Kolmogorov and others in terms of X's being&lt;br/&gt;unpredictable and indescribable. Slaman proposes to study the non-uniform case, its&lt;br/&gt;associated criteria for effective randomness, and its possibilities for the sets of random&lt;br/&gt;sequences. Even the most basic questions are open. For example, for a given infi-&lt;br/&gt;nite binary sequence X, under what conditions does there exist a measure relative to&lt;br/&gt;which X is random? This is a classic mathematical problem, given an individual data&lt;br/&gt;set determine a distribution which would generate it. Qualitatively, a measure relative&lt;br/&gt;to which X is random concentrates on the nonrandom aspects of X and thereby separates&lt;br/&gt;those from the random ones. Other ways to quantify X's random content include&lt;br/&gt;the complexity of X's initial segments and X's ability to compute uniformly random&lt;br/&gt;sequences. The proposal is to investigate all of these and the relationships between&lt;br/&gt;them.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
