<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The United States and Japan have recognized Nanoscience and Nanotechnology as frontier areas&lt;br/&gt;of research with potentially widespread societal impact, promising to transform health,&lt;br/&gt;electronics, transportation, the environment, and national security. In both countries, significant&lt;br/&gt;investments in these areas have been made and their rapid growth is expected to continue in the&lt;br/&gt;future.&lt;br/&gt;To be successful, research and training efforts in this emerging arena have to be highly&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary and interactions will have to span not only across fields and professional hubs,&lt;br/&gt;but also across international boundaries, so that the strengths and resources available in each&lt;br/&gt;country can also benefit other countries. With this in mind, the Japanese Ministry of Education,&lt;br/&gt;Science, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) and the United States National&lt;br/&gt;Science Foundation (NSF) initiated the support of scientific exchange visits between the two&lt;br/&gt;countries. We propose to organize the next exchange visit to several Japanese universities for&lt;br/&gt;twelve US scientists early in their academic careers, with research interests broadly defined as&lt;br/&gt;Nanoscience and Bionanotechnology. The Japanese government will sponsor a similar trip of&lt;br/&gt;twelve young scientists from Japan to several US universities as the counterpart component in&lt;br/&gt;this exchange program. The focus on young scientists is driven by the premise that the&lt;br/&gt;possibilities for building long-term and meaningful partnerships are far higher if contacts are&lt;br/&gt;made early in one's career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impact of Proposed Research&lt;br/&gt;Links established between scientists in the US and Japan at the very early stages of their&lt;br/&gt;academic careers will lay the foundation for a long-term fruitful collaboration over an extended&lt;br/&gt;period, maximizing the likelihood for a successful global interdisciplinary effort and productive&lt;br/&gt;relationship between these two and other countries.</AbstractNarration>
