    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed for manufacturing&lt;br/&gt;high-density phase-locked fiber laser arrays that can be made with extremely high precision and&lt;br/&gt;quality that will be free from mechanically induced defects. The company has developed a novel&lt;br/&gt;technique for coherent power-combining a specially structured group of phase-locked fiber lasers&lt;br/&gt;in a common cladding so that their phases are synchronized in favor of the fundamental in-phase&lt;br/&gt;mode through strong evanescent wave interaction. It has been shown that the output of phase locked fiber lasers and amplifiers can provide extremely high power (multi-kW) with a good&lt;br/&gt;beam quality (M2 &lt; 1.5) in a compact package. Such a laser is very desirable for material&lt;br/&gt;processing and precision manufacturing and offers many attractive features, such as&lt;br/&gt;maintainability, transportability, and affordability. The Company has developed an efficient side-pumping technique by which a uniform gain can be established over a long fiber length far exceeding the absorption length. Combining a defect-free multi-core fiber with this side pumping technique, it will be possible to realistically scale the output power of a phase-locked fiber laser array up to multi-kW in a spot size of about 50 micron in diameter (equivalent to a laser intensity greater than 10 MW/cm2) without encountering catastrophic failure. Under Phase I, efforts will be focused on designing and experimenting with a defect-free phase-locked fiber array. In addition, experiments will be performed to verify the power-scaling law that is proportional to not only the fiber core area but also the length. Results will be used to formulate the prototype for the Phase II. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially, because fiber laser efficiency is at least 4 times higher than the solid-state laser and operates at a more desirable wavelength than the CO2 laser, it will have a much better chance to succeed in the market place to replace the existing solid-state and CO2 lasers, which have been used extensively as precision machine tools for present-day manufacturing in aerospace, automotive, ship-building, refractory metals, graphite, and composite materials industries. With these technological advancements, a multi-kW fiber laser with a highbrightness beam can be manufactured economically and reliably and can offer an order of magnitude increase in speed and high-resolution for precision manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>
