<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0535305&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Elisabeth Werner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports travel of US participants to a "Workshop on&lt;br/&gt;Asymptotic Analysis and Applications" in July 2006 at the&lt;br/&gt;Institut Henri Poincare in Paris, France.  The workshop is a&lt;br/&gt;component of the special trimester research program there on&lt;br/&gt;"Phenomena in Large Dimensions" and concerns properties of&lt;br/&gt;families of finite-dimensional objects as the dimension grows&lt;br/&gt;without bound.  Particular topics that fit this agenda are&lt;br/&gt;measure transport techniques, concentration of measure,&lt;br/&gt;quantitative measures of convex bodies, isoperimetric&lt;br/&gt;inequalities, and large deviation inequalities.  Some of the&lt;br/&gt;important features emerging in these studies are threshold or&lt;br/&gt;phase transition effects, similar to those seen in statistical&lt;br/&gt;physics or asymptotic combinatorics, and this work also seems to&lt;br/&gt;have connections to problems in computational complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mathematical description of a scientific or engineering&lt;br/&gt;question often requires lots of independent numbers, leading to a&lt;br/&gt;geometric space of high dimension.  For example, if you want to&lt;br/&gt;specify the location of one gas molecule in a room then you need&lt;br/&gt;to report the front/back, side-to-side, and up/down locations of&lt;br/&gt;the molecule, using three numbers. The direction and speed of the&lt;br/&gt;molecule's motion takes another three numbers, and so to describe&lt;br/&gt;enough of the molecule's current state to allow us to predict its&lt;br/&gt;future motion from position and velocity we would need six&lt;br/&gt;separate numbers in all.  If you want to track 100 distinct&lt;br/&gt;molecules of the air in the room then you will need 600&lt;br/&gt;independent numerical coordinates to collect all of the relevant&lt;br/&gt;measurements.  As these dimensions increase then the difficulty&lt;br/&gt;of sampling and computation go up rapidly, a phenomenon&lt;br/&gt;scientists and mathematicians sometimes call "the curse of&lt;br/&gt;dimensionality."  However, there are also patterns that emerge as&lt;br/&gt;dimension increases, and this grant for support of US travel to&lt;br/&gt;the international workshop described above will study some of&lt;br/&gt;these patterns that are recent discoveries.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
