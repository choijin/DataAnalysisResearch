<AbstractNarration>The PI plans to work on three related projects involving the combinatorics&lt;br/&gt;of Macdonald polynomials and the space of diagonal harmonics.  The first&lt;br/&gt;is an attempt&lt;br/&gt;to build on recent joint work between Haiman, Loehr and the PI which gives a&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial formula for type A nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;The existence of this formula in the type A setting suggests that similar&lt;br/&gt;formulas exist for other root systems; the discovery of such formulas&lt;br/&gt;would open up the subject significantly, as very few explicit identities of&lt;br/&gt;any kind have been discovered beyond the type A case.  The second project&lt;br/&gt;attempts to build on&lt;br/&gt;the combinatorial formula for (type A) symmetric Macdonald polynomials,&lt;br/&gt;which was discovered empirically by the PI and proved in subsequent joint&lt;br/&gt;work&lt;br/&gt;with Haiman and Loehr.  The main open problem in this regard is to find&lt;br/&gt;a combinatorial formula for the coefficients in the&lt;br/&gt;Schur expansion; as a step in this direction&lt;br/&gt;the PI describes a new conjectured formula for the special case of&lt;br/&gt;augmented hook shapes.&lt;br/&gt;The third project involves trying to prove a conjectured&lt;br/&gt;formula for the monomial expansion of the&lt;br/&gt;character of the space of diagonal harmonics, due to Haiman, Loehr, Remmel,&lt;br/&gt;Ulyanov and the PI.  This conjecture,&lt;br/&gt;which led the PI to the empirical formula for symmetric&lt;br/&gt;Macdonald polynomials mentioned above,&lt;br/&gt;has a number of implications to enumerative combinatorics and&lt;br/&gt;representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orthogonal polynomials are families of polynomials which satisfy an&lt;br/&gt;orthogonality condition, typically meaning that the integral of any&lt;br/&gt;two different elements of the family,&lt;br/&gt;against some given weight function, is zero.&lt;br/&gt;The study of orthogonal polynomials is several centuries old,&lt;br/&gt;and they have quite a number of applications throughout mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;science.&lt;br/&gt;Symmetric functions are polynomials in several variables which are&lt;br/&gt;invariant under any permutation of the variables.  They have a large number&lt;br/&gt;of applications to several branches of mathematics such as representation&lt;br/&gt;theory and&lt;br/&gt;the roots of polynomial equations.&lt;br/&gt;In 1988 Macdonald introduced a new family of orthogonal polynomials,&lt;br/&gt;which depend on a set of variables X and two extra parameters q,t.  They are&lt;br/&gt;symmetric functions in the variables X, and&lt;br/&gt;contain most useful symmetric functions as special cases.&lt;br/&gt;They were immediately recognized as being important to several area of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics&lt;br/&gt;including combinatorics and special functions.&lt;br/&gt;In 2000 Haiman proved they have a complicated interpretation in terms of&lt;br/&gt;an advanced,&lt;br/&gt;abstract and theoretical branch of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics known as algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;Macdonald's construction is indirect however, and neither it nor&lt;br/&gt;Haiman's interpretation&lt;br/&gt;give a way of easily describing these polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;Recently the PI discovered, and with Haiman and Loehr proved, a simple&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial formula for Macdonald's polynomials.  The PI is trying to&lt;br/&gt;apply this result to answer some of the open questions surrounding them.&lt;br/&gt;Macdonald and Cherednik now have a much more general construction which&lt;br/&gt;contains almost all&lt;br/&gt;previously studied symmetric functions and orthogonal polynomials as&lt;br/&gt;special cases.&lt;br/&gt;The PI, in collaboration with Haiman, is trying to extend the&lt;br/&gt;simple combinatorial formula to this more general construction.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
