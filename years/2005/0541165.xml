<AbstractNarration>Background&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern high-performance systems are chronically underutilized not because their job queues&lt;br/&gt;are short, but because each task uses just a small fraction of the power available on each node.&lt;br/&gt;Compiled code simply does not achieve a reasonable fraction of the available performance, despite&lt;br/&gt;years of work in academia and in research labs that aimed to improve the situation. Some of the&lt;br/&gt;performance gap is due to architecture and design; however, a portion of it is directly attributable&lt;br/&gt;to the design of  optimizing compilers. Standard optimization techniques fail to discover and fix such problems, in part because they operate at a procedure-level granularity and in part because the remedy requires the compiler to change its approach to optimizing that part of the code to use another order or another transformation scheme. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PI will develop a feedback-driven adaptive compilation harness&lt;br/&gt;that specifically targets improvements in small regions of underperformance. To make the regional&lt;br/&gt;scheme work, his team  will enhance and reformulate two powerful optimizations, rematerialization and&lt;br/&gt;reassociation, and re-scope others so that they operate on a regional rather than a global scope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will directly support graduate education at Rice. The positive research&lt;br/&gt;results will be taught in a Rice graduate course on the subject; the material will reach a broad&lt;br/&gt;audience because the teaching materials for the course are used at other institutions. The work in&lt;br/&gt;this project will add to the code base for the Rice University research compiler, which is distributed free of&lt;br/&gt;charge in source-code form to others in both academia and industry. The PI will use a combination of&lt;br/&gt;local funds and directed research projects to include undergraduates directly in this work.</AbstractNarration>
