<AbstractNarration>The theory of error estimation is of paramount importance to the&lt;br/&gt;computational sciences. Local temporal and spatial grid adaptivity&lt;br/&gt;help to minimize the discretization error at a low computational cost.&lt;br/&gt;In this project the investigator and graduate students pursue a study&lt;br/&gt;of model adaptivity in which the original model represented by a&lt;br/&gt;coupled system of partial differential equations is replaced by&lt;br/&gt;another one which is easier to solve. The main idea of model&lt;br/&gt;adaptivity is to use an appropriate splitting of the total error so&lt;br/&gt;that the discretization and the modeling error are estimated&lt;br/&gt;a-posteriori and controlled locally and globally. Realization of these&lt;br/&gt;ideas depends on a particular application and its numerical&lt;br/&gt;approximation as well as on the relevant quantities of interest which&lt;br/&gt;guide both the grid and model adaptivity. This project will focus on&lt;br/&gt;applications in porous media, in particular on those of multiscale and&lt;br/&gt;preferential type, and on their various conforming and non-conforming&lt;br/&gt;finite element formulations. The researchers will prove new&lt;br/&gt;theoretical results as well as will develop new adaptive algorithms&lt;br/&gt;whose prototype implementations will be available in public domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will lay foundations for a new class of fast and accurate&lt;br/&gt;computational methods for simulation of natural phenomena occuring&lt;br/&gt;under the Earth's surface such as flow of contaminated water through&lt;br/&gt;and over complex geological formations. While traditional methods use&lt;br/&gt;a fixed model of such phenomena as a basis for computational&lt;br/&gt;simulations, the novel ideas proposed in this research project will&lt;br/&gt;allow to discard those elements of a model which are computationally&lt;br/&gt;costly but which do not have significant impact on the solutions. The&lt;br/&gt;new methods proposed in the project will be evaluated from both&lt;br/&gt;theoretical as well as from practical point of view and can be used in&lt;br/&gt;place of costly sensitivity and parameter studies. The results of the&lt;br/&gt;project will be also applicable to other disciplines such as&lt;br/&gt;engineering design of multiscale materials, large scale simulations of&lt;br/&gt;neutron transport and biomedical applications. Undergraduate and&lt;br/&gt;graduate students will be involved in research and will be trained in&lt;br/&gt;the new and traditional adaptive computational methods and their&lt;br/&gt;applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
