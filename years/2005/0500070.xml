<AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;The increased demand for knowledge of small-scale behavior is making microrheology a key&lt;br/&gt;step in the understanding of biological systems, the design and use of advanced materials,&lt;br/&gt;and the novel applications of already existing materials. Most microrheological experiments&lt;br/&gt;and analyses to date have focused on linear viscoelastic properties, by correlating the&lt;br/&gt;random thermally-driven displacements of small tracers to the complex modulus through a&lt;br/&gt;generalized Stokes-Einstein relation, a process which is relatively well understood but which&lt;br/&gt;is limited in its scope to equilibrium systems. Many systems of practical interest are driven&lt;br/&gt;out of equilibrium and display nonlinear behaviors, but the microrheology work in this&lt;br/&gt;area has been scarce (conventional macroscale rheometers are used to measure both linear&lt;br/&gt;and nonlinear regimes), and the connection between micro and macroscale measurements&lt;br/&gt;is unclear. The need and interest in microscale measurements, whether due to the scarcity&lt;br/&gt;of the material or the size of system, makes microrheology an important technology, but&lt;br/&gt;unfortunately one which currently lacks fundamental understanding in many aspects.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research examines the relation between micro and macrorheology through&lt;br/&gt; theoretical studies, with a particular and strong emphasis on the `active' (driven) and nonlinear regime. &lt;br/&gt;This research is best described in terms of applications to colloidal dispersions, and will focus on such systems&lt;br/&gt;because they offer very well-defined and well-characterized materials, allowing for comparisons&lt;br/&gt;to macroscale measurements. However, the impact of this research extends beyond&lt;br/&gt;colloidal systems as the theoretical foundation and general conclusions are extendable to&lt;br/&gt;many complex materials, especially biomaterials. Specific issues such as shear thickening&lt;br/&gt;in microrheology, the effect of the size ratio (tracer size to typical medium length scale) on&lt;br/&gt;the `continuum approximation' and on microscale velocity fluctuations, and the interactions&lt;br/&gt;between pairs of moving particles leading to structure formation are addressed. This is the first attempt to analyze the nonlinear behavior of materials within the context of microrheology&lt;br/&gt;and provides a fundamental validation of microrheology as a sound technique, critical for&lt;br/&gt;its continued application and future growth.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: In a broader context, this research will engage PhD students who will&lt;br/&gt;become experts in colloidal physics and rheology, and who will go on to positions of leadership in industry and/or academia. &lt;br/&gt;To aid in the education of future generations of scientists and engineers, a microrheology section for the undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;chemical engineering laboratory at Caltech will be developed. To disseminate the research&lt;br/&gt;as widely as possible, in addition to publication in conventional technical journals, a website&lt;br/&gt;will be maintained with research results that are accessible to the general public. Since this&lt;br/&gt;research provides the theoretical foundation for a new experimental technique that has&lt;br/&gt;widespread application in science and technology, its impact is both very broad and deep.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
