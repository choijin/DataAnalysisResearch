<AbstractNarration>Project Summary  Proposal Section B&lt;br/&gt;Objectives and Methods&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic research vessels (ORVs) are a critical element of science, technology,&lt;br/&gt;engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research and education, but their access by&lt;br/&gt;persons with disabilities (mobility, hearing, visual, and cognitive impairments) is&lt;br/&gt;constrained by physical barriers (gangways, paths of travel about the vessel, vertical&lt;br/&gt;access, berthing and toilet facilities, communications, and signage) and cultural barriers&lt;br/&gt;(ignorance and attitudes).&lt;br/&gt;With the participation of a diverse steering committee of persons with disabilities, vessel&lt;br/&gt;operators, shipyards, ship designers, and academia, the project will facilitate the&lt;br/&gt;removal of barriers by assessing the degree of accessibility of ORVs and the science,&lt;br/&gt;technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education programs they support,&lt;br/&gt;and developing specific solutions for barrier removal. The results will be incorporated in&lt;br/&gt;an OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH VESSEL ACCESSIBILITY GUIDE of Best&lt;br/&gt;Practices and disseminated to stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The project will advance knowledge and understanding of shipboard accessibility by&lt;br/&gt;developing crosscutting solutions, applying lessons learned from the passenger vessel&lt;br/&gt;industry to ORVs, and disseminating results to stakeholders. The PI is a licensed&lt;br/&gt;Professional Engineer and naval architect, and an expert in passenger vessel&lt;br/&gt;accessibility, who will use his expertise, experience, and comprehensive resources to&lt;br/&gt;explore creative and original concepts for removing institutional and shipboard barriers.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of persons with disabilities in&lt;br/&gt;oceanographic research and education is the essence of this project, which will&lt;br/&gt;enhance the infrastructure for oceanographic research and education by removing&lt;br/&gt;physical and cultural barriers. Results, in the form of lessons leaned and best&lt;br/&gt;practices, will be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific, technological, and cultural&lt;br/&gt;understanding and awareness of challenges faced by persons with disabilities. Society&lt;br/&gt;at large will benefit by the transfer of project results to make the nation's 1,100 ferry and&lt;br/&gt;excursion vessel fleet more accessible to commuters and recreational boaters.</AbstractNarration>
