    <AbstractNarration>This project provides partial support for a Gordon Research Conference on Thin Film and Crystal Growth Mechanisms, to be held June 26-July 1, 2005 at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, MA. The goal of the conference is to advance understanding of complex chemical and physical processes that control the assembly of atoms and molecules into ordered crystalline solids. The conference includes sessions on the topics:&lt;br/&gt;o Quantum Dots and Semiconductor Growth&lt;br/&gt;o Thin Film Growth Dynamics&lt;br/&gt;o Control of Organic and Pharmaceutical Crystals&lt;br/&gt;o Dynamics of Crystal Growth&lt;br/&gt;o Novel Techniques&lt;br/&gt;o Colloidal Crystals&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;An evaluation of the progress and status of synthesis, processing, and control of thin film crystal growth along with current assessments of the most important developments in this interdisciplinary field will be of great value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of electronic/photonic materials in computing, data processing, and communications. The requested NSF funds will be used to facilitate participation in the meeting by young faculty, postdoctoral research associates and graduate students with attention to support for members of underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
