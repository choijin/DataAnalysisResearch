<AbstractNarration>The United States collects extraordinarily high-quality data on the S&amp;E workforce, both at the graduate and undergraduate level. The jewel in the crown is the SESTAT data collected by the National Science Foundation, which integrates three databases: The Survey of College Graduates, The Survey of Recent College Graduates, and the Survey of Doctoral Recipients.  University researchers who have received licenses to work with the confidential data have done most of the analysis of these data. Because of limited knowledge in the research community concerning the databases and their availability, there have not been many data users. A 2000 National Research Council review recommended increased use of the data and the need for increased interaction between NSF staff and outside researchers.  This project will be a one-day workshop - in the Fall of 2005 -- for users and potential users of the NSF data. The goals of the workshop are threefold: (1) Exchange information among users concerning creative uses of the data and research outcomes; (2) Broaden the base of users by familiarizing potential users with the data that is available and ways in which the data is currently being used as well as the potential for other kinds of use; (3) Provide feedback to SRS regarding the data and ways to enhance use.</AbstractNarration>
