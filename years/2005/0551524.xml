    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to study the joint determination of gender differences in labor&lt;br/&gt;market outcomes and the division of labor within the household. The PI's analysis is based on two sets of empirical observations. First, there are persistent gender differences in "adjusted" labor&lt;br/&gt;earnings and hours worked, at home and on the market. Second, there is a large variation in&lt;br/&gt;gender earnings differentials across industries and occupations. The PI's explore the hypothesis that these differentials arise endogenously from the interaction between the intra-household allocation process and labor contracting between firms and workers.&lt;br/&gt;The PI's propose that incentive problems on the labor market, due to private information on&lt;br/&gt;household decisions, play a crucial role in the emergence of unequal labor market outcomes&lt;br/&gt;across genders. In turn, the differential labor market outcomes influence gender roles within the&lt;br/&gt;household, thus generating a feedback mechanism. The presence of incentive problems implies&lt;br/&gt;that the earnings structure, as well as the earnings level, should be different across genders. The PI's preliminary empirical work with aggregate data is broadly consistent with this hypothesis. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed new work will extend the analysis in a number of directions. Theoretically, the PI's plan to&lt;br/&gt;use their framework to evaluate how technological progress in home production may influence&lt;br/&gt;gender differences in labor market outcomes and the household division of labor. Empirically, the PI's plan to use micro data to directly evaluate the predictions regarding the interaction between the&lt;br/&gt;labor market and the household, as well as the predictions on the earnings structure by gender.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The intended contribution of this project is twofold. The PI's propose the first, to their knowledge,&lt;br/&gt;equilibrium model of the feedback between the gender division of labor within the household and&lt;br/&gt;gender differences in labor market outcomes. Typically, supply side theories have been used to&lt;br/&gt;explain gender differences in earnings and employment and their evolution over time. These take&lt;br/&gt;as given the division of labor within the household and emphasize its role in causing unequal&lt;br/&gt;labor market outcomes. By contrast, in our framework, gender roles are endogenous. The&lt;br/&gt;centerpiece of their hypothesis is to identify the incentive problem in labor contracting as a source&lt;br/&gt;of statistical discrimination on the basis of gender.&lt;br/&gt;The PI's are also the first to rationalize the large variance in gender earnings and employment&lt;br/&gt;differentials across industries and occupations. The variation in the severity of incentive problems&lt;br/&gt;across industries and occupations can be related to differences in the earnings structure and home&lt;br/&gt;hours by gender, and within households across spouses. The proposed empirical analysis will use&lt;br/&gt;matched household and earnings data to directly evaluate these predictions.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will potentially be of interest not only to economists, but also to&lt;br/&gt;sociologists, as well as to policymakers. One important implication of the PI's framework is that&lt;br/&gt;gender equality on the labor market is intimately linked to equality in the household division of&lt;br/&gt;labor. Policies aimed at reducing gender disparities in earning opportunities are likely to fail if&lt;br/&gt;they do not include provisions to reduce the expected contribution of women to home production.&lt;br/&gt;The research will also be integrated with the PI's teaching, especially at the graduate level. It&lt;br/&gt;is expected that graduate research assistants will be introduced to important research skills and&lt;br/&gt;potential research topics to develop on their own.</AbstractNarration>
