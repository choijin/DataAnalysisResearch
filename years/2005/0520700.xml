<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to produce plastics in microorganisms that grow naturally in wastewater treatment plants and then to mix these plastics with wood fibers to create wood-composite products that are used in door, window, decking, siding, and roofing applications.  The approach to this research will be undertaken in three discrete tasks.  Task 1 will characterize PHA-rich biomass from selected WTFs, develop a time cycle assessment of PHA within WTFs, and establish a biopolymer properties matrix based on lab-scale biopolymer production.  Task 2 will evaluate critical biopolymer properties that impact the production and end-use performance of wood-composite products manufactured with wastewater biosolids.  Findings from Task 1 and 2 will be used to develop a virtual manufacturing model in Task 3.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop an environmentally benign manufacturing process that utilizes thermoplastics biologically derived on renewable carbon sources (sewage); the bacterial biomass would otherwise be disposed, often in a manner that produces greenhouse gases.  The process will reduce (1) our nation's reliance on fossil fuels, (2) additions to the global carbon budget, and (3) resource utilization in both the petroleum and timber industries.  The proposed study will advance discovery while promoting teaching, training, and learning through actively involving college students and K-12 teachers in research related activities. Significant educational and research related findings generated as part of the project will be disseminated by all participants in peer-reviewed science and educational journals; local, regional, and national conferences; local school districts; and a website constructed as part of this project.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
