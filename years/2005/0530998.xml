<AbstractNarration>Two conferences would disseminate research and best practices in the domain of science assessment.  The conference presenters would be the Principal Investigators of recent NSF-funded projects that studied approaches to assessing the science understanding of pre-college students.  The intended audience would be grades 3 - 12 teachers of science, science supervisors, school administrators and professional development providers.  Modeled after a recent NSTA-sponsored conference entitled "The Linking of Science and Literacy in the Classroom," the proposed conference format would be a combination of plenary sessions, panel presentations and small group discussion sessions.  The presenters would also contribute chapters to a book to be published following the conference, extending the dissemination to a much larger audience.  An Advisory Board of assessment experts has been established to guide the conference planning process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
