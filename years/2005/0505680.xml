<AbstractNarration>The PI will investigate several problems concerning the spectra of random&lt;br/&gt;matrices and random Schroedinger operators.  Foremost, the PI will&lt;br/&gt;continue his study of random matrices with no symmetry, establishing&lt;br/&gt;fluctuation results for linear spectral statistics, limit theorems for the&lt;br/&gt;spectral edge, and further investigating the connections between these&lt;br/&gt;ensembles and roots of random polynomials. In the realm of Hermitian&lt;br/&gt;random matrices, the PI will employ the Riemann-Hilbert Problem method to&lt;br/&gt;investigate the behavior of the Janossy densities for large dimensional&lt;br/&gt;'Unitary Ensembles'.  The goal is to then use these results to establish&lt;br/&gt;the speed of convergence of the largest eigenvalue distribution to its&lt;br/&gt;limiting Tracy-Widom distribution.  Finally, the PI will generalize his&lt;br/&gt;recent results on the distribution of the ground state eigenvalue of a&lt;br/&gt;one-dimensional periodic Schroedinger operator with White Noise potential&lt;br/&gt;to a broader class of random potentials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The random matrix models under study in this proposal have important&lt;br/&gt;applications to such disparate areas as multivariate statistics (principal&lt;br/&gt;component analysis), theoretical physics (energy levels and resonances of&lt;br/&gt;quantum systems) and electrical engineering (signal processing and&lt;br/&gt;wireless communication).  Schroedinger operators with random potential on&lt;br/&gt;the other hand have long been studied as fundmental models in disordered&lt;br/&gt;solids.  The PI brings to bear a variety of techniques from Probability&lt;br/&gt;and Analysis to study the detailed behavior of basic classes of random&lt;br/&gt;matrices and random Schroedinger operators in physically relevant limiting&lt;br/&gt;regimes.  An overall goal of this proposal is to uncover new&lt;br/&gt;commonalities, or universal properties, of these models through asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;analysis.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
