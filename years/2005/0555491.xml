<AbstractNarration> This experimental research program has two goals.  The first is to conduct experiments to understand ionization of highly excited, or Rydberg atoms by strong microwave fields at or above the orbital frequency of the valence electron in the Rydberg atom, and, secondly, manipulate the Rydberg atoms with somewhat weaker microwave fields. The objective in the first part of the project is to link ionization of atoms by low frequency electromagnetic fields to ionization by high frequency fields. In the former case the slowly varying electromagnetic field distorts the atomic potential, allowing the electron to escape. In the latter a photon is absorbed. The objective in the second part of the project is to manipulate the orbital frequency of the electron. The experiments will be carried out using atomic beams of alkali atoms. The atoms are excited to Rydberg states using pulsed dye lasers, and after the laser excitation they are exposed to a microwave pulse. The effect of the microwave pulse is determined by analyzing the final states, either by state selective field ionization of bound atoms or measuring the fraction of atoms ionized. The broader impact of the program involves education as well as applications to other fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
