<AbstractNarration>The overall purpose of this project is to increase significantly the enrollment and &lt;br/&gt;graduation rates of Indigenous students at Leech Lake Tribal College (LLTC) in science &lt;br/&gt;and mathematics and to increase their familiarity of related technology.  By achieving &lt;br/&gt;these increases, and working through the other interventions that are integral to this &lt;br/&gt;project, more students at Leech Lake Tribal College will choose to major in the math and &lt;br/&gt;science disciplines and continue their education at a four-year institution. Their familiarity &lt;br/&gt;with technology and its multiple uses will increase as well.  The success of our proposal &lt;br/&gt;requires that we recognize the importance of two concepts.  First, academic success of &lt;br/&gt;Indigenous students is clearly related to their feelings of self-worth and having a strong &lt;br/&gt;sense of who they are.  Second, their sense of identity is strongly tied to an Anishinaabe &lt;br/&gt;focus throughout the LLTC curriculum.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Four components will make up this project.  The current STEM infrastructure will be &lt;br/&gt;enhanced; community centers where LLTC currently has internet connectivity and &lt;br/&gt;computers will be improved to facilitate outreach efforts; a library learning center will be &lt;br/&gt;developed; and student services attention to recruitment will be enhanced (Harper &lt;br/&gt;2003).  Each component interconnects not only with each other but also with barriers &lt;br/&gt;associated with a social digital divide and with the four goals of the National Science &lt;br/&gt;Foundation.</AbstractNarration>
