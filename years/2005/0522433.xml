    <AbstractNarration>Bounded Conflict:&lt;br/&gt;The Consumer Price Index and American Political Economy, 1880 - 1985&lt;br/&gt;Since 1950, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has been one of the most potent economic&lt;br/&gt;statistics, largely because of its incorporation into automatic escalator clauses in union&lt;br/&gt;contracts and government programs (including everything from tax brackets to&lt;br/&gt;social security payments). Yet the CPI has also been very controversial: throughout the last&lt;br/&gt;fifty years, economists, labor officials, politicians have debated the significance and accuracy of&lt;br/&gt;the index without reaching a clear conclusion. In an award-winning dissertation, Thomas Stapleford &lt;br/&gt;explored the history of the CPI and its role in American political economy, describing how and why &lt;br/&gt;this ambiguous and embattled statistic became a central part of labor relations, such that by 1953 &lt;br/&gt;a Congressional committee could label it "the most important single statistic" in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;Building on that project, this research extends the analysis, both chronologically (carrying it&lt;br/&gt;through the early 1970s, when Congress began to place automatic escalator clauses in&lt;br/&gt;government programs) and comparatively (by examining the role of price indexes in other&lt;br/&gt;countries and the formal adoption of other statistics into government programs). This new work&lt;br/&gt;will form the basis for a book manuscript. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Although economic statistics are a central part of the modern state, historians are only&lt;br/&gt;beginning to integrate historical study of these artifacts with 20th century political, social, and&lt;br/&gt;economic history, and no such narratives exist for the United States. Turning to a different field, &lt;br/&gt;economists have written several short histories of price index theory, but have not examined the&lt;br/&gt;CPI's historical role in industrial relations or economic policy. By analyzing both theoretical &lt;br/&gt;debates about price indexes and the changing political function of the CPI, this project demonstrates &lt;br/&gt;how a rich historical account of economic statistics can illuminate questions in American history, &lt;br/&gt;such as how the form of economic statistics both reflected and shaped national economic policy, &lt;br/&gt;and the history of economics, such as why the CPI remained at odds with neoclassical price index &lt;br/&gt;theory through most of the 20th century. This study addresses broader issues, including the role of &lt;br/&gt;technical expertise and interest-group pressure in public policy, and tensions between reliance on &lt;br/&gt;highly complex statistics in government and the traditional values of liberal democracy .&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The wide resonance of these questions and the continuing debate over the nature of&lt;br/&gt;the CPI suggest the potentially large audience for this work. As the only historical&lt;br/&gt;analysis of the political context and function of the CPI, for example, this research will be useful&lt;br/&gt;for public policy analysts and politicians. The investigator intends to attract a general&lt;br/&gt;readership beyond academic historians by keeping the monograph relatively short (~90,000&lt;br/&gt;words) and confining technical details to an appendix or academic journal articles. Furthermore,&lt;br/&gt;some of the key conclusions will be presented in more popular forums (e.g., articles in political &lt;br/&gt;magazines), and thereby contribute to the continuing public discussion about statistics, public &lt;br/&gt;policy, and the cost of living.</AbstractNarration>
