<AbstractNarration>Roelofs, Wendell L.&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Evolutionary Genomics of Moth Sex Pheromone Desaturases&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Research will be conducted on a multigene family of desaturase genes unique among eukaryotes because they are found only in moth sex-pheromone glands.   These genes are key to the biosynthesis of pheromone components, and, thus, are involved in generating changes in the mating communication system.  Evolution of the pheromone blends, therefore, can be a key factor in the speciation process in these moth species.  This project takes the previous studies on the characterization of these genes in a new direction by looking at the organization and diversification of the genes at the genomic level.   An in-depth analysis of genomic DNA for the 4 different desaturase genes found in the European corn borer (ECB) moth has revealed the presence of at least 4 variants of the main desaturase used for pheromone biosynthesis.  Some interesting ancient transposable elements were found in these variants that can alter gene expression by inserting into or close to promoter elements or other regulatory elements.  These elements could provide important information on how these desaturase genes were duplicated and evolved in moths. Just recently an ECB bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library was generated and made public from ECB specimen obtained from the Cornell laboratory. It represents a tremendous resource because it allows for the analysis of very large segments of the ECB genome.  These large segments will be used to generate a physical map of desaturase genes in the ECB.  This information will reveal if the desaturase genes are clustered, how many clusters exist, and how both genes and clusters are organized across large segments of the ECB genome in relation to other genes and genetic elements.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Broader Impacts: The Roelofs laboratory has a long history of training post-doctoral fellows and Ph. D. students. Also, undergraduate students from Cornell University and Hobart College have been incorporated into the project to conduct summer and independent study research.  Students contribute to the research of the proposed project and gain valuable training on the molecular techniques involved. International collaborative efforts on the desaturase project also will continue, including a visiting scientist from China now present in the Roelofs lab for training on molecular techniques to identify desaturase genes. The investigators are active in presenting the work at professional meetings, to primary and secondary school classes, and to many local and legislative touring groups, in addition to publishing the results in prestigious scientific journals. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
