<AbstractNarration>This award will support to organize a multidisciplinary conference entitled "The Sixth Mississippi State - UAB Conference on Differential Equations and Computational Simulations" with a mission of providing a joint forum where mathematicians, scientists, and engineers from the academia and industry exchange research and education ideas. The conference is a collaborative endeavor between the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Mississippi State University and Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The co-sponsors of the conference are Engineering Research Center (ERC) at Mississippi State University, Electronic Journal of Differential Equations (EJDE), and Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA). This two-day conference will offer ten invited lectures by expert researchers and around 70 contributed papers. The majority of the funds will be used to provide travel expenses to the graduate students and new Ph.D.s. In particular, special effort will be made to encourage the participation of students and recent Ph.D.s from the underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lectures by the outstanding principal speakers and the participation and interaction of around 150 interdisciplinary researchers would significantly impact the development of this field. The primary objective of the conference is to optimally fulfill the aforestated mission, while at the same time to promote research and education in mathematical and computational analysis of differential equations and associated simulations. The conference will also provide graduate students and young Ph.D.s an opportunity to present their work, meet other researchers, educators and practitioners, learn of recent developments in the proposed interdisciplinary field, and produce a new generation of mathematical models and challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
