<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0505920&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Dan F. Knopf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will advance the search for canonical geometries by&lt;br/&gt;means of geometric heat flows. In light of the landmark progress&lt;br/&gt;made recently by Perelman in Hamilton's program to resolve the&lt;br/&gt;Geometrization and Poincare' Conjectures, this research area is&lt;br/&gt;undergoing a rapid and productive expansion. The powerful&lt;br/&gt;innovations and profound insights in Perelman's work contribute&lt;br/&gt;to the extraordinary power of Ricci flow as a tool for&lt;br/&gt;investigating the geometry and topology of Riemannian and complex&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. In virtually all known applications of Ricci flow, it&lt;br/&gt;is critical to have a deep understanding of the mechanisms of&lt;br/&gt;singularity formation. Therefore, the project will investigate&lt;br/&gt;four aspects of singularity formation. These four objectives are&lt;br/&gt;chosen to build upon the prior results and current research&lt;br/&gt;program of the PI and to be highly relevant to promising new&lt;br/&gt;applications of Ricci flow. The objectives are to study (1)&lt;br/&gt;asymptotics of Ricci flow singularity formation, (2) analysis of&lt;br/&gt;Ricci flow singularities in dimension four, (3) analysis of&lt;br/&gt;singularity models for Kaehler-Ricci flow, and (4) the structure&lt;br/&gt;of reduced geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A manifold is an object that - like our universe - looks like&lt;br/&gt;Euclidean space locally, but whose global topology and geometry&lt;br/&gt;may be much different. The broad goals of this project are to&lt;br/&gt;find optimal geometric structures with which to categorize&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. The methods used are certain partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations called geometric heat flows. The idea is to let a&lt;br/&gt;geometric object evolve in time in such a way that its geometry&lt;br/&gt;improves and simplifies, possibly after a change in topology. A&lt;br/&gt;geometric heat flow called the Ricci flow has just yielded major&lt;br/&gt;breakthroughs in two of the most difficult open problems in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. These successes provide great incentives to apply it&lt;br/&gt;to other challenging open problems and make it a very active and&lt;br/&gt;competitive field of research. The types of partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations studied in Ricci flow have much in common with those&lt;br/&gt;used to model the movement of oil in shale and in thin films,&lt;br/&gt;combustion in porous media, heat propagation, avalanches,&lt;br/&gt;population dispersal, the spreading of microscopic droplets, and&lt;br/&gt;certain effects in plasma physics. For this reason, methods&lt;br/&gt;developed in this project may have important applications to&lt;br/&gt;those areas of applied mathematics. The project will focus on the&lt;br/&gt;delicate analysis needed to understand such equations as they&lt;br/&gt;become singular. This analysis should have important broad&lt;br/&gt;applications, among which are the following. (i) The methods&lt;br/&gt;developed, especially asymptotic analysis, should extend to the&lt;br/&gt;practical applications mentioned above. (ii) The project will&lt;br/&gt;promote interdisciplinary interactions with physics, where there&lt;br/&gt;are many applications for geometric classification and flow&lt;br/&gt;techniques. For example, theorists in general relativity want to&lt;br/&gt;classify possible topologies of four-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;space-times. Researchers in string theory and mirror symmetry are&lt;br/&gt;interested in understanding certain six-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. The Ricci flow itself is an approximation to the&lt;br/&gt;renormalization flow for an important model in quantum field&lt;br/&gt;theory.  (iii) The project will benefit graduate education,&lt;br/&gt;because the PI will invest time helping students develop&lt;br/&gt;expertise in relevant areas of geometry, analysis, and topology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
