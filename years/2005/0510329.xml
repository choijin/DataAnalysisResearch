    <AbstractNarration>Cosmogenic isotopes such as 10Be and 26Al are widely used to determine the age&lt;br/&gt;and exposure histories of landscape features. Such information is critical to&lt;br/&gt;understanding the timing and rate of geologic processes such as active fault ruptures,&lt;br/&gt;glacial advances, soil formation and erosion of mountain belts. However, the utility of&lt;br/&gt;these isotopes is limited by the high cost and intense labor associated with producing a&lt;br/&gt;single measurement. This project proposes development of cosmogenic 3He as a dating&lt;br/&gt;tool in common accessory mineral phases such as apatite, sphene and zircon. If&lt;br/&gt;successful, this technique will be unique in several respects. First, it will allow rapid and&lt;br/&gt;inexpensive cosmogenic dating of a wide range of rock types, thus increasing the number&lt;br/&gt;of samples that can be dated in a single study. Second, because 3He is stable and has a&lt;br/&gt;very high production rate, it may prove useful in combination with other cosmogenic&lt;br/&gt;nuclides to address problems such as paleoaltimetry, ancient exposure and burial histories&lt;br/&gt;(100 my time scales), and dating of archaeological sites and artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;Several technical challenges need to be overcome before 3He in apatite, sphene&lt;br/&gt;and zircon can be used as a cosmogenic dating tool. First, it is necessary to develop&lt;br/&gt;analytical procedures such that the measurement of small amounts of 3He in the presence&lt;br/&gt;of large quantities of radiogenic 4He is not hampered by the "tailing" of low energy 4He&lt;br/&gt;ions onto the 3He peak, or by space charge effects at high 4He abundances. The former&lt;br/&gt;is likely not a problem based on the demonstrated abundance sensitivity at mass 3, and&lt;br/&gt;the latter will be addressed using a spike of standard gas inlet during the measurement&lt;br/&gt;of an unknown to calibrate the instrument at that He pressure. A second challenge is to&lt;br/&gt;verify the production rate of 3He, which will be done using samples of known exposure&lt;br/&gt;age from glacial moraines in the Sierra Nevada and Nepal Himalaya. Implicit in this task&lt;br/&gt;is identifying and correcting for non-cosmogenic sources of 3He such as inheritance from&lt;br/&gt;fluid inclusions and production via 6Li(n, alpha) + time -&gt; 3He.</AbstractNarration>
