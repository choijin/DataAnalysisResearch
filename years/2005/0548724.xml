<AbstractNarration>Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society, the 13th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (and associated events, including a workshop and three tutorials) will be held from November 6 to November 9th, 2005, in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Support from the National Science Foundation is awarded on behalf of graduate students attending institutions in the United States as well as faculty members from underrepresented groups and minority-serving institutions. The requested $25,000 support is for approximately twenty awards to graduate students (at $750 each) towards registration, travel, and accommodations and for approximately ten awards for minority faculty or faculty from universities serving minority students (at $1,000 each) towards registration, travel, and accommodations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This award will serve to widen the audience attending a premiere networking conference-the International Conference on Network Protocols-and as such raising the level of interaction and the potential for new collaboration, new investigations, and higher quality research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: By supporting graduate students, minority faculty members, and faculty from minority-serving institutions to attend ICNP 2005, this proposal will increase the dissemination of the conference's research results to a larger and a more diverse audience, which might not otherwise be able to attend. In doing so, this proposal will contribute to the strength and inclusiveness of the research community. By giving preference in grant awards to women and minority students, and by targeting minority faculty members and those from minority-serving institutions, we hope to widen the participation among these underrepresented groups. Furthermore, by advertising to a wide range of colleges and universities, participants from a more diverse set of institutions should be able to attend and benefit from the conference.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
