<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this proposal is to investigate a series of fundamental&lt;br/&gt;problems in constructive function theory which constitute  common ground&lt;br/&gt;of the analysis and applied mathematics. Our approach borrows ideas and&lt;br/&gt;techniques from many fields of theoretical mathematics, such as real and&lt;br/&gt;complex analysis, topology, and Fourier analysis. Recently, Carleson,&lt;br/&gt;Totik, and the PI in a series of papers have found a new approach  to&lt;br/&gt;connect  the continuous properties of the Green function and the metric&lt;br/&gt;properties of the boundary of a domain where the Green function  is&lt;br/&gt;defined. We believe that this approach can give a decisive impulse to&lt;br/&gt;investigation of a number of long-standing open problems in constructive&lt;br/&gt;functio theory. A major  component of this proposal is to study a new&lt;br/&gt;representation of basic notions of potential theory (logarithmic capacity, the Green function, and&lt;br/&gt;equilibrium measure) in terms of a conformal mapping of the exterior of&lt;br/&gt;the unit interval onto the exterior of the unit disk with finite or&lt;br/&gt;infinite number of radial slits, presented in the recent work of the PI.&lt;br/&gt;We analyze the geometry of Cantor-type sets and propose to find a new&lt;br/&gt;proof to and significant extension of the results by Totik and Carleson on&lt;br/&gt;sets possessing the Hoelder continuous Green function. The second part of&lt;br/&gt;our proposal concerns Markov- and Remez-type inequalities for polynomials&lt;br/&gt;on subsets of the real line. We propose  to construct a general&lt;br/&gt;$2$-dimensional theory of Remez-type inequalities and illustrate their&lt;br/&gt;power by giving a number of applications. The last  part is  devoted to  study of well-known&lt;br/&gt;open problems in polynomial approximation in the complex plane which have&lt;br/&gt;a large number of applications in both pure and applied mathematics. We&lt;br/&gt;hope to find a complete solution of the Meinardus-Varga problem on&lt;br/&gt;structure of an entire function with the geometric convergence on the&lt;br/&gt;positive real axis of reciprocals of polynomials to the reciprocal of the&lt;br/&gt;function. We intend to employ a new concept of Faber-type polynomials. Our&lt;br/&gt;prior reseach indicates that there exists a connection  between th&lt;br/&gt;Nikolskii-Timan-Dzjadyk approximation theorem and the concept of uniformly&lt;br/&gt;perfect sets introduced by Beardon and Pommerenke. We propose to&lt;br/&gt;investigate the details of this connection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The major component of the broader impact of our proposal is to create a&lt;br/&gt;new link between potential theory, geometric function theory and&lt;br/&gt;constructive function theory. Another  component  concerns  the training&lt;br/&gt;of graduate and undergraduate students. Indeed, the problems addressed in&lt;br/&gt;this proposal are stated in such a way that not only are they clear to the&lt;br/&gt;graduate students but they are accessible to undergraduates as well. On&lt;br/&gt;the other hand, the answers to many of those problems are quite&lt;br/&gt;counterintuitive. This stimulates the interest of students to the subject&lt;br/&gt;and mathematics in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
