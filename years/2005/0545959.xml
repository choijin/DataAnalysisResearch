<AbstractNarration>Future microprocessor chips will contain numerous computational cores, large cache hierarchies, and complex on-chip networks between cores and cache banks. For an application to exploit a processor's peak throughput, it will have to necessarily be composed into many threads. As part of this project, the curriculum at Utah will be revised so that graduating students have the skills to write efficient multi-threaded programs that can harness the compute power in future processors. When multi-threaded applications execute on a chip, different threads and data transfers make varied demands on the hardware in terms of speed, bandwidth, power, reliability, etc. By optimizing specific cores and networks on the chip for different metrics, the hardware can meet the diverse needs of software. A processor that packs in heterogeneous functionalities and device characteristics will likely allow processor throughput to continue its steady rise while not compromising reliability or power-efficiency. This project explores the effect of optimizing on-chip networks for either speed, bandwidth, or power. It also explores the effect of customizing cores to execute the operating system, redundant threads, or speculative threads. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project explored the role of heterogeneous components in future computer systems.  A given component can be designed in different ways depending on the metric (performance, energy, reliability) that is being optimized.  To build a system with overall better performance, energy, and reliability, a system can be built with different components, and tasks can be assigned to components based on their need, i.e., does the task require high performance, low energy, or high reliability?  The project explored heterogeneity in three different realms: (i) wiring within a processor chip, (ii) processing units, and (iii) different layers of a 3D stacked chip.  Results show that wires can be designed such that they are either optimized for low power or low latency or high bandwidth.  The architecture can easily classify different types of on-chip messages and assign each message type to the appropriate wire type to yield overall better performance and energy efficiency.  Similarly, it can be shown that parts of the operating system and the application are not performance-critical.  Such program functionalities are best executed on a separate low power processing unit that has minimal features.  Techniques were developed to automatically determine when some program functionality must be off-loaded to the low power unit.  Finally, the project shows that high reliability can be achieved at a low overhead by stacking chips from old and new technologies and executing a duplicate copy of a program on the old technology chip.  The old technology chip consumes less power for this particular task while also yielding fewer errors.       Last Modified: 07/12/2011       Submitted by: Rajeev Balasubramonian]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
