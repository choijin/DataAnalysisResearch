<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project FUTURE (Fostering Undergraduate Training Using Research Experiences) focuses on real world learning experiences related to anthropogenic Nitrogen (N) deposition and its impact on natural plant communities.  The target course involved is a one-semester, introductory biology course that emphasizes concepts and principles of ecology, genetics, evolution and conservation biology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project creates inquiry-based instructional activities that are consistent with those that have been found to increase interest in science as well as learning outcomes for diverse student populations.  These activities include a greater emphasis on teams of students working together to address environmental problems that are currently at the forefront of the concerns of ecological and conservation biology.  A unique aspect of the proposed project is that it emphasizes research and experimental training in an expanding area of ecological research, namely the environmental consequences of global change.  A number of evaluation techniques are used to assess student performance, the results of which are shared at national educational conferences.  Detailed information on syllabus, experimental protocol and data sets are posted on a dedicated web page for national dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Project FUTURE enables roughly 900 students per year, mostly from groups underrepresented in science professions, to gain familiarity with research in global environmental change.  To ensure recruitment and retention of the underrepresented students in this project, four campus organizations (African American Academic Network, Latin American Recruitment and Education Services, Native American Support group and Women in Science and Engineering) provide mechanisms for assistance.</AbstractNarration>
