<AbstractNarration>The Netted Sensors Community Workshop will be held on October 24-26, 2005, at the MITRE Corporation McLean, Virginia, USA. The workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from Academia, Government (Gov't) and Industry; it will provide a forum for both developers and users of netted sensors technologies to share, exchange, and disseminate information with the goal of accelerating the research, development and transition of Netted Sensors (NS) technologies to solve real world problems. The workshop will focus on NS R&amp;D activities to solve environmental monitoring, industrial and commercial, existing and future DOD and Intelligence Community sensing problems. In particular, The workshop brings together the S&amp;T community, industry and Gov't/Mil organizations to [1] review discuss the current state-of-the-art as well as disseminate recent advances and new R&amp;D results, [2] highlight new commercial products and technologies, and [3] identify and discuss nationally important sensing problems suitable for Netted Sensing solutions and [4] identify a set of key challenge areas that need investments and will benefit from community wide R&amp;D collaboration. NS R&amp;D and applications are in the early stages of development and the transition to transformational capabilities is still a few years away. Significant NS research and development (R&amp;D) challenges exist in the functional areas of sensors and platforms, communications and networks, signal and information processing, resource and information management, and security. An interdisciplinary approach to R&amp;D is required because key system components and functions are highly interdependent. This workshop will act to synergistically combine the netted sensors functional areas. The workshop organizers believe that by bringing these interdisciplinary research groups together will lead to synergistic advances in the field of NS. The workshop will feature keynote addresses by leading researchers, panel discussion of future research directions, and contributed technical papers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests facility and travel support for university participants. We would like to keep the registration cost of the workshop low to allow many folks to easily participate. In order to accomplish this, we have decided to host the conference at the MITRE Corporation in McLean, Virginia. We request support for the cost of the organizational staff and facilities required for the workshop. We also request support for university faculty and students from US institutions who are authors or coauthors of a presentation, who without travel subsidies would not be able to attend.
