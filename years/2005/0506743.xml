<AbstractNarration>The Fifth International Workshop on Objective Bayesian Methodology will&lt;br/&gt;be held in Branson, Missouri, June 4-8, 2005.&lt;br/&gt;Objective Bayesian methodology is, for the most part, oriented towards&lt;br/&gt;the development of prior distributions that can be used automatically,&lt;br/&gt;i.e. that do not require subjective input other than the specific&lt;br/&gt;probabilistic model chosen to describe the data. There are three quite&lt;br/&gt;distinct statistical domains in which this development has taken place:&lt;br/&gt;parametric estimation, model selection, and prediction,&lt;br/&gt;Objective Bayesian methodology is of increasing importance today since&lt;br/&gt;application of Bayesian analysis is rapidly growing among nonspecialists,&lt;br/&gt;most of whom seek automatic or objective Bayesian procedures.&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will emphasize prediction, practical applications&lt;br/&gt;such as spatial-temporal models, multiple comparisons and goodness-of-fit.&lt;br/&gt;Bayesian methods usually are heavily depend on prior distributions.&lt;br/&gt;Although a prior distribution is an important component in the Bayesian&lt;br/&gt;paradigm, it is known that even in the absence of any relevant prior&lt;br/&gt;information, the Bayes method can produce reliable inference to many&lt;br/&gt;challenging problems by employing appropriate objective (noninformative)&lt;br/&gt;Bayesian analysis. The principal objectives are to facilitate the&lt;br/&gt;exchange of recent research developments in objective Bayesian&lt;br/&gt;methodology, to provide opportunities for new researchers, and to&lt;br/&gt;establish new collaborations that will channel efforts into pending&lt;br/&gt;problems and open new directions for investigation. An important&lt;br/&gt;consequence of this meeting will be to further crystallize objective prior&lt;br/&gt;methodology as an established area for statistical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statisticians have traditionally embraced one of two main approaches,&lt;br/&gt;classical or "frequentist" methods and Bayesian methods. In recent years,&lt;br/&gt;advances in computing technology and breakthroughs in statistical theory&lt;br/&gt;have made Beyesian methods increasingly attractive, especially for &lt;br/&gt;difficult problems with many variables in fields such as meteorology, &lt;br/&gt;epidemiology, natural resources, etc. With this increased emphasis on &lt;br/&gt;Bayesian statistics, it has become increasingly important to bridge the &lt;br/&gt;differences between the two schools of statistical thinking.  Objective &lt;br/&gt;Bayesians are dedicated to resolving these differences.  The planned &lt;br/&gt;workshop will bring together 80-100 participants including leaders in the &lt;br/&gt;field of objective Bayesian statistics from around the world together with &lt;br/&gt;young researchers and students in a setting especially conducive to &lt;br/&gt;cooperation and exchange of ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
