    <AbstractNarration>This project supports the participation of 12 US doctoral students in a research and doctoral career consortium (workshop). In addition to the NSF funded US doctoral students we anticipate approximately 10 international and 8 FIU students to participate in the doctoral consortium. The doctoral consortium will take place in conjunction with the 7th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems (ICEIS), to be held May 24-28 in Miami. The ICEIS'05 doctoral consortium will provide an opportunity for graduate students to explore their research interests in an interdisciplinary workshop, under the guidance of a panel of distinguished experts in the field. Student participants will make formal presentations of their work and will receive constructive feedback from a faculty panel. The feedback is designed to help students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to related research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented. The doctoral consortium will include a panel discussion of career options in academia and industry, how to manage a research program, and manage time. The doctoral consortium will help expand the participation of young researchers pursuing graduate studies in this field, by providing them an opportunity to gain wider exposure in the community for their innovative work and to obtain feedback and guidance from senior members of the research community. Because the students and faculty constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, including nationality/cultural and scientific discipline, the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the field. The inclusion of doctoral students from FIU will help ensure broad participation from under-represented minorities and women in the doctoral consortium.</AbstractNarration>
