<AbstractNarration>This is a Conference proposal for support of an ACS Symposium on "Advances in&lt;br/&gt;Polymer Brushes" to be held as part of the national ACS Meeting in August 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very active area of research, which is closely tied in to nanoscience. Brushes&lt;br/&gt;(i.e. closely spaced polymer molecules tethered on surfaces) are of great interest for&lt;br/&gt;applications in microfluidics, tailoring of surface properties, and even as "chemical&lt;br/&gt;gates". The PI is one of the world's leaders in that area, and the list of invited speakers&lt;br/&gt;is really a "who's who" of top practitioners in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This list of speakers also has very good diversity in terms of people, institutions, topical&lt;br/&gt;areas, and international presence. US participants will undoubtedly benefit greatly from&lt;br/&gt;this Symposium. Funds are requested specifically to defray costs of participants in the&lt;br/&gt;early stages of their careers or new to the field of polymer brushes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, the Polymers Program is convinced that this would be a very beneficial&lt;br/&gt;opportunity in terms of both intellectual merit and broader impacts. We recommend&lt;br/&gt;funding the $3000 requested.</AbstractNarration>
