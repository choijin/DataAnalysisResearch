<AbstractNarration>This three-day conference will provide a forum for in-depth dialogue on&lt;br/&gt;innovative research in the area of Neural Control of Behavior.  The first&lt;br/&gt;two days will be devoted to a symposium that will be open to the scientific&lt;br/&gt;community.  There will be four sessions: (1) Neurobiological Basis of Social&lt;br/&gt;Behavior; (2) Fear and Anxiety; (3) Sleeping and Dreaming; (4) The Aging&lt;br/&gt;Brain. The speakers represent a balance of species used (invertebrates to&lt;br/&gt;mammals), experimental approaches used (from molecular and cellular to&lt;br/&gt;behavioral levels of analyses), gender, and career level.  The third day of&lt;br/&gt;the meeting will be devoted to a workshop of speakers and invited conference&lt;br/&gt;participants, where they will explore ways in which information discussed&lt;br/&gt;during the symposium can be used to take their respective research areas in&lt;br/&gt;new directions.  This conference aims to: Bring together researchers who are&lt;br/&gt;asking similar questions, but are using different species and different&lt;br/&gt;experimental approaches; Promote the use of simple systems for addressing&lt;br/&gt;complex biological problems; Promote interaction between junior scientists -&lt;br/&gt;women in particular - and established investigators and leaders in the&lt;br/&gt;field; Provide a high-quality educational forum, in an intimate setting,&lt;br/&gt;that is conducive for in-depth discussion and learning between trainees and&lt;br/&gt;more senior researchers.  A Meet-the-Speaker luncheon is aimed specifically&lt;br/&gt;at trainees, giving them the unique opportunity to interact with&lt;br/&gt;internationally recognized experts in an intimate setting.  A Poster Session&lt;br/&gt;also gives trainees and more senior researchers the opportunity to highlight&lt;br/&gt;and discuss their own work. The speakers use modern, cutting-edge&lt;br/&gt;technologies for addressing problems in the area of Neural Control of&lt;br/&gt;Behavior.  By bringing together these researchers, and giving them a forum&lt;br/&gt;for discussing their work, the message can be effectively spread that these&lt;br/&gt;modern techniques are being used with great success in a wide variety of&lt;br/&gt;animal systems.  This conference will provide an important interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;communications-mechanism for advancements in the neuroscience community.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
