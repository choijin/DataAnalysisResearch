<AbstractNarration>*****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT*****&lt;br/&gt;Understanding electronic properties of semiconductor quantum devices becomes increasingly important as miniaturization of modern integrated circuits approaches a point where quantum effects come into play. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project at the University of Minnesota integrates research and education in the area of electronic transport in semiconductor nanostructures. Of particular focus are experimental investigations of peculiar new phenomena recently discovered in GaAs-based quantum devices, which are driven out of their equilibrium state by microwave radiation. In particular, the electrical resistance of such a device can oscillate drastically with an applied weak magnetic field to the extent that the resistance totally vanishes under certain conditions. The physical origin of these oscillations and vanishing resistance remains under debate. By exploring new experimental regimes and techniques this project will provide valuable constraints to guide and filter theoretical models and identify novel technological concepts. The educational component of this project rests on the development of research-driven educational resources and direct involvement of students at all levels and from a variety of backgrounds in cutting-edge research to ready them for careers in nanotechnology industry, government, and academe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT*****&lt;br/&gt;This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project at the University of Minnesota integrates research and education in the area of non-equilibrium transport in semiconductor nanostructures.

By exploring new experimental regimes and techniques, such as bichromatic and multi-photon microwave spectroscopies, this project will provide valuable constraints to guide and filter theoretical models and identify novel technological concepts.
