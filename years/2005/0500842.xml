<AbstractNarration>The d-bar-Neumann problem may be viewed as the study of the solution&lt;br/&gt;of the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations having minimal&lt;br/&gt;L^2-norm. After Kohn's solution of the problem on strictly&lt;br/&gt;Pseudo-convex domains, important advances in the L^2-Sobolev theory&lt;br/&gt;included the work of Hormander on L^2-estimates, D'Angelo and Catlin&lt;br/&gt;on finite type and subellipticity, Boas and the PI on global&lt;br/&gt;regularity on domains of infinite type, and Kiselman, Barrett, and&lt;br/&gt;Christ on irregularity on worm domains. However, characterizing&lt;br/&gt;global regularity remains a fundamental open problem. Likewise, quite&lt;br/&gt;general sufficient conditions are known for compactness of the&lt;br/&gt;d-bar-Neumann operator, but a characterization on general&lt;br/&gt;pseudo-convex domains in terms of boundary data remains elusive. These&lt;br/&gt;long term goals represent two thrusts of this project. The PI&lt;br/&gt;recently observed intriguing links between sufficient conditions for&lt;br/&gt;regularity properties of the d-bar-Neumann operator and sufficient&lt;br/&gt;conditions for the existence of a Stein neighborhood basis for the&lt;br/&gt;closure of the domain. Investigating to what extent regularity&lt;br/&gt;properties of the d-bar-Neumann operator such as compactness imply&lt;br/&gt;the existence of a Stein neighborhood basis of the closure of the&lt;br/&gt;domain is a third thrust of this project. During this project, the PI&lt;br/&gt;will supervise several postdoctoral researchers and several graduate&lt;br/&gt;students. He will co-organize a special semester at the Erwin&lt;br/&gt;Schrodinger International Institute for Mathematical Physics&lt;br/&gt;dedicated to topics investigated in this project, and he will give a&lt;br/&gt;lecture course within the Institute's Senior Fellows program&lt;br/&gt;introducing these topics to graduate students and junior researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of analysis in several complex variables can be motivated by&lt;br/&gt;the centrality of the subject within mathematics as well as through a&lt;br/&gt;direct appeal to its usefulness. For example, one of the basic laws&lt;br/&gt;of nature, causality, when transcribed via a mathematical device&lt;br/&gt;called Fourier transform, leads immediately to analytic functions of&lt;br/&gt;several (in this case, four) complex variables. The PI has shown that&lt;br/&gt;some of the problems to be studied in this project have intimate&lt;br/&gt;connections to issues emanating from quantum mechanics. The central&lt;br/&gt;object of study in this project, the Cauchy-Riemann equations, form a&lt;br/&gt;model problem for a subject central to physics and engineering&lt;br/&gt;(partial differential equations). Finally, the project will&lt;br/&gt;contribute significantly to the development of human resources&lt;br/&gt;through training of highly qualified personnel at the postdoctoral and&lt;br/&gt;graduate levels, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
