<AbstractNarration>The investigators will study E-region electrodynamics at high latitudes using the Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) systems in Alaska and Resolute Bay.  The research will form the foundation for a PhD thesis by a University of Colorado aerospace engineering graduate student.  The objective is to exploit the new AMISR radar system to provide height-resolved observations of the electrodynamic properties of the E-region, including electron density, ion motion, current density, Joule heating rates and neutral winds.  The unique capabilities of the AMISR system will also help resolve spatial-temporal ambiguities that presently limit these types of studies.  The research will focus on two specific science questions:  (1) At what altitude does high-latitude ion motion perpendicular to the magnetic field begin to deviate from the convection direction, and how do the ions behave below this altitude, and (2) Can we learn more about upper E region neutral winds using a novel approach to incoherent scatter radar measurements.  The study involves the determination of vector velocity fields from E and F region line-of-sight AMISR measurements.  These velocity fields will be used to estimate E-region electrodynamic parameters, including the neutral wind.  The research will promote teaching, training and learning, and will provide the opportunity for the advancement of a woman engineer/scientist.  The techniques will be incorporated into the curriculum of a graduate course in Radar and Remote Sensing.  Data acquired will be rapidly and broadly disseminated and new peer-reviewed research will be published that will enhance scientific understanding of the polar E region ionosphere.  Societal benefits will result from improvements in the ability to specify and predict space weather.  The observational techniques developed for AMISR will be applied to future rocket launches from Poker Flat, Alaska.</AbstractNarration>
