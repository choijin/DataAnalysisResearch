<AbstractNarration>This award supports development of a strategic plan for the Muller Field Station (MFS), a recently recently acquired, off campus facility located near the southern end of Honeoye Lake in the Finger Lakes Region of western New York.  The station, which belongs to the Finger Lakes Community College (FLCC) is one of only a few field stations in the U.S. that are operated by a community college. The MFS now provides field-based education through several academic programs, laboratory experiences, community outreach, and the opportunity to participate in or observe local research projects.  Undergraduate students, local K-12 students and teachers, community members, and environmental organizations/agencies already frequent the site.  Because of the demand for use of the MFS, FLCC intends to convene stakeholders to help identify best uses for the facility, determine science opportunities available in the surrounding glacial landscape, examine needs for expansion, and ultimately plan the future mission of the MFS.  The planning effort will include five workshops that address programming, facility and grounds enhancement, operational sustainability, research, and strategic plan development.  The project PIs will visit to other field stations and exchange ideas with key personnel from the Organization of Biological Field Stations (OBFS).  The project PIs have considerable experience conducting research, using industry-standard research technology, leading scientific based travel/study courses and working with local communities and municipalities to research environmental issues.  The workshops will capture creative input from stakeholders including teachers, administrators and students from all levels of education, representatives from local and state environmental organizations/agencies, field station directors, architects and interested community members.  The planning effort is expected to improve current science education efforts and to integrate scientific research into local decision-making processes.</AbstractNarration>
