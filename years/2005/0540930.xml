    <AbstractNarration>University of Colorado at Boulder is granted an award to support student participation in the 2005 Taxonomic Databases Working Group annual meeting in Saint Petersburg Russia during September 11-18. Funding will support 7 students to attend TDWG2005 based on a competitive application process and the PI to be a mentor for the students before, during, and after the workshop. The merit is the potential for intellectual growth for the individual student participants, securing continued research growth in the field by bringing the next generation of biodiversity informaticians into the community, and to provide cross-disciplinary training, community-building, and contacts with the leaders in the field for a new cadre of biodiversity informaticians. Student participation is solicited from a diverse group of students both male and female, and from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Because training occurs during all phases of student development, participants from all stages in their student careers including undergraduate, Masters, PhD and post-doctoral students will be eligible to apply. The national competition for open slots will provide an opportunity for deserving students who couldn't otherwise afford to attend TDWG a chance to participate. Preference will be given to students who help assure continued ethnic and gender diversity.</AbstractNarration>
