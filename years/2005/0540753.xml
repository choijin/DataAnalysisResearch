<AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposal is to investigate the feasibility and potential for implementation of information  design technology as a means to improve management and dissemination of scientific information amassed through research conducted within and among NSF Engineering Research Centers, thereby increasing collaboration activity and results.  Preliminary exploration is focused on standardized scientific poster design, offering potential for streamlining of information and improved sharing capabilities.  The PI plans in using "information design" technology to organize complex and large amounts of scientific information.  The intellectual merit of this proposal is in the conceptualization, design, and implementation of systematic methods for the creation, classification, and sharing of scientific information resulting from ERC activities over a 10-year life span.  The broader impact of this research is manifested through industrial-strength software development technology, which is not normally taught to graduate students in software engineering classes at HBCUs.  This research will make it possible for HBCU students to learn the basics of good software developmentpractices and information design.  This research will provide input for revision of the curriculum in the "Advanced Software Engineering" course where concepts of industrial-strength software development will be taught.  Also, this project will partner with the Baltimore City School system to provide a practicum for senior high school students.  These students will partner with college students on projects to understand software engineering and information design technology.</AbstractNarration>
