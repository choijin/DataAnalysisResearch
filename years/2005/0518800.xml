<AbstractNarration>Humans are amazingly proficient at rapidly perceiving facial identity, extracting facial expressions of emotion, and remembering individual physiognomies. These skills are critical for effective human interaction. This vital realm of cognitive expertise is situated at the intersection of memory and perception. However, the fact that many memory processes occur concurrently when we see a familiar image places serious constraints on their investigation. The next stage of advancement in memory research requires disentangling the plethora of processes that in combination influence memory performance. A cognitive neuroscience perspective on this problem is emphasized in this research project, which takes the investigation of facial memory as key for elucidating perceptual expertise and memory in general. The exquisite temporal precision of EEG measures is combined with sophisticated  behavioral measures of memory to allow multiple memory processes and corresponding neurophysiological signals to be characterized independently. The specific memory phenomena under investigation include: (1) Remembering a person's face together with biographical information about that person and relevant personal experiences; (2) Recognizing a face as familiar in the absence of any additional memory retrieval;  (3) Facilitated processing of a facial image ("priming") due to prior visual experience with the same face and in the absence of conscious remembering; (4) Similar unconscious memory based on conceptual rather than perceptual knowledge; and (5) Unconscious influences due to emotional facial expressions. Behavioral and electrophysiological results obtained as these 5 phenomena are dissociated from each other will help to sharpen theoretical conceptions of these complex memory phenomena by providing neural validation  of these cognitive distinctions. Independent neural signals being characterized in this research are intended to show how these processes unfold in time when a face is viewed. These measures are opening the door for further inquiry into the fundamental characteristics of various memory phenomena, including conscious and nonconscious memory more generally. Electrical signals of memory, once identified, can then be used to determine which memory functions are operative in different situations, and how the various components operate interactively. Fruitful cross-disciplinary extensions include investigations of these memory phenomena in elderly and patient populations who show cognitive impairments in a subset of relevant storage and retrieval processes. EEG analyses will be used to generate more detailed hypotheses about neural processes and structures, which can then be tested using other neuroimaging methods, both with respect to accurate and inaccurate memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A comprehensive scientific understanding of facial memory will have wide-ranging impact. By fractionating multiple aspects of facial memory, the research findings will provide insights into conceptions of various memorial influences on behavior, including but not limited to learning and memory in the classroom, in a court of law, in the acquisition of various cognitive skills, and in everyday interpersonal interactions. This project will publicize research to the general public, bring underrepresented groups into scientific research, train post-doctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students, and develop implications for treating disease-related memory disorders and normal memory decline in aging. Better use of eyewitness testimony, of computerized facial identification, and of memory for people generally, will come from improved comprehension of the multiple facets of facial memory examined and characterized in the research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
