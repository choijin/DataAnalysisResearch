<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity: Patterned polymer brushes, that is, thin&lt;br/&gt;films of polymers end anchored to surfaces are becoming increasingly important in a number&lt;br/&gt;of advanced technology applications ranging from microelectronics to biotechnology. A&lt;br/&gt;patterned polymer brush in comparison is one that is attached to a surface in a spatially&lt;br/&gt;defined micron or nanometer-sized region. A focus of the proposed research will be to&lt;br/&gt;examine the synthesis of di- and triblock copolymer brushes and to evaluate in detail&lt;br/&gt;their polymerization and microstructure. A second focus of this proposal will be to&lt;br/&gt;pattern polymer brushes at length scales comparable to brush length and to investigate&lt;br/&gt;their behavior and microstructure in these confined regions. Patterning methods will&lt;br/&gt;include e-beam and EUV lithography as well as near-field scanning optical methods. If&lt;br/&gt;successful, this study will provide an exciting opportunity to overcome many of the&lt;br/&gt;barriers currently encountered in small scale (~10 nm) structure formation and at the same&lt;br/&gt;time provide an excellent model system for exploring the converging length scales in&lt;br/&gt;top-down (lithography) and bottom-up (self-assembly) processing. We expect that this&lt;br/&gt;convergence will lead to interesting synergies and may enable directed assembly of the&lt;br/&gt;block copolymer brushes. Such an approach could bridge the gap between the limits of&lt;br/&gt;current lithographic methods (&gt;50 nm) and the need to achieve nanostructures as small as&lt;br/&gt;10 nm. The proposed research will require expertise in polymer synthesis, lithographic&lt;br/&gt;patterning and analytical methods capable of characterizing the small-scale structures we&lt;br/&gt;plan to produce. To aid us in the characterization of these new materials, we will make&lt;br/&gt;use of our collaborations to investigate the patterned block copolymer brushes using a&lt;br/&gt;range of synchrotron based analytical methods including X-ray reflectometry, grazing&lt;br/&gt;incidence (GI) SAXS and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) studies.                          &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity: This program will engage motivated&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate researchers throughout the course of the proposed research program.&lt;br/&gt;Students will be connected with graduate student mentors and will participate in all&lt;br/&gt;aspects of the research program. REU students from programs at Cornell will take part&lt;br/&gt;during the summer. Participants in this program will take part in outreach activities&lt;br/&gt;aimed at communicating the use of patterned polymer brushes. We will also provide&lt;br/&gt;educational samples of patterned brushes to interested teachers during participation in&lt;br/&gt;Cornell high school teacher outreach activities. A number of companies will collaborate&lt;br/&gt;with us on our research activities helping to carry out patterning studies. Both graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and especially undergraduate students will be encouraged to carry out work&lt;br/&gt;internships with our collaborators.</AbstractNarration>
