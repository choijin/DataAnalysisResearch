<AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the scientific and cultural production of knowledge at archaeological sites&lt;br/&gt;through an ethnography of archaeologists working in Pompeii, Italy. The exacting "scientific" nature of&lt;br/&gt;archaeology has played a pivotal role in the construction of cultural and national identities. This project&lt;br/&gt;seeks to understand the micro-processes by which artifacts become scientific objects and how, as&lt;br/&gt;scientific objects, artifacts become objects of signification:  of "Italian-ness", "European-ness" and finally&lt;br/&gt;"World Heritage".  Italy is a country fraught with a continual crisis of cultural and/or national identity&lt;br/&gt;but the narrative of a shared Roman ancestry became important in attempts to generate "Italian-ness". &lt;br/&gt;Historically archaeology helped establish and legitimize this "common" identity. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed research is to examine how archaeology is currently being enrolled&lt;br/&gt; in the project of identity formation. As one of the most important sites in Italy, Pompeii offers the best &lt;br/&gt;opportunity to examine these processes at work. In 1997 Pompeii was "inscribed" by UNESCO and &lt;br/&gt;designated a "World Heritage" site. As such it is a particularly interesting place to potentially locate the&lt;br/&gt;formation of a new yet not fully defined European or world identity. This project not solely concerns the &lt;br/&gt;uses that archaeology has been put to in the social and political arena, but also with the practice of &lt;br/&gt;archaeology itself and how these practices construct scientific objects that are then employed to make &lt;br/&gt;larger truth claims. While general conclusions have been offered as to the work of archaeology as a &lt;br/&gt;nation-building tool, this project seeks to understand how archaeology as science is a "sign producing" &lt;br/&gt;activity and exactly how it is that the archaeological sign comes into being and circulates to produce&lt;br/&gt;narratives of heritage, identity and nation.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;UNESCO's declaration of Pompeii as a "World Heritage" site points to the broader impacts of&lt;br/&gt;this study. Archaeological artifacts have long been caught up in important and contentious policy debates&lt;br/&gt;over the disposition of such objects: not just who owns them, but who can use them for proprietary and&lt;br/&gt;narrative projects. This study will contribute to those policy debates, as well as the broader discussion in&lt;br/&gt;policy circles in Europe: the Council of Europe explicitly stated in its Forward Planning Project of 2001&lt;br/&gt;that archaeological heritage would be used to "Europeanize" Europe. This project will thus have broader&lt;br/&gt;impacts in addressing the policy and scientific debate about the interface between the science and the&lt;br/&gt;politics of archaeology in the new Europe. Finally, Italy has recently passed legislation allowing the&lt;br/&gt;privatization of Pompeii. How can privatization be reconciled with the larger collective projects of&lt;br/&gt;UNESCO and the Council of Europe (which themselves may be at odds)? The data collected through the&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will be useful to scholars and policy makers attempting to navigate this increasingly&lt;br/&gt;fraught legal and proprietary terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
