<AbstractNarration>This project develops methodology for objective Bayesian analysis &lt;br/&gt;of spatial data, both geostatistical and lattice data, that arise in &lt;br/&gt;many of the social and earth sciences, such as economy, epidemiology, &lt;br/&gt;geography, geology and hydrology, as well as computationally efficient &lt;br/&gt;algorithms to perform Bayesian analysis and prediction based on &lt;br/&gt;moderate to large spatial datasets. &lt;br/&gt;On the methodological side, the investigator derives new automatic &lt;br/&gt;prior distributions for the parameters of different kinds of Gaussian &lt;br/&gt;random fields, specified either by their covariance matrices or by &lt;br/&gt;their precision matrices. &lt;br/&gt;The research explores the main statistical properties of Bayesian &lt;br/&gt;inferences based on these automatic priors, such as conditions for &lt;br/&gt;posterior propriety, frequentist properties of parameter and&lt;br/&gt;predictive inferences, and existence of predictive summaries.&lt;br/&gt;A point of particular interest is the study of the pros and cons of &lt;br/&gt;the dependence of these automatic priors on the sampling design.&lt;br/&gt;On the computational side, the investigator derives methods to &lt;br/&gt;approximate these automatic priors distributions, since evaluation &lt;br/&gt;of these priors is in most cases computationally expensive, and &lt;br/&gt;develops new computationally efficient algorithms for Bayesian &lt;br/&gt;inference and prediction of spatial data that would make feasible &lt;br/&gt;Bayesian analysis based on moderate to large spatial datasets.&lt;br/&gt;The methodology proposed in this project serves as an initial step &lt;br/&gt;toward the development of objective Bayesian analysis for spatial &lt;br/&gt;hierarchical models used to describe non-Gaussian data, since most &lt;br/&gt;of these models use Gaussian random fields as building blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The statistical methodology developed during this project has practical&lt;br/&gt;impacts in many social and earth sciences, such as economy, epidemiology, &lt;br/&gt;geography, geology and hydrology, where the collection and analysis of &lt;br/&gt;spatial data have become common tasks.&lt;br/&gt;A paradigm of statistics called the Bayesian approach possesses several &lt;br/&gt;conceptual and methodological advantages when compared to traditional &lt;br/&gt;approaches for the analysis of spatial data, but technical and &lt;br/&gt;computational difficulties that arise during implementation have &lt;br/&gt;hindered its more widespread use among practitioners.&lt;br/&gt;This is particularly so for the analysis of some types large spatial &lt;br/&gt;datasets where current implementations of the Bayesian approach &lt;br/&gt;are too cumbersome or unfeasible to be carried out.&lt;br/&gt;The statistical methodology developed in this project would contribute &lt;br/&gt;to overcome some of these technical and computational hurdles, and&lt;br/&gt;consequently to bridge the gap between methodology and practice for &lt;br/&gt;Bayesian analysis of spatial data.&lt;br/&gt;Graduate students would be engaged in the project, contributing to &lt;br/&gt;their statistical training as well as the enhancement of the Statistics &lt;br/&gt;program at the University of Arkansas.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
