<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Our proposed research is concerned with the design of distributed algorithms for networks of agents&lt;br/&gt;with communication/sensing capabilities. Our novel algorithms will be capable of exploiting fea-&lt;br/&gt;tures of the communication/sensing topology and heterogeneities in the design paradigm in order to&lt;br/&gt;complete coordinated tasks in the face of constraints (such as actuator saturation or communication&lt;br/&gt;rate constraints) and stochastic or nonrandom topological variations. Hence, the algorithms will be&lt;br/&gt;well-suited for modern applications such as autonomous-vehicle coordination, sensor network-based&lt;br/&gt;detection, and air trafficc  flow management, among others.&lt;br/&gt;Our proposed methodology for designing these sensing-network algorithms is control-theoretic&lt;br/&gt;in nature. We will draw on several control-theoretic tools|most prominently, tools that use the&lt;br/&gt;notion of a fixed-mode in decentralized control theory and the influence model paradigm|to gain&lt;br/&gt;insight into distributed algorithm performance and design. In particular, we will systematically&lt;br/&gt;characterize and design algorithms for a sequence of canonical tasks, including formation, agree-&lt;br/&gt;ment, and self-partitioning tasks, and tasks for internally-coupled networks (such as Air Traffic&lt;br/&gt;Systems or electric power systems). For each canonical task, our goal will be to identify the topo-&lt;br/&gt;logical structure and degree of design heterogeneity needed to achieve high performance in the&lt;br/&gt;face of realistic contstraints and topological variation. The underlying control-theoretic tools will&lt;br/&gt;be extended based on our algorithm-design needs (e.g., they will be extended to be account for&lt;br/&gt;topological variation), and simulations and experiments of complex tasks will be performed.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposal is evident: difficult distributed control problems are&lt;br/&gt;addressed to in order to develop novel sensing-network algorithms. The broader impact of our&lt;br/&gt;research is significant: a new course on network dynamics and control has been designed and is&lt;br/&gt;currently being taught here at Washington State University, and efforts will be made to foster&lt;br/&gt;interest and disseminate information about sensing networks and their control.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
