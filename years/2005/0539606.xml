<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses a novel processing technique for depositing binary nanocomposite metal oxide thin films to yield electrochromic (EC) devices with superior performance and reliability. EC technology is used to fabricate smart windows that can be electronically tinted to control solar light and heat. Materials with designed composition and nanostructure will enable maximum fracture toughness and minimal biaxial stress of key layers in EC devices. The more robust films are expected to boost the reliability of smart window products which are exposed to a wide range of environmental and solar conditions while being switched tens of thousands of times over their expected lifetime. The nanotechnology innovation will also result in faster switching of large (&gt;1.5m) EC windows and enable higher light transmission in the clear state with better color neutrality in the tinted state. The technical objective is to explore sputter deposition and thermal annealing to yield stable nanocomposites in EC thin films. Designed experiments will explore resulting beneficial mechanical and optical film properties. Finally, the EC performance of lab scale devices incorporating nanostructured films will be evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The global market for energy saving EC architectural windows is predicted to be $13.8 billion in annual sales at maturity. The performance and reliability improvements achievable as a result of this project are essential for widespread market acceptance. OEM window companies, architects, and building occupants require the larger windows and improved transmission properties obtainable with nanostructured materials. In addition, the increased film toughness will lead to higher yields during manufacturing with concomitant lower costs. In addition to architectural windows, deposition technologies for nanostructured films can improve the performance of flat panel displays and alternative gate oxides for advanced CMOS technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
