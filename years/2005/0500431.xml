    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to do research on ethical and societal implications of nano research and development in the nano facility at the University of Illinois in Chicago. The individuals involved in the program will be (1) the PI, (2) Prof. Alan Feinman, Manager of the facility, (3) a sociologist of science, (4) a philosophy of science predoctoral graduate student. The PI also plans to bring in a psychologist, as a consultant, experienced in this kind of research that introduces an outsider into a workplace. The nano facilities are available for research &lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to develop a questionnaire for staff and users about impacts and implication of their work. The predoctoral graduate student will develop report/case study covering the research experience. This is a very timely and relevant study because of the recent emphasis being placed in this area through workshops by NSF and others. This project will bring to light ethical and societal issues associated with work at the nano facility. The PI plans to test an innovative approach to ethics in an emerging area of nanotechnology. The outcome of this work will be broadly available and could be useful in many scientific and technical areas of research and a variety of facilities.</AbstractNarration>
