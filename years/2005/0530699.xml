<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. Richard H. Meadow, Benjamin Arbuckle will &lt;br/&gt;collect and analyze archaeological data related to the &lt;br/&gt;evolution of sheep and goat pastoralism in Central Anatolia. Continuing &lt;br/&gt;preliminary work that he began in 2004, Arbuckle will join international &lt;br/&gt;archaeological projects based at Ankara and Istanbul Universities in &lt;br/&gt;order to collect and analyze animal bone remains from four sites in &lt;br/&gt;Central Anatolia (South Central Turkey). The goal of this research is to &lt;br/&gt;develop a detailed understanding of the organization and evolution of &lt;br/&gt;sheep and goat pastoralism leading up to and during the appearance of &lt;br/&gt;the first complex polities and early urban states in the region from &lt;br/&gt;6000-2000 BC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is significant because, although sheep and goat &lt;br/&gt;pastoralism is one of the most important socio-economic formations in &lt;br/&gt;the ancient and modern Middle East, little is known about how pastoral &lt;br/&gt;systems were organized in Central Anatolia, how they evolved over time, &lt;br/&gt;and how these systems were affected by and affected the development of &lt;br/&gt;early urban states. As a result a major portion of the cultural system &lt;br/&gt;in Central Anatolia and its role in socio-political evolution remains &lt;br/&gt;poorly known. This project analyzes faunal remains from four sites in &lt;br/&gt;the region, including Erbaba, Kosk Hoyuk, Guvercinkayasi, and Acemhoyuk, &lt;br/&gt;each representing a different point in the sequence of cultural &lt;br/&gt;evolution in the region from simple villages to urban centers. &lt;br/&gt;Particular attention is focused on addressing questions concerning the &lt;br/&gt;overall organization of the animal economy, when and to what extent &lt;br/&gt;sheep and goat herds were utilized for products such as milk and wool, &lt;br/&gt;and when and to what degree sheep and goat herding became a specialized &lt;br/&gt;occupation. The extent to which products such as milk and wool were &lt;br/&gt;utilized is important for understanding the productive potential of &lt;br/&gt;ancient herds and therefore their economic, social, and political &lt;br/&gt;importance. Evidence for specialization in pastoral production and in &lt;br/&gt;the distribution of pastoral products will provide a means to identify &lt;br/&gt;aspects of the internal organization of early societies in Central &lt;br/&gt;Anatolia that may not be available from other lines of evidence, as well &lt;br/&gt;as the opportunity to test assumptions concerning the centralized and &lt;br/&gt;redistributive nature of the urban Bronze Age economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, this research will contribute to a new understanding of the &lt;br/&gt;origins and development of pastoral practices that continue to be &lt;br/&gt;important in the region today. By characterizing the nature of the sheep &lt;br/&gt;and goat pastoral system and by addressing questions concerning the &lt;br/&gt;relationship between specialization in the pastoral economy and emerging &lt;br/&gt;social complexity, this research also makes an important contribution to &lt;br/&gt;understanding the organization and evolution of early complex polities &lt;br/&gt;in Central Anatolia. Furthermore, this project has been conducted in &lt;br/&gt;close cooperation with Turkish and other foreign researchers, and the &lt;br/&gt;results of this research will be disseminated to the scientific &lt;br/&gt;community through collaborative publications in scientific journals in &lt;br/&gt;both English and Turkish. Finally, this research has given the author &lt;br/&gt;the opportunity to gain valuable experience in the methods of &lt;br/&gt;zooarchaeological and archaeological research and has introduced faunal &lt;br/&gt;research to several important Turkish excavation projects.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
