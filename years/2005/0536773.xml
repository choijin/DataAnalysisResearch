<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Physics (13) This project is focused on creating a set of labs that can be used in an undergraduate biological physics class that draws upper-division students from Chemistry, Biology, Engineering, and Mathematics in addition to Physics. Biophysics is a rapidly-changing  field within physics that interacts with many other disciplines. The ultimate objective is to explore how best to enhance the educational experience of students so that they will be better prepared to take advantage of current advances in science and technology. This project evaluates the efficacy of inquiry-driven, case-study based labs in settings where the students come from a broad spectrum of STEM disciplines. The labs draw upon four principal areas of biological physics: viscosity and drag, Brownian motion, atomic-force microscopy as a tool for surface morphology, and force-probe measurements and optical-trapping to investigate piconewton-sized forces and Kramer's rate theory. Where appropriate, visualization and simulation in Visual Python are used. Each lab incorporates two innovative educational techniques to drive the process and application aspects of scientific learning. Case studies are used to encourage students to think independently and apply the scientific method to a novel lab situation. Student input from this case study is then used to decide how best to do the measurement, guide the project, and ultimately evaluate the success of the program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The course is exploring innovations and adapting successful models currently in place at other institutions to develop further opportunities in the rapidly-changing field of biophysics.   The assessment of student learning is used to shape the customization and evaluate teaching methods, contributing to the cycle of innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Students use cutting-edge technology from current research. The project uses problems that require discussion, peer instruction and reflection to extend the students' knowledge to lab situations.  The project is of wide interest in the physics community.</AbstractNarration>
