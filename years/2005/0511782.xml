<AbstractNarration>This project is concerned with the numerical solution of partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations, as applied to layered models of ocean &lt;br/&gt;circulation.  Particular issues that are addressed include the &lt;br/&gt;following.  (1)  Develop numerical methods for applying the spatial &lt;br/&gt;``B-grid'' to layered models with vanishing layers, and compare this &lt;br/&gt;grid to the ``C-grid'' in such situations.  Each of these grids is a &lt;br/&gt;staggered grid for which the mass variables and velocity components are &lt;br/&gt;defined at different locations.  Presently, the B-grid is widely used &lt;br/&gt;in z-coordinate models, whereas layered models more typically use the &lt;br/&gt;C-grid.   Of particular interest in the present project are behavior &lt;br/&gt;near variable bottom topography and the possible generation of grid &lt;br/&gt;noise.  These issues have interfered with previous attempts to use the &lt;br/&gt;B-grid with layered models, but the B-grid nevertheless has attractive &lt;br/&gt;properties that warrant consideration.  (2)  Compare different &lt;br/&gt;formulations of the momentum equation for numerical discretization, and &lt;br/&gt;compare different advection methods for solving the equations for mass &lt;br/&gt;and momentum.  One issue of interest is the nature of the nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;interactions within the discrete system.  The choice of numerical &lt;br/&gt;scheme is also influenced by the need to transport multiple scalar &lt;br/&gt;fields simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall purpose of this work is to improve the algorithms that are &lt;br/&gt;used in computer simulations of ocean circulation.  The ocean plays a &lt;br/&gt;crucial role in the global climate system, and a better understanding &lt;br/&gt;of that system relies in part on numerical simulations of the ocean's &lt;br/&gt;circulation over long periods of time.   The investigator has developed &lt;br/&gt;an improved time-stepping method and related algorithms, and the &lt;br/&gt;present project represents further work towards the goal of improving &lt;br/&gt;the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of the algorithms that are &lt;br/&gt;used in numerical models of ocean circulation.  The investigator has &lt;br/&gt;extensive contacts with practicing ocean modelers who provide valuable &lt;br/&gt;insights to help guide this research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
