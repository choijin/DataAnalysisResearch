<AbstractNarration>This  proposal aims  at developing  new and  effective  algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;performing  dimensionality  reduction  tasks  by methods  which  blend&lt;br/&gt;techniques  from numerical  linear algebra  and  approximation theory.&lt;br/&gt;Current  implementations of  LSI, and  other  dimensionality reduction&lt;br/&gt;methods,  rely on  matrix decompositions  such as  the  Singular Value&lt;br/&gt;Decomposition (SVD).   SVD-based methods compute  explicitly the basis&lt;br/&gt;of the dominant singular vectors  and proceed with a projection of the&lt;br/&gt;data on  this basis.  This has  the desirable effect  of filtering out&lt;br/&gt;noise and  redundancy inherent to  the data, while retaining  its main&lt;br/&gt;structural  features  (e.g., `semantic  contents'  in LSI).   However,&lt;br/&gt;SVD-based methods tend to be expensive, both in terms of computational&lt;br/&gt;cost and  storage, and  become impractical for  very large  data sets.&lt;br/&gt;The premise of  this proposal is that there is no  need to compute the&lt;br/&gt;(partial)  SVD  in  order  to perform  dimensionality  reduction.  The&lt;br/&gt;projection  of a  given  vector  onto the  space  associated with  the&lt;br/&gt;largest singular  values can be accurately reproduced  by a polynomial&lt;br/&gt;filtering   technique.   This   technique,   which  entails   repeated&lt;br/&gt;multiplication  of  a vector  by  the  original  data matrix  and  its&lt;br/&gt;transpose, offers  several advantages including  low computational and&lt;br/&gt;storage  requirements.   In  addition, ``relevance  feedback'',  which&lt;br/&gt;enhances  significantly the  quality of  the  results of  LSI, can  be&lt;br/&gt;easily adapted  for polynomial  filtering.  Perhaps more  important is&lt;br/&gt;the excellent flexibility of  polynomial filtering in enabling various&lt;br/&gt;desired reduction features.  For example, an appropriate choice of the&lt;br/&gt;filter will  yield an arbitrarily smooth transition  from the unwanted&lt;br/&gt;components (small singular values)  to the wanted ones (large singular&lt;br/&gt;values) in contrast with the discontinuous cut-off which characterizes&lt;br/&gt;Truncated SVD (TSVD).  Also, some applications may require an accurate&lt;br/&gt;projection  (high degree polynomial)  while for  others this  would be&lt;br/&gt;wasteful or even counter-productive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Society  is  currently  facing   an  explosive  surge  of  exploitable&lt;br/&gt;information in  scientific, engineering, and  economical applications.&lt;br/&gt;The rapidly  increasing sizes of  the data sets becoming  available is&lt;br/&gt;starting to  render inadequate  many of the  algorithms used  in `data&lt;br/&gt;exploration' in spite of their merits when computational costs are set&lt;br/&gt;aside.   The methods investigated  in this  research will  address the&lt;br/&gt;issue of  cost by  taking a new  approach which completely  avoids the&lt;br/&gt;bottleneck  of  the  classical  algorithms. If  fully  successful  the&lt;br/&gt;methods to be developed  may significantly enhance the capabilities of&lt;br/&gt;current  state-of-the-art methods  used  in key  areas of  information&lt;br/&gt;technology.   For example,  preliminary studies  have shown  that when&lt;br/&gt;processing a query  in a database, the proposed  methods can sometimes&lt;br/&gt;offer a  tenfold gain in  speed relative to standard  methods, without&lt;br/&gt;any loss  of accuracy.  The  investigating team will also  extend this&lt;br/&gt;approach  to the  problem of  face  recognition. The  method also  has&lt;br/&gt;excellent  prospects in other  potential applications  including image&lt;br/&gt;processing, and medical tomography.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
