<AbstractNarration>This project is extending the current Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at Polytechnic University. It is leveraging the resources and improving the infrastructure generated by the current SFS program. The project is supporting an educational program that relies on a number of high-quality courses in the area of information assurance (IA), participation in research projects supervised by faculty, hands-on experience both at Polytechnic University and during summer internships, and state of the art infrastructure for IA research. The graduates of this program are becoming valuable members of the federal work force in charge of protecting information and technological infrastructure of our country. Polytechnic has been a host University to the SFS program since September 2002 and has graduated 25 students as of May 2005. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The nature of the SFS program is primarily educational. This project is using the infrastructure and environment to prepare high-quality information assurance professionals who can be effective in protecting the information technology infrastructure of the Federal government. Polytechnic is innovating in information assurance education, in particular placing a stronger emphasis on research projects by the SFS students. This effort is sharpening the students' ability for creative thinking, making them better information assurance professionals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The SFS program at Polytechnic is training information assurance professionals for positions in agencies of the Federal government. Using knowledge and skills obtained in the program, the graduates are well prepared to meet challenges of protecting the information and infrastructure resources of the United States. The SFS program at Polytechnic is continuing to attract female students at a higher percentage than the larger Polytechnic student population. Further, the revised program is enhancing outreach efforts to continue to broaden participation. These efforts include an alumni mentoring program, an assessment and evaluation component, and partnerships with NY city industry, government and voluntary organizations. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
