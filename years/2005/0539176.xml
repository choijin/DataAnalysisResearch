<AbstractNarration>The properties of groundwater aquifers are uncertain at almost all&lt;br/&gt;physical locations.  Only a small fraction of an aquifer can be sampled&lt;br/&gt;and tested.  Some statistical model must be chosen and implemented that&lt;br/&gt;describes the distribution and correlation structure of the parameters&lt;br/&gt;(primarily the hydraulic conductivity) that control the motion of&lt;br/&gt;groundwater and dissolved pollutants.  Based on the statistical model,&lt;br/&gt;replicas of the aquifers are constructed to make predictions of flow and&lt;br/&gt;transport.  These replicas must contain the structures that may be&lt;br/&gt;present across all scales of interest.  The replicas should honor the&lt;br/&gt;real data where measured (including a possibly non-Gaussian&lt;br/&gt;distribution), and should represent correlation that might be restricted&lt;br/&gt;to very narrow directional windows; for example, discrete fracture set&lt;br/&gt;orientations.  The investigators are working on one model that can honor&lt;br/&gt;the data from many well-studied aquifers (granular and/or fractured). &lt;br/&gt;The model uses operator-fractional noise and motions, since the scaling,&lt;br/&gt;or fractal, properties of aquifers vary with direction.  The operator&lt;br/&gt;fractional motions are based on the investigators' recent definitions of&lt;br/&gt;3-D fractional integro-differentiation.  The operator-fractional motions&lt;br/&gt;have what is known in the earth sciences as "generalized scale&lt;br/&gt;invariance" in which the index of scaling depends on direction.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigators are rigorously defining the mathematical properties of&lt;br/&gt;these motions and their numerical implementations.  They are also&lt;br/&gt;studying the correspondence between transport through the&lt;br/&gt;operator-fractional aquifer replicas and simple analytic descriptions of&lt;br/&gt;transport embodied in fractional-order transport equations and&lt;br/&gt;generalized continuous time random walks.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The spreading of pollution in an aquifer is controlled by sediment&lt;br/&gt;structures that are present across a huge range of scales.  Tiny bits of&lt;br/&gt;silt and clay may retain pollutants for years, while buried (remnant)&lt;br/&gt;gravelly stream channels might move some pollutants for miles in a short&lt;br/&gt;time.  To make realistic predictions of drinking water vulnerability or&lt;br/&gt;eventual cleanup, it is important to construct models of aquifers that&lt;br/&gt;have this kind of multi-scale structure.  In another setting more&lt;br/&gt;germane to nuclear waste storage, the simultaneous presence of small and&lt;br/&gt;large fractures will account for both the slow and fast pathways for the&lt;br/&gt;spreading of radioactivity away from future repositories. &lt;br/&gt;Representative models of these aquifers must be "buildable" and&lt;br/&gt;testable, so the investigators are first pouring a concrete mathematical&lt;br/&gt;footing.  While the work deals primarily with mathematics and hydrology,&lt;br/&gt;the results also contribute to applied studies in physics, fluid&lt;br/&gt;dynamics, electrical engineering, and finance.  The financial&lt;br/&gt;applications are revealed when looking at a graph of a stock price:&lt;br/&gt;there are minute-to-minute fluctuations that are similar to year-to-year&lt;br/&gt;gains and losses. Some stocks are tightly coupled; others are not. Not&lt;br/&gt;all markets respond at the same rate, nor are the magnitudes of the&lt;br/&gt;changes easily characterized.  Finally, several graduate students and a&lt;br/&gt;post-doctoral researcher are also supported by the grant.  Each of them&lt;br/&gt;is receiving extensive training in both physical sciences and&lt;br/&gt;mathematics.  This cross-training engenders more fruitful cooperation&lt;br/&gt;between the theoretical and applied sciences. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
