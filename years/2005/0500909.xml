<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies the complex and Kohn Laplacians in several&lt;br/&gt;complex variables, the d-bar-problem on complex manifolds, as well&lt;br/&gt;as their applications to and interplays with problems in algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry and quantum physics. One of the main thrusts of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed research is  systematical study of the d-bar-Neumann and&lt;br/&gt;Kohn Laplacians along the lines of the classical spectral theory&lt;br/&gt;for the Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians.  The investigator will&lt;br/&gt;continue his work on the interplays between spectral behavior of&lt;br/&gt;these Laplacians and the underline geometric structures. A problem&lt;br/&gt;of particular interest is to characterize geometric structures on&lt;br/&gt;which these Laplacians have purely discrete spectrum. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator will also study the spectral theory of related&lt;br/&gt;Schrodinger operators with magnetic fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complex analysis and differential equations arise naturally in&lt;br/&gt;physics, engineering, chemistry, economics, and other sciences.&lt;br/&gt;Spectral analysis of differential operators plays an important&lt;br/&gt;role in quantum mechanics.  The proposed research will further&lt;br/&gt;explore the intimate connections between the seemingly unrelated&lt;br/&gt;problems in several complex variables and quantum mechanics.  It&lt;br/&gt;could lead to new understanding and discoveries in both fields.&lt;br/&gt;Ideas, tools, and techniques developed in this project will also&lt;br/&gt;have repercussions in other fields.  This project will have direct&lt;br/&gt;impact on the development of human resources; it will support&lt;br/&gt;development of new courses and texts that attract students into&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and sciences.  It will facilitate interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;research activities with biologists and computer scientists.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
