    <AbstractNarration>The investigator applies various mathematical methods&lt;br/&gt;to extend the range of application of saddlepoint&lt;br/&gt;approximation techniques and exact enumeration techniques&lt;br/&gt;in statistical inference. These techniques are applied to&lt;br/&gt;multi-dimensional conditional inference, achieved primarily&lt;br/&gt;by developing new approximations to multivariate tail&lt;br/&gt;probabilities for some component of a vector of sufficient&lt;br/&gt;statistics conditional on the remaining components, and&lt;br/&gt;methods for calculating these tail probabilities exactly.&lt;br/&gt;Particular attention is paid to probability models&lt;br/&gt;whose sufficient statistics have lattice distributions,&lt;br/&gt;since standard asymptotic techniques frequently fail&lt;br/&gt;in this context. These models, including logistic and&lt;br/&gt;Poisson regression and contingency table models, are&lt;br/&gt;very frequently used in applied biostatistical work.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this research includes the application&lt;br/&gt;of multidimensional saddlepoint approximations to&lt;br/&gt;order--restricted hypotheses. It extends existing&lt;br/&gt;Approximations applicable to continuous distributions to&lt;br/&gt;general non-lattice distributions. It develops guidelines&lt;br/&gt;for tuning approximate conditional inferential methods to&lt;br/&gt;obtain higher power. Computational algorithms developed&lt;br/&gt;as part of this work are publicly available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many current statistical techniques rely on mathematical approximations;&lt;br/&gt;the accuracy of these approximations ranges from very good to inadequate.&lt;br/&gt;This research involves approximations known to be almost always of high&lt;br/&gt;accuracy, and applies them in some statistical contexts that are widely&lt;br/&gt;used by scientists in a variety of disciplines. This research allows&lt;br/&gt;investigators to draw valid conclusions from smaller data sets,&lt;br/&gt;particularly in cases when important research questions are phrased in terms&lt;br/&gt;of a number of quantities that must be accounted for. This situation occurs &lt;br/&gt;in a wide range of areas, from finance to political science to medicine.&lt;br/&gt;For example, a new medical therapy might be expected to lead to improvements,&lt;br/&gt;potentially measured in a number of ways. The investigator wishes to&lt;br/&gt;demonstrate that individuals receiving the new therapy at least as well &lt;br/&gt;according to all of the potential measures, and better on at least one&lt;br/&gt;measure, than do patients on the original therapy. Standard statistical&lt;br/&gt;methods do not handle such situations in an efficient way; the current&lt;br/&gt;research represents a significant improvement.</AbstractNarration>
