<AbstractNarration>This award supports several projects which involve studying quantum effects as they relate to both cosmology and black holes.  The same techniques will be used to compute the force a particle feels due to the gravitational radiation that is emitted as it orbits a black hole.  One of the most important ideas in cosmology today is that early in its history the universe underwent a process of extremely rapid expansion called inflation. Quantum effects were very important both during and shortly after this period of inflation.  They are almost always computed using an approximation to quantum field theory called the semiclassical approximation.  The validity of this approximation as it relates to the period of inflation and to particle production that occurs immediately after this period will be investigated.  In addition, studies will be made of the effects that quantum fields have on the event horizons of black holes.  The event horizon is the boundary in space between where light can get away from the black hole and where it cannot.  A study will also be made of the difference between the effects quantum fields have on the geometry far from the event horizon of a black hole versus the effects they have on the geometry far from the surface of a static star.  When a particle orbits a black hole gravitational radiation is emitted whose effect can change the subsequent orbit.  If the particle is charged electromagnetic radiation is also emitted. These can be modeled by using a simpler type of radiation called scalar radiation. Projects will be worked on that involve the computation of the force this scalar radiation exerts on a particle as it orbits a black hole.&lt;br/&gt;Some of the most important predictions of inflation including the creation of density fluctuations that eventually evolve into galaxies depend on quantum effects which are computed using semiclassical approximations. It is thus extremely important to determine whether these approximations are valid both during and immediately after inflation.  If calculations for reheating in some chaotic inflation scenarios are invalidated, then much more difficult calculations will be necessary. In the case of black holes there are indications that there are special cases where it is possible that quantum effects might have such a significant effect on the event horizon of the black hole that they prevent that type of black hole from existing.  It is not clear how likely it is that this will happen but it is important to investigate whether or not it does happen.  One of the important sources of gravitational waves for the proposed space based gravitational wave detector called LISA is a neutron star or black hole formed from the collapse of a star which orbits a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy.  The detailed nature of the waves emitted depend upon the trajectory of the orbiting body.  This in turn depends on the force that the emitted gravitational radiation emits on the orbiting body.  Thus it is very important to compute this force.  It will be possible to involve both undergraduate and graduate students in many of these projects.  There is a&lt;br/&gt;long history of undergraduate and graduate students working on these types of projects and gaining training in both numerical and analytical research techniques as well as being coauthors on publications.</AbstractNarration>
