<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. Kurt M. Pickett of the American  &lt;br/&gt;Museum of Natural History for the study of behaviorally important  &lt;br/&gt;wasps in the genus Polistes, or common paper wasps.  Within Polistes,  &lt;br/&gt;the New World species form a lineage of 119 species, many of which  &lt;br/&gt;have been the basis for the empirical and theoretical study of social  &lt;br/&gt;behavior.  While many of these theories have been devised with paper  &lt;br/&gt;wasps in mind, their applicability extends well beyond wasps.   &lt;br/&gt;Because many of these theories posit the sequence of behavioral  &lt;br/&gt;evolution through time, fully understanding the evolution of social  &lt;br/&gt;behavior in paper wasps requires the evolutionary tree of the  &lt;br/&gt;species.  Based on molecular, anatomical and behavioral evidence, Dr.  &lt;br/&gt;Pickett and co-workers will produce a robust evolutionary hypothesis  &lt;br/&gt;for this group.  This hypothesis will clarify not only the evolution  &lt;br/&gt;of a diversity of behaviors, but also the taxonomy of the group.  The  &lt;br/&gt;project will produce a series of scientific articles relating to the  &lt;br/&gt;evolution of social behavior and the taxonomy of the group, including  &lt;br/&gt;identification keys to the species.  All data, illustrations and  &lt;br/&gt;articles will be disseminated via the World Wide Web.&lt;br/&gt;             The products of this project will enrich the community  &lt;br/&gt;in many ways.  Traditional and interactive keys to the species will  &lt;br/&gt;be of broad use by applied entomologists and environmental  &lt;br/&gt;consultants as well as the research community.  The project will  &lt;br/&gt;train three undergraduate students in advanced molecular techniques  &lt;br/&gt;and preparation of digital archives of anatomical variation.  One  &lt;br/&gt;intern will receive extensive training over 2 years, and will attend  &lt;br/&gt;a scientific congress at which she will report her work to the  &lt;br/&gt;scientific community.  The project will also create new content for  &lt;br/&gt;the OLogy website related to the proposed research.  OLogy (http:// &lt;br/&gt;ology.amnh.org/) is a free, science-rich website designed for  &lt;br/&gt;learners aged 7 and up to spark innate curiosity about the natural  &lt;br/&gt;world.  Developed entirely in-house at the American Museum of Natural  &lt;br/&gt;History by teams of educational technologists, writers, programmers,  &lt;br/&gt;designers and scientists, OLogy takes advantage of the Museum's  &lt;br/&gt;collections, scientists, and outreach capacity to provide standards- &lt;br/&gt;based science educational content to children at home, educators in  &lt;br/&gt;schools, and the general public in libraries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
