<AbstractNarration> The current project proposes research on three subjects: 1) tensor categories &lt;br/&gt;and Hopf algebras; 2) dynamical R-matrices and special functions, and&lt;br/&gt;3) Cherednik algebras, Calogero-Moser systems. In the first area, &lt;br/&gt;the PI plans to construct new examples of finite tensor categories, &lt;br/&gt;both semisimple and nonsemisimple, and classify module categories &lt;br/&gt;over given tensor categories. In the second area, the PI plans to &lt;br/&gt;study elliptic hypergeometric functions of Felder and Varchenko &lt;br/&gt;using representation theory of quantum affine algebras and &lt;br/&gt;dynamical R-matrices, and to prove the De Concini conjecture about &lt;br/&gt;quantum Weyl groups and the Felder-Varchenko conjectures&lt;br/&gt;on the properties of elliptic hypergeometric functions. In the third area, &lt;br/&gt;the PI plans to study finite dimensional representations of symplectic &lt;br/&gt;reflection algebras, their large $N$ limits (double Yangians),&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic analogs (Gan-Ginzburg algebras), and ``topological&lt;br/&gt;analogs'' (Hecke algebras of various braid groups). He plans to prove &lt;br/&gt;algebraic PBW theorems for deformations of group algebras which &lt;br/&gt;are similar to double affine Hecke algebras. He also plans to study &lt;br/&gt;the connections of this subject with representations of quivers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current project is at the crossroads of several mathematical areas -- &lt;br/&gt;representation theory, mathematical physics, theory of integrable systems, &lt;br/&gt;special functions. The theory of Cherednik algebras and Calogero-Moser spaces&lt;br/&gt;originates from a remarkable family of orthogonal polynomials of several &lt;br/&gt;variables called Macdonald polynomials. These polynomials are a very &lt;br/&gt;broad generalization of the classical Legendre polynomials arising in &lt;br/&gt;the study of the hydrogen atom, and they have an incredibly rich structure. &lt;br/&gt;Similarly to this classical case, Macdonald polynomials are eigenstates &lt;br/&gt;of a quantum Hamiltonian (Macdonald operator), which defines an &lt;br/&gt;integrable quantum-mechanical system, in the sense that one can &lt;br/&gt;exactly solve it. Representation theory allows us to use symmetry to &lt;br/&gt;understand the structure of Macdonald polynomials. Similarly to how the &lt;br/&gt;rotational symmetry of the hydrogen atom is instrumental in the study of its &lt;br/&gt;quantum-mechanical properties, the structure of Macdonald polynomials &lt;br/&gt;is uncovered using the quantum group and Cherednik algebra symmetry. &lt;br/&gt;The theory of tensor categories, which is another subject of this proposal, &lt;br/&gt;is also instrumental in understanding quantum systems, since the &lt;br/&gt;representation-theoretical structure expressing the symmetry of many &lt;br/&gt;such systems takes the shape of a tensor category.</AbstractNarration>
