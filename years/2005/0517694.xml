<AbstractNarration>Fueling Hummingbird Foraging: Mechanisms and Ecological Implications&lt;br/&gt;Raul K. Suarez&lt;br/&gt;University of California, Santa Barbara&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of their small size and energetically expensive mode of flight, hummingbirds display some of the highest known metabolic rates among vertebrate animals.  Low ambient temperatures further increase thermoregulatory costs and, therefore, increase the rate of food intake.  Flying to forage requires even higher rates of energy expenditure, so how do hummingbirds make ends meet and how do they make an energetic profit to enable pre-migratory fattening?  Although hummingbirds rely on fat to fuel migratory flight, previous studies on rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) revealed that short foraging bouts are fueled by carbohydrate.  This allows birds refueling at meadows during migration to deposit fat at higher rates because it avoids the energetic inefficiency that results from synthesizing fat from dietary sugar and then using fat to fuel foraging flight.  It is proposed that hummingbirds use fuels optimally to be more energetically efficient foragers.  In the studies proposed here, rates of O2 consumption and CO2 production during hover-feeding shall be measured to estimate the energetic cost of hover-feeding as well as to determine the nature of the fuel(s) used.  The effects of low ambient temperature shall be determined.  The results shall be used to refine a computer model of the energetics of hummingbird foraging to determine how they make a profit under harsh environmental conditions.  It is not known whether hummingbird flight muscles are directly fueled by dietary sugar or whether dietary sugar must first be converted into a storage form of carbohydrate.  Sugar labeled with stable carbon isotope shall be used to determine the extent to which the flight muscles are fueled directly by dietary sugar.  The biochemistry of sugar uptake and metabolism in flight muscles shall be examined.  This research shall involve collaboration with international scientists, the training of an American graduate student at UC Santa Barbara, and collaboration with a female Hispanic graduate student at UC Berkeley.  Elementary and high school students shall be provided exposure to field research in ecological physiology.  The results shall allow a further test of the hypothesis that hummingbird behavior and metabolism have coadapted to maximize net energy gain and will lead to insights into the energetics of hummingbird migrations.  The findings shall contribute to the understanding of the problems faced by animals as a consequence of global climate change.        &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
