    <AbstractNarration>Millimeter-Wave Reconfigurable Antenna Arrays Using Monolithic MEMS Technology&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: Reconfigurable antenna arrays can dramatically enhance versatility of the RF front-ends in radars&lt;br/&gt;and transceiver systems, and present an interesting problem at millimeter-wave (MMW) frequencies. The&lt;br/&gt;purpose of this project is to utilize radio-frequency micro-electromechanical system (RF-MEMS) technology&lt;br/&gt;to form highly integrated, monolithic, reconfigurable antenna array architectures. Two different aspects of&lt;br/&gt;the problem will be addressed under the proposed program: 1) design of reconfigurable radiating structures&lt;br/&gt;that lend themselves to surface micro-machining fabrication techniques, and 2) fabrication of monolithic&lt;br/&gt;MEMS arrays and technological issues involving wafer-scale integration. A programmable aperture lens-array&lt;br/&gt;is proposed based on MEMS-enabled antenna-filter-antenna (AFA) elements. AFA's are three-layer planar&lt;br/&gt;structures composed of transmit and receive antennas and bandpass filters. The complete array, including&lt;br/&gt;MEMS switches, is fabricated using a stack of two similar size quartz or glass wafers, and in a monolithic&lt;br/&gt;fashion. MEMS devices are sandwiched between the two bonded substrate wafers, resulting in a selfpackaged&lt;br/&gt;structure.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: High-performance, low-cost beam-steering is of prime importance for wide-spread&lt;br/&gt;deployment of commercial MMW systems. MEMS technology enables novel integrated antenna array&lt;br/&gt;concepts, which can respond to this need. The findings of this project are expected to advance the technical&lt;br/&gt;knowledge and understanding in the areas of antenna arrays and applied electromagnetics, as well as RFMEMS&lt;br/&gt;design and technology.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: An unconventional research effort of this type promotes the research culture and&lt;br/&gt;technological competence among graduate students. Development of the necessary measurement capabilities&lt;br/&gt;creates opportunities for the participation of undergraduate students through summer internships and senior&lt;br/&gt;design projects. ASU is the main vehicle of higher education for a large number of students from underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;ethnic backgrounds through the state of Arizona. The proposed program furthers involvement&lt;br/&gt;of these students in advanced technology research, and is a practical step towards making engineering&lt;br/&gt;education accessible to minorities.</AbstractNarration>
