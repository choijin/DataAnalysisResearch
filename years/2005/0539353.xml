<AbstractNarration>Electric Power Networks Efficiency and Security (EPNES) is an interdisciplinary initiative by NSF/ONR aimed at promoting interdisciplinary research in Electric Power Research and Education. The workshop is an annual grantees meeting that provides a forum for EPNES PIs across disciplines to share their research results and engage in scholarly discussion/exchange. This research includes components of economics, social/human public perception, systems, security, environment and integrated schemes for designing robust power systems. Possibilities for the transition of research results to for industry applications will be discussed. Another thrust of the grantee meeting is to evaluate progress made on new education material and curricula. The workshop will include the preparation of workshop proceedings that will feature technical information provided by the grantees. These proceedings will later be developed into a special publication. Intellectual merit: This grant will create interaction between EPNES researchers and will stimulate intellectual discussions among representatives from FERC, NERC, DoE, ONR, EPRI, and Entergy. Broader impact: This grant will (i) broaden the activities of the investigators to a national and international level, (ii) include representatives from underrepresented groups who will inspire and encourage broader participation in this type of research, and (iii) include a workshop proceedings and a book that will disseminate the findings to a wide audience of other researchers in this area and areas related to network efficiency and security.</AbstractNarration>
