<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0505735&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Albert Schwarz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first examples of topological quantum field theories were&lt;br/&gt;constructed by PI in the late seventies. The importance of such&lt;br/&gt;theories became clear in late eighties after Witten's&lt;br/&gt;papers. Witten suggested a more general way of construction of&lt;br/&gt;topological quantum field theories and used it to find new&lt;br/&gt;interesting models. Among the most important topological theories&lt;br/&gt;are Chern-Simons theory, suggested by PI and Witten and solved by&lt;br/&gt;Witten, and Witten's topological sigma-models (A-model and&lt;br/&gt;B-model).  Chern-Simons theory was very useful in knot theory.&lt;br/&gt;Topological sigma-models, especially mirror symmetry between&lt;br/&gt;A-and B-models, were used to obtain striking results in&lt;br/&gt;enumerative algebraic geometry.  Topological version of gauge&lt;br/&gt;theories led to remarkable developments in the theory of&lt;br/&gt;four-dimensional and three-dimensional manifolds.  One can say&lt;br/&gt;that topological quantum field theories opened the way for&lt;br/&gt;applications of ideas borrowed from physics to pure&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. However, these theories were used also as a powerful&lt;br/&gt;instrument in string/M-theory. It was shown by Witten that&lt;br/&gt;starting with any N=2 superconformal theory one can construct&lt;br/&gt;topological quantum field theories by means of so called&lt;br/&gt;twisting. This means, in particular,that string theory with N=2&lt;br/&gt;superconformal target has topological sectors, that can be&lt;br/&gt;analyzed more easily than complete theory.  Topological sectors&lt;br/&gt;served as a testing ground for many important conjectures. From&lt;br/&gt;the other side, for any critical string we can obtain&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional topological theory considering matter fields&lt;br/&gt;together with ghosts. More generally, two-dimensional topological&lt;br/&gt;quantum field theory obeying certain conditions can be "coupled&lt;br/&gt;to gravity"; the resulting theory can be considered as string&lt;br/&gt;theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present proposal is devoted to some problems related to&lt;br/&gt;topological quantum field theories.  In particular, we would like&lt;br/&gt;to relate recent developments in knot theory to the theory of&lt;br/&gt;topological strings; it seems that this relation should lead to&lt;br/&gt;essential progress both in knot theory and in string theory. We&lt;br/&gt;are planning to apply methods of number theory to topological&lt;br/&gt;string theory.  Our projects are interdisciplinary; their&lt;br/&gt;realization will be important both for mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;theoretical physics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
