    <AbstractNarration>The US-Korea Workshop on Nano and Micro Integrative, Hybrid and Complex Systems is&lt;br/&gt;proposed. This workshop will be held in Korea from October 25-27, 2005, and is expected to lead to an&lt;br/&gt;exchange of ideas and identification of new opportunities in the rapidly developing field of micro/nano&lt;br/&gt;integrated complex systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is currently much greater emphasis on building complex, multifunctional, miniaturized&lt;br/&gt;integrative systems to meet the critical needs in terms of speed, versatility and space&lt;br/&gt;optimization. It is expected that the current efforts in micro/nanofabrication technology will yield revolutionary advances in integrative systems in support of biomedical, electrical, information, mechanical, chemical, optical, and environmental applications. This could have major impact in the application markets such as information, medicine, healthcare, and telecommunications. In addition, deployment of micro/nano-systems enabled products is expected to address major socio-economic problems. The holistic approach is expected to promote a variety of application solutions and leverage the deployment and market potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will be jointly organized by Florida International University (FIU) and the Tera-level nano devices program (TND) in Korea. IT will take place in Seoul and will be hosted by TND. The US participation will consist of 10-12 leading faculty and industrial researchers representing areas of micro/nano integration systems, and will be joined by 12 leading researchers from Korea. The proceedings of the workshop and the list of recommendations will be available to all the participants of the workshop and the NSF. The proceedings will be posted on the web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will have both an intellectual as well as broader impact. This will be an important forum to continue the dialog between nano/micro systems experts in the US and Korea with a specific focus on application in future integration systems, and to explore the ultimate boundaries and define new opportunities in this rapidly developing area of research. This workshop will promote education incorporating the forefront of nano/micro integrated complex systems.</AbstractNarration>
