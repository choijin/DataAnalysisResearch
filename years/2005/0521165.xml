    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide updated microscopy equipment, including an advanced, research-grade microscope (differential interference contrast and fluorescence optics), objectives (10x, 20x, 40x and 60x- and 100x-oil objectives), filter cubes (DAPI, FITC, TRITC) and sophisticated imaging hardware and software, to eleven investigators representing Biology, Geography, Anthropology, Chemistry and Electrical, Computer, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. This equipment will significantly strengthen the research and research-training goals of these investigators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of research, the Biologists will use this equipment to investigate the dynamic relationships existing among living organisms and their diverse environments. Microscopic examination of diseased plants may allow one Biology researcher to design future crop-protection strategies. The Engineers and Chemists will be able to design and build more sensitive transistors and biosensors now that they can better observe microscopic structures and a variety of light-wavelengths. Given the immediate threats of global warming, a Geographer will use the equipment to observe microscopic leaf structures in search of factors contributing to regional water balances. And the Anthropologist will examine ancient artifacts to analyze the environmental conditions that affected past civilizations. Importantly, this shared equipment is likely to spark research collaborations among these diverse disciplines and lead to the creation of new and exciting scientific advancements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This microscopy equipment will also allow these investigators to attain important research-training goals. Undergraduate and Masters students using the new instrumentation will gain both the technical skills and scientific know-how required by doctoral degree programs as well as America's expanding biotechnology industries. The microscope and imaging instrumentation will be integrated into an existing instructional project geared toward training visually and physically disabled science students.</AbstractNarration>
