<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The proposed state-of-the-art IR-ellipsometer will complement the existing UV-VIS ellipsometer, and will continue to provide a rich research climate to Kenyon undergraduates. Using the instrument, we plan to specifically address four fundamental issues related to semiconductors and organic nanostructures: (i) to determine the IR-dielectric functions of narrow-bandgap diluted magnetic semiconductors in order to decipher their band structure, and to understand the origin of their ferromagnetism; (ii) to investigate the phonon structure of Be- based semiconductors and to obtain their behavior as a function of alloy concentration; (iii) to explore how the dielectric function changes as a function of doping, strain, and temperature, and to better understand electron-phonon coupling, and coupled plasmon-phonon effects; and (iv) to measure the optical functions of layer-by-layer-grown nanostructures, consisting of nanoparticles and polyelectrolytes, and to relate them to the molecular conformation, structure, and orientation of these structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposal will be the following:  (i) to significantly advance scientific research, and research training among physics and chemistry majors,  which will subsequently influence students to pursue advanced degrees; (ii) by incorporating IR- ellipsometry experiments into several physics courses, all physics majors will be introduced to the fields of semiconductors and nanostructures, resulting in the increase in talent and number of students entering the scientific and technical workforce; (iii) to have a strong impact on minority groups, particularly women, in light of the high percentage of women (42%) majoring in physics at Kenyon (over twice the national average); (iv) to enhance the integration of teaching and research on campus; and (v) to promote interdisciplinary cooperation between the physics and chemistry departments. The goals of this project will be subject to evaluation using the Logic Model, and the results will be disseminated through publications and presentations. In addition, topics of the proposal will be presented to High School teachers as a part of the outreach program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ellipsometry is a technique that uses changes in light waves to study the properties of materials. With this tool we intend to investigate the behavior of materials that may be used in future electronic devices. Our investigations will focus on materials that incorporate magnetic properties into semiconducting materials similar to those currently used in transistors. Incorporating magnetism into these materials is a possible pathway to faster computers that run with less power and lower waste heat. At Kenyon College our student body is diverse, and includes a large percentage of women majoring in physics, so this tool will be used to introduce under-represented groups to scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
