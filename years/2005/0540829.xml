<AbstractNarration>We propose to organize an international symposium on ?Frontiers of Science, Engineering and Education at Nanoscale? to continue the dialogue among leading scientists and technology experts of USA, India and several other countries. India provides an optimal international venue for this dialogue and future cooperative efforts, considering the high level of commitment it has placed on the development of nanotechnology through advanced&lt;br/&gt;research conducted indigenously and through international collaborations. The participants representing the areas of drug delivery, disease detection, computation and communication&lt;br/&gt;will discuss the intersection of nanotechnology with their fields, and opportunities and technical challenges associated with a rapid development of the generation-after-next technology placing focused efforts to surmount those challenges in this symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed symposium on "Frontiers of Science, Engineering and Education at  Nanoscale" will provide a platform for a wide range of discussions between participants from several countries regarding technological challenges, system integration and commercialization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium will develop not only bilateral opportunities between US and India, but will&lt;br/&gt;also be a forum for potential interaction with other countries, Specifically, it will focus on initiating collaborations among academia, and government laboratories, and industry partners about a rapid development of nanotechnology that is going to enable advances in several research areas, such as electronics, sensors, biotechnology, medical, and health care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The symposium will provide a forum to discuss the emerging fields in nanotechnology including development of predictive and characterization techniques, technical challenges at the development as well as integration level, and explore the possibility of collaborative efforts between experts in areas of common interest and in technology transition. A session will also be devoted on issues related to the development of undergraduate and graduate curricula in nanoscale science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
