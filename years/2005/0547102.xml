<AbstractNarration>One of the scientific triumphs of the past century was the development of asolid and consistent understanding of the microphysics of matter; a parallel triumph was the development of an empirical and quantitative understanding of the macrophysics of the Universe.  Beacom's CAREER proposal details plans for using neutrinos and other new messengers to address some of the remaining mysteries of each worldview, and especially the essential questions of their synthesis.  The Intellectual Merit of Beacom's proposed scientific work is based on three main directions -- The Supernova Problems, New Messengers, and The Mysterious Neutrino -- which are interwoven with each other and the proposed work in education and public outreach.  Among other goals, the scientific work is designed to help lead to the first detection and subsequent detailed measurements and implications of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background produced by past type-II supernovae, to lead toward a resolution of the uncertain origin of the Milky Way positrons responsible for the observed 0.511 MeV gamma ray emission, to use existing underground detectors and insights from nuclear physics to place novel limits on dark matter, and to develop new tests of neutrino mass models.  The overall focus is strongly oriented towards exploiting the confrontation between laboratory and astrophysical data to derive new insights; applications include how supernovae explode, the cycle of stellar birth and death, the history of nucleosynthesis, and the particle properties of dark matter and neutrinos.  To ensure the Broader Impacts of the proposed work, in addition to Beacom's present efforts on forging interdisciplinary connections and training students and postdocs, he proposes to initiate new efforts to enhance the physics and astronomy education of Deaf (and hard-of-hearing) students.  This would be accomplished by developing materials and activities tailored to the different needs of hearing teachers of Deaf students at mainstream institutions, the Deaf and hearing teachers of Deaf students at institutions primarily using American Sign Language, and Deaf students everywhere.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the scientific triumphs of the past century was the development of a solid and consistent understanding of the microphysics of matter by laboratory experiments on atoms, nuclei, and elementary particles.  A parallel triumph was the development of an empirical and quantitative understanding of the macrophysics of the universe and its evolving contents by astronomical observations of stars, supernovae, and galaxies.  For the Intellectual Merit component, this project used neutrinos and other new messengers to address some of the remaining mysteries of each worldview, and especially the essential questions of their synthesis.  The main focus was on nuclear and neutrino astrophysics.  This included work on core-collapse and thermonuclear supernovae, the evolution of massive stars, the history of star formation, black hole formation, cosmic rays, high-energy sources of neutrinos and gamma rays, the nature of dark matter, the properties of neutrinos, and many other related topics.  One of the key projects was connected with the faint glow of neutrinos and antineutrinos created by all core-collapse supernovae in the history of the universe.  This included efforts to improve the precision of the predictions and to improve the prospects for detection and interpretation.  Major efforts included work on the rate of star formation, the rate of core collapse, the conditions under which massive stars lead to core collapse, the frequency of black hole formation, issues connected to neutrino detection and background rejection, the interpretation of the results, and more.  Much of this work was summarized in a review article published in Annual Reviews of Nuclear and Particle Science (2010).  For the Broader Impacts component, the outreach associated with this project was directed towards bringing the excitement and knowledge of science to a wide range of students and the general public, as well as to providing increased opportunities to participate in science for all students, especially underrepresented populations, including the Deaf and Hard of Hearing.
