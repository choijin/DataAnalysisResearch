<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing a comprehensive web-based repository of solved circuit analysis example problems delivered as narrated video clips. These are carefully scripted and edited hand-drawn animations that appears as a close-up of a piece of paper with writing and drawings appearing as if "by magic".  Results from research in teaching and learning motivate the pedagogical style of the commentary, which emphasizes expert explanations of the rationale behind the multi-step solution process. The audio commentary is directed to an audience of one, so the student feels that the expert is speaking directly to their needs. The student can work examples in the repository before watching the expert video as a test of their own mastery, or they can watch the videos first for instruction in a new topic. The video format accommodates various styles and rates of student learning since students can interact with the material by pausing, replaying, and skipping to points of interest as needed. The audio narration is available in English and Chinese, as well as closed-captioned text. The evaluation effort will use qualitative and quantitative techniques to obtain indicators of student interest and satisfaction, academic performance, and retention as well as differences in these among student subpopulations.  Two approaches for dissemination are being evaluated: one relies on a web-based repository, which will allow free access but result in static material, while the other involves commercialization through a publisher, which will result in dynamic material but probably require a usage fee. Regarding broader impacts, this repository of educational materials is broadly available to students regardless of location or time of day and it fits seamlessly into every sophomore-level two-semester linear circuits course taken by most engineering students nationwide.  In a pilot version these materials generated much enthusiasm among academically at-risk students and has real potential for increasing retention among this population.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
