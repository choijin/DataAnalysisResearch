<AbstractNarration>This project is to conduct three training workshops/conferences and attendance at the joint American Evaluation Association/Canadian Evaluation Society conference in Toronto in 2005/6.  The workshops aims to develop leaders of diverse national and ethnic groups in evaluation and thereby increase the diversity of the STEM workforce. Specific goals of the proposed project are:&lt;br/&gt; To provide training conferences to graduate students in order to develop valuable curricula and evaluation knowledge generation,    &lt;br/&gt; To improve the knowledge base of graduate students from STEM and other social science disciplines interested in evaluation,&lt;br/&gt; To develop a leadership pipeline model guided by social agenda/advocacy evaluation frameworks that address issues of access, opportunity, and power that are faced by non-profit organizations, foundations, and other agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop a format of quarterly training activities to include an orientation and networking in the field of evaluation, advancing the conceptual and methodological tools of becoming a culturally responsive evaluator, and building sustainable communities through evaluation and the role of evaluation in promoting social change.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
