    <AbstractNarration>Clatsop Community College is home to a Living Machine, a wastewater treatment facility that processes wastewater biologically through a series of anaerobic, aerobic, and hydroponic tanks, and finally constructed wetlands to achieve tertiary treatment of the wastewater. Water out of the system is suitable for reuse. This emerging ecologically friendly and economically sound system looks like a large greenhouse, but is also a hands-on science laboratory. The Living Machine has tremendous and, as yet, untapped research and educational potential. This project introduces high school and college students to environmental technology through the use of the educational and research potential of the Living Machine. Integration of technology with science education and research encourages students to pursue technology-related occupations. This project 1) designs and implements an enriched hands-on lab science curriculum that utilizes the ecology of the Living Machine, and gives students an introduction to environmental technology; 2) develops an independent lab science course centered around the Living Machine technology; 3) partners with area high schools to encourage use of Living Machine as a living classroom (to include curriculum development and teacher preparation); 4) partners with 2 and 4 year colleges/universities to develop short courses or projects centered around the Living Machine technology; 5) develops research showing the Living Machine is as effective as conventional systems in treating wastewater; and 6) designs and implements research to answer questions regarding wastewater and wetland ecology.</AbstractNarration>
