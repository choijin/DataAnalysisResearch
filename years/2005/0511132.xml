<AbstractNarration>Chemistry(12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Chemistry at Howard University is revising its Instrumental Analysis&lt;br/&gt;Chemistry lecture and laboratory courses to emphasize (1) team project based&lt;br/&gt;laboratory exercises and (2) the impact of analytical chemistry on shaping public policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project-based labs being introduced in the Instrumental Analysis Laboratory are&lt;br/&gt;based on successful cooperative learning reform projects at other institutions. These&lt;br/&gt;projects are relevant to students in the program and bear on their career interests. The role science&lt;br/&gt;plays in public policy is a main focus of the new curriculum that is meant to help&lt;br/&gt;students see the relationship between chemistry and societal needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The redesigned lecture and laboratory is increasing students' exposure to recent&lt;br/&gt;advances in instrumental techniques, developing research skills, improving their oral&lt;br/&gt;and writing skills, and allowing them to actively explore the role of the analytical chemist&lt;br/&gt;in shaping public policy. The investigators  are updating chromatographic equipment in the&lt;br/&gt;Instrumental Analysis Laboratory including gas, liquid and ion chromatography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives are (1) the nurturing and development of a cadre of minority chemists to&lt;br/&gt;become proficient at working in teams, (2) providing an opportunity for students to&lt;br/&gt;formulate and carry out independent and multidisciplinary research projects and to&lt;br/&gt;present their findings and (3) broadening the horizons of minority students entering the&lt;br/&gt;field of chemistry so that they are making connections with human needs outside of&lt;br/&gt;science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
