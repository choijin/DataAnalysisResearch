<AbstractNarration>With NSF support, Delaware State University will establish a program in molecular and cellular neuroscience, strengthening the research and research-training infrastructure at Delaware State University.  The neuroscience MS program will: (1) build the academic and research skills of recent graduates who are interested in pursuing an advanced degree; (2) foster interest in pursuing a Ph.D. by involving graduate and undergraduate students in research experiences; (3) create a graduate education partnership between DSU and the Neuroscience Ph.D. program at Drexel University that will strengthen both undergraduate and graduate programs at DSU; (4) improve the preparation of biology undergraduates by increasing the number and variety of advanced courses available to them, and (5) increase the research and research training opportunities of Delaware residents by developing the first neuroscience degree program in the state. The project includes faculty start-up support, summer salaries, stipends and travel allowances. The partnership between DSU and Drexel could serve as a national model for similar collaborative efforts that result in M.S./PhD. programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in its contribution to the knowledge base in molecular and cellular neuroscience.  The broader impact of this project lies in the expanded research opportunities for students including underrepresented minority students and expected increases in the number of minority students who successfully pursue advanced degrees and research careers in STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
