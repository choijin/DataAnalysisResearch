<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program: NSF 04-588 CISE Computing Research Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;Title:  CRI: Acquisition of Research Instrumentation Infrastructure for Next-Generation Broadband Communication Systems  &lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CNS 0551735&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Heydari, Payam&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California-Irvine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Researchers at the University of California-Irvine will acquire test and measurement equipment for integrated research and education focused on the design and implementation of novel nano-scale circuits for next generation, wireless and wireline, broadband communication systems. Specific research to be conducted is in three areas: (1) Methodologies will be introduced for the design of high performance front-end circuits in scaled silicon technologies such as 100GHz silicon based integrated radio. This effort will be extended to the design and implementation of the entire high data rate wireless transceiver (including both ultra-wideband (UWB) and multiple-input multiple output wireless systems) in a close collaboration among the PIs. (2) In the area of broadband wireline system design, the group will conduct research on silicon-based implementations of circuits/systems, operating at 40Gb/s and higher, while addressing the impact of environmental noise sources (e.g., crosstalk, power/ground noise, substrate noise) on the performance of these circuits. (3) Finally, high-frequency measurement (particularly jitter and phase noise measurements) will be an area for research. Research and training in measurement, collaborations with industry and other groups in the universitys College of Engineering, and research at system design, circuits, antennas, and semiconductors will create a strong interdisciplinary activity. Broader impacts of the project include providing an experimental facility supporting training and research in circuits and systems, promoting knowledge transfer to industry in the Irvine area, and supporting the Broadband Multimedia Access activities of Calit2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
