<AbstractNarration>A new framework for modeling artificial boundary conditions in a variety of&lt;br/&gt;applications, including fluid dynamics, acoustics, and electromagnetic wave&lt;br/&gt;propagation, will be developed.  Previous approaches have relied either on&lt;br/&gt;simple descriptions of those processes occurring near boundaries, such as&lt;br/&gt;linearized disturbances to uniform states, or on a range of ad hoc&lt;br/&gt;techniques that attempt to mitigate spurious artifacts of domain truncation.&lt;br/&gt;The present work is based on the concept of a super-grid-scale model that is&lt;br/&gt;in many ways analogous to sub-grid-scale models that are used in Large Eddy&lt;br/&gt;Simulations of turbulent flows.  The formulation explicitly recognizes that&lt;br/&gt;in general systems (especially inhomogeneous and nonlinear PDE), domain&lt;br/&gt;truncation, like filtering, is a modeling problem--the result is ``missing&lt;br/&gt;information'' that cannot be recovered from first principles.  Many existing&lt;br/&gt;techniques (especially damping layers) implicitly supply such a model, but&lt;br/&gt;our hypothesis, backed by preliminary calculations in compressible flow and&lt;br/&gt;acoustic applications, is that better models can be developed by exploiting&lt;br/&gt;a strong analogy with sub-grid-scale modeling techniques.  The analogy is&lt;br/&gt;based on the dual roles that filtering and windowing play in real and&lt;br/&gt;Fourier space.  The proposal details a rationally sequenced research program&lt;br/&gt;that includes examination of several different super-grid models (based on&lt;br/&gt;analogies to existing sub-grid models), detailed computations and comparison&lt;br/&gt;with previous methods in the areas of incompressible and compressible flow,&lt;br/&gt;acoustics, and electromagnetic, and detailed analysis of stability and&lt;br/&gt;convergence of the models and discretized systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is often said that simulation is becoming the 'third leg' of science,&lt;br/&gt;taking an important place beside theory and experiment.  In engineering,&lt;br/&gt;simulation is an essential tool that enables design and optimization based&lt;br/&gt;on first-principles rather than empirical correlations.  However,&lt;br/&gt;computation is only useful when the underlying system is correctly modeled.&lt;br/&gt;Indeed, many relevant systems in fluid dynamics, acoustics, and&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic waves cannot be reliably simulated with existing techniques.&lt;br/&gt;Techniques for artificial domain truncation, in particular, are a pacing&lt;br/&gt;item in many applications in these and related fields.  Artificial domain&lt;br/&gt;truncation (or artificial boundary conditions) refers to situations where&lt;br/&gt;one wishes to simulate only a portion of a larger system in order to reduce&lt;br/&gt;computational effort.  The present research will provide a new generation of&lt;br/&gt;such techniques that are based on a rigorous and well-validated modeling&lt;br/&gt;framework called the super-grid-scale model.  Successful outcome of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed research has potential for far-ranging impact scientific and&lt;br/&gt;engineering design-oriented simulations.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
