<AbstractNarration>My project focuses on studying connections between inner models&lt;br/&gt;of set theory and large cardinals on the one side, and infinitary&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics and descriptive set theory on the other side. It&lt;br/&gt;consists of four parts that are connected through methods of&lt;br/&gt;research. The first part is devoted to the analysis of the internal&lt;br/&gt;structure and combinatorial properties of extender models, an area&lt;br/&gt;of research launched by Jensen in the late 60's; the emphasis here&lt;br/&gt;is on extending the methods recently developed by Schimmerling and&lt;br/&gt;Zeman, and creating a "catalogue" of such methods with broad&lt;br/&gt;applicability. The second area focuses on optimal forcing&lt;br/&gt;constructions in infinite combinatorics. A typical question in&lt;br/&gt;this category is obtaining the exact consistency strength for&lt;br/&gt;the failure of Jensen's principle "square" at a singular cardinal.&lt;br/&gt;Although the emphasis here is on developing new forcing methods,&lt;br/&gt;inner model theory (even at its current state of development)&lt;br/&gt;provides large cardinal axioms that are likely candidates for the&lt;br/&gt;consistency strengths in question. The third area comprises&lt;br/&gt;applications of inner models in establishing lower bounds for&lt;br/&gt;consistency strengths at large cardinal levels below one Woodin&lt;br/&gt;cardinal, as well as applications in descriptive set theory&lt;br/&gt;related to correctness of canonical inner models and inner model&lt;br/&gt;theoretic characterizations of descriptive set theoretic objects.&lt;br/&gt;The last area focuses on the theory of inner models; the main&lt;br/&gt;objective here is to make a progress on extender models matching&lt;br/&gt;higher levels of the large cardinal hierarchy, as well as&lt;br/&gt;exploring possibilities for constructions of the core model below&lt;br/&gt;one Woodin cardinal with no background large cardinal assumption&lt;br/&gt;on the set-theoretic universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set theory can be viewed as a mathematical theory that formalizes the&lt;br/&gt;methods currently accepted as valid working methods in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;It is based on the so-called Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms that describe&lt;br/&gt;basic mathematical constructions. The developments in mathematics&lt;br/&gt;in the twentieth century brought the entire subject to a new stage:&lt;br/&gt;It turns out that there are more and more natural questions answers&lt;br/&gt;of which are sensitive to the background axioms, that is to the axioms&lt;br/&gt;of set theory. Such questions arise even in classical disciplines like&lt;br/&gt;algebra or analysis. They cannot be decided from Zermelo-Fraenkel&lt;br/&gt;axioms alone. In order to decide such questions, it is necessary&lt;br/&gt;to augment the axiomatic system by additional axioms; such axioms&lt;br/&gt;are usually formulated in the language of infinitary combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;This has to be done in a manner that will not introduce an&lt;br/&gt;inconsistency of the augmented axiomatic system. In some cases,&lt;br/&gt;the consistency of the augmented system (relative to the&lt;br/&gt;Zermelo-Fraenkel system) can be proved using methods formalizable&lt;br/&gt;in the Zermelo-Fraenkel system itself. However, there is an entire&lt;br/&gt;hierarchy of axioms, the so-called large cardinal axioms, which do not&lt;br/&gt;allow this. It is believed that every mathematical statement that is not&lt;br/&gt;decidable from the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms alone -- or at least the&lt;br/&gt;consistency of such a statement -- can be decided using the right large&lt;br/&gt;cardinal axiom. The mathematical praxis provides a lot of support for&lt;br/&gt;this belief. Thus, the large cardinal hierarchy constitutes a kind of&lt;br/&gt;a "scale" that "measures" the complexity of mathematical statements, and&lt;br/&gt;each such statement has an exact match on this scale. The large&lt;br/&gt;cardinal axiom, that together with Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms provides&lt;br/&gt;the very piece of information necessary and sufficient to decide the&lt;br/&gt;(consistency of) the statement, is called the consistency&lt;br/&gt;strength of the statement. Expressed informally: By determining the&lt;br/&gt;consistency strengths, set theory is able to isolate the precise amount&lt;br/&gt;of information that that has to be used along with the standard&lt;br/&gt;mathematical methods in order to decide certain mathematical questions.&lt;br/&gt;Inner model theory, forcing, descriptive set theory, and infinitary&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics constitute crucial tools for this task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
