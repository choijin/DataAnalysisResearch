<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: CTS-0553867 / 0553602&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: P-K YEUNG/ K. R. SREENIVASAN&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: GIT / U. OF MD COLLEGE PARK&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIGH RESOLUTION NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF TURBULENCE &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project are to utilize supercomputing power at the highest level to advance understanding of turbulent flows, via innovative and rigorous analyses of large numerical simulation databases, and via systematic sharing of data with a community of collaborators while pushing the frontiers of computational turbulence.  Emphasis is placed on the dependence of local fluctuations on scale size in space and time, and on several major non-dimensional parameters that express the effects of a wide range of scales in both fixed and moving frames of reference, of different degrees of molecular diffusion, and of Coriolis forces in a rotating frame.  The PIs will conduct high resolution (computational mesh of  4096 cubed, or 69 billion grid points) simulations and interrogate the database using their combined expertise in simulation, theory and experiment to provide definitive answers to fundamental aspects of turbulence, such as intermittency, multifractals, anisotropy, Lagrangian similarity, mixing at high Schmidt numbers, rotating turbulence at low Rossby numbers.  Furthermore, the range of new ideas tested and stimulated by the database will be greatly expanded through working with a group of highly regarded researchers, who will be able to access the data hosted at two NSF TeraGrid sites (SDSC and PSC) in a seamless manner.  The proposed activity will have wide impact because of the importance of turbulence in many fields of science and engineering, the uniqueness of the simulation database generated using millions of supercomputer hours, and innovative arrangements with at least two NSF-supported supercomputer centers for sharing data effectively with many researchers with varied interests in the US and abroad. Advances in the science of turbulent flow will have long-term impact in many problems important to society, including fossil fuel combustion, marine life in oceanography, and newer technologies such as nanomaterial synthesis, all of which depend on turbulent mixing at the small scales. Graduate students will have unique and inspiring opportunities to work at the forefront of scientific computing and develop broader perspectives by working closely with many distinguished researchers in the field.  Similar considerations are expected to motivate qualified undergraduates from under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
