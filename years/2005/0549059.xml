<AbstractNarration>0549059&lt;br/&gt;McDonnell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IAHS Decade on Predictions in Ungauged Basins (PUB) is an initiative of the&lt;br/&gt;International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS) aimed at formulating and&lt;br/&gt;implementing appropriate science programs to engage and energize the scientific community,&lt;br/&gt;in a coordinated manner, towards achieving major advances in the capacity to make reliable&lt;br/&gt;predictions in ungauged basins. Now two years into the effort, PUB participants have&lt;br/&gt;defined a set of community science questions in the hydrological sciences with broad&lt;br/&gt;consensus and community buy-in.&lt;br/&gt;As the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI)&lt;br/&gt;begins its community science question-building effort, there is much that can be learned&lt;br/&gt;from the PUB experience?both good and bad. The PUB example provides a potential template&lt;br/&gt;for the USA CUAHSI community.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests NSF funding to support the preparation and implementation of a&lt;br/&gt;four-day workshop to catalyse the identification of community science questions by the USA&lt;br/&gt;hydrologic community. Workshop goals are: 1) introduce PUB science processes to the USA&lt;br/&gt;hydrological community; 2) explore the utility of six major PUB science themes as a&lt;br/&gt;potential template for USA community science questions; 3) critically discuss the open&lt;br/&gt;questions in hydrology as they pertain to the establishment of hydrologic observatories;&lt;br/&gt;and, 4) spark dialogue among participants to identify the most promising avenues for the&lt;br/&gt;efficient development of community science questions.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be convened by leaders of the USA?s hydrologic science community and&lt;br/&gt;feature presentations by over 30 experts widely recognized in their fields. The workshop&lt;br/&gt;will be among the first to be conducted in association with the newly established National&lt;br/&gt;Center for Hydrologic Synthesis at the University of California, Berkeley. The workshop&lt;br/&gt;will employ the AGU Chapman Conference style that features substantial discussion ?space?&lt;br/&gt;to facilitate a high level of thoughtful participant interactions with speakers and each&lt;br/&gt;other.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop?s intellectual merit derives from the clear need for USA hydrologists to&lt;br/&gt;share experiences, debate approaches, and reach consensus on a new science plan that&lt;br/&gt;embodies a response to the growing demand for multidisciplinary approaches to advance the&lt;br/&gt;science of hydrology. The workshop?s nationally- and internationally-recognized speakers&lt;br/&gt;will deliver compelling content over a broad range of hydrologic topics to&lt;br/&gt;participants?all within a format designed to challenge assumptions, optimize debate, and&lt;br/&gt;inform agreement.&lt;br/&gt;The broader implications of the workshop reach to society?s ability to access, understand,&lt;br/&gt;and act upon improved prediction capacities resulting from a new, more holistic, and&lt;br/&gt;effective orchestration of hydrologic inquiry. The workshop will help define a new&lt;br/&gt;trajectory of research that will allow water resources decisions to be made with greater&lt;br/&gt;resolution, in a more timely manner, and with substantially more confidence.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
