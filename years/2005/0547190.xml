<AbstractNarration>CAREER: Integrated Research and Education in Regional Evaluation of Seismic Hazards                 Laurie G. Baise&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes an integrated research and education plan that incorporates local soil information into the regional evaluation of seismic hazards and expands visualization and analysis tools for the evaluation of three-dimensional geotechnical data. The project will focus on the regional evaluation and mapping of soil amplification and liquefaction. The research aim is to improve visualization and analysis tools that incorporate the overall variability as well as the spatial correlation of geotechnical data to improve regional evaluations of seismic hazards. More accurate, detailed maps of liquefaction and soil amplification susceptibility that account for inherent geologic variability will allow for an evaluation of the effect of this variability and therefore considerably improve the assessment of these seismic hazards over a regional scale. This in turn will allow communities to better plan and mitigate their effects on the built environment. This work will include the development of a three-dimensional visualization and analysis tool for mapping subsurface data and an extensive study of the effect of soil spatial variability on regional seismic hazards. The educational aim is both to encourage the next generation of engineers and scientists to work on seismic hazards and to educate all students about the cause of geologic hazards and associated risk so that they may be informed citizens. The educational component of the project will continue on-going initiatives in undergraduate education and expand into middle school education through the development and use of web-based GIS tools for seismic hazard and geotechnical education. The educational work involves partnerships between middle school teachers and undergraduates through summer research experiences and academic year outreach programs. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
