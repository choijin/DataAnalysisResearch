<AbstractNarration>Engineering Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;This project is fostering both a system-level perspective as well as an appreciation for emerging trends in microwave and analog integrated circuit (IC) design by implementing educational innovations into several Electrical and Computer Engineering courses.  A strategy of vertical integration of RF and microwave electronics materials and concepts through all undergraduate class levels allows weaving a microwave area thread through the curriculum.  A state-of-the-art sub-micron CMOS modeling laboratory is being introduced in an existing senior-level microwave course; a distributed amplifier design laboratory is under development in a junior-level advanced analog course; laboratory exercises are being incorporated into a sophomore circuits course; and a microwave system demonstration is being integrated into the freshmen-level introductory course.  The curricular components are building on exemplary course development experiences from other institutions.  The project assessment plan tracks ABET criteria currently in use for curriculum assessment.  Outreach activities include continuing interaction with middle and high schools that have a large Native American student base.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
