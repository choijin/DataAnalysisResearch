<AbstractNarration>Abstract for: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;US-Poland Workshop on Analytical Models and New Concepts in Concrete and Masonry Structures, CMS 0529707&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Andrzej S. Nowak, University of Nebraska-Lincoln &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed Workshop is to review the recent advancements in concrete&lt;br/&gt;materials and their applications for civil infrastructure systems in Poland and the United&lt;br/&gt;States, identify the most suitable topics for collaboration, and prepare proposals for&lt;br/&gt;joint US-Polish research projects. The Workshop will focus on materials properties, forms&lt;br/&gt;of deterioration and their effects on structural performance, and quantitative analysis of&lt;br/&gt;materials. The major areas to be covered include: (1) advanced materials&lt;br/&gt;(high-strength/high-performance concrete, composites, fiber-reinforced concrete, smart&lt;br/&gt;materials), (2) forms of deterioration for reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete&lt;br/&gt;structures, (3) diagnostic procedures (tests, performance monitors, nondestructive&lt;br/&gt;techniques, signal processing, integrated sensor systems, acoustic and optical&lt;br/&gt;techniques), (4) materials and techniques for repair and rehabilitation of concrete&lt;br/&gt;structures (reinforced and prestressed concrete, new composite materials). Accordingly,&lt;br/&gt;the Workshop will attempt to review state of the art summary of main topics as viewed on&lt;br/&gt;one hand in the U.S. and, on the other hand, in Poland, identify the research needs, in&lt;br/&gt;particular, topics for cooperative projects, and derive some recommendations that reflect&lt;br/&gt;the needs in manpower, technology transfer and education for the near future. The local&lt;br/&gt;organizers will also organize special meetings, lab tours and visits to the construction&lt;br/&gt;sites. The results will be presented in the report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: &lt;br/&gt;The results of the Workshop, including papers prepared and presented by the US and Polish&lt;br/&gt;participants will be available on the Workshop webpage. The results will also be presented&lt;br/&gt;at technical conferences (ASCE, ACI, IABSE).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
