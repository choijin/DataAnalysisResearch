<AbstractNarration>Abstract for REU Site: Design, Application, Analysis and Control of Interfaces (DAACI)&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Stephen P. Beaudoin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU award for a Site on Design, Application, Analysis and Control of Interfaces (DAACI) supports 8 undergraduate students each year for three years in a 10-week summer research experience at Purdue University.  In addition to performing research mentored by faculty and graduate students, the undergraduate students participate in a number of technical and social events which will allow them to integrate with other REU participants, including group lunches with faculty and graduate students, research group discussions, and outings to regional recreation areas and local industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DAACI research projects target interfaces for chemical, electronic, optical, mechanical and biological applications, with key dimensions from nanometers to hundreds of microns.   While the applications are diverse, the research questions are similar: (1) how does one make interfaces with specified composition and specified electronic, mechanical, and biological properties, and (2) how do the interfacial environment and the interface properties influence interface function?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The goals of the site are to inspire promising undergraduates to pursue research careers,&lt;br/&gt; to train them to succeed as graduate researchers, and to empower them as valued &lt;br/&gt; members of the academic community.  The broad research theme will allow them a &lt;br/&gt; rich palette of research options in emerging scientific areas of significance. The&lt;br/&gt; experiences will allow them to work confidently as independent researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The DAACI site will target students from underrepresented groups in engineering, will inspire these students to pursue research careers, and will arm them with a solid foundation in the rational approach to research.  By motivating a broad spectrum of students to pursue research careers and preparing them to excel in research areas of high technological value, the program will have a very significant influence on future research leaders. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
