<AbstractNarration>Towson University seeks to acquire hardware and software necessary to upgrade the force measurement capabilities of an existing Nanoscope III Multimode Atomic Force Microscope (AFM).  Improvements include a new, innovative scanner with a closed-loop control of the z-axis, providing precise control of tip-sample separation over a 20 microns range of motion. Additionally a low noise AFM head with low coherence length light source will be included which eliminates periodic noise (interference effects) and achieves true thermally limited pico-Newton scale performance. The upgrade will provide the quantitative force measurement capabilities necessary to perform experiments encompassing several multidisciplinary projects. Specifically, the instrument will be used to study the light induced magnetism in nanostructured materials, the influence of charge on adhesion, the process of charge transfer between materials, and the mechanical properties and interactions of fungi. In addition to the use in our research programs, an updated instrument will provide added opportunities in undergraduate and graduate education. The educational use of this instrument will occur in laboratory instruction (as a part of undergraduate curriculum) as well as through its use in undergraduate and graduate research projects in all the above-mentioned research areas. Additionally, this equipment will expand the opportunities for undergraduate students and high school teachers participating in Towson University's NSF REU/RET program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) has been successfully used in industrial, government and academic research for over two decades.  These microscopes have rejuvenated the area of nanotechnology, providing scientists with the ability to "see" and manipulate nanometer - size objects. While best known for its ability to provide extremely detailed, three dimensional images of surface features, it is also capable of quantitatively measuring forces between objects. Within the last 10 years, commercially available AFMs have increased in sophistication and capabilities as new technologies have become available. This proposal seeks to upgrade an existing Nanoscope III Atomic Force Microscope to incorporate new technological capabilities. This improvement will provide the ability to study novel methods for data storage and gain fundamental knowledge of how charge affects adhesion in micron-size particles. It will also allow the study of mechanical and adhesive properties of fungi leading to more efficient production of fungal byproducts and the development of better inhibitors for crops.  This instrument will not only impact the scientific community, but will also be used to educate future scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
