    <AbstractNarration>AST-0507424&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: University of California, Santa Cruz&lt;br/&gt;PI: Peter Bodenheimer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Problems in Giant Planet Formation &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Peter Bodenheimer and Dr. Douglas Lin, at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will undertake theoretical investigations of several areas relating to the formation of giant planets. Among the issues are: 1) What mechanisms may have slowed down migration of planets inward toward their host star; 2) What possible mechanisms exist for increasing the rate of gas accretion so that significant accretion can commence at small core masses; and 3) Did Jupiter form with a larger core, which was subsequently eroded and mixed with the gaseous envelope? These remain unsolved problems in understanding the origin of giant planets. The broader impact of the proposed work focuses on the integration of research and scientific education, by means of graduate and undergraduate involvement in the project. The research will also serve to broaden participation in the sciences, by including women in the research. Additionally, the project investigators will encourage broad dissemination of the scientific results, by means of public lectures on planetary science, as well as contributions to science journals for the general public.</AbstractNarration>
