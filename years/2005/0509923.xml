<AbstractNarration>Edward F. DeLong of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute has been awarded a grant to sequence the genome of the marine microbe, Cenarchaeum symbiosum.   This microbe belongs to a divergent lineage of microorganisms known as Archaea, and is a member of one of the most abundant microbial groups in the ocean.   Despite their high abundance however, these microbes have never been cultivated, so their biological properties and ecological significance remain unknown.  Genome sequencing technology can now address this problem, allowing genetic characterization of even uncultivated microbes.   In this project, contemporary genome sequencing strategies will be developed and applied to determine and analyze the whole genome sequence of Cenarchaeum symbiosum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be among the first to determine a whole genome sequence from an uncultivated, undomesticated microbe.  The methods and techniques developed will have broad applications for many other studies.  The technologies developed will enable the study of naturally occurring microorganisms in the environment in many different contexts.    Due to its evolutionary origin, the Cenarchaeum  symbiosum genome sequence will provide new insight into the mechanisms of thermal adaptation in microorganisms.  This information will be useful for studies aiming to modify or isolate active,  thermostable enzymes used in industry, biotechnology,  or commercial products.  Additionally, Cenarchaeum symbiosum belongs to a group of microbes that represent the most abundant cell types in the ocean.  The genome sequence of this microbe should also yield important clues about the function of these widespread and abundant oceanic microorganisms. The data will be made available to the entire scientific community, adding to the growing database of whole microbial genome sequences.  The data will also provide a starting point for future studies of ocean ecology.  This is a Microbial Genome Sequencing Award funded through a collaborative program between the National Science Foundation and the Department of Agriculture.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
