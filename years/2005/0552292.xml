<AbstractNarration>This award by the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Juniata College for the summers of 2006-2008. The program director is David Reingold. Twelve students each year will do research in the synthesis of Theoretically Interesting Molecules (TIM) at six undergraduate institutions (Juniata College,  Macalester College, Northern Kentucky University, Saint Michaels College, Trinity College (CT), and Trinity University (TX)). Each faculty member will accept 2 students for 10 weeks of summer research. The consortium will gather two times a summer. The first meeting will serve as an introduction to the chemistry going on in each group and as an extended group meeting to discuss immediate results and problems. It will take place at one of the major national meetings, such as the National Organic Symposium or the Reaction Mechanisms Conference. The last meeting will afford the students a chance to present their results. One of the major TIM researchers will join us for both of the meetings. In between the meetings, there will be electronic communication among students and faculty of the consortium. REU student participants will present their research at regional and national scientific meetings and through publication in refereed journals. Students will also prepare posters of their results for the web site and for display at the home campus.</AbstractNarration>
