    <AbstractNarration>The investigator studies two related but different aspecta of&lt;br/&gt;vortex dynamics in three space dimensions. The first project&lt;br/&gt;concerns the global regularity of Euler flows in three dimensions. &lt;br/&gt;This important outstanding problem of applied analysis is attacked&lt;br/&gt;by the investigator and colleagues with the aim of showing that,&lt;br/&gt;under appropriate conditions of flow topology, global regularity&lt;br/&gt;is obtained. In addition an estimate of the time rate of growth&lt;br/&gt;of the maximum vorticity should be accessible. The approach&lt;br/&gt;utilizes maximization of the growth of vorticity and a variational&lt;br/&gt;construction of an artificial structure (the "cocoon") near the&lt;br/&gt;vorticity maximum. The second project concerns analysis together&lt;br/&gt;with numerical and physical experiments of modes of hovering in&lt;br/&gt;flapping flight. An oscillating flow facility already in use&lt;br/&gt;provides the starting point for investigations of the vortical&lt;br/&gt;flow in the vicinity of small flapping hoverers. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;and the research staff of the CIMS Applied Mathematics Laboratory&lt;br/&gt;develop analytical and numerical models for the study of hovering&lt;br/&gt;flight, motivated by the current interest in micro-aerodynamic&lt;br/&gt;vehicles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project deals with two related problems involving the&lt;br/&gt;difficult problem of analysis of three-dimensional fields of fluid&lt;br/&gt;motion and the complex eddying motions that occur in many&lt;br/&gt;important time-dependent flows. The first problem that the&lt;br/&gt;investigator and his colleagues study is the theoretical question&lt;br/&gt;of "blowup" of solutions of Euler's equations, wherein the flow&lt;br/&gt;develops a rough or singular structure after a finite time. &lt;br/&gt;Although much effort has been devoted to trying to find such&lt;br/&gt;behavior in fluid flows, the question remains open. The&lt;br/&gt;contention the investigator explores is that in fact for most&lt;br/&gt;flows, especially those for which the "knottedness" of the&lt;br/&gt;vorticity is sufficiently simple, blowup does not occur. This&lt;br/&gt;regularity property of the flows can be established in some simple&lt;br/&gt;cases, and methods under development by the investigator promise&lt;br/&gt;to be applicable to a larger class, whose size needs to be&lt;br/&gt;determined. The study has important implications for global&lt;br/&gt;analysis of Euler flows, and perhaps also for the numerical&lt;br/&gt;computation of these flows. The second project is different in&lt;br/&gt;emphasis and brings into play a combination of analysis with&lt;br/&gt;numerical and physical experiments to study the hovering flight of&lt;br/&gt;small flapping flyers of the kind envisioned in the context of&lt;br/&gt;micro-aerodynamic flight. This work aims to understand the&lt;br/&gt;eddying motions produced by certain kinds of flapping structures,&lt;br/&gt;and the mechanism of lift production in various cases of hovering&lt;br/&gt;flight. The work has possible applications to the engineering&lt;br/&gt;design of extremely small air vehicles, as well as a bearing on&lt;br/&gt;the understanding of insect flight.</AbstractNarration>
