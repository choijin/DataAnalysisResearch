<AbstractNarration>The investigator studies several problems in the theory of fractional &lt;br/&gt;factorial design. Some recent results in finite projective geometry &lt;br/&gt;provide powerful tools for characterizing the structures of regular &lt;br/&gt;fractional factorial designs of resolution IV in certain important cases. &lt;br/&gt;One major research activity is to expand these tools and apply them to &lt;br/&gt;develop a comprehensive theory for the determination and construction of &lt;br/&gt;optimal regular fractional factorial designs of resolution IV under the &lt;br/&gt;criterion of minimum aberration. The results are further extended to &lt;br/&gt;nonregular designs and the situation where the experimental units are &lt;br/&gt;divided into more homogeneous blocks to improve precision. The research on &lt;br/&gt;nonregular designs provides new methods for constructing orthogonal arrays &lt;br/&gt;of strength three. Hidden projection properties of multi-level designs are &lt;br/&gt;also investigated. Under the assumption of effect sparsity, a design with &lt;br/&gt;good projections onto small subsets of factors can provide useful &lt;br/&gt;information after the small number of active factors have been identified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental design is used extensively in a wide range of scientific and &lt;br/&gt;industrial investigations. In industrial experiments, often a large number &lt;br/&gt;of factors have to be studied, but the experiments are expensive to &lt;br/&gt;conduct. In this case, only a small fraction of all the possible &lt;br/&gt;combinations can be observed, and how to choose a good fraction is an &lt;br/&gt;important issue. In recent years, such fractional factorial designs have &lt;br/&gt;received considerable attention, mainly due to the success in applying &lt;br/&gt;them to conduct experiments for improving quality and productivity in &lt;br/&gt;industrial manufacturing. This research is to study the construction of &lt;br/&gt;efficient designs to extract more information. Experimenters will be &lt;br/&gt;benefited by having a rich source of new and good designs, and will be &lt;br/&gt;able to run their experiments more efficiently. Better industrial &lt;br/&gt;experiments can improve the quality of products and reduce production &lt;br/&gt;cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
