<AbstractNarration>This MWN (Materials World Network) project is a joint research and education activity between West Virginia University and Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (PUC). The project addresses materials science issues involved in the combination of ferroelectric, magnetic and traditional semiconductor nanostructures with devices based on new or enhanced electronic properties achieved through heterostructures. Primary research issues being addressed are: epitaxial growth of high quality materials on semiconductors (or vice-versa), and control of the ferroelectric or magnetic/semiconductor interface. The approach utilizes MBE growth of ferroelectric, magnetic, or other multifunction layers on GaN without exposing surfaces to atmospheric contaminants. The growth apparatus will also be integrated with existing ultra-high vacuum scanning probe microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy capabilities. This will permit investigation of initial layer nucleation on GaN and provide information to establish a fundamental understanding of the interface, demonstrate epitaxial growth of ferroelectric layers, and allow integration of magnetic multilayers into such hybrid systems. Other issues being addressed are the effects of molecular adsorption on ferroelectric/semiconductor multifunctional devices. Imaging Raman spectroscopy with sub-micrometer spatial resolution, ellipsometry, x-ray photoemission, spectroscopy, and electric force microsopy, available at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (PUC) Physics Department, will be used to probe materials properties on a microscopic level. &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The project addresses fundamental research issues associated with electronic and photonic materials having technological relevance. An important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on education, stressing integration of research and education, and an international collaboration providing both scientific and educational benefits. The project will establish a strong collaboration with PUC scientists that will include exchange of undergraduate and graduate students between West Virginia University (WVU) and Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (PUC). Undergraduate students will not only actively participate in the research program during the academic year, but will also have the opportunity to spend a significant portion of the summers at PUC, providing them with cultural immersion combined with a serious scientific experience. Graduate students will also participate in the research and will be able to visit PUC to coordinate our laboratory efforts. In the long term, this program will aid WVU in attracting qualified students, and in particular, will reinforce WVU's underrepresented minority outreach efforts, especially those directed toward Latino students. In addition, it will also result in new knowledge that could someday be used to fabricate more efficient electronic sensors and data storage devices.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
