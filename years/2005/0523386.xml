<AbstractNarration>0523386&lt;br/&gt;Osgood&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;The thrust of research on new integrated-optics devices is to increase functionality and reduce spatial dimensions over those in existing devices. One approach to this goal has been to use the strong optical confinement possible in photonic crystals; using this approach a new series of ultrasmall optical passive device structures have been fabricated. The focus of the research described here is to investigate methods of realizing photonic-crystal-based structures for nonlinear optical devices. Nonlinear optical response can be employed to achieve unique device functionalities for ultrafast all-optical control and processing schemes, including switching, wavelength conversion, wavelength multiplexing/demultiplexing, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research uses a unified approach, integrating research on experimental and theoretical techniques needed for nonlinear crystal devices. The focus of the materials research will be the use of single-crystal thin-film ferroelectric materials, that is, LiNbO3 in particular, and research on fabrication methods using this material. Research on numerical techniques will be toward robust, general methods for exact computation of effects induced by optical nonlinearities in periodic complex structures.  In particular, the research program will consist of a) fabrication of 2D high-index-contrast nonlinear photonic-crystal waveguides and devices that incorporate such structures; b) theoretical investigation of devices based on the nonlinear optical response of photonic crystals; and c) new techniques for numerical simulation of light interaction with nonlinear periodic structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;Educational goals are integrated into this research program. In particular, the program will offer an excellent opportunity for its graduate students to engage in cross-disciplinary research, which combines basic materials science problems along with challenges in understanding optical systems needs and in employing and developing rigorous applied mathematical techniques. The proposing group has a strong record in such broad-based research. Further the program is highly collaborative with other major research laboratories located in the Northeast. A strong program of teaching in photonics and photonics devices at Columbia University matches the research in this area. Finally, undergraduate research is also an integral part of this program since undergraduates will be encouraged to be involved in extended, hands-on experimental and numerical projects within the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
