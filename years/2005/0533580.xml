<AbstractNarration>The National Center for Women and Information Technology (NCWIT) seeks to establish an extension service for nationwide, significant, and sustained increase in enrollment and graduation of women in undergraduate information technology bachelor's degree programs. The goal is to actively target an existing coalition of academic departments. This coalition, the NCWIT Academic Alliance, is eager to implement effective practices for increasing participation of women in their programs. A key process in the plan is to develop quickly many types of "exemplar institutions" that will serve as replicable role models of success. Processes and outcomes of these exemplars will be broadly disseminated, and support will be provided for change efforts, increasing the likelihood that other institutions can successfully emulate the effective processes. Exemplar institutions will serve as proof points to the entire nation and will become hubs for accelerated regional change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Bell Labs Fellow and a respected member of the computing research and information technology community of deans will lead the reform effort. Social scientists who are experts on issues of women in computing and program evaluation will implement, consult, collect and analyze data. A nationally recognized leader in assessing programmatic educational reform will conduct the external formative evaluation of the proposed extension service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our Unified Program of Change includes annual workshops for disseminating evidence-based effective practices and for supporting outreach, recruiting, and dissemination to regional communities. We will provide customized consultations with experts in implementation and industry members as well as small grants for research-related innovation and development by faculty. Evaluation is built into every aspect of the project to maximize positive outcomes for all stakeholders. Our model of active dissemination and implementation of known effective practices to a group committed to effecting real change will allow us to create exemplar institutions quickly. Such institutions can serve as proof points to the entire nation and will become hubs for accelerated regional change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project is uniquely situated for success in increasing the participation of women in computing. The Academic Alliance is in place, growing, and eager to implement interventions. Each member is committed to implement only practices shown in research to increase recruitment and retention of women. Interventions will be closely evaluated through rigorous social science methods, led by expert social scientists. Each Academic Alliance member will be supported in collecting and analyzing its own data for ongoing formative evaluation, and will supply data to NCWIT for summative evaluation. The multi-pronged approach to each intervention will focus on changing the system, not just overcoming "deficiencies" among female students. Thus it requires fewer resources and will be sustained beyond the funding period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact: Increasing women's participation in IT has far-reaching national consequences. Not only do information and computing technologies pervade all aspects of our everyday lives in an unprecedented way, but all engineering and science discovery and innovation are now considered to be dependent on computational science. Increasing the pool of qualified computing professionals supports national goals: nanotechnology, the Cyberinfrastructure Initiative, and our economic, security, defense, and health care systems all depend on computing. Increasing the participation of women not only provides for national needs, but improves the development and design of computing systems, applications, and products through the integration of diverse ideas while helping overcome economic disparities for women.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[2012 Project Outcomes Report for NCWIT Extension Services for Undergraduate Programs  The overarching goal of the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT) Extension Services for Undergraduate Programs (ES-UP) is to support systemic change in undergraduate computing departments in ways that increase the recruitment and retention of women.  The purpose of the ES-UP is to provide customized consultation services to members of the NCWIT Academic Alliance for implementing systemic change in their undergraduate programs in ways that increase enrollment, retention, and graduation of women.  NCWIT ES-UP works to accomplish our objectives through numerous activities.

In addition, we have      distributed 26,877 resources at these events. Growing our clientele: ES-UP has      recruited and consulted with 39 clients over the lifetime of the project. Scaling our consultants to      match our client base: ES-UP has expanded the community of highly trained social      science and evaluation professionals through the hiring and training of a      total of 19 Extension Services Consultants and two Directors of Research      and Consulting. Implementation of Extension      Services: With the goal of increasing womenÆs representation and retention      of all computing students, clients and our consultants implemented the following      processes: Information Gathering Visits (100%), use of the Tracking Tool (87%),      Strategic Planning Workshops (90%), Student Experience of the Major Surveys      (56%), Research Experiences for Undergraduates (83%), Baseline Reports      (97%), and Client Status Reports (86%). Extend impact of full-service      clients: Thirty-seven percent of ES-UP clients were also NCWIT Pacesetters      which is a program that includes both Workforce and Academic Alliance      members who have made a substantial commitment to accelerate the pace of      reform nationally and commit to rapid progress in the area of women and      computing.   According to the NCWIT ES external evaluator, our project was successful in creating change in our clientÆs departments. The program has made an impact on the recruitment and retention of women in computing degrees. Some specific outcomes include:  Fifty-eight      programs submitting data into our Tracking Tool that showed our clients      had served 14,940 newly enrolled students of which 13.3% were female.

In addition, our clients accepted 48% of the      female applicants who applied to their programs and enrolled 45% of the      female acceptances. These findings may be explained by particularly high      quality female applicants or by departmental efforts to recruit and admit      as many qualified women as possible.   Both womenÆs and menÆs attrition rates decreased from 2010 tracking data by 4% and 2% respectively. I...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
