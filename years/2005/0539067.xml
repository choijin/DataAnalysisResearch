<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will demonstrate a micro-optical distributed sensor technology for temperature, pressure and strain measurements. The measurement principle is based on the detection of optical mode shifts of dielectric micro-beads that serve as sensors. The sensors are weakly coupled to one or more optical fibers and are excited by a tunable laser light. The technology exploits the morphology dependent shifts in resonant frequencies that are commonly referred to as the whispering gallery modes (WGM). A change in a physical condition surrounding the micro-bead "sensor", such as temperature, pressure or force, will cause a change in the size, shape or the dielectric constant of the sensor thereby causing shifts in WGM. With typical quality factors of 106-108, these shifts can be detected with resolutions and dynamic ranges that are beyond those realized by the existing mechanical sensors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will advance understanding of fundamental processes associated with formation of optical modes in weakly coupled micro-resonators in various environments. The technology can have a significant impact on process control in manufacturing industries as well as the medical field. Further, the successful completion of this effort will lay the groundwork for the development of a much broader range of WGM-based distributed sensors that can include species concentration detection with potential applications in homeland security and other areas.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
