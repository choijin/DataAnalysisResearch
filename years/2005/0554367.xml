<AbstractNarration>This project is motivated by the most interesting source of gravitational waves: the inspiral of a binary pair of black holes. The final plunge of the holes toward each other, and the merger to form one final hole, must be handled by the supercomputer methods of numerical relativity, but those methods cannot handle the epoch of the binary before the plunge/merger: the many orbits in which the black holes strongly interact, but follow nearly circular orbits. This epoch of the binary will be studied using an unusual approximation scheme (the "periodic standing wave approximation") and with innovative mathematical/computational methods ("adapted coordinates").&lt;br/&gt;The results of the approximation method will not only let us understand the pre-merger astrophysics, but will give crucial support to the work in numerical relativity by providing the best possible starting point for numerical relativity computations. In addition, spin-offs of the work will be new approximation/computational methods that are likely to find applicability in other fields. This work will be carried out in a very new university in an underserved region of the country; the presence of forefront scientific research activity at the university helps to provide role models for students to encourage them to consider careers in science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ ?Relativistic theories of gravitation, in particular Einstein's general relativity, now play a leading role in astronomy. The work done under this grant is a reflection of the importance of this new astrophysics, and of the new mathematical and computational realities that are involved.  All the supported work falls in this combined area of relativity, astronomy, and computation, but individual projects are quite distinct and some emphasize one or another corner of this area.   At least three of the projects focused on the applied mathematics that is effective in dealing with the astrophysics of black holes.  One result answered a longstanding controversy about the way in which disturbances to black holes die off, showing that the correct answer was not the "common sense" answer.  Another of the projects showed that a change in mathematical viewpoint could eliminate apparent problems in computations in which a compact object spirals into black hole emitting radiation. For such inspirals the third result explains the surprising pattern of emission of momentum.    Several of the projects emphasized applied or computational mathematics, though in an astrophysical setting. One project gave a mathematical explanation of the pattern of success and failure of a computational method that had long been used for binary pairs of neutron stars; another presented a new, potentially superior mathematical method for dealing with the polarization of radio waves in cosmology; a third project pushed forward the development of an innovative computational technique with many applications, one of which would be improved starting conditions for the inspiral of close neutron star binaries.   Two very distinct sets of projects involved pulsars. One set analyzed potential sensitivity of pulsar timing to very long wavelength gravitational waves. The other analyzed the effect of the bending of a pulsar beam by the black hole at the center of our Galaxy and concluded that there is a marginal possibility of observing such beams with current or future radio telescopes.
