    <AbstractNarration>The main activity of the project is the analysis of new limit laws and &lt;br/&gt;their associated integrable differential equations that appear in a &lt;br/&gt;variety of stochastic processes. These stochastic processes include the &lt;br/&gt;Airy process, the Pearcey process and its higher order generalizations, &lt;br/&gt;a nonintersecting Brownian excursion path model, and a class of &lt;br/&gt;interacting particle systems called the asymmetric exclusion process. &lt;br/&gt;The main methods to be employed are a combination of ideas and &lt;br/&gt;techniques coming from random matrix theory, integrable systems and &lt;br/&gt;operator theory. An operator theory application to integrable systems &lt;br/&gt;would establish new limit theorems for a class of operator determinants &lt;br/&gt;providing solutions to the cylindrical Toda equations in so-called &lt;br/&gt;critical cases. The methods are related to those used in the study of &lt;br/&gt;truncated Wiener-Hopf and Toeplitz operators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many physical systems possess such complicated behavior that exact &lt;br/&gt;predictions become impossible. Random matrix theory provides &lt;br/&gt;mathematical models that allow a simulation of such behavior and &lt;br/&gt;predictions that allow comparison with experiment. This was its original &lt;br/&gt;motivation, but it has since had significant applications in other areas &lt;br/&gt;of mathematics, science and technology, in such diverse subjects as &lt;br/&gt;communications, probability, statistics, number theory, condensed matter &lt;br/&gt;physics, and engineering. One can anticipate that ideas from random &lt;br/&gt;matrix theory and techniques developed in part by the PI and his &lt;br/&gt;collaborators will be instrumental in the study of the stochastic &lt;br/&gt;processes describe above. Further, the project should provide, through &lt;br/&gt;the integrable differential equations, implementable numerical &lt;br/&gt;algorithms to compute properties of these processes. This last aspect is &lt;br/&gt;most important for applications.</AbstractNarration>
