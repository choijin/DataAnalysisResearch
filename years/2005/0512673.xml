<AbstractNarration>The investigator is studying connections between conventional finite element&lt;br/&gt;methods and the cutting edge discontinuous Galerkin method. Only recently has&lt;br/&gt;it been discovered that the differential operators discretized via these&lt;br/&gt;philosophically distinct methods have closely related eigenspectra.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator is synthesizing analytical and numerical tools from both fields to&lt;br/&gt;examine and improve the robustness of the latter method when used with highly&lt;br/&gt;non-conforming discretization resolution. In addition, the investigator and a&lt;br/&gt;graduate student are creating an object oriented library which allows&lt;br/&gt;non-experts to use combinations of these methods through a simple and intuitive&lt;br/&gt;interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As new techniques for computational simulation of physical phenomena are&lt;br/&gt;developed, it is extremely important to determine under what circumstances they&lt;br/&gt;perform at their best and in a predictable way. There has been significant&lt;br/&gt;interest in the recently developed discontinuous Galerkin simulation method,&lt;br/&gt;because it can solve large scale problems not readily attainable with existing&lt;br/&gt;methods. For example, these methods can potentially increase the accuracy,&lt;br/&gt;efficiency, and scope of modeling radar scattering from large complex aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator is studying how to predict when this new method will give&lt;br/&gt;physically reasonable solutions, for example in computing the noise generated&lt;br/&gt;by next generation aircraft. The end product of this investigation will be a&lt;br/&gt;set of guidelines on how and when to best use the methods. Furthermore, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator is developing a software library which will ease transfer of these&lt;br/&gt;high resolution methods by simplifying the process of rapid prototyping and&lt;br/&gt;testing of new critical core components for physics simulation tools.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
