    <AbstractNarration>The Mw=9.3 Dec 2004 Sumatra earthquake ruptured 1000 miles of &lt;br/&gt;India's eastern plate boundary causing damage in the Nicobar and &lt;br/&gt;Andaman islands, shifting them bodily 3m-7m southwestward, and &lt;br/&gt;tilting them down to the east. Although shaking damage in the &lt;br/&gt;Andaman and Nicobar islands was minor, the tilting caused massive &lt;br/&gt;damage to coastline ecologies. Thousands of hectares of agricultural &lt;br/&gt;land were flooded, and erosion of forested shorelines has commenced &lt;br/&gt;in regions that sank. Hundreds of km of coral reefs were killed where &lt;br/&gt;the land rose, with attendant loss of nearshore fishing grounds. Yet &lt;br/&gt;clearly this was not the first time that this has occurred, and it &lt;br/&gt;is certain that it will occur again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several societal questions arise. How frequently do these &lt;br/&gt;catastrophic tsunami earthquakes occur? Are the flooded islands &lt;br/&gt;permanently drowned or will they slowly recover their former levels? &lt;br/&gt;Will the saline intrusion and flooding of shoreline farmland be &lt;br/&gt;reversed or worsened in the coming decades. Will harbor defenses &lt;br/&gt;and docks require extended construction to accommodate additional &lt;br/&gt;submergence or emergence. In what way does the Sumatra earthquake &lt;br/&gt;resemble a similar Mw=9 expected in the Pacific NW of the US? What &lt;br/&gt;can be learned from the Sumatra earthquake that has application to &lt;br/&gt;the coasts of Oregon and Washington?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These questions can be answered from a geophysical knowledge of the &lt;br/&gt;subsurface process involved in the Sumatra/Andaman event. Near Port &lt;br/&gt;Blair, where most of the people of the Andaman/Nicobar islands live, &lt;br/&gt;the plate boundary accomodates both northward motion of India and the &lt;br/&gt;westward motion of the Andaman plate: every 100 years it accommodate &lt;br/&gt;s roughly1 m of northward motion and 4 m of convergence. All this &lt;br/&gt;motion occurs infrequently in earthquakes, yet it is driven by slow &lt;br/&gt;interseismic processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists from Memphis and Colorado are investigating continued &lt;br/&gt;movements in the Andaman islands using Global Positioning geodesy and &lt;br/&gt;sea level monitoring devices to find out whether these catastrophic &lt;br/&gt;changes are increasing or decreasing. The spatial variation of these &lt;br/&gt;effects with time provides unique constraints on the continuing &lt;br/&gt;processes in the islands. Their initial results indicate that &lt;br/&gt;although the islands continue to move SW some of the subsidence has &lt;br/&gt;been reversed. In this two year project they hope to provide many &lt;br/&gt;hundreds of points to constrain future motions, and to answer how &lt;br/&gt;frequently these earthquakes occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of their objectives is to show local scientists how to undertake &lt;br/&gt;these kinds of measurements. Strong collaborative agreements have &lt;br/&gt;been established with scientists affiliated with the Society for &lt;br/&gt;Andaman and Nicobar Ecology (SANE) who have access throughout most of &lt;br/&gt;the islands.</AbstractNarration>
