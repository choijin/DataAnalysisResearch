<AbstractNarration>The research being done by Professors Daniel Carman and Kenneth Hicks &lt;br/&gt;of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Ohio University is conducted &lt;br/&gt;in the area of intersection between nuclear and particle physics.  One goal &lt;br/&gt;is to study the production of subatomic particles having at least one &lt;br/&gt;"strange" quark in their makeup.  The strange quark is heavier than the &lt;br/&gt;conventional "up" or "down" quarks that make up common particles found in &lt;br/&gt;the nucleus, like the proton and the neutron.  Interestingly, studies &lt;br/&gt;involving particles with "strangeness" represent a new way to investigate &lt;br/&gt;the dynamics and structure of matter composed of non-strange quarks.  This&lt;br/&gt;is accomplished by understanding how particles without strangeness decay into&lt;br/&gt;particles containing these strange quarks.  These experimental studies provide &lt;br/&gt;more information and constraints for the underlying theory of the quark structure &lt;br/&gt;of particles and their excited states known as quantum chromodynamics (QCD).  &lt;br/&gt;One possible extension to the known set of subatomic particles would be the &lt;br/&gt;discovery of "exotic" particles which are allowed by the rules of QCD, but not &lt;br/&gt;yet seen experimentally.  In particular, the glue which binds quarks can itself &lt;br/&gt;carry a portion of the spin quantum numbers of a particle, and these particles &lt;br/&gt;are predicted to exist.  Understanding the nature of this glue is one of the most&lt;br/&gt;important unanswered question in the field of nuclear physics.  Experiments at &lt;br/&gt;the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) in Newport &lt;br/&gt;News, VA, where Carman and Hicks do their research, are searching for signs of &lt;br/&gt;exotic particles, which (if found) will extend our knowledge of the strong &lt;br/&gt;force that binds quarks together into subatomic particles and into the very &lt;br/&gt;structure of the matter around us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
