<AbstractNarration>Physics (13) The two universities are collaborating to set up the Problem Solving Laboratory system (PSL) developed by the Physics Education Research and Development Group (PERDG) at University of Minnesota-Twin Cities for introductory physics courses at the two campuses. UMC has a long-term goal of integrating videobased PSLs into study modules suitable for K-12 teacher training. Video based labs and software associated with pre-lab quizzes are being expanded to facilitate distance education. The UND counterpart project utilizes technical expertise gained by the Minnesota group to set up a PSL system in introductory physics courses on campus. In particular, UND is using (1) TA training materials, (2) more effective collaborative problem-solving lab instruction, (3) a version of PSL manuals for non-majors customized for UND, (4) a computerized pre-lab quiz system. The project aims to increase the impact of laboratory exercises on student learning by enforcing more active student involvement.  The project is being evaluated by an evaluator at another neighboring university.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the activity is that it is investigating the impact on student learning of changing the laboratory instruction system and thus evaluating the PSL system in the context of another state university with different infrastructure and different constraints. It does this by comparing against a baseline that has already been developed. The project addresses weaknesses uncovered by student surveys with content retention questions, student assessment and other measures. The new system applies leverage to get at these fundamental points. Its effectiveness is amenable to quantitative measurement. The project is a large-scale attempt to bring about improvement through systemic change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact of the project is that all service courses come under a cycle of measurement-based incremental improvement. Working with U of M and UMC is particularly beneficial for gaining a knowledge base for developing K-12 physics teacher training courses and workshops and also for development of effective distance learning courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expectations for student comprehension are raised, and labs are coordinated more closely with lectures. Computerized pre-lab quizzes, if successful, could generalize to wider application in the curriculum. The degree to which the implementation succeeds at UND (not untypical of many Midwestern universities) will be analyzed and a report submitted for publication. The project has direct impact on the involvement of women in the department (25% of GTAs and the project coordinator).  Curriculum materials are available in public domain via the internet.</AbstractNarration>
