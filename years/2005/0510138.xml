<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The synthetic materials (metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites) developed in research laboratories during the past century have revolutionized life. However, at present, the possibilities of designing and producing synthetic materials with improved performance are being exhausted. Therefore researchers are turning their attention to nature, trying to understand it better, with the goal of mimicking its designs. This emerging field of Biomimetics seeks to design properties into materials modeled after biological systems.  The proposed study addresses the abalone shell that is highly prized as a source of nacre, or mother-of-pearl. Yet, is comprised of 95% chalk, which is weak and brittle. The complex nanostructure and microstructure of the shell are such that adding 5% of an organic glue leads to a toughness that is orders of magnitude higher than that of chalk. The goal of the proposed research is to understand, at the fundamental level, why the shell is so strong and to use this knowledge to develop a new generation of ceramic composites with superior properties. &lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: A four-year program with strong characterization and analysis components will be carried out: development of new micro- and nano-mechanical testing methods to establish viscoelastic mechanical response of the protein layer(s) that act as an adhesive between tiles. This approach requires the use of atomic force microscopy, nanoindentation and nanoscratch tests, a miniaturized shear test (analogous to the meso scale test used by the PI), modeling mechanical responses through novel mechanisms incorporating viscoelastic response of organic layer; identification and quantification of the changes in the organic layers that occur after deformation using micro-Raman spectroscopy and FTIR, and identification of mechanisms by which tiles grow in "Christmas tree" pattern and transmit their orientation from level to level. Based on these observations, a detailed growth model for aragonite (the orthorhombic phase of CaCO3) will be developed.  The ultimate goal is the use of biologically-inspired techniques to synthesize new materials. Research will be carried out at University of California San Diego, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Graduate and undergraduate students from San Diego and Mexico will be involved in the learning process, as well as high school students. The Preuss School, a charter high school that is designed as in intensive college preparatory educational program for low-income students in the grades 6-12, will be involved.  These students come from families whose parents have not received college training.  Two senior high school students will work during the school year (4-6 hrs/week, as allowed by The Preuss School) and full time during their summer breaks (6 weeks).  It is emphasized that no abalone are harmed or killed for these experiments. &lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Materials Research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
