<AbstractNarration>CAREER:  Understanding, Estimating, and Reducing Processor Design Complexity &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this CAREER project is to understand, estimate, and reduce processor design complexity.  The project will develop three-component complexity metrics for processor design complexity:  a procedure to account for the contributions of the different components in the design, accurate statistical regression of experimental measures using a nonlinear mixed-effects model, and a productivity adjustment to account for the productivities of different teams.  Once the metrics are developed, new approaches to reduce processor design complexity will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current development costs for top of the line processors are staggering due to the rapidly-growing complexity of microprocessor design.  As larger and more complex processors are designed, it is becoming increasingly difficult to estimate design and verification times.  Processor design cost estimation still does not have a quantitative approach, and there is little work on measuring, understanding, and estimating the effort required.  The project will address these issues be developing appropriate quantitive metrics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Designing new processors is a challenging task. Thousands of employes work just to design and validate a single processor core. Verification of modern processors is an expensive, time consuming, andchallenging task. Although it is estimated that over half of total designtime is spent on verification, we often find processors with bugs released intothe market.  Even though this is a time consuming task, the computer archtiecture research community does not have any quantitative model to estimate design time impact for a given archtiectural modification. This work has provided the funds to analyze several processor designs, propose models and techniques to estimate design times. Our proposed simulation infrastructure models the interaction between engineers during the development and verification cycles.   In addition, this project has allowed the architecture that tolerates, not just the typically infrequent bugs found in current processors, but a significantly larger set of bugs. The objective is to allow for a much quicker time to market. We proposean architecture built around Beta Cores, which are cores partially verified.Our proposal intelligently activates and deactivates a simple single issue in-order Checker Core to verify a buggy superscalar out-of-order Beta Core.  This project has provided funds necessary to support 2 PhD students and 1 MS student.       Last Modified: 05/07/2012       Submitted by: Jose Renau]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
