<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0537531&lt;br/&gt;Masayoshi Tomizuka&lt;br/&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the Joint U.S.-China workshop to be held in Jinan, China, on Integrated Sensing Systems, Mechatronics and Smart Structures Technologies are: (a) to evaluate the current status of research and education in the topic areas in the United States and China, (b) identify critical and strategic research and educational issues of mutual interest, (c) identify joint research projects and potential research teams for collaborative research activities, and (d) identify the research data, experimental test beds, and resources that can be shared by the researchers for joint research projects.  The intellectual merits of this project are embedded in the identification of high impact research issues of mutual interest to the U.S. and China in the area of advanced sensing systems, mechatronics and smart structures technologies, and in strengthening the U.S.-China network for conducting joint collaborative studies to address these research issues for the benefit of the research community and general public in the two countries. The workshop is designed to have a broad impact in the areas of integrated sensor systems, mechatronics and smart structure technologies for aerospace, civil and mechanical systems through international collaborations both in terms of research and education. The workshop will invite, and make every effort to include, the participation of young and underrepresented groups of researchers to enhance the diversity of representation and their involvement in scientific activities. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
