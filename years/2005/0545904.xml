<AbstractNarration>The investigator studies the use of p-adic analytic techniques in &lt;br/&gt;several aspects of arithmetic geometry. One focus is on the p-adic &lt;br/&gt;cohomology of algebraic varieties over finite fields, including &lt;br/&gt;theoretical questions like the stability of coefficient objects under &lt;br/&gt;cohomological operations, and computational problems like the &lt;br/&gt;determination of zeta functions of specific curves and surfaces. Another &lt;br/&gt;focus is the classification of Galois representations over local fields &lt;br/&gt;(p-adic Hodge theory); goals of this include gaining insight into &lt;br/&gt;proposed Langlands-style correspondences between Galois representations &lt;br/&gt;and representations of p-adic Lie groups, as well as unifying the &lt;br/&gt;treatment of Hodge theory in the complex and p-adic settings. These foci &lt;br/&gt;share common (and recently developed) technical elements from the theory &lt;br/&gt;of p-adic differential equations, which again have strong &lt;br/&gt;complex-analytic analogues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of p-adic analytic methods in arithmetic geometry, as in the &lt;br/&gt;investigator's work, has great significance within mathematics; for &lt;br/&gt;instance, it is currently being used to pursue generalizations of the &lt;br/&gt;techniques underlying the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. But it also &lt;br/&gt;has surprising practical significance due to the appearance of systems &lt;br/&gt;of polynomial equations over finite fields (such as the integers modulo &lt;br/&gt;a prime number) in combinatorics and computer science. For instance, &lt;br/&gt;elliptic curve-based cryptography has been adopted by NIST as a standard &lt;br/&gt;for secure communications thanks to its balance of efficiency versus &lt;br/&gt;security; p-adic methods can be used to select curves suitable for this &lt;br/&gt;construction. Geometry over finite fields also appears in the &lt;br/&gt;construction of many error-correcting codes; p-adic methods can be &lt;br/&gt;deployed to search for codes which correct transmission errors without &lt;br/&gt;carrying too much overhead. So far these applications rely on proven &lt;br/&gt;statements in the theory of p-adic cohomology, but the theory is &lt;br/&gt;somewhat unfinished and it seems likely that future applications will &lt;br/&gt;rely for their provable correctness on statements not yet proved. It is &lt;br/&gt;thus important to pursue theoretical and practical aspects in parallel.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project primarily involves the use of differential methods (p-adic cohomology) in number theory and algebraic geometry, at both theoretical and practical levels. Findings of principal intellectual merit include the following.  A key theorem in p-adic cohomology (semistable reduction) that is needed to resolve several foundational problems in that theory. This should enable new applications of this theory within number theory and possibly other fields. An offshoot of the previous result leads to a formal classification of certain partial differential equations. This is relevant to asymptotic analysis for such equations, which arises in various science and engineering contexts. Related results are obtained in p-adic Hodge theory. These intervene in some recent breakthrough results in number theory, such as a 40-year old conjecture of Serre on the link between Galois representations and modular forms (resolved by Khare, Wintenberger, and Kisin). Some results with applications in computer science, especially cryptography. For example, p-adic cohomology leads to algorithms used to construct certain cryptographic systems based on hyperelliptic curves. Another key result is a theorem (joint with Umans) reducing the difficulty of factoring very large polynomials.   Broader impacts of the project include the following.  Initial sponsorship of the AIM Teachers Circle project. This project has been developing materials for middle-school and high-school teachers, to bring alternate viewpoints on mathematics and problem-solving into mainstream classrooms. It has also spearheaded the development of a national network of math teachers' circles dedicated to similar principles. See their website at http://mathteacherscircle.org/circle/. Supervision of five PhD students, informal co-supervision of two PhD students, and mentoring of two postdocs. Supervision of several undergraduate research projects through the UROP program at MIT. A number of these led to published papers. Most of the students involved later continued into PhD programs in mathematics or computer science.
