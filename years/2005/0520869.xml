<AbstractNarration>This award is for the acquisition of a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) that will support research, teaching, curriculum improvement, and professional development in the Department of Biological Sciences at Chicago State University. The FACS system allows the users to identify and sort subpopulations of cells based on natural or experimentally introduced parameters that include cell-surface molecules, genetic content, and general cell shape and size. The cell types to be examined by the PI and the three co-PIs range from mammalian gut mucosa and immune cells (Drs Al-Ghoul and Swier) to protozoa (Dr Maselli) and plant protoplasts (Dr Poturi). The goals of the projects proposed for this award relate to basic cellular mechanisms associated with the intestinal mucosa barrier, host-pathogen interactions, cell vesicle traffic, and environmental conservation and crop improvement. Dissemination of the knowledge and use of the FACS by these faculty and their students will assure that the acquisition of a FACS will have a major impact on the research exploration and training environment at Chicago State University, bringing it to a level that is more compatible with current standards in research and training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to its tremendous impact on the scientific research environment at Chicago State University, the acquisition of the FACS system is a significant addition to the infrastructure needed for teaching, curriculum improvement, and professional development. At the basic level, it is expected to play a central role in expanding inquiry-based learning, fostering student collaborations, and providing valuable hands-on experience with advanced technology. This is certain to advance the level and quality of instruction in courses taught or designed by the PI and co-PIs, which span the fields of cell biology, parasitology, immunology, physiology, pathology, botany, and microbiology. Furthermore, a growing number of hands-on workshops are also expected to benefit from the FACS system.  With its predominantly African-American population, Chicago State University is one of the largest minority serving institutions in the Midwest and has a growing number of programs aimed at enhancing underrepresented minority participation in basic science research and channeling B.Sc. and M.Sc. graduates into professional degree-granting institutions.  As such, the impact of acquisition of a FACS is expected to translate into significant gains in recruitment and empowerment of minority students through academic and research training that incorporates up-to-date scientific and biomedical technology. This, in turn, will contribute to increased diversity in the American landscape of skilled professionals.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
