<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Alternative Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen and Methanol Fuel Cells&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  CTS - 0518900&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:   Jingguang G. Chen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution:   University of Delaware &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis (rationale for decision):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will determine the feasibility of using tungsten carbides, as well as Pt supported on tungsten carbides, as alternative electrocatalysts for hydrogen and methanol fuel cells.  Hydrogen and methanol fuel cells are attractive future energy sources in transportation vehicles and in small-scale static power supplies.  At present the leading anode electrocatalysts consist of Pt and Pt/Ru alloys.  However, these electrocatalysts are associated with two technical hurdles that hinder the commercialization of fuel cells:  their prohibitively high cost at the current metal loading levels, and their susceptibility to catalyst poisoning by carbon monoxide (CO).  The objective of the proposed research is to identify novel alternative electrocatalysts that are potentially less expensive and more CO-tolerant.  The proposed research will include physical vapor deposition (PVD) synthesis and characterization of tungsten carbide films, investigation of reaction pathways under in situ conditions, and evaluation of electrocatalytic performance in hydrogen and methanol fuel cells.  A systematic and molecular-level understanding of the reactions of hydrogen, methanol, water and CO on carbide surfaces will be developed.  The combination of PVD synthesis, surface science studies, and in-situ electrochemical evaluation will be unique and innovative.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; The successful discovery of less expensive and more CO tolerant electrocatalysts will be of significant importance for both fundamental studies and for commercial applications.  The project will provide educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to learn basic concepts related to fuel cells, both in the classroom and in laboratories.  The proposed research will also give students an opportunity to utilize the synchrotron facilities at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, which will provide students the scientific breadth and depth that are unavailable at individual academic laboratories.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
