<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: UNDERSTANDING CLIMATE CHANGE DURING THE FINAL STAGES OF LATE&lt;br/&gt;PALEOZOIC GONDWANAN GLACIATION - AN INTEGRATED DATA-MODEL STUDY&lt;br/&gt;Isabel Montanez, University of California, Davis&lt;br/&gt;Vladimir Davydov &amp; Mark Schmitz, Boise State University&lt;br/&gt;Chris Poulsen, University of Michigan&lt;br/&gt;Neil Tabor, Southern Methodist University&lt;br/&gt;Recently developed paleoclimate archives reveal a much more dynamic transition from the late&lt;br/&gt;Paleozoic Gondwanan ice age to a greenhouse world than previously considered - one characterized by&lt;br/&gt;considerable co-variability in climate and pCO2. Recently documented short-lived (1 to 4 m.y.) episodes&lt;br/&gt;of glaciation appear to coincide with large magnitude shifts in atmospheric pCO2, marine and continental&lt;br/&gt;temperatures and relative sea-level suggesting a CO2-climate-glaciation link. This link, however, remains&lt;br/&gt;untested. We propose an interdisciplinary study focused on significantly improving our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the evolution of the late Paleozoic climate system, and the mechanisms that triggered climate change&lt;br/&gt;during the Earth's last period of transition from icehouse to greenhouse states. The research is designed to&lt;br/&gt;test two hypotheses: (1) that atmospheric CO2 variability was the primary driver for repeated growth and&lt;br/&gt;retreat of continental ice sheets, and, in turn, (2) that late Paleozoic ice sheets strongly influenced global&lt;br/&gt;climate, particularly in the tropics. Specific basins in central and eastern Europe and western Argentina&lt;br/&gt;have been targeted given their stratigraphic and paleogeographic coverage, presence of marine, paralic&lt;br/&gt;and paleosol-bearing terrestrial deposits, and their existing biostratigraphy and potential for further&lt;br/&gt;radiometric dating (i.e., multiple intercalated volcanic tuffs) and biostratigraphic analysis. This research&lt;br/&gt;has three major objectives:&lt;br/&gt;* To establish a radiometrically calibrated, chronostratigraphic framework (Gzhelian to early Middle&lt;br/&gt;Permian) through the integration of new and existing bio-, cyclo-, and chemo-stratigraphic (87Sr/86Sr)&lt;br/&gt;data with U/Pb dating of volcanic tuffs, and the application of these integrated data to multiple&lt;br/&gt;quantitative tools (CONOP, RASC, CASP, GraphCor).&lt;br/&gt;* To further develop and calibrate high-resolution, quantitative proxy records of paleo-atmospheric&lt;br/&gt;pCO2, paleo-precipitation, and marine and terrestrial paleo-temperatures. This includes critical&lt;br/&gt;evaluation and further development of new quantitative proxies as well as direct comparison of proxy&lt;br/&gt;records to sedimentologic evidence for glaciations and 'warmings' in southern Gondwanan&lt;br/&gt;successions.&lt;br/&gt;* Development of a theoretical climate framework for the late Paleozoic glacial-interglacial oscillations&lt;br/&gt;using three-dimensional climate models to quantify the sensitivity of ice sheets on Gondwana to&lt;br/&gt;pCO2, determine the role of ice sheets in driving global climate change, and make climate predictions&lt;br/&gt;that can be tested through comparison with the proxy records.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed research will offer four major contributions to the broader scientific&lt;br/&gt;community: (1) a reconstruction of the late Paleozoic climate system at an unprecedented level of&lt;br/&gt;resolution and accuracy, (2) an important test of the pCO2-climate paradigm for climate evolution through&lt;br/&gt;Earth history, (3) documentation of marine-terrestrial climate linkages at unprecedented temporal&lt;br/&gt;resolution for the Paleozoic, and (4) the first test of proposed correlations of cyclothemic successions in&lt;br/&gt;eastern Euramerican and North American basins, and of linkages to the Gondwanan glaciosedimentary&lt;br/&gt;record. In addition, to the planned cross-disciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students, the&lt;br/&gt;PIs will integrate their research efforts into three educational outreach programs designed to enhance the&lt;br/&gt;research and teaching opportunities of underrepresented undergraduate students and high school science&lt;br/&gt;teachers. We will make our data and model simulations available to the greater scientific community by&lt;br/&gt;importing them into the CHRONOS System (and its partner website, PaleoStrat), a web-based interactive&lt;br/&gt;resource with which PI Davydov is directly involved.</AbstractNarration>
