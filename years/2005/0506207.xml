<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0506270&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Robert M. Hardt and Michael Wolf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Singular objects and regularity theory for potentially singular&lt;br/&gt;objects have played and continue to play an essential role in all&lt;br/&gt;areas of geometry, topology and analysis. The works of F. Reese&lt;br/&gt;Harvey and John C. Polking, both jointly and separately,involving&lt;br/&gt;the analysis and structure of singularities, have ranged widely&lt;br/&gt;over all three areas. This conference, in recognition of their&lt;br/&gt;scholarly and academic service, will treat important issues&lt;br/&gt;involving singularities raised in their works over the last 30&lt;br/&gt;years. It will focus on recent developments in singular spaces as&lt;br/&gt;an outgrowth of calibrated geometries, special Lagrangian&lt;br/&gt;submanifolds, removable singularity problems, and the relatively&lt;br/&gt;new area of singular connections. The conference will begin with&lt;br/&gt;an introductory session aimed at graduate students, recent&lt;br/&gt;Ph.D.'s, and non-specialist researchers.  The body of the&lt;br/&gt;conference will involve topics from the wide expertise of the&lt;br/&gt;invited lecturers which encompass: singularities in calibrated&lt;br/&gt;geometries, exceptional holonomy, CR geometry, differential&lt;br/&gt;characters, geometry of singular spaces, singularities of complex&lt;br/&gt;submanifolds and varieties, extension problems for analytic&lt;br/&gt;objects, geometric aspects of singular connections, special&lt;br/&gt;Lagrangian theory, compactification of spaces of connections, and&lt;br/&gt;regularity theory of harmonic maps, special Lagrangian&lt;br/&gt;minimizers, and Yang-Mills connections. Finally one session of&lt;br/&gt;the conference will be devoted to the study of a specific&lt;br/&gt;implementation of technology in the classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through mathematical models of a wide variety of phenomena from&lt;br/&gt;macro-economic systems, to cosmological models of the universe,&lt;br/&gt;to microscopic mechanics of solids, the notion of a&lt;br/&gt;"singularity" has gained prominence in the last thirty&lt;br/&gt;years. It is identified with the sudden disruption in space or&lt;br/&gt;time of a smooth media. It may occur at a point, as with two&lt;br/&gt;colliding particles, along a curve, as with lightning, or a&lt;br/&gt;surface, as with an earthquake fault, or on some higher&lt;br/&gt;dimensional "surface," as occurs in multi-parameter&lt;br/&gt;economic models. The basic fields in pure mathematics of&lt;br/&gt;analysis, geometry, and topology, have all attacked problems of&lt;br/&gt;understanding singularity formation and structure. This timely&lt;br/&gt;conference, on the occasion of the retirement of two academic&lt;br/&gt;leaders, brings together outstanding researchers and students&lt;br/&gt;from all these fields for a synergistic exchange of ideas. Many&lt;br/&gt;of the specific topics of the lectures of the conference have&lt;br/&gt;both their origins in and applications to mathematical physics,&lt;br/&gt;from the Lagrangian description of classical mechanical systems&lt;br/&gt;(1800's) to problems in string theory (1990's). The mathematical&lt;br/&gt;analysis of singularities provides important information for not&lt;br/&gt;only these well-established applications but also for new&lt;br/&gt;singularities arising from biological and computational problems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
