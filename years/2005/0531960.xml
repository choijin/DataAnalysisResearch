<AbstractNarration>The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE), with its14 member Universities, is recruiting undergraduates, including community college transfer students, and STEM professionals into mathematics and science teaching careers in high schools and middle schools by offering financial assistance through a Robert Noyce Scholarship or Stipend.  The project includes a comprehensive recruitment program and on-going student mentoring during the entire scholarship years and early teaching years. The partners in this proposal include the existing CETP-PA Project Office established under the NSF Collaboratives for Excellence in Teacher Preparation (CETP) program, the Math and Science Centers, numerous school districts, community colleges, the Pennsylvania State System Foundation as scholarship administrator, and the statewide CareerLink (a career counseling and placement) program. The project rests on an existing infrastructure, utilizing Scholarship Shepherds, the resources of the Math and Science Centers, existing advising resources, and strong school-university partnerships in the 236 school partners involved in CETP-PA.  School initiatives, including Professional Development Schools initiative and the Philadelphia Urban Seminar, provide an infrastructure for successfully introducing pre-service teachers to a career in high-need schools.  The project is addressing the unique needs of novice teachers in high-need school districts by providing relevant, quality field experiences for pre-service teachers and by providing a menu of support services for novice in-service teachers, enabling 35 scholarship or stipend recipients to become successful mathematics and science teachers.  Evaluation efforts address the effectiveness of the Noyce program in attracting and retaining teachers and the quality of the preparation of and teaching by the Noyce recipients.</AbstractNarration>
