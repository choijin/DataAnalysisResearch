<AbstractNarration>In this research, a vibration-based structural health monitoring methodology for complex structures vulnerable to localized damage at inaccessible structural joints/girders is developed. The investigation addresses both the forward and inverse approaches for structural health monitoring. Issues and steps to (i) avoid catastrophic structural failures and (ii) be not expensive, time consuming, and often ineffective as for conventional methods are taken into consideration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The research plan reflects the PI's long-term goal of developing innovative solution methods to solve practical engineering problems and educate a broad spectrum of students. This research allows the direct participation of both graduate and undergraduate students. The PI will reach K-12 students by guest speaking in local schools' science and technology curriculum activities. Web-based demonstrations and a short course will also be developed to offer to graduate students, undergraduate students and engineers from local industry through the Professional Educational Center of the University of Michigan-Dearborn.&lt;br/&gt;This is a SGER project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
