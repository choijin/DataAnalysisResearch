<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Fuel cells potentially provide a more efficient and pollution-free method for converting chemical energy to electricity.  The performance of fuel cell electrodes depends strongly on the details of the electrodes' micro- or nano-structure.  However, traditional methods for measuring material morphology (e.g. electron microscopy) are limited to two dimensions.  The aim of the proposed project is to develop a powerful new method - focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy - for fully characterizing electrode microstructure in three dimensions.  The new information available by this method will allow workers to connect performance and structure directly, enabling further advances in the technology. These new methods will be included in new university course materials and in educational modules designed to reach a broad spectrum of age groups.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: A main aim of this research is to fully understand the relationships between electrode processing, structure, properties, and performance.  This will ultimately allow design of higher performance and more stable electrode microstructures, as well as providing processing information needed to achieve these structures.  The methods developed are also of general interest to the engineering community.   New course material based on this work will be integrated into the PI's existing courses on fuel cells at the University of Washington (UW).  The 3D images will also facilitate demonstration of scientific principles to youths in unprecedented detail, and will become part of UW's yearly outreach to local area schools. This research is a collaborative effort with Northwestern University and the University of Michigan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
