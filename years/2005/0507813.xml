<AbstractNarration>AST-0507813&lt;br/&gt;Arons&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses fundamental questions about the origin of non-thermal energy in the Universe.  Rotation powered pulsars are among the most fascinating and bizarre compact objects around, involving rotating neutron stars with surface magnetic fields a trillion times stronger than that of the Earth.  In the standard model, the rotation of the magnetic field generates huge voltages that cause a relativistically accelerated particle beam to be extracted from the stellar surface and flow along the polar magnetic field, emitting gamma rays that convert to electrons and positrons.  The recently discovered double pulsar binary system offers the opportunity to probe this relativistic outflow unprecedentedly close to the source, using the eclipses and emission formed by the shock-heated plasma created when the relativistic wind from the fast pulsar collides with the magnetosphere of the slow pulsar.  This same physics applies to the visible hot spots at the end of the jets from radio galaxies, and to the shock waves and afterglows in gamma ray burst sources.  This project will study this physics using 3D relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of the flows, 3D particle-in-cell simulations of the relativistic shocks, and analytical modeling to understand and extrapolate the results of the simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will apply to other areas of astrophysics and will open new directions in plasma physics, as well as integrating research and education in the continuing training of students and junior researchers.  Previous group members have gone on to academic and permanent research positions, to advanced accelerator research, to careers in bioinformatics, and to the financial industry.</AbstractNarration>
