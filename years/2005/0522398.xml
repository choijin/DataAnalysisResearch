<AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;The problem of how to make sense of the non-classical probabilistic behavior of&lt;br/&gt;quantum systems was the subject of an unresolved dispute between Einstein and Bohr.&lt;br/&gt;The opposition between their opposing philosophical views has provided the tension for&lt;br/&gt;an ongoing debate among physicists and philosophers of physics about the conceptual&lt;br/&gt;significance of the transition from classical to quantum mechanics, centering on a measurement&lt;br/&gt;problem in the foundations of the theory. The 1990s saw the development of&lt;br/&gt;a quantum theory of information, prompted by the realization that certain nonclassical&lt;br/&gt;features of quantum systems could be exploited to perform information-processing tasks&lt;br/&gt;that would be impossible in a Newtonian world. This has led to an explosion of interest&lt;br/&gt;in theoretical and practical applications of quantum computation and quantum cryptography,&lt;br/&gt;and a reconsideration of the foundational problems underlying the Bohr-Einstein&lt;br/&gt;debate.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The PI has published a number of recent papers on these issues,&lt;br/&gt;in particular a paper (jointly authored with Rob Clifton and Hans Halvorson) showing&lt;br/&gt;that one can derive the basic features of a quantum-theoretic description of physical systems&lt;br/&gt;from three information-theoretic constraints. The research project involves working&lt;br/&gt;out the details of an information-theoretic interpretation of quantum mechanics in&lt;br/&gt;the light of the Clifton-Bub-Halvorson result. A core feature is to split the measurement&lt;br/&gt;problem into a problem about truth and a problem about probability, and to set aside the&lt;br/&gt;truth problem. The PIs solution to the probability problem involves showing (i) that one&lt;br/&gt;can derive from quantum mechanics the conditions for the existence of measuring instruments&lt;br/&gt;as sources of classical information, and the existence of information-gatherers&lt;br/&gt;with the ability to use measuring instruments to apply and test quantum mechanics, and&lt;br/&gt;(ii) that the generalized transition probabilities of the theory can be given a subjective&lt;br/&gt;Bayesian interpretation without solving the truth problem of measurement. The PI argues&lt;br/&gt;that the possible solutions to the truth problem are well understood, and proposes&lt;br/&gt;to show that any such solution produces a modification of quantum mechanics that is&lt;br/&gt;explanatorily and methodologically inferior to the standard theory, particularly with respect&lt;br/&gt;to accounting for the new results in quantum computation and quantum cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The PI proposes to write a book developing these ideas accessible&lt;br/&gt;to scientists who work on issues in quantum information and computation, to&lt;br/&gt;philosophers of science who work on questions of interpretation, and to a wider group&lt;br/&gt;of readers interested in developments in the foundations of physics. The PI has been&lt;br/&gt;invited to present papers on topics related to the above information-theoretic interpretation&lt;br/&gt;of quantum mechanics at various conferences, and to contribute articles to several&lt;br/&gt;Handbooks and Encyclopedias. A number of recent papers and PhD dissertations discuss&lt;br/&gt;the Clifton-Bub-Halvorson result and its implications, and three of the PIs PhD&lt;br/&gt;students will shortly be working on dissertations on various aspects of quantum information.&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will be incorporated in an undergraduate course on&lt;br/&gt;philosophy of physics (Phil 354) directed at physics students.  The PI will also disseminate &lt;br/&gt;information on the project through an annual "new directions in the foundations of physics &lt;br/&gt;conference,"  and through online archives.  &lt;br/&gt;1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
