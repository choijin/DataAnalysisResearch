<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests support for the continuation of a research program in the phenomenological aspects of particle theory. The theme of the research is to look for flavor violation and use it as a tool to discover physics beyond the standard model (BSM). The PI is particularly interested in string theory models and their implications for flavor violating processes. The PI is well-known for important work on the process tau lepton -&gt; muon + eta meson as a sensitive test for such models. He is also interested in the possibility of extra dimensions, additional gauge bosons, and abreakdown of Lorentz and CPT invariance.</AbstractNarration>
