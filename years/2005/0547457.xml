<AbstractNarration>Passaglia  0547457&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this project is to quantify the computational algorithms employed by the nervous system to convert visual images into a visual behavior.   This project on the vision of the horseshoe crab Limulus will provide more knowledge on human vision, nighttime vision and how the brain processes visual inputs. The research will have impact in neural coding, neuromodulation, and computational neuroscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component will improve neural engineering education. The educational activities will focus on introducing and disseminating neural engineering material into biomedical engineering education through the development of a teaching simulator, an undergraduate laboratory, and a graduate course.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
