<AbstractNarration>Project summary&lt;br/&gt;The rate of job-to-job transitions, moves of workers between employers without an intervening unemployment&lt;br/&gt;spell, are twice as large as the rate at which workers move from employment to unemployment. Moreover,&lt;br/&gt;the relative importance of these job-to-job transitions has increased dramatically in recent decades.&lt;br/&gt;This means that job-to-job transitions are now at least as important a means of reallocating labor towards&lt;br/&gt;its more productive uses as are the transitions of workers through unemployment. Despite their quantitative&lt;br/&gt;significance, job-to-job transitions are rarely given an important role, or even included, in equilibrium&lt;br/&gt;search models, which have been for the past two decades the primary and most successful tool used to&lt;br/&gt;analyze worker reallocation and the phenomenon of unemployment. Moreover, the search models that do&lt;br/&gt;incorporate job-to-job transitions adopt the so-called basic job-ladder model of these transitions. My recent&lt;br/&gt;work has demonstrated some serious and previously unrecognized quantitative shortcomings of the basic&lt;br/&gt;job-ladder model with respect to recently documented stylized facts. In fact, the proposal shows that there&lt;br/&gt;exists no theoretical model of job-to-job transitions that can quantitatively match their salient features.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this study will be to remedy this significant gap in the literature by developing&lt;br/&gt;a new theoretical model of job-to-job transitions that is able to match observed salient features of these&lt;br/&gt;transitions, both in terms of their magnitude and of their variation across groups of workers and across&lt;br/&gt;stages of the business cycle.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the study will involve the efficiency properties of the proposed model and the resulting&lt;br/&gt;development of policy implications of theories of frictional labor markets that incorporate an empirically&lt;br/&gt;grounded model of job-to-job transitions. Any successful labor-market policy should aim to achieve the reallocation&lt;br/&gt;of labor to its most productive uses with the least social cost. Equilibrium search models portray&lt;br/&gt;unemployment as a social cost that is necessary to achieve this reallocation. In fact, they predict that, under&lt;br/&gt;certain conditions, the unemployment observed in decentralized markets is equal to its socially optimal level.&lt;br/&gt;The introduction of job-to-job transitions, in which the reallocation of labor towards its more productive uses&lt;br/&gt;takes place without workers having to bear the burden of unemployment, can be expected to challenge these&lt;br/&gt;conclusions. It will provide novel insights about the optimality of the observed level of unemployment and&lt;br/&gt;of patterns of worker turnover in general. These new insights can then guide policy-makers to adopt new&lt;br/&gt;approaches to the long-standing policy concern of unemployment.</AbstractNarration>
