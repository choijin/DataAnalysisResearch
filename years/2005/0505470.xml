<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;In 1997 the PI and Kazantsev obtained the first explicit inversion formula &lt;br/&gt;for the emission tomography problem using the intimate connection between &lt;br/&gt;this problem and elliptic systems with operator coefficients.In this &lt;br/&gt;project the PI plans to generalize this method to the following cases: (1) &lt;br/&gt;cases with partial or incomplete data; (2) cases where the unknown function &lt;br/&gt;is replaced by a tensor field; (3) cases where a general scattering term is &lt;br/&gt;also present in a transport equation; (4) cases where straight line rays are &lt;br/&gt;replaced by geodesic lines which may be known or unknown; (5) cases where the &lt;br/&gt;attenuation coefficient is also unknown; (6) cases with reflection on the &lt;br/&gt;boundary. We also plan to consider inverse problems with multiple boundary &lt;br/&gt;measurements for elliptic and hyperbolic operators with partial Cauchy data &lt;br/&gt;and develop for them the method of Carleman estimates together with the &lt;br/&gt;geometric optics construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1895 Rontgen discovered the so-called X-rays and made the first &lt;br/&gt;radiograph (of his wife's hand).In 1917 Radon considered the problem of &lt;br/&gt;reconstructing a function on the plane from the integrals of this function &lt;br/&gt;over all possible straight lines and obtained an explicit inversion &lt;br/&gt;formula. In the mid seventies these two discoveries joined in the X-ray &lt;br/&gt;tomograph. In 1979 an English engineer, Hounsfield, and an American &lt;br/&gt;mathematician, Cormack, received the Nobel prize in medicine for its &lt;br/&gt;development. Using X-ray tomography, one can find the attenuation of a body. If &lt;br/&gt;we replace now the X-rays by more "soft" rays we obtain a much more difficult &lt;br/&gt;tomography problems. For example, in a seismic tomography one generates elastic &lt;br/&gt;waves in the earth using acoustical sources at the earth's surface.The waves &lt;br/&gt;that return to the surface of the earth are observed. The problem is to &lt;br/&gt;reconstruct the elastic properties of the earth from this data. In this case &lt;br/&gt;rays will be unknown curves that depends on the elastic properties. In the &lt;br/&gt;emission tomography problem it is required to find unknown radioactive source &lt;br/&gt;distribution in a body with a known attenuation. It was only in 1997 that the &lt;br/&gt;PI and Kazantsev obtained the first inversion formula for this problem with &lt;br/&gt;arbitrary smooth attenuation. In this project, the PI plans to generalize this &lt;br/&gt;result to the following cases: (1) cases with incomplete data and curved rays &lt;br/&gt;(this is important for oil exploration for instance); (2) cases where the &lt;br/&gt;attenuation coefficient is also unknown (this is important for medical &lt;br/&gt;imaging, since we reduce the need to use the X-ray tomography for &lt;br/&gt;determination of the attenuation); (3) cases where the unknown scalar function &lt;br/&gt;is replaced by a vector or a tensor field (non-destructive evaluation of &lt;br/&gt;vector and tensor fields in aerodynamics and material sciences &lt;br/&gt;respectively). The project will integrate research and education since the PI plans to use &lt;br/&gt;new facts from the project in advanced "Math and Engineering courses ".&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
