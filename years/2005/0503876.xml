<AbstractNarration>The main objective of this research proposal is to improve understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;thermodynamic, kinetic and structural properties of non-oriented bulk crystallized&lt;br/&gt;flexible chain polymers. Building on a foundation that established the important&lt;br/&gt;independent structural variables that describe the crystalline state, and final properties, a&lt;br/&gt;research program is described to advance the understanding of the interplay between&lt;br/&gt;chain microstructure, phase structure, crystallization kinetics and morphology of the&lt;br/&gt;dominant class of crystalline polymers, the polyolefins. Emphasis is given to novel&lt;br/&gt;studies of model branched polyethylenes that serve as control microstructures to establish&lt;br/&gt;the connection between molecular architecture and the semicrystalline morphology that&lt;br/&gt;they assemble. Two sets of model branched polyethyelenes will be studied. One set of&lt;br/&gt;precisely spaced branched polyethylenes serve as a bridge between the crystallization of&lt;br/&gt;short-chain molecules and the more complex behavior of industrial-like linear low&lt;br/&gt;density polyethylenes. The second set of model long chain-branched (LCB) random&lt;br/&gt;ethylene copolymers will provide fundamentals for the effect of length and architecture&lt;br/&gt;of LCB on the crystallization behavior of these polyethylenes from isotropic melts,&lt;br/&gt;before additional effects intrinsic to flow, come into play. Details of the early stages of&lt;br/&gt;the crystallization of these systems serve as a basis to describe the properties of H-link&lt;br/&gt;and other types of LCB poly(propylenes) also subjects of study in this proposal.&lt;br/&gt;The work on model systems will provide an opportunity for faculty and students&lt;br/&gt;of the University of Florida and the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering to interact&lt;br/&gt;closely toward integrating catalysis, macromolecular architecture and their path to the&lt;br/&gt;ordered state beyond each group's laboratory boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal also includes detailed work to substantiate a model of defect&lt;br/&gt;microstructure for Z-N based isotactic poypropylenes, derived from previous studies, as&lt;br/&gt;well as a continuation of the crystallization behavior of metallocene random propylene&lt;br/&gt;copolymers. In this venue emphasis is given to integrate the dynamics of the&lt;br/&gt;polymorphic behavior in the analysis of the overall crystallization and the linear growth&lt;br/&gt;rates of these copolymers.                                                                                                                                     &lt;br/&gt;The FAMU-FSU College of Engineering is a jointly managed program of the&lt;br/&gt;Florida State University, a Research I institution with an enrollment of 38,000 and&lt;br/&gt;Florida A&amp;M University, a historically Black University with an enrollment of 12,000.&lt;br/&gt;Faculty hold joint appointments at both institutions, and students from both universities&lt;br/&gt;enroll in the same engineering classes. The present enrollment at the College of&lt;br/&gt;Engineering consists of approximately 50% minority students and over 25% women,&lt;br/&gt;making it unique in a number of respects. The proposed work includes active&lt;br/&gt;participation of graduate and undergraduate students and training in current techniques of&lt;br/&gt;characterization of polymers. These activities parallel the commitment of the PI to&lt;br/&gt;education of students in the area of Polymer Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
