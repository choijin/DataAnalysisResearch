    <AbstractNarration>OISE-0544773 &lt;br/&gt;Singhose &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports Mr. Jason Lawrence, dissertation student of Dr. William E. Singhose of Georgia Institute of Technology Department of Mechanical Engineering, for two months of dissertation enhancement research in Japan on oscillation suppression through command shaping in remotely operated cranes. Dr. Shigeo Hirose will host Mr. Lawrence at his world-renown robotics lab at the Tokyo Institute of Technology Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Lawrence s dissertation research aims to enhance command shaping for cranes by deriving new command shapers to compensate for nonlinear crane dynamics; studying tele-operation of cranes over long distances; and improving command shaping teaching methods and increase awareness of the technology among engineering students. &lt;br/&gt;Mr. Lawrence will work with Dr. Hirose, an expert in the field of robotic control, to implement control algorithms using a miniature robotic crane located in the Hirose lab. Lawrence will then conduct tests that include internet-based manipulation experiences with students at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. In this process both Tokyo Tech and Georgia Tech students will have key roles in evaluating the command shaping curriculum and tele-operations objectives.</AbstractNarration>
