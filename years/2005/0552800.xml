<AbstractNarration>The REU Site at Southern Illinois University Carbondale supports 10 undergraduates for a 10-week period each summer (2006-2008); students are involved in interdisciplinary projects in the broadly defined area of materials research.  The Principal Investigator is Dr. Daniel Dyer, he is assisted by Dr. Boyd Goodson, the Co-Principal Investigator.  The project is co-funded by Division of Materials Research and the Division of Chemistry at NSF.  The faculty mentors involved in this project have backgrounds in Chemistry, Physics and Engineering; inclusion of mentors from various disciplines encourages the REU students to think about their respective projects in broad terms and provide them with the opportunity to present their results to a diverse audience.  Students are also required to think about the application of their research to new technologies and to consider issues relating to the manufacturing of new devices.  Students are recruited nationally, with a focus on the neighboring states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Tennessee; particular recruitment emphasis is placed on students from groups underrepresented in science and engineering, as well as those from socio-economically disadvantaged regions.  Goals for this REU site include: 1) creating a positive image of science and engineering as a career choice; 2) providing a nurturing environment to foster a sense of confidence in the art of discussing and practicing science; 3) improving the participants oral and written communication skills; 4) teaching basic research tools, including literature searches and the operation of modern instrumentation; 5) fostering a collaborative teamwork approach to research; and 6) increasing the number of domestic students, especially those from underrepresented groups, who choose to further their careers in science and engineering.  Participants have the opportunity to network with other scientists, engineers, and students through various social activities, including weekly lunches with faculty mentors, evening concerts in the local community, and weekend trips to cultural locations in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
