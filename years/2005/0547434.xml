<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.:   CTS-0547434&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS:  PAVLOS VLACHOS&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION:   VIRGINIA TECH&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Arterial Flow Dynamics-Effects of Pulsatility, Compliance and Curvature&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on the experimental in-vitro modeling and analysis of transitional flows in the cardiovascular system by developing, improving and implementing state-of-the-art experimental methods that will be combined to overcome the limitations of conventional approaches. This pioneering effort will significantly advance understanding of cardiovascular flows and in particular flow transition. Implementing a unique combination of experimental tools and integrating the effects of three important cardiovascular parameters, pulsatility, vessel compliance, and curvature, allows the modeling and analysis of their individual effects as well as their complex interactions. Cardiovascular disease has historically been the leading cause of death in the US and accounts for approximately one third of all deaths worldwide. Cardiovascular flows are governed by complex fluid-structure interactions within short, curved, branching, elastic tubes that undergo lateral dynamic motions while interacting with propagating and reflecting pressure waves. Analysis of the fluid dynamics in the cardiovascular system is a topic of paramount importance, because of the relationship among the hemodynamics, the endothelial cell response and the vascular pathology. Moreover, transitional and turbulent flows are intrinsically related to endothelial cell injury and the origin of vascular disease. However, despite many years of research, cardiovascular flows are poorly understood. The goal of the integrated educational component of this grant is to develop a new model for engineering education using research-based learning. This effort will reinvent and reenergize the classroom experience, demonstrate the multidisciplinary character of modern engineering and stimulate the students intellectual growth. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance recruitment and retention for engineers, including members of underrepresented groups, and to motivate the students to commit to a life-long process of learning, advancing engineering and benefiting society.  This goal will be accomplished by translating fluid mechanics and biofluids research to engineering education from middle school to undergraduate and graduate level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Background: Cardiovascular disease has been the leading cause of death in the US and accounts for approximately one third of all deaths worldwide.  Two of the leading causes of heart failure are due to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) and coronary artery disease. The present work tackles the flow physics associated with both diseases in order to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to heart failure and enable improved clinical diagnostic and treatment modalities. This is achieved through the synergistic integration of engineering and clinical measurement techniques along with physical modeling and analytical tools.  Analysis of Color M-Mode Echocardiography and phase contrast Magnetic Resonance Velocimetry provide the capability for in-vivo noninvasive analysis of the fluid mechanics of diastolic dysfunction. The present work uses these tools in a complementary fashion along with scaling analysis, theoretical modeling, and statistical analysis and classification techniques to determine the physical parameters governing LVDD.  Coronary stents are used to open occluded arteries. The particular stent design affects the dynamics of blood flow and modulates the arterial wall shear stress which has been shown to correlate with disease progression.  Recent controversial results with respect to the efficacy of drug coated stents punctuate the importance of stent design. This effort investigates the flow dynamics of stent designs.  For the first time high-resolution, high-fidelity experimental spatiotemporally-resolved velocity measurements in compliant, three-dimensional stented arteries are presented and analysed with respect to their physiological significance.  Results: Through the research efforts undertaken within this project it was discovered that:  The initial left      ventricular diastole is universally (for healthy and diseased subjects)      characterized by an abrupt deceleration of the early filling wave velocity.      The time during the cardiac cycle and the distance within the ventricle      that this deceleration occurs strongly correlate with different types and      stages of cardiac disease. The formation of a strong      initial vortex during the early left ventricle filling appears to mediate      a smooth intra-ventricular pressure gradient that allows for better      filling dynamics and conversely is compromised under diastolic dysfunction      conditions.  Wall shear stresses      induced by the presence of different types of stents in arteries are      strongly depended on the stent design and appear to correlate with the      proper re-endothelialization of the artery wall.  An inverse relationship      between time average wall shear stress (WSS) and oscillatory shear index      (OSI) exists in stented arterial flows. Namely, regions of high WSS are      subject to low unsteadiness (OSI) and vise versa. This can be explained      due to the disturbances introduced by the stent struts.  The transition and      relaminarization of the flow downstream an occlusion shows little      dependence of the type of pulsatile flow, in other words, coronary versus      peripheral flow.
