<AbstractNarration>The goal of this Leadership Award is to increase the representation of minority women faculty in science and engineering. It employs an innovative approach to study, understand and address the unique challenges facing women of color in the academy by drawing on the interdisciplinary knowledge base of both the social sciences and the hard sciences and engineering, by bringing women faculty together across disciplines for self empowerment, support and constructive problem solving.  A series of national workshop-based conferences provide a framework for professional development, the development of effective strategies and sharing of best practices and for sustenance of a community of practice that participates in networking, mentoring, data collection and dissemination. Under the direction of the PI, the wealth of data and individual narratives collected within the community of practice are developed in a format suitable for publication and broad dissemination.  The cross-disciplinary initiative supported by this ADVANCE Leadership Award contributes to the success and advancement of minority women faculty in science and engineering, thereby enhancing their retention and increasing their ranks.  The increased presence of these women enhances faculty diversity and provides the role models and self images that contribute to the enhanced recruitment, retention, and ultimate success of minority and women students, all of which is necessary to build a diverse science and engineering workforce required to maintain national prosperity</AbstractNarration>
