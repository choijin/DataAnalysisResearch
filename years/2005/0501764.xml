<AbstractNarration>The project is increasing the expertise of qualified renewable energy technicians in existing 2-year college and high school programs through a collaborative infrastructure for delivering an online series of renewable energy courses developed and taught by top experts in the field.  This series, which can be easily integrated into existing 2-year college programs, includes introductory renewable energy, energy management, alternative transportation, photovoltaic, solar home design, wind power, and biomass courses.  Until the North American Board of Energy Practitioners and other industry-sanctioned accrediting agencies can certify these courses, the College is issuing certificates for them.  The project includes industry and renewable energy association experts to develop a review process and a stamp of approval that will be noted on the certificate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To complement the online courses, the project is developing a series of web-based learning objects that give learners virtual access to renewable energy technologies and inquiry-based pedagogy.  The project plans to conduct one large summer institute to introduce and promote the online courses and the learning objects to other faculty.  Finally, it is developing an alternative to the online courses through a similar series of face-to-face renewable energy workshops offered at the College that will serve as a model that other schools and technical college systems can adopt. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;This project addresses a major challenge in undergraduate education, namely, how do two-year college programs change to reflect new and emerging technologies, in this case, renewable energy technologies?  The project uses a simple, but practical model that makes a prestigious group of experts from around the country and virtual laboratory experiences available to everyone. It provides the infrastructure and the vision to bring emerging and disparate renewable energy technologies together into a cohesive structure that two-year colleges can readily embrace.  The model also includes a provision to bring seasoned renewable energy teachers into the 2-year college classroom immediately.  Finally, it includes cutting-edge pedagogy through learner-centered, interactive learning objects. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact &lt;br/&gt;This project empowers faculty and institutions to take advantage of the rapidly developing interdisciplinary technologies that can revitalize educational programs and create new ones.  As such, it is a powerful model of the two-year college as an agent of change to meet emerging economic and workforce development needs.  A key feature of this model is the evolution of existing 2-year college programs to provide new pathways for renewable energy technicians. The courses and the learning objects provide access to experts in the field using innovative, learner-centered strategies.  These strategies provide a flexible way to stay abreast of new developments as they are easily scaled up or down for new technologies. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
