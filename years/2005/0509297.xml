<AbstractNarration>CNS-0509297 CSR/PDOS: Security and Incentives for Overlay Network&lt;br/&gt;Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: Proposed Research&lt;br/&gt;Overlay network systems have largely been engineered to operate in a world where every&lt;br/&gt;node cooperatively executes the protocol as specified. Nodes either operate correctly, or&lt;br/&gt;cease to work altogether (i.e., fail-stop). This model is quite successful when nodes&lt;br/&gt;can trust one another, but this limits overlay systems from operating in the more general&lt;br/&gt;case when they might be operating on untrusted, end-user computers. Such users will be&lt;br/&gt;economically rational, meaning they will seek to get as much benefit from the network as&lt;br/&gt;possible while contributing as little of their own resources. Our research will examine&lt;br/&gt;extensions to these systems where nodes perform accounting, allowing them to track&lt;br/&gt;which nodes are and are not performing correctly, making it possible to offer preferential&lt;br/&gt;service to nodes that offer preferential service in return. These and other related&lt;br/&gt;techniques will ultimately result in incentives-compatible designs that enable a new&lt;br/&gt;generation of peer-to-peer applications, including distributed backup systems, distributed&lt;br/&gt;file systems, and distributed email systems. Our work will be disseminated as part of the&lt;br/&gt;FreePastry project, which provides a high-quality and scalable implementation of a&lt;br/&gt;variety of overlay network services and is available under a BSD-style license. Likewise,&lt;br/&gt;our work will become part of the next-generation Tor anonymous communication system.</AbstractNarration>
