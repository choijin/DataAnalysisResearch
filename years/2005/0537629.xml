<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The Mw=9.3 Dec 2004 Sumatra  earthquake ruptured 1000 miles of  &lt;br/&gt;India's eastern plate boundary causing damage in the Nicobar and  &lt;br/&gt;Andaman islands, shifting them bodily 3m-7m southwestward,  and  &lt;br/&gt;tilting them down to the east.  Although shaking damage in the  &lt;br/&gt;Andaman and Nicobar islands was minor,  the tilting caused massive  &lt;br/&gt;damage to coastline ecologies.  Thousands of hectares of agricultural  &lt;br/&gt;land were flooded, and erosion of forested shorelines has commenced  &lt;br/&gt;in regions that sank. Hundreds of km of coral reefs were killed where  &lt;br/&gt;the land rose, with attendant loss of nearshore fishing grounds. Yet  &lt;br/&gt;clearly this was not the first time that this has occurred,  and it  &lt;br/&gt;is certain that it will occur again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several societal questions arise. How frequently do these  &lt;br/&gt;catastrophic tsunami earthquakes occur? Are the flooded islands  &lt;br/&gt;permanently drowned or will they slowly recover their former levels?   &lt;br/&gt;Will the saline intrusion and flooding of shoreline farmland be  &lt;br/&gt;reversed or worsened in the coming decades.  Will  harbor defenses  &lt;br/&gt;and docks require extended construction to accommodate additional  &lt;br/&gt;submergence or emergence.  In what way does the Sumatra earthquake  &lt;br/&gt;resemble a similar Mw=9 expected in the Pacific NW of the US?  What  &lt;br/&gt;can be learned from the Sumatra earthquake that has application to  &lt;br/&gt;the coasts of Oregon and Washington?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These questions can be answered  from a geophysical knowledge of the  &lt;br/&gt;subsurface process involved in the Sumatra/Andaman event.  Near Port  &lt;br/&gt;Blair, where most of the people of the Andaman/Nicobar islands live,   &lt;br/&gt;the plate boundary accomodates both northward motion of India and the  &lt;br/&gt;westward motion of the Andaman plate: every 100 years it accommodate  &lt;br/&gt;s roughly1 m of northward motion  and  4 m of convergence.  All this  &lt;br/&gt;motion occurs infrequently in earthquakes, yet it is driven by slow  &lt;br/&gt;interseismic processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists from Memphis and Colorado are investigating continued  &lt;br/&gt;movements in the Andaman islands using Global Positioning geodesy and  &lt;br/&gt;sea level  monitoring devices to find out whether  these catastrophic  &lt;br/&gt;changes are increasing or decreasing. The spatial variation of these  &lt;br/&gt;effects with time provides unique constraints on the continuing  &lt;br/&gt;processes in the islands.  Their initial results indicate that  &lt;br/&gt;although the islands continue to move SW some of the subsidence has  &lt;br/&gt;been reversed.   In this two year project they hope to provide many  &lt;br/&gt;hundreds of points to constrain future motions, and to answer how  &lt;br/&gt;frequently these earthquakes occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of their objectives is to show local scientists how to undertake  &lt;br/&gt;these kinds of measurements. Strong collaborative agreements have  &lt;br/&gt;been established with scientists affiliated with the Society for  &lt;br/&gt;Andaman and Nicobar Ecology (SANE) who have access throughout most of  &lt;br/&gt;the islands.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
