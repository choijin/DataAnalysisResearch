<AbstractNarration>CAREER: Mechanisms of Seasonal Reproduction in the Tropics&lt;br/&gt;Ignacio T. Moore&lt;br/&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A crucial challenge that animals face is timing reproduction to maximize offspring survival. Most of our understanding of how animals time reproduction comes from studies of mid- to high latitude species. For these animals, changes in day length are the primary cue they use to predict seasons and thus time seasonal processes. However, the majority of animals inhabit tropical latitudes where seasonal changes in day length are minimal. Yet many tropical species still breed seasonally and it appears that many rely on more localized cues to time reproduction. This can lead to wide disparity in reproductive timing between populations in close proximity. Previous studies have described populations of rufous-collared sparrows (Zonotrichia capensis) near the equator in Ecuador, that are separated by only 25km, yet breed at very different times of years. Interestingly, these populations have also diverged genetically. This system, where day length does not change seasonally, provides an ideal opportunity to further investigate mechanisms of seasonal reproduction. The proposed studies will investigate seasonal reproduction in terms of environmental and social cues, endogenous rhythms, breeding synchrony, population genetic differentiation, and nutrition. There are two primary components of the education portion of this project. For the first part, Ecuadorian locals and students will be incorporated into the research program, primarily as research assistants in the field. For the second part, a foreign studies class will be initiated at Virginia Tech to expose students to the culture and nature of Ecuador. Through this program, twelve students per year will travel for a month to Ecuador, interact with locals at four field sites and experience one of the most bio-diverse places on earth. Some of these students may also stay in Ecuador and work on the research project. This award is co-funded by the NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
