<AbstractNarration>0550008&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SGER: A Socio-Technical Approach to Internet Security&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nancy G. Leveson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical security measures are often breached through social means, but little research has tackled the problem of system security in the context of the entire socio-technical system, with the interactions between the social and technical parts integrated into one model.  Similar problems exist in the field of system safety, but recently a new accident model has been devised that uses a systems-theoretic approach to understand accident causation.  Systems theory allows complex relationships between events and the system as a whole to be taken into account, so this new model permits an accident to be considered not simply as arising from a chain of individual component failures, but from the interactions among system components, including those that have not failed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory research will examine how this new approach to safety can be applied to Internet security, using worms as a first example.  The long-term goal is to create a general model of trustworthiness that can incorporate both safety and security, along with system modeling tools and analysis methods that can be used to create more trustworthy socio-technical systems.  This research provides a unique opportunity to link two research disciplines, safety and security, that have many commonalities but, up to now, relatively little communication or interaction.</AbstractNarration>
