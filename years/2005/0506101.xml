<AbstractNarration>Novel transmission formats hold the potential for large increases in &lt;br/&gt;the total system capacity of optical fiber transmission systems.  At &lt;br/&gt;high bit-rates, however, nonlinear and stochastic physical effects &lt;br/&gt;contribute to limit the overall system performance.  The deterministic &lt;br/&gt;impairments are mainly due to the combination of nonlinearity and &lt;br/&gt;dispersion.  The stochastic impairments occur due to amplifier noise &lt;br/&gt;(which induces amplitude, timing and phase fluctuations) as well as &lt;br/&gt;polarization-mode dispersion.  All of these effects produce impairments &lt;br/&gt;which lead to unacceptable rates of transmission errors.  However, &lt;br/&gt;the large scale and complexity of these systems, the variety of effects &lt;br/&gt;involved, and the extremely low bit-error-ratios required of these &lt;br/&gt;systems (which requires studying the occurrence of extremely rare &lt;br/&gt;events) all contribute to make the modeling of optical fiber &lt;br/&gt;communications a challenging task.  Recent work has demonstrated that &lt;br/&gt;careful mathematical and computational modeling can be very effective &lt;br/&gt;in describing the behavior of realistic optical fiber transmission &lt;br/&gt;systems.  This research project aims at evaluating the potential of &lt;br/&gt;new transmission formats and assessing how each of them is affected &lt;br/&gt;by the various transmission impairments.  The methods that will be &lt;br/&gt;developed in this project are expected to make an impact on how &lt;br/&gt;these systems are modeled and designed.  In addition, because &lt;br/&gt;new ultra-short pulse lasers share many similarities with &lt;br/&gt;dispersion-managed optical transmission systems, the mathematical &lt;br/&gt;techniques that will be developed as part of this research project &lt;br/&gt;will help researchers understand the behavior of these lasers and &lt;br/&gt;their fundamental limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of high-capacity optical fiber communications has &lt;br/&gt;been a major technological advance that enabled the widespread use &lt;br/&gt;of the internet and the world-wide-web which revolutionized our &lt;br/&gt;day-to-day interactions.  The demand for further increase in the &lt;br/&gt;total transmission capacity remains unabated, however, fueled by &lt;br/&gt;emerging applications such as video-on-demand, video-conferencing &lt;br/&gt;and others requiring very large bandwidths.  A key feature of this &lt;br/&gt;collaborative research project is the combined use of sophisticated &lt;br/&gt;mathematical and computational methods to model the behavior of &lt;br/&gt;realistic lightwave systems, with the aim of developing the accurate &lt;br/&gt;tools which are needed to efficiently study the behavior of optical&lt;br/&gt;fiber transmission systems and to design the next generation of &lt;br/&gt;systems.  As such, the outcome of this project will contribute to &lt;br/&gt;strengthening the national infrastructure and maintaining U.S. &lt;br/&gt;competitiveness in an area which is of great national interest,&lt;br/&gt;thus benefiting not just researchers, but also the community at &lt;br/&gt;large.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
