<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed research develops new practical methodology and algorithms as&lt;br/&gt;well as theoretical results for high-dimensional data classification. The&lt;br/&gt;main issue is that when the number of measured variables exceeds by far&lt;br/&gt;the number of observations, estimating the full covariance matrix&lt;br/&gt;accurately is impossible. The investigator has previously shown that&lt;br/&gt;ignoring the dependence completely in such a situation is a better option,&lt;br/&gt;but it means discarding a lot of information.  This problem will be&lt;br/&gt;resolved by developing new sparse covariance estimators which will only&lt;br/&gt;retain important dependence information, and studying their behavior&lt;br/&gt;theoretically in the context of discriminant analysis. New practical,&lt;br/&gt;computationally efficient algorithms for computing these estimators from&lt;br/&gt;data will be developed on the basis of clustering and graph partitioning&lt;br/&gt;methods and compared to existing regularization techniques. Theoretically,&lt;br/&gt;asymptotically optimal or near optimal classification performance is&lt;br/&gt;expected to be demonstrated.  Another way to reduce the size of the&lt;br/&gt;problem and get to the underlying structure is to reduce the data&lt;br/&gt;dimension using recently developed nonlinear manifold projection methods,&lt;br/&gt;which aim to discover a nonlinear low-dimensional embedding preserving&lt;br/&gt;most of the information contained in the data. Using these methods&lt;br/&gt;requires estimating intrinsic data dimension and neighborhood scale on a&lt;br/&gt;manifold, and new rigorous estimators for both are proposed, along with an&lt;br/&gt;analysis of their statistical properties.  Careful estimation of these two&lt;br/&gt;parameters will improve on the current mostly heuristic methods used in&lt;br/&gt;machine learning and increase applicability of manifold projection methods&lt;br/&gt;for high-dimensional data classification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses the new challenges posed by the massive amounts of&lt;br/&gt;data collected in the modern world by developing new theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;practical tools for dealing with high-dimensional data, particularly with&lt;br/&gt;the situation when the number of measurements taken for one observation is&lt;br/&gt;large relative to the number of observations.  New sparse estimators of&lt;br/&gt;dependence structure in such data are developed, which only contain the&lt;br/&gt;information relevant for data classification.  The new estimators can also&lt;br/&gt;be used in any problem where large covariance matrices need to be&lt;br/&gt;estimated from limited amount of data, and hence will have an impact on a&lt;br/&gt;wide range of modern applications, such as classification and analysis of&lt;br/&gt;gene expression data, analysis of complex chemical and physical&lt;br/&gt;experiments, remote sensing, and medical imaging, among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
