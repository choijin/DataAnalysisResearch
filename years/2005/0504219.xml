<AbstractNarration>Astrobiology seeks to understand the origins and history of life in the Universe (including that on Earth), to predict where extraterrestrial life might occur, and to find and study it. The main problems are (1) where to look for life, (2) what to look for, and (3) how to know when you find it. The intellectual merit of this project consists of the effort to investigate these problems.  Investigating these questions, however, involves a host of scientific disciplines, many of which do not normally interact with one another. To achieve this, this continuing IGERT-funded graduate training program will have: (1) a strong engineering and instrumentation component, (2) specific training in teamwork and teaching, (3) innovative training in scientific writing, especially for communicating across disciplines and to the general public, (4) improved collaboration with other developing astrobiology programs, both domestic and foreign, and (5) more effective recruiting, mentoring and retention of members of underrepresented groups in science and engineering. This second phase of IGERT support will allow further progress in institutionalizing successful innovative practices in interdisciplinary education.    The broader impacts of the project are releated both to basic and applied scientific questions and goals.  The questions posed by astrobiology are of great general interest and are among the most fundamental for both scientists and the public because knowing whether life on Earth is unique affects our approach to the stewardship of our own planet and the exploration of our cosmic environment. Astrobiology  is also providing the guiding principles behind NASA's redirection of planetary exploration and hence the outcome of this substantial research investment is dependent on training scientists capable of getting the scientific fundamentals right.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>
