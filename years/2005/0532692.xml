<AbstractNarration>The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) seeks funding to support its newly formed Computer Science Teacher's Association (CSTA).  CSTA is addressing the enrollment crisis in CS: Despite the pressing need for students to learn foundational computer science skills, course enrollments are dropping at the secondary and post-secondary levels, and the number of young women and minority students studying computing is at an all-time low. CSTA is addressing this on a national scale, through collaboration with leaders from all levels of education, government, industry, and partnering non-profit organizations. CSTA has begun reframing computer science within K-12 education as a true science. It has launched national programs to conduct research, develop curriculum and certification standards, provide professional development opportunities, and create and disseminate new resources for teachers nationwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To support this organization in its nascent stages, CSTA is requesting funding for a portion of its&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure, for research, and for the implementation of its goal to establish K-12 computer science as an essential academic discipline (as opposed to a technical application) and address the key issues that have hampered efforts to systematically address the needs of all students. By building a national multi-level community of educators and stakeholders who share resources, new research, and best practices, CSTA will revitalize K-12 computer science education, and promote CS as a career choice.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
