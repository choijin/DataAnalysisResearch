<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0504534&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Xiaochun Rong&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Positive curvature and non-positive curvature have been frequent&lt;br/&gt;subjects in Riemannian geometry, where mathematics from several&lt;br/&gt;disciplines interact; such as differential geometry, analysis and&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations, transformation group theory and&lt;br/&gt;topology. The PI is pursuing a research program concerning some&lt;br/&gt;basic problems in these areas: 1. Interplay between positive&lt;br/&gt;curvature (with Abelian symmetry) and topology. This project is&lt;br/&gt;amplified by the amazing fact that among the manifolds of the&lt;br/&gt;same dimension whose sectional curvature is between two positive&lt;br/&gt;constants, all but finitely many admit (large) Abelian symmetry.&lt;br/&gt;2. The semi-rigidity of the moduli space of non-positively curved&lt;br/&gt;metrics on a closed manifold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics is the foundation of natural sciences, and&lt;br/&gt;differential geometry and Riemannian geometry is one of the most&lt;br/&gt;important branches of mathematics. The PI is pursuing solving&lt;br/&gt;some basic problems in this field which would have a broad&lt;br/&gt;intellectual impact. PI will continue to actively pursue&lt;br/&gt;collaborations with other mathematicians in US and abroad and to&lt;br/&gt;speak at several national and international meetings a year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI organized Riemannian geometry seminars in summers of&lt;br/&gt;2001-2004, which were designed to provide a forum for the&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of new ideas, in particular for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;The PI has had three papers with his graduate students and&lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral fellow which were the products of the summer&lt;br/&gt;seminars.  The PI will continue the Riemannian geometry summer&lt;br/&gt;seminars in the next three years. The PI has been writing two&lt;br/&gt;advance graduate textbooks for three years (titled: ``The&lt;br/&gt;convergence and collapsing theory in Riemannian geometry'' and&lt;br/&gt;``Positive curvature, symmetry and topology''). He wishes to&lt;br/&gt;finish the two books in 2-3 years. This will not only benefit&lt;br/&gt;graduate students and researchers from these areas (due to the&lt;br/&gt;lack of graduate textbooks in these topics) but also help to&lt;br/&gt;advertise and disseminate Riemannian Geometry to students and&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians in other related fields, by giving them a quick&lt;br/&gt;picture of some of the research directions of Riemannian&lt;br/&gt;geometry, and by showing them how the subject vitally interacts&lt;br/&gt;with differential geometry, analysis and PDE, compact&lt;br/&gt;transformation group theory and topology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
