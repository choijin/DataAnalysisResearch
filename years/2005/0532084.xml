<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0532084&lt;br/&gt;SGER: NEESR Payload Project for NSF Award #0420347 -&lt;br/&gt;Control of Plastic Hinging Behavior of RC Bridge Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this NEES Research (NEESR) payload project is to accurately model and control plastic hinging locations in concrete bridge structures through an investigation of actual hinging behavior in large-scale testing of bridge systems subjected to multiple excitations that includes the effects of joint and foundation flexibility.  Models that are created to represent the hinging behavior in reinforced concrete systems, and the resulting understanding of this behavior under different loading conditions, have traditionally been limited by the ability to validate the model with experimental data - either from pre-existing bridge structures with inadequate access to internal reinforcement, or from component tests that are unable to simulate realistic boundary conditions.  The validation of these detailed models is now possible with the data that will be collected during the NEESR project CMS-0420347 investigation of the seismic performance of four-span large-scale bridge systems, which includes the soil-foundation-structure interaction effects at the footings and abutments, at the NEES equipment site at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR). The proposed NEESR payload research will be conducted in two parts:  (1) small additions to the existing experimental procedure of the UNR NEESR team in the form of additional instrumentation, non-invasive photogrammetric methods, and additional input ground motions (at low level excitation), and (2) an analytical investigation of the effects of joint and foundation flexibility and load history on the control of plastic hinging locations in bridge systems.  The specific goals of the project are the following:  (1) accurately track the deformations in the hinging region and beam-column joints using traditional reinforcement and concrete gages as well as photogrammetric methods, (2) create a bridge system model using OpenSees that captures the joint deformations and spread of plasticity in the column elements under different levels of excitation, (3) compare deformations captured using traditional gages with those determined using photogrammetric methods, (4) perform parametric analysis of bridge systems with varied stiffness and strength properties to determine the effect on inelastic behavior, component, and system performance, (5) recommend simple techniques for calculating the drift response of bridge systems considering joint flexibility and more accurate plastic hinge behavior, and (6) engage graduate and undergraduate students through content in graduate courses and participation by telepresence during the testing phases of the project.   Intellectual Merit: This proposal addresses the estimation of element and system level inelastic deformations considering the impact of joint and foundation flexibility for reinforced concrete bridge systems subjected to various strong ground motion demands. As part of this work, an improved joint model for reinforced concrete bridge systems will be developed for the OpenSees platform. The drift response of structural systems will be estimated with a better understanding of the contributions of joint flexibility and inelastic behavior in the elements.   Broader Impacts: This project broadens the focus of a NEESR award that evaluates soil-foundation-structure interaction of reinforced concrete bridge systems and new hinging devices, to the contributions of joint flexibility to the development and the location of hinging in bridge elements. Undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the work through telepresence during testing and through graduate coursework. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
