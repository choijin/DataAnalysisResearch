    <AbstractNarration>The photonuclear physics group at James Madison University is engaged in a&lt;br/&gt;program of Compton scattering and meson production located at the Laser&lt;br/&gt;Electron Gamma Source (LEGS) at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS)&lt;br/&gt;at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), and the High Intensity Gamma Source&lt;br/&gt;(HIGS) facility at the Duke Free Electron Laser Laboratory (DFELL)&lt;br/&gt;laboratory at Duke University (DU). The work at both facilities is focused&lt;br/&gt;on polarized photon beams and targets. At LEGS, the experiments will use a&lt;br/&gt;polarized HD target especially constructed for this program. Polarized&lt;br/&gt;targets are being developed for the program at the HIGS facility at the&lt;br/&gt;University of Virginia (UVA), DU and JMU. These include several polarized&lt;br/&gt;targets, including the polarizable scintillator target using material&lt;br/&gt;fabricated at JMU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LEGS effort focuses on the distillation of high purity HD for target&lt;br/&gt;production and the participation in the final phase of data collection. The&lt;br/&gt;HIGS effort is concentrated on the fabrication of polarizable scintillator&lt;br/&gt;targets and the construction of a detector assembly and testing laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;This lab will be equiped using JMU money and will permit NaI detector&lt;br/&gt;assembly and testing for HIGS. All the students are involved in distillery&lt;br/&gt;operation. This provides them with an opportunity that is unique at JMU.&lt;br/&gt;This is the only cryogenic laboratory of any kind on campus. In addition,&lt;br/&gt;this distillery is unique in the world making this facility on the JMU&lt;br/&gt;campus a critical component for the LEGS program and an ideal learning&lt;br/&gt;situation for our students. The HIGS NaI detector testing lab will serve as&lt;br/&gt;a starting point for the development of a nuclear physics lab course to&lt;br/&gt;complement the existing lecture introduced by the PI and will allow&lt;br/&gt;extension of a new department outreach program to include nuclear physics.&lt;br/&gt;The preparation of polarizable target materials at JMU is generating a&lt;br/&gt;closer connection with the material science group here. This builds&lt;br/&gt;connections among the students in different research groups and connections&lt;br/&gt;among the faculty.</AbstractNarration>
