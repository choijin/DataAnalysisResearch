<AbstractNarration>RCN: Biogeosphere-Atmosphere Stable Isotopes Network (BASIN)  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will create a Research Coordination Network to bring together ecologists, ecosystem scientists, ecophysiologists, hydrologists and atmospheric scientists interested in using stable isotopes to better understand the controls on gas exchange processes, to understand the relationships between water and gas exchange and climatic factors, and to stimulate interdisciplinary cooperation, collaboration and training through workshops, national and international meetings, and student exchanges.  This RCN continues the work of a prior RCN, but broadens and refocuses the network to push for better integration of stable isotopes in the ecohydrological studies with a new emphasis on transpiration and evaporation processes.  A strong focus of this RCN will be on water in biological, hydrological and atmospheric systems and on how the hydrological cycle has been changed as land-use change and urbanization have intensified.  This RCN will have broader impacts for human resources by providing graduate and post-doctoral training opportunities and involving underrepresented groups from the United States and abroad in scientific activities that highlight the use of stable isotopes across the disciplines of biology, hydrology and atmospheric&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
