<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;One important problem in peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay distributed systems is&lt;br/&gt;to enforce the trust of the data stored in the system, and protect the&lt;br/&gt;security and privacy of the peers. However, current research addresses&lt;br/&gt;this problem in two directions with independent efforts: privacy and&lt;br/&gt;security. In the privacy direction, researchers focus on proposing&lt;br/&gt;anonymity protocols to hide peers' identities and on how to prevent the&lt;br/&gt;attackers from revealing peers' identities. In the security direction, one&lt;br/&gt;major research focus is to detect the identities of peers who are&lt;br/&gt;suspicious to disturb normal operations in P2P systems intentionally or&lt;br/&gt;unintentionally. If a peer can absolutely hide his/her identity, the&lt;br/&gt;anonymity protocol can be possibly abused to threat the Internet security.&lt;br/&gt;Increasing peers' privacy means increasing the difficulties to ensure&lt;br/&gt;security. In this project, the PI conducts research to understand and&lt;br/&gt;provide solutions on balancing the tradeoffs between privacy and security&lt;br/&gt;in P2P systems. Specifically, (1) the PI develops anonymity communication&lt;br/&gt;protocols to provide privacy protection for P2P users with security&lt;br/&gt;insurance; (2) taking overlay distributed denial-of-service and file&lt;br/&gt;integrity as case studies for security issues, the PI develops technical&lt;br/&gt;security solutions without conflict with privacy requirements; (3) the&lt;br/&gt;research investigates a wide range of security issues by developing&lt;br/&gt;security solutions to balance tradeoffs of privacy and security. This&lt;br/&gt;project is integrated to a Microsoft sponsored undergraduate course&lt;br/&gt;development, where important topics of networking security and privacy,&lt;br/&gt;design of decentralized P2P systems are being studied.&lt;br/&gt;----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
