<AbstractNarration>This project submitted under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) program investigates cooperation among evacuees in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  In this regard the project offers the opportunity to study the levels of cooperation and conflict among strangers who have been dislocated due to the emergency.  It also asks about the risk orientation of those who have been dislocated and the levels of trust that individuals have for others within their group and for agencies working with them.  Finally, project assesses the effect of different sized evacuation centers on levels of in-group cooperation and trust and the way in which attitudes and behaviors change over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is conducted at the Behavioral Research Laboratory located at Rice University in Houston, Texas.  Houston currently is housing the largest population of evacuees from New Orleans and other places in the Gulf Coast.  The investigator runs three different cross sections of evacuees: one beginning on September 9th and extending for one week; a second one month later; and, the final cross section will occur in two to three months, depending on the time table for moving evacuees out of Houston.  Evacuees will be transported to the Behavioral Research Laboratory at Rice and will participate in studies assessing cooperation and attitude development and change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to the second review criterion of the National Science Foundation, broader applicability to societal needs, the research gathers fundamental data on how opinion changes over time on issues under debate in Washington in tandem with discussions of disaster relief and mitigation.   This study will be of value to scholars interested in the topic and also to decision-makers trying to differentiate among threats to social dislocation and the American culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
