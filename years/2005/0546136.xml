<AbstractNarration>IIS-0546136&lt;br/&gt;Amol V Deshpande &lt;amol@cs.umd.edu&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of Maryland College Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: MauveDB: Model-based User Views over Sensor Data&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Real-world data --- especially when generated by distributed measurement infrastructures such as sensor networks --- tends to be incomplete, imprecise, and erroneous, making it impossible to present it to the users or to feed it directly into applications.  The goal of this project is to develop MauveDB, a data management system that offers a principled approach to dealing with this problem by supporting a new abstraction called "model-based views."  MauveDB is built by leveraging the Apache Derby Database Management System (DBMS) codebase.  Analogous to traditional database views, model-based views provide independence from the details of the underlying data generating mechanism and hide the irregularities of the data by using statistical and probabilistic "models" to present a consistent view of the data to the users. MauveDB supports a declarative language for defining model-based views, and supports declarative querying over model-based views using an extended version of SQL that supports continuous and probabilistic queries. Being a full-fledged DBMS, MauveDB also enables easy storage and archival and querying of historical data. By relieving the users of the burden of dealing with the noisy real-world data, MauveDB enables a high-impact new class of real-world applications based on networks of monitoring and sensing devices, such as traffic monitoring, location-based services, environmental monitoring, health services, and military applications.  This research will be used to develop code, datasets and sensor network deployments that will be used in the new course modules being developed at the University of Maryland; the code and the course material developed will also be made freely available at the project web site http://www.cs.umd.edu/~amol/MauveDB.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
