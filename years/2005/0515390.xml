<AbstractNarration>The funded research aims to provide practical tools for biologists who &lt;br/&gt;use cross-species comparisons to identify significant functional, &lt;br/&gt;ecological, or historical factors shaping the patterns of diversity &lt;br/&gt;among species. For example: is the evolution of HIV virulence related &lt;br/&gt;to rates of transmission among hosts? Which environmental factors most &lt;br/&gt;strongly influence the rate of evolution, and what are the strengths &lt;br/&gt;and directions of evolution? This broad class of questions all involve &lt;br/&gt;adaptive evolution (i.e., the direction and strength of natural &lt;br/&gt;selection). All existing methods share the significant shortcoming in &lt;br/&gt;using a completely neutral model of evolution. That is, previous &lt;br/&gt;methods fail to account for natural selection, despite the fact that it &lt;br/&gt;is the central feature of interest. The method developed here is the &lt;br/&gt;most comprehensive to date. It simultaneously accounts for random &lt;br/&gt;evolutionary fluctuations (such as genetic drift), common ancestry, and &lt;br/&gt;natural selection (under multiple adaptive regimes). Methods are &lt;br/&gt;provided for formulating scientific hypotheses as explicit mathematical &lt;br/&gt;models, each of which can then be fit to the data. Modern &lt;br/&gt;model-selection theory is then to identify the best-support model or &lt;br/&gt;models. Because in this approach, the causal factors of interest are &lt;br/&gt;explicitly modeled and tested directly against data, scientists will be &lt;br/&gt;able to use these methods to identify which aspects of the evolutionary &lt;br/&gt;process are most important, describe the relative strengths and &lt;br/&gt;directions of these evolutionary forces, and understand how they have &lt;br/&gt;influenced the tempo and mode of evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The comparative method is a fundamental tool in organismal, &lt;br/&gt;evolutionary and ecological biology. It is used to identify and study &lt;br/&gt;the factors which have been important in producing the diversity of &lt;br/&gt;life we see today. Understanding the significant environmental, &lt;br/&gt;functional, and genetic mechanisms operative in the past is critical &lt;br/&gt;for planning conservation strategies for the future. It is also &lt;br/&gt;important in planning effective strategies to control human disease. &lt;br/&gt;For example, two fronts in the battle against HIV, predicting the &lt;br/&gt;spread of drug-resistance and immune-escape mutations, rely on an &lt;br/&gt;understanding of how HIV evolves in response to natural selection and &lt;br/&gt;how HIV evolution differs within and among hosts. Beyond the &lt;br/&gt;environmental sciences, it is now widely appreciated that studies of &lt;br/&gt;function (at the organismal, biochemical, or gene level) require the &lt;br/&gt;application of the comparative method.The funded research will provide &lt;br/&gt;practical tools to enable comparative biologists to make stronger tests &lt;br/&gt;of their hypotheses.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
