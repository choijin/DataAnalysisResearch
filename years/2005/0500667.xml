<AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;DeBacker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will continue his research into a number of topics in &lt;br/&gt;harmonic analysis for Lie groups over nonarchimedian fields.  The first &lt;br/&gt;goal is to establish Murnaghan-Kirillov theory for depth zero &lt;br/&gt;supercuspidal representations.  At its most basic level, &lt;br/&gt;Murnaghan-Kirillov theory asks for a connection between the &lt;br/&gt;supercuspidal representations of our group and the Fourier transforms &lt;br/&gt;of certain coadjoint orbital integrals.  Because of their intimate &lt;br/&gt;connection to finite groups of Lie type, the problem of establishing &lt;br/&gt;Murnaghan-Kirillov theory for these representations reduces to the &lt;br/&gt;problem of associating regular semisimple orbital integrals to &lt;br/&gt;generalized Green functions.  The second objective is to investigate &lt;br/&gt;questions about stability.   For example, it would be useful to &lt;br/&gt;explicitly understand, in a uniform way via Bruhat-Tits theory, the &lt;br/&gt;space of stable distributions supported on the nilpotent set.  Thanks &lt;br/&gt;to various homogeneity results, this problem can be addressed by &lt;br/&gt;associating (as above) regular semisimple orbital integrals to &lt;br/&gt;generalized Green functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harmonic analysis on Lie groups traces its roots to the following &lt;br/&gt;problem from physics:  Describe the motion of a plucked guitar string.  &lt;br/&gt;Eventually, people realized that this problem --- and rather more pure &lt;br/&gt;problems like calculating Gauss sums or studying the density of primes &lt;br/&gt;in arithmetic progressions --- could be understood by studying certain &lt;br/&gt;well-behaved functions on the circle (or other groups).   These &lt;br/&gt;well-behaved functions are called characters, and the resulting theory &lt;br/&gt;is called harmonic analysis.  By the 1930s mathematicians had a firm &lt;br/&gt;understanding of harmonic analysis on many types of groups (for &lt;br/&gt;example, compact or abelian groups).   During the 1940s problems from &lt;br/&gt;relativistic physics led people to think about harmonic analysis on a &lt;br/&gt;more general class of groups, called Lie groups.  Initiated by the work &lt;br/&gt;of Bargmann, Gelfand--Naimark, and Harish-Chandra,  the goal was, as &lt;br/&gt;for the guitar problem, to understand functions on the group by &lt;br/&gt;studying characters.  Thanks mostly to Harish-Chandra this goal was &lt;br/&gt;largely realized. Based at least partially on his understanding of this &lt;br/&gt;work, in the late 1960s Langlands was led to formulate his program; &lt;br/&gt;this program is a vast, remarkable web of conjectures and ideas --- a &lt;br/&gt;kind of mathematical theory of everything. For example, the celebrated &lt;br/&gt;works of Harris--Taylor, Kim--Shahidi, and Lafforgue provide a small &lt;br/&gt;sampling of the deep results it anticipates.  As harmonic analysis on &lt;br/&gt;Lie groups plays a central role in our understanding of many of the &lt;br/&gt;problems in this area, the investigator hopes his research will &lt;br/&gt;contribute to future progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
