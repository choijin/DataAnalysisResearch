<AbstractNarration>0551834 &lt;br/&gt;Germaine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding particle transport in porous media is important to a number of&lt;br/&gt;problems involving subsurface flow and transport, water and waste-water treatment, and&lt;br/&gt;soil pedology. The migration behavior of particles in porous media is complex. Factors&lt;br/&gt;influencing this behavior include the particle density, size and surface chemistry, the&lt;br/&gt;water chemistry, the interstitial velocity, and the characteristics of the porous medium. In&lt;br/&gt;the case of biological particles, motility, chemotaxis, growth and decay are also&lt;br/&gt;influential.&lt;br/&gt;Considerable insight into particle transport in porous media has been gained from&lt;br/&gt;experimental programs based on batch and column testing. Nonetheless, work of this&lt;br/&gt;nature cannot resolve, in real-time, the processes governing particle transport in the&lt;br/&gt;interior of a porous medium. This limits the scale of understanding that can be gained&lt;br/&gt;from such experimental approaches. In order to further understanding of the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;processes governing particle fate and transport in porous media, alternative methods that&lt;br/&gt;involve visualization studies of particle behavior within a porous medium are needed.&lt;br/&gt;In prior work, the Investigators of this proposal developed a visualization&lt;br/&gt;technique to study particle behavior in the interior of a porous medium. Use of this&lt;br/&gt;technique enabled the proposition of new hypotheses regarding particle transport&lt;br/&gt;behavior. The goals of this exploratory research project are to further the new&lt;br/&gt;visualization technique, and to provide further support for the emerging hypotheses on&lt;br/&gt;particle transport behavior. Specifically, the project will:&lt;br/&gt;1. Extend the new visualization technique to enable better resolution of particle&lt;br/&gt;behavior, including resolution of individual particle tracks at the micro-scale and&lt;br/&gt;distinction between aqueous and solid phase particles at the macro-scale.&lt;br/&gt;2. Prove, irrefutably, that, during non-Brownian particle transport under&lt;br/&gt;unfavorable electrostatic conditions, observations of decreasing particle attachment rate&lt;br/&gt;with transport distance are attributable to the early filtration of heavier particles as a&lt;br/&gt;result of gravitational sedimentation, and&lt;br/&gt;3. Establish the impact of flow direction on particle transport for micron-sized&lt;br/&gt;particles whose behavior is, theoretically, dominated by Brownian motion.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts The proposed research will provide a visualization tool that can&lt;br/&gt;spatially and temporally resolve microscopic and macroscopic particle concentrations in&lt;br/&gt;the interior of a porous medium. The research will also improve understanding of&lt;br/&gt;attachment and detachments mechanisms that impact particle interaction with a medium's&lt;br/&gt;solid phase. In particular, it will provide an explanation for why irreversible particle&lt;br/&gt;attachment rates decrease with transport distance under unfavorable electrostatic&lt;br/&gt;conditions. Research training will be provided for one graduate student. Undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students will also be engaged in the research through MIT's Undergraduate Research&lt;br/&gt;Opportunities Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
