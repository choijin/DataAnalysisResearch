<AbstractNarration>Over the last three years the Claremont Graduate University, in collaboration with the University of&lt;br/&gt;Minnesota, has investigated the time-critical nature of emergency medical services (EMS) and the&lt;br/&gt;implications for information systems that support these services. This proposal aims to extend this work&lt;br/&gt;by exploring conceptual model development for time-critical information services generally and EMS&lt;br/&gt;specifically and convening a workshop of interested researchers. The motivation for this study and workshop is to improve the public welfare through a better understanding of how IT and organizations interact to deliver time-critical services such as emergency medical services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there is a burgeoning literature on digital government processes, to date, there has been minimal attention to the time-criticality dimension of information services. This research and workshop  will develop a foundation for conceptual and empirically-based tools that can improve scientific understanding about how information and organizational systems interact to facilitate and/or thwart the delivery of time-critical information services. From a methodological perspective, the project will explore how both qualitative (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;ethnographies) and quantitative (e.g., simulation) methods can aid in understanding end-to-end&lt;br/&gt;performance of e-government services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project findings are aimed to improve the performance of time-critical egovernment&lt;br/&gt;services. This information can serve a broad range of policy makers (including transportation, health care, public safety, and emergency management) and increase general understanding of information technology and organizational dynamics associated with time-critical information services. By increasing the time-responsiveness of services such as EMS, the aim is to benefit a broad range of citizens from diverse racial, income, and ethnic backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>
