<AbstractNarration>Gene expression is the primary mechanism in which information encoded by the&lt;br/&gt;genome is converted into developmental, morphological, and physiological phenotypes.&lt;br/&gt;Thus, understanding the amount, structure, and patterns of gene expression variation is&lt;br/&gt;of fundamental importance. However, very little is known about how gene expression&lt;br/&gt;varies within and between populations and how gene expression variation contributes to&lt;br/&gt;phenotypic variation. The goal of this proposal is to begin to bridge this critical lack of&lt;br/&gt;knowledge by using microarray technology to study gene expression variation in human&lt;br/&gt;populations. To this end, gene expression levels will be measured in individuals from&lt;br/&gt;geographically diverse populations and genes that are differentially expressed between&lt;br/&gt;individuals within the same population and differentially expressed between populations&lt;br/&gt;will be identified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful completion of this project will have important practical benefits for&lt;br/&gt;society. For example, the data will provide the first systematic and global&lt;br/&gt;characterization of gene expression variation within and between geographically diverse&lt;br/&gt;human populations. In turn, this information will provide the foundation for making more&lt;br/&gt;principled inferences of phenotypic variation in humans, including the genetic&lt;br/&gt;contribution to disease. In addition, this project will fulfill an important educational need&lt;br/&gt;by providing interdisciplinary training opportunities for the next generation of scientists,&lt;br/&gt;which will enable them to address and solve challenging biological problems.</AbstractNarration>
