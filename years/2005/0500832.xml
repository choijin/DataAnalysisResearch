<AbstractNarration>The proposed research has several goals. The first goal is to&lt;br/&gt;study cohomological equations over hyperbolic dynamical systems.&lt;br/&gt;One is interested to generalize Livsic's cohomological&lt;br/&gt;results to cocycles for which periodic data is included in&lt;br/&gt;semigroups in Lie groups. Positive results in this direction will&lt;br/&gt;be natural generalizations of previous work, and will give&lt;br/&gt;obstructions to the topological transitivity of extensions over&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic actions. The second goal is to use cohomological&lt;br/&gt;results as a tool in the rigidity theory of partially hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;higher rank lattice actions. This goal is part of the rigidity&lt;br/&gt;program initiated by Zimmer, aiming to classify volume preserving&lt;br/&gt;higher rank lattice actions on compact manifolds. A reachable&lt;br/&gt;target is to classify small GL(n,R) extensions of SL(n,Z) totally &lt;br/&gt;non-symplectic actions (i.e. hyperbolic and with a special structure of the&lt;br/&gt;stable and unstable foliations). The third goal is to find generic&lt;br/&gt;classes of partially hyperbolic transformations with rich dynamic&lt;br/&gt;properties. Pugh and Shub recently conjectured that stably&lt;br/&gt;ergodicity and accessibility occur more frequently than expected &lt;br/&gt;among differentiable maps, and that some partial hyperbolicity is &lt;br/&gt;sufficient to prove stably ergodicity. From a result of Nitica and &lt;br/&gt;Torok it follows that, under technical conditions, stably ergodicity is&lt;br/&gt;open and dense in the class of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms&lt;br/&gt;with one-dimensional central foliation. The density holds even in the &lt;br/&gt;higher regularity classes. An interesting problem is to&lt;br/&gt;generalize this result to more general classes of partially &lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic diffeomorphisms. In other direction, a recent result &lt;br/&gt;of Nitica and Pollicott shows that for Euclidean extensions of &lt;br/&gt;Anosov diffeomorphisms on infranilmanifolds the only obstructions &lt;br/&gt;to stable transitivity are of cohomological nature. One would like &lt;br/&gt;to generalize this result to non-abelian fibers, and to classify &lt;br/&gt;the obstructions to topological transitivity. The Investigator (with &lt;br/&gt;I. Melbourne and A. Torok) has recent results in this direction proving &lt;br/&gt;the existence of stably transitive extensions with Sp(n) fiber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A chaotic map has a dense set of periodic points, that &lt;br/&gt;is points that are fixed by a higher iterate of the map, as well as transitive &lt;br/&gt;points, that is points for which a higher iterate will get arbitrarily &lt;br/&gt;close to any other point. Chaotic behaviour is expected to &lt;br/&gt;be generic in large classes of maps and in nature. Part of this research &lt;br/&gt;will be focused on finding new mechanisms for producing chaos &lt;br/&gt;for large classes of dynamical systems that exhibit only partial hyperbolicity. &lt;br/&gt;It will also concentrate on finding obstructions to chaotic behaviour. These &lt;br/&gt;results will be of interest to the broader scientific community involved &lt;br/&gt;in applications of nonlinear dynamics in physical sciences. &lt;br/&gt;A spin-off of this work will be a careful study of the semigroups in the &lt;br/&gt;Special Euclidean groups with interesting applications to discrete control &lt;br/&gt;theory and robotics. The Investigator actively participates in recruitment, &lt;br/&gt;training and professional development of K-12 mathematics teachers. He will &lt;br/&gt;continue his collaboration with undergraduate students and will support them &lt;br/&gt;to give talks at professional meetings. These activities will benefit from the &lt;br/&gt;grant.</AbstractNarration>
