<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the creation of a methodology for modeling &lt;br/&gt;and mathematical computation to quantify operational flexibility in service &lt;br/&gt;and manufacturing supply chains. It emphasizes the flexibility attained &lt;br/&gt;when sources of production (e.g., workers, machines, plants, etc.) are &lt;br/&gt;multi-functional. Examples of this include workers with multiple skills, &lt;br/&gt;machines with flexible or reconfigurable capabilities, and supply chains &lt;br/&gt;with flexible sourcing and distribution options. By having multi-functional &lt;br/&gt;servers (sources), capacity can be dynamically allocated in response to the &lt;br/&gt;realization of uncertain demand. Taking queueing networks as models of the &lt;br/&gt;production systems, approximate deterministic metrics of flexibility are &lt;br/&gt;used to accurately predict the best design from various alternatives. &lt;br/&gt;Mathematical programming, queueing theory, Markov Decision Processes, and &lt;br/&gt;discrete event systems simulation are employed. The research illuminates &lt;br/&gt;the connections between general queueing networks with flexible servers and &lt;br/&gt;the properties found in approximate, deterministic network models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will lead to improvements in &lt;br/&gt;the design of service and manufacturing operations and supply chains that &lt;br/&gt;deliver high-performance efficiencies and service levels despite uncertain &lt;br/&gt;changes in technology, heightened consumer expectations, decreased vertical &lt;br/&gt;integration of the supply chain, and intensified global competition. The &lt;br/&gt;primary objectives of this research are to (1) develop effective methods &lt;br/&gt;for quantifying flexibility, (2) develop principles and methodology to &lt;br/&gt;better select a roster of flexible workers for a shift (or work period) &lt;br/&gt;that results in a robustly productive team, and (3) invent a methodology to &lt;br/&gt;assist in the design of robust multi-echelon supply chains. The anticipated &lt;br/&gt;results of this research are: (1) managerial insights that deepen the &lt;br/&gt;understanding of how to design production systems and worker/staffing &lt;br/&gt;schedules that are truly flexible and robust and (2) tractable &lt;br/&gt;analytical/numerical models and methods for the analysis and design of &lt;br/&gt;multi-echelon supply chains.  Upon implementation, the results will help &lt;br/&gt;ordinary people through increased quality of service in everyday &lt;br/&gt;transactions, workers through increased career development and training, &lt;br/&gt;and businesses through improved management practices and competitive &lt;br/&gt;operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
