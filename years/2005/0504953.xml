    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigators: Kottas, Athanasios and Gelfand, Alan&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: DMS - 0505085 and DMS - 0504953&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Collaborative Research on Bayesian Nonparametric Methods for Spatial and Spatiotemporal Data&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California Santa Cruz and Duke University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators develop Bayesian nonparametric methodology for&lt;br/&gt;spatial and spatio-temporal data analysis. Point-referenced spatial&lt;br/&gt;data arises in several fields, including atmospheric science, ecology, &lt;br/&gt;environmental science, and epidemiology. In fact, often such data is &lt;br/&gt;replicated across time say through sampling at monitoring sites. In &lt;br/&gt;certain cases, with appropriate preliminary manipulation, the&lt;br/&gt;replicates may be viewed as independent. More often, the temporal &lt;br/&gt;dependence is retained and, discretizing time, a time series of&lt;br/&gt;spatial processes emerges. In either case, virtually all of the&lt;br/&gt;modeling for the spatial processes is specified parametrically; in fact, &lt;br/&gt;it is almost always a Gaussian process which is most frequently&lt;br/&gt;assumed to be stationary. The investigators study new classes of &lt;br/&gt;nonparametric spatial models to remove these assumptions. These models &lt;br/&gt;are applicable to either of the above replicated settings. In its &lt;br/&gt;simplest form, the investigators use Dirichlet processes to create &lt;br/&gt;random spatial processes, which are non-Gaussian, nonstationary, and &lt;br/&gt;have non-homogeneous variance. These processes are defined through&lt;br/&gt;their finite dimensional distributions, and are referred to as spatial &lt;br/&gt;Dirichlet processes. A spatial Dirichlet process is then convolved&lt;br/&gt;with a pure error process to create an illustrative spatial process&lt;br/&gt;with a nugget component. Such models are hierarchical and can be&lt;br/&gt;fitted through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In application, the &lt;br/&gt;investigators use spatial Dirichlet processes to introduce spatial&lt;br/&gt;random effects into the modeling, either directly with independent &lt;br/&gt;replicates or embedded within a dynamic model to handle temporal &lt;br/&gt;dependence. The investigators study an assortment of problems&lt;br/&gt;associated with the use of spatial Dirichlet processes, including&lt;br/&gt;their theoretical global and local properties; their use as mixing&lt;br/&gt;models; their use with semiparametric mixing; their implementation in &lt;br/&gt;dynamic models; their utilization for interpolation at given time&lt;br/&gt;points and for forecasting at future time points; their use with &lt;br/&gt;non-Gaussian first stage specifications for the data; their use in &lt;br/&gt;describing multivariate distributions and, as a special case, for &lt;br/&gt;extended regression modeling; their use in modeling spatial point &lt;br/&gt;process data; and their extension to richer classes of so-called &lt;br/&gt;generalized spatial Dirichlet processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Point-referenced spatial data arises in application areas as diverse &lt;br/&gt;as environmental science, climatology, ecology, epidemiology, and&lt;br/&gt;real estate markets. As researchers collect more and more space and &lt;br/&gt;space-time data, the need for analyses to enhance their understanding &lt;br/&gt;of the complex processes they are sampling grows. This inspires the &lt;br/&gt;need for sufficiently rich models to accommodate a variety of global&lt;br/&gt;and local behaviors. The primary motivation for this research is to &lt;br/&gt;expand the catalog of space-time modeling tools available to such &lt;br/&gt;scientists. This research work suggests the first approach to &lt;br/&gt;nonparametric Bayesian spatial and spatio-temporal data analysis. &lt;br/&gt;Nonparametric Bayesian approaches have witnessed increased utilization &lt;br/&gt;in recent years as a result of their successful application to certain &lt;br/&gt;problems in, for example, engineering and biomedical fields.&lt;br/&gt;Similar success is anticipated by bringing this methodology to &lt;br/&gt;space-time settings. In particular, it is anticipated that, for fields &lt;br/&gt;such as epidemiology, environmental contamination and weather&lt;br/&gt;modeling, researchers will value the flexible modeling framework the &lt;br/&gt;work offers. And, an increase in usage of the methodology is expected &lt;br/&gt;as the computational techniques to fit the models are advanced.</AbstractNarration>
