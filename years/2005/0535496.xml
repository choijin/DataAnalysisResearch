<AbstractNarration>Over the past few decades it has become apparent that scientific progress is commonly best&lt;br/&gt;attained where big problems are addressed by teams of scientists representing a wide&lt;br/&gt;variety of expertise. In response to these changes in the nature of scientific inquiry,&lt;br/&gt;the Paleontological Society proposes to organize a workshop accompanied by a series of&lt;br/&gt;research forums that will focus on developing several new large-scale research initiatives&lt;br/&gt;that have the broad support of the paleontological community. The proposed Future Research&lt;br/&gt;Directions in Paleontology (FRDP) Workshop, for which funds are requested, will include 25&lt;br/&gt;participants, and is to be held on September 10-11, 2005 at the Department of&lt;br/&gt;Paleobiology, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. This will be preceded by a&lt;br/&gt;research forum at the North American Paleontological Convention (June, 2005) in Halifax,&lt;br/&gt;Nova Scotia. The workshop will then be followed by two research forums at the Geological&lt;br/&gt;Society of America Annual Meeting (October, 2005). The final product of this effort will&lt;br/&gt;be a document of 30-40 pages which will contain short proposals for 5-6 larger integrative&lt;br/&gt;projects that require significant funding which the paleontological community shows strong&lt;br/&gt;support for initiating.&lt;br/&gt;What Is The Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity?&lt;br/&gt;Those engaged in paleontological research would agree that many challenges towards our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of how life has evolved and existed on Earth would be best approached in a&lt;br/&gt;collaborative, integrative fashion. The FRDP Workshop and associated Research Forums will&lt;br/&gt;provide a community-based platform where several of these most important research problems&lt;br/&gt;can be addressed through development of research projects that will act as initiatives for&lt;br/&gt;the paleontological community. In this way the Paleontological Society plans to lead the&lt;br/&gt;way towards the future of paleontological research.&lt;br/&gt;What Are The Broader Impacts of this Study?&lt;br/&gt;With the growth of science over the past few decades, many of the most important problems&lt;br/&gt;can only be solved with interdisciplinary teams of scientists using the best available&lt;br/&gt;technology. Such team-based activities will provide numerous opportunities for research&lt;br/&gt;training and experience in forefront areas of science, particularly the growing number of&lt;br/&gt;women and other under-represented groups which are currently entering the Earth sciences.</AbstractNarration>
