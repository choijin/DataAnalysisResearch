    <AbstractNarration>The investigator works on three projects: 1) Mechanical&lt;br/&gt;properties of composites and polycrystals. New reliable&lt;br/&gt;analytical and numerical methods are developed to predict the&lt;br/&gt;strength of a wide range of heterogeneous solids. In addition,&lt;br/&gt;detailed results on idealized models are obtained. These serve to&lt;br/&gt;gain understanding of real materials and to test existing methods&lt;br/&gt;in regimes where their accuracy is uncertain. 2) Solute transport&lt;br/&gt;in porous media. New efficient mathematical models are developed&lt;br/&gt;and studied. Because this project is relevant to the&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the transport of contaminants in soils and the&lt;br/&gt;transport of nutrients in bones, the range of potential&lt;br/&gt;applications of the results of this project is wide. 3) Small&lt;br/&gt;particles migration and clogging. Laboratory experiments that&lt;br/&gt;capture the physical mechanisms involved in particles migration&lt;br/&gt;and clogging are studied and mathematically modeled. The goal is&lt;br/&gt;to improve the current understanding of the physical phenomena&lt;br/&gt;that lead to clogging, to provide guidelines for improved&lt;br/&gt;methodologies to pump petroleum and water. The phenomena to be&lt;br/&gt;studied are also relevant in other contexts including sand filters&lt;br/&gt;in water treatment, food grain, pharmaceuticals, bio-mechanical&lt;br/&gt;systems (lungs, kidneys, etc.) and filters. The projects are of&lt;br/&gt;related nature. In all cases, the macroscopic physical phenomena&lt;br/&gt;depend on the microgeometry of the materials. Accordingly, a key&lt;br/&gt;component to their study is to identify the relevant different&lt;br/&gt;length and time scales to formally obtain or construct the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Guidelines that mathematical analysis can provide in the&lt;br/&gt;understanding of properties of heterogeneous materials is of great&lt;br/&gt;benefit to society. The current availability of computational&lt;br/&gt;power and the maturity that applied mathematics has reached make&lt;br/&gt;mathematical modeling and numerical simulation powerful tools. &lt;br/&gt;The investigator believes that important discoveries are likely to&lt;br/&gt;result from interdisciplinary work; accordingly, he collaborates&lt;br/&gt;and interacts with researchers in other disciplines. Potential&lt;br/&gt;applications of the project include new guidelines on the disposal&lt;br/&gt;of contaminants, the design of improved methodologies to treat&lt;br/&gt;osteoporosis and related diseases, a better understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;processes that lead to loss of bone experienced in the absence of&lt;br/&gt;gravity (during space flights), and improve methodologies for bone&lt;br/&gt;implants. The objective of the educational activities is to&lt;br/&gt;create interdisciplinary learning and research experiences for&lt;br/&gt;students, with mathematics being a central component. To&lt;br/&gt;accomplish that goal, a seminar in interdisciplinary mathematics&lt;br/&gt;is developed.</AbstractNarration>
