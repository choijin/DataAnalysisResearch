<AbstractNarration>Improving the experiences of people in multi-user computer assisted collaborative activities or training to the extent that their interactions with each other and with their virtual environments are almost lifelike will requires much better haptic (force and touch) feedback technology than is currently available.  In particular, little is available to provide human-human and human-world touch feedback when groups of users are moving freely, rather than seated at desktop displays.  Compact vibration feedback devices could be used, notwithstanding that the user's ability while in motion to perceive high-frequency vibration is likely to suffer.  An alternative method of activating the touch sensors in human skin is to apply distributed cutaneous stimulants, or skin stretch, but little is known about its effects on the body, or if it can be used as a body-mounted haptic display.  The PI's goal in this project is to explore such issues.  In particular, he will investigate the effects of both distributed skin-stretch and vibration feedback applied by means of light-weight, low-power "tactors" that can be mounted/worn at various locations on a person's body.  The PI will conduct experiments to quantify the effects of skin-stretch in comparison to vibration feedback for both sedentary and rapidly moving users, and will conduct preliminary investigations of the effects of body worn tactors in a physical rehabilitation environment, in the hope of improving motion training exercises which patients often require when recovering from injuries or strokes.  The results of these experiments will provide a first indication of how best to utilize skin-stretch and vibration displays in virtual environments and in human-human interactions, and will also guide further tactor development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  In comparison to vision and sound, haptic feedback is an underdeveloped channel.  New technologies such as those the PI will investigate in this project promise to revolutionize human-computer interaction and computer-mediated human-human interaction in a host of diverse domains, not the least of which are timely applications such as training exercises for emergency personnel and collaborative efforts among geographically distributed teams to develop emergency procedures.</AbstractNarration>
