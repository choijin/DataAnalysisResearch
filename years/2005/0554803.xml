    <AbstractNarration>The principal investigator proposes to study questions&lt;br/&gt;dealing with the algebraic structure of the Stone-Cech&lt;br/&gt;compactification of a discrete semigroup and the combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;applications of that structure. Some of the questions,&lt;br/&gt;while easy to state, are notoriously difficult. For &lt;br/&gt;example, is there a nontrivial continuous homomorphism&lt;br/&gt;from the Stone-Cech compactification of the positive&lt;br/&gt;integers to its remainder? Equivalently, is there a&lt;br/&gt;finite subsemigroup of the remainder whose elements&lt;br/&gt;are not all idempotents? Among the applications&lt;br/&gt;of this algebraic structure have been results establishing&lt;br/&gt;that certain infinite matrices are image partition regular.&lt;br/&gt;It is hoped that progress will be made on the difficult&lt;br/&gt;question of characterizing which infinite matrices are&lt;br/&gt;image partition regular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The study of the algebraic structure of the Stone-Cech&lt;br/&gt;compactification of a discrete semigroup is important&lt;br/&gt;for two main reasons. First, many of the questions that&lt;br/&gt;remain open are very simple to state and quite natural.&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, experience has shown that information about&lt;br/&gt;this algebraic structure has significant applications&lt;br/&gt;to the field of mathematics known as Ramsey Theory.&lt;br/&gt;The first such application was the algebraic proof in 1975 by &lt;br/&gt;Fred Galvin and Steven Glazer of the "Finite Sums&lt;br/&gt;Theorem", which asserts that whenever the positive&lt;br/&gt;integers are divided into finitely many classes, one&lt;br/&gt;of these classes contains a sequence and all of its&lt;br/&gt;sums of finitely many distinct terms. After this&lt;br/&gt;initial application many other applications have been found. For example&lt;br/&gt;very easy proofs of van der Waerden's Theorem (which asserts that&lt;br/&gt;whenever the positive integers are divided into finitely&lt;br/&gt;many classes, one of these must contain arbitrarily&lt;br/&gt;long arithmetic progressions) and some of its&lt;br/&gt;extensions have been found. The principal investigator&lt;br/&gt;intends, with some of his students, to continue&lt;br/&gt;the investigation of this algebraic structure&lt;br/&gt;and its applications.</AbstractNarration>
