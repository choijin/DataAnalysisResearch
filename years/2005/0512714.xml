<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0512714&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Haynes R. Miller, Michael J. Hopkins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Talbot program is a series of yearly workshop retreats&lt;br/&gt;bringing together graduate students, recent PhDs, and faculty&lt;br/&gt;mentors for an intense exploration of a topic of active&lt;br/&gt;mathematical research. The Talbot 2004 workshop was devoted to&lt;br/&gt;the Stolz-Teichner model of elliptic cohomology and was mentored&lt;br/&gt;by Stephan Stolz. The Talbot 2005 workshop will focus on the&lt;br/&gt;geometric Langlands program and be mentored by David Ben-Zvi. The&lt;br/&gt;geometric Langlands program is one of the most fertile areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, integrating representation theory, topology, and&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry. The original conjectures of Langlands tie&lt;br/&gt;infinite-dimensional representation theory to the structure of&lt;br/&gt;Galois groups, with profound applications to number theory. From&lt;br/&gt;the geometric perspective deriving from the renowned theorem of&lt;br/&gt;Borel-Weil-Bott, one would like to classify such representations&lt;br/&gt;by equivariant sheaves on a parametrizing space. Drinfeld and&lt;br/&gt;Laumon, among others, adapted Langlands' original ideas for&lt;br/&gt;function fields to formulate a far reaching geometric&lt;br/&gt;generalization, now called the geometric Langlands program. Work&lt;br/&gt;in this area over the past twenty years has changed the face of&lt;br/&gt;modern representation theory. Recent advances, such as new&lt;br/&gt;geometric generalizations of the classical Satake isomorphism,&lt;br/&gt;make this an ideal time to gather young mathematicians to study&lt;br/&gt;these results, the techniques used to derive them, and newly&lt;br/&gt;exposed avenues for future research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Talbot workshops seek to introduce aspiring mathematicians to&lt;br/&gt;active areas of mathematical research, foster community and&lt;br/&gt;collaboration across subdisciplinary and institutional lines, and&lt;br/&gt;form pedagogical and research ties between established&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians and young researchers. The topic for Talbot 2004&lt;br/&gt;concerns a central problem in mathematics deeply related to&lt;br/&gt;neighboring areas of science. For instance, the crystallographic&lt;br/&gt;study of proteins, quantum states of particles, and the structure&lt;br/&gt;of integer solutions to polynomial equations are all central to&lt;br/&gt;chemistry, physics, and cryptography/number theory; their deeper&lt;br/&gt;study requires probing the algebraic structures that govern&lt;br/&gt;aspects of their nature. Representation theory is precisely the&lt;br/&gt;field of mathematics devoted to this study.  Further, the&lt;br/&gt;geometric Langlands program offers a unifying vision for the&lt;br/&gt;specific algebraic structures suited to each of these areas,&lt;br/&gt;which are called reflection groups, Lie groups, and Galois&lt;br/&gt;groups. This Talbot workshop will bring together graduate&lt;br/&gt;students with different specialties and from many universities to&lt;br/&gt;spend a week focused on this important subject. The participants&lt;br/&gt;and their mentor, David Ben-Zvi, will share a residence as well&lt;br/&gt;as lectures, discussions, and meals. This informal atmosphere,&lt;br/&gt;mixing fellowship and intellectual interest, will promote a&lt;br/&gt;concentrated study of the material and lay the foundation for&lt;br/&gt;future collaboration and research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
