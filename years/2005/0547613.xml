<AbstractNarration>Chun&lt;br/&gt;0547613&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most powerful and the fastest motions in the biological world can be found in a single-cell ciliated protozoan, Vorticella convallaria. At one stage of its life cycle, the Vorticella consists of a cell body of approximately 50 m'm in size and a stalk of 2~3 mm long, 4 m'm wide. The Vorticella stalk is capable of contracting at a speed  almost 1000 times its body size per second. The Vorticella stalk contraction is observed to be 500 times the average power of human skeletal muscle. The contractile organelle within the Vorticella stalk is a membrane-surrounded protein-based fiber structure called 'spasmoneme'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biological responsive materials are more efficient and effective than any synthetic materials ever made. The Vorticella spasmoneme represents an excellent example of a highly efficient responsive biomaterial. The spasmoneme functions on simple physical chemical terms of binding to calcium ion concentration. The triggered contraction is very fast and fully reversible upon removal of calcium.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research goal of the project is to biomimetically design polymer-based biomaterials that are responsive to biological signals such as changes in calcium ion concentration by studying the spasmin protein for the design of calcium sensitive biomaterials.  The research would have great societal impact in biomemetic engineering and biomaterial science. The educational component of the project will serve students at different levels.  The outreach will include underrepresented undergraduate students and K-12 students. The outreach activities will be a workshop on biomimetically responsive materials for the undergraduate students at Howard University and also illustrative museum experiments of biomimetic biomaterials for the Science Museum of Minnesota.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project addresses the challenge of the designing responsive biomaterials, which are materials that change their structure and properties in the presence of certain biologically derived stimuli such as pH changes. We have developed three series of responsive polymers using different molecular building blocks such as synthetic polymers, proteins and peptides. All these materials have well-defined molecular structure and narrowlly molecular weight distribution. We have shown that these properties enabled these materials to respond to biologically relevant changes and could potential be used for a range of medical applications including delivery of therapeutic drugs, genes and cells. Our research findings have been reported to the public through eight peer-reviewed research publications in scientific journals. A number of graduate and undergraduate students have been trained through conducting this project. Through this project we have developed education program targeting undergraduate students and their teachers, showcasing to them the cutting-edge research accomplishments in the field of biomaterials and inspiring them to be involved in learning or teaching careers in this field. Specifically, we have recruited a number of under-represented minority student from colleges in Minnesota and elsewhere in the country to visit our laboratory, engage in hands-on research, participate in workshops and lectures, and present their results in symposia held on campus. We have also worked with high school teacher and faculty member from undergraduate teaching institution to be exposed to cutting-edge research and to assist them to develop tools and resources for enrichment of their own teaching of undergraduate students.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/04/2015<br>      Modified by: Chun&nbsp;Wang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
