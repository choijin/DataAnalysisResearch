    <AbstractNarration>Strontium (Sr) isotopes have been used for over 40 years to examine geological processes,&lt;br/&gt;e.g. age of rocks or provenance. More recently they have been applied to biological&lt;br/&gt;samples to examine animal migration and nutrition. These latter applications assume that&lt;br/&gt;Sr isotopes are not fractionated in these biological systems. It is this hypothesis that&lt;br/&gt;will be tested by this project. Should there be significant mass dependent fractionation&lt;br/&gt;of Sr, much of the current Sr isotope measurements in non-geological systems would have to&lt;br/&gt;be revisited to check for accuracy. This will have a substantial impact on the use of Sr&lt;br/&gt;isotopes across many avenues of the biological sciences and open up new fields of research&lt;br/&gt;in earth sciences working with the mass dependence of Sr isotopic fractionation.&lt;br/&gt;For the further use of the Sr isotope system as a robust tracer it is vital that the mass&lt;br/&gt;dependence fraction of Sr is completely understood. This project will examine in detail&lt;br/&gt;how prolific this effect is.</AbstractNarration>
