<AbstractNarration>Grambling State University (GSU) will establish the Center for Mathematics Achievement in Science and Technology (CMAST), which will increase the number of underrepresented minority graduates with majors in a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) discipline.   The project activities include the reform of all introductory mathematics courses, research in mathematics education, summer programs for pre-freshmen and sophomores, outreach to high school teachers, student scholarships, undergraduate research, and mentoring.  The Center will provide the means for GSU to engage in the systematic examination and improvement of instruction in mathematics in order to address the retention of students in STEM fields. The Center gives the University a mechanism for reforming its courses in mathematics. It will enhance the role and function of mathematics in the curriculum and significantly raise the profile of study and career opportunities in STEM fields. The Center will support research on teaching methodologies and strategies in the teaching of introductory college-level mathematics. It will support research in applied mathematics which involves student participation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of CMAST include:  1) Decrease the percentage of students that earn failing grades in introductory math courses from a five-year average of 60% to 35% over a five year period; 2) Increase the average grade point average of STEM majors from 2.23 to a 2.50;  3) Increase STEM graduates enrolling in STEM graduate programs from 5% to 15%;  4) Increase STEM majors engaging in undergraduate research projects from 6% to 30 %; and 5) Increase performance of Grambling High School students on High School Graduation Exit Exam. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The CMAST program will improve the teaching and learning of introductory mathematics for STEM and non-STEM students.  Improvements in the success of students in mathematics is known to improve retention in STEM majors higher graduation rates.  The CMAST could be a model for other universities who face similar challenges of GSU.  Data collected in this project will advance knowledge of best practices to be used to address the deficits in the mathematical preparation of some college freshmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The Center will expand at a later stage to include the sciences and engineering which has the long term potential to improve and enhance all instruction in STEM fields. The center will also eventually coordinate all programs in STEM fields that involve undergraduates at GSU.  The outreach to the high school science teachers will also help to improve the preparation of GSU freshman over the long term.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
