    <AbstractNarration>Documenting regional species diversity is an urgent task because the&lt;br/&gt;extinction crisis has become more acute and more apparent to the collective&lt;br/&gt;conscience of society. The insect order Coleoptera (beetles) is an obvious&lt;br/&gt;starting point for this endeavor because it is the largest order of insects&lt;br/&gt;and constitutes over 25% of total animal diversity worldwide. Likewise,&lt;br/&gt;Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) is an obvious place to begin&lt;br/&gt;because it is a national treasure constituting one of the most biologically&lt;br/&gt;diverse and unique landscapes in North America and is located in one of the&lt;br/&gt;most densely populated parts of the U.S. This project will be conducted by a&lt;br/&gt;team of 44 cooperating scientists engaging in an ambitious effort to&lt;br/&gt;completely document beetle diversity in GSMNP. Methods will include&lt;br/&gt;fieldwork by scientists, students and volunteers, morphological and&lt;br/&gt;molecular analyses, and computer databasing. The project is fully integrated&lt;br/&gt;with other teams of researchers conducting biotic surveys as part of the All&lt;br/&gt;Taxa Biodiversity Inventory (ATBI) in GSMNP, including data and specimen&lt;br/&gt;exchange, joint collecting events ("bioblitzes"), and networking at the&lt;br/&gt;annual ATBI Conference. Products from the Coleoptera project of the ATBI&lt;br/&gt;will include computer generated identification guides, internet species&lt;br/&gt;profiles, and research publications. Project scientists have estimated that&lt;br/&gt;3000 species will be recorded, representing 105 different beetle families.&lt;br/&gt;Previous work has already documented 25 species new to science and this&lt;br/&gt;number is expected to double during the four-year project. Ultimately, the&lt;br/&gt;beetle fauna of GSMNP will be the best documented in the entire world. The&lt;br/&gt;project is coordinated with Discover Life in America, Inc (DLIA), an&lt;br/&gt;organization devoted to documenting life in U.S. national parks that serves&lt;br/&gt;as a liaison between our team and participating units in the National Parks&lt;br/&gt;Service, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and National Biological Information&lt;br/&gt;Infrastructure (NBII).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Coleoptera project is a significant part of a larger endeavor to assist&lt;br/&gt;national parks and other conservation areas in the development of inventory&lt;br/&gt;methods to compile data about biological diversity. This work is being&lt;br/&gt;conducted under the broad umbrella of the GSMNP ATBI to document all species&lt;br/&gt;within the park. Already, other national parks are implementing the&lt;br/&gt;synergistic model established at GSMNP. Completion of the beetle survey&lt;br/&gt;will serve these broader goals by demonstrating that the single most diverse&lt;br/&gt;group of animals can be successfully documented. Beyond this, parks and&lt;br/&gt;reserves in China and Nepal are closely monitoring this survey in developing&lt;br/&gt;initiatives to save habitats and preserve biodiversity there. The education&lt;br/&gt;components of this project will transfer basic knowledge of the importance&lt;br/&gt;of all living things using beetles as examples to the youth of America&lt;br/&gt;through the classroom and positive interactions with scientists in the&lt;br/&gt;field. Products that will be available through the web have the potential&lt;br/&gt;to teach millions of people about biodiversity and the importance of knowing&lt;br/&gt;and understanding the organisms that share this world with us.</AbstractNarration>
