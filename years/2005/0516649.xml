    <AbstractNarration>The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Eukaryotic mRNA Processing Conference will be held August 24-28, 2005 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. This conference, the fifth in a biennial series, will focus on various aspects of mRNA processing, transport, RNA interference, informatics and turn-over. Major advances have recently been made in these areas, and the conference will be a timely event for discussing the latest unpublished results and exchanging ideas, thereby fostering new developments in this rapidly moving field. A major focus will be on nuclear events in mRNA maturation, particularly mRNA splicing and polyadenylation, but the scope has been expanded to encompass both the impact of the history of an mRNA on its ultimate biological fate, the emerging fields of RNA interference and microRNA function as well as the application of informatics to the analysis of RNA processing. The meeting format will consist of eight plenary sessions and three poster sessions. Speakers in the plenary sessions will be selected on the basis of the submitted abstracts, which will encourage active participation by junior scientists. The main topics covered will include: catalytic mechanisms of mRNA splicing and 3'-end processing; developmental and cell-type specific regulation of gene expression by alternative splicing and polyadenylation; structure and function of snRNP and hnRNP particles; mechanisms of RNA interference and microRNA function; assembly of processing machineries; mRNA transport, decay and localization; and integration of processing with transcription and translation.</AbstractNarration>
