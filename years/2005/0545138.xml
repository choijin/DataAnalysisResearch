<AbstractNarration>This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program to Professor Julia L. Brumaghim of Clemson University is to support the examination of the coordination chemistry of selenium by synthesizing and characterizing iron and copper selenolate complexes.  Current understanding of selenium antioxidant activity focuses on the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, a relatively inert oxygen species. The Brumaghim group has recently discovered a novel mechanism for selenium antioxidant activity that requires metal coordination, and targets the metal ions which produce extremely damaging oxygen radicals.  In order to confirm, study, and understand this new mechanism, they will synthesize and characterize a range of selenium and sulfur complexes with the most common metals in living systems: iron and copper.  They will also examine the reactivity of the copper complexes with oxygen species.  This work will elucidate new principles for the design of selenium drugs and supplements to more effectively treat and prevent diseases caused by oxidative damage, such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer.  In addition to these research goals, the integrated educational goals will update the chemistry curriculum at Clemson University to include a specialization in chemical biology and bioinorganic chemistry at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.  Professor Brumaghim will continue her involvement with the South Carolina DNA Learning Center where outreach activities for K-12 students and their teachers focus on the understanding of DNA and genomics in the high school curriculum.   Both the research and educational aims of this interdisciplinary work will provide outstanding opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to learn coordination and biological chemistry, in keeping with the dynamic character of chemical research.</AbstractNarration>
