<AbstractNarration>AST-0507711&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Georgia State University&lt;br/&gt;PI: Todd Henry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: The RECONS Investigation of the Solar Neighborhood&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Todd Henry, at the Georgia State University, will undertake research under the Research Consortium on Nearby Stars ("RECONS") program.  RECONS has several goals, among them providing a census of stars within 10 parsecs of the Sun, the identification of white dwarfs within 25 parsecs of the Sun, the identification of subdwarfs in the Solar neighborhood, a search for companions to white and red dwarfs, and identification of other nearby stars though proper motion data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary broader impact of the proposed research is in the area of student training in the field of astrometry.  Additionally, a variety of efforts within astronomy will benefit from a census of nearby stars, among them searches for extrasolar planets and searches for dark matter.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
