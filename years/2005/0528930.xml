<AbstractNarration>This grant provides support to the International Conference on Solid-Solid Phase Transformations in Inorganic Materials (PTM2005) to be held May 29 - June 3, 2005, at the Pointe Hilton Resort at Squaw Peak in Phoenix, AZ. The primary goal of the conference is to bring together new and established researchers to discuss foremost emerging research directions related to the fundamental mechanisms and principles governing solid-to-solid phase transformations in materials.  A series of invited papers will be presented at the conference from a diverse group of experts from leading institutions around the world.  Most of these papers are oriented towards a critical comparison of theory and experiment, new experimental approaches and results, or new theoretical developments and paradigms.  All of the NSF funds are used to pay registration or travel expenses for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers to attend the conference, allowing them an opportunity to share their research experience with leading experts in the field. The conference papers will be published in one volume through the conference sponsor, The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society.  This Conference on Solid-to-Solid Phase Transformations in Inorganic Materials, PTM2005, follows the tradition of the International Solid-to-Solid Phase Transformation Conferences held at Carnegie Mellon in 1981, Cambridge University in 1987, Nemacolin Woodlands in 1994 and Kyoto, Japan, in 1999.  Specific goals of the conference are: (a) to discuss current developments in understanding fundamental aspects of solid-to-solid phase transformations in inorganic materials; (b) to provide researchers with a survey of new experimental, mathematical, theoretical and computational techniques applicable to the understanding of solid-to-solid phase transformations; (c) to present critical comparisons between theory and experiment; (d) to compare fundamental aspects of phase transformation in ceramics, metals and minerals; (e) to provide those who are involved in practical applications of phase transformations an opportunity to familiarize themselves with new developments in the field; and (f) to provide a relaxed atmosphere in which scientists can discuss their work with colleagues from many countries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The period since the last PTM Conference has seen an explosion of new experimental and simulation techniques that provide novel descriptions of solid-solid phase transformations, quantification of material structures and observation of transformation phenomena previously unknown. Bringing together leading experts from around the world to discuss these latest developments will elevate the fundamental knowledge in this field to the highest possible technical level. The participation of leading researchers, post-doctoral researchers and graduate students from around the world, combined with the publication of full conference proceedings, will disseminate the latest developments in solid-solid phase transformations worldwide. Use of the NSF funds to support graduate students and post-doctoral researchers assists in the training of highly educated researchers in the important field of phase transformations in materials.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
