<AbstractNarration>The proposed activity will continue the development of a relatively new&lt;br/&gt;area of mathematics in which algebraic topology is used to study moduli&lt;br/&gt;spaces of Riemann surfaces and related objects.  The main result so far in&lt;br/&gt;this area is the solution, by Madsen and Weiss, of a generalization of a&lt;br/&gt;conjecture of Mumford.  This subject lies in the overlap between algebraic&lt;br/&gt;topology and other branches of mathematics, with expected applications in&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, and possibly theoretical physics.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity will further investigate and develop the result of&lt;br/&gt;Madsen and Weiss.  Specifically, the proposed activity will define a&lt;br/&gt;d-dimensional cobordism category C^d and determine the homotopy type of&lt;br/&gt;its classifying space.  This will imply the result of Madsen and Weiss,&lt;br/&gt;but is a much more general result, opening for many new possible&lt;br/&gt;applications.  At the same time, it will be conceptually simpler and&lt;br/&gt;allows for a much simpler proof.  This is one project of the proposal.  &lt;br/&gt;The remaining four proposed projects are related.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theorem of Madsen and Weiss is a very important theorem, that has&lt;br/&gt;already recieved much interest.  It sheds a completely new light on the&lt;br/&gt;moduli spaces M_g of Riemann surfaces of genus g and on the 2-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;cobordism category.  These objects has been studied and used for long&lt;br/&gt;time, and in many different areas of mathematics.  On the other hand it is&lt;br/&gt;clear that the result is not definitive, for example it is restricted to&lt;br/&gt;dimension d=2.  The development of the proper generalization should be of&lt;br/&gt;great interest and importance for algebraic topology as well as for&lt;br/&gt;related fields.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
