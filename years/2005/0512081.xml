<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2005. The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of scientific leadership in US science. To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients.   It is expected that Fellows supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled "RNA gene silencing in plant-virus disease resistance and susceptibility."  RNA gene silencing is a mechanism of gene regulation that determines the outcome of many plant-virus interactions.  The research plan focuses on identifying in plant and viral genomes microRNA genes that direct silencing and the targets of the silencing.  These targets are being tested as novel sources of disease resistance.  The training plan focuses on learning new techniques in plant genomics at the John Innes Centre in England and the skills needed to establish a research program as a university faculty member in the U.S. for the benefit of both U.S. and developing world agriculture.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
