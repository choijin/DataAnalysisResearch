<AbstractNarration>Member institutions of the Alliance for the Production of African American &lt;br/&gt;Ph.D.s in the Mathematical Sciences. (APAAPMS) will carry out several &lt;br/&gt;projects which will lead to an increase in the number of African Americans &lt;br/&gt;who enroll in doctoral programs in the mathematical sciences as well as an &lt;br/&gt;increase in the number of these students who obtain the Ph.D.  The Alliance, &lt;br/&gt;which consists of mathematics departments at four Historically Black &lt;br/&gt;Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) together with departments in the &lt;br/&gt;mathematical sciences at the three Iowa Regents universities, will expand &lt;br/&gt;activities that they are presently undertaking in this area.  The first of &lt;br/&gt;these projects, the Alliance Scholar's Program, identifies eight students at &lt;br/&gt;each participating Alliance HBCU and provides these students with close &lt;br/&gt;mentoring by teams consisting of HBCU and Iowa Regents mathematics faculty. &lt;br/&gt;A second project, the Alliance Summer Research Experience, provides an eight &lt;br/&gt;week intensive research experience for Alliance Scholars as well as for &lt;br/&gt;selected undergraduate mathematics majors from other institutions.  A third &lt;br/&gt;project, the Alliance Curriculum Project, provides for a careful analysis of &lt;br/&gt;the similarities and differences of undergraduate mathematics courses taught &lt;br/&gt;at participating institutions with an eye toward building seamless &lt;br/&gt;transitions between undergraduate mathematics programs at Alliance HBCUs and &lt;br/&gt;doctoral programs at majority institutions.  A fourth project, the Alliance &lt;br/&gt;High School Math Circle, involves Alliance Scholars in outreach activities &lt;br/&gt;in the communities in which their schools are located.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) enroll approximately &lt;br/&gt;20% of all African Americans who attend four year undergraduate &lt;br/&gt;institutions; they account for approximately 30% of all African Americans &lt;br/&gt;who graduate from these institutions.  Yet, with the exception of three or &lt;br/&gt;four elite HBCUs with an established tradition of excellence, it is &lt;br/&gt;extremely rare for graduates of HBCUs to enroll in doctoral programs in the &lt;br/&gt;mathematical sciences or, indeed, in any doctoral program which leads to a &lt;br/&gt;position in the professoriate.  The reason for this is not hard to &lt;br/&gt;ascertain: in fact, with few exceptions, African Americans were simply not &lt;br/&gt;welcome among the ranks of the professoriate until quite recently.  As a &lt;br/&gt;result, HBCUs have tended to focus on producing professionals - doctors, &lt;br/&gt;lawyers, teachers and religious leaders who have historically provided &lt;br/&gt;critical infrastructure to a community at risk due to segregation and overt &lt;br/&gt;discrimination.   Less than 2% of all Ph.D. in mathematics awarded at US &lt;br/&gt;universities each year are awarded to African Americans, a percentage that &lt;br/&gt;has remained more or less stable over the last twenty five years.  It is the &lt;br/&gt;goal of this project to ease the transition to graduate programs in &lt;br/&gt;mathematics for students attending HBCUs with an eye toward improving these &lt;br/&gt;numbers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

(Please see www.mathalliance.org for further information about the Alliance.)  The Alliance has grown rapidly. There are presently approximately 150 Alliance Predoctoral Mentors representing more than 85 departments nationally and approximately 500 past and present Alliance Predoctoral Scholars, almost all of whom come from US minority groups that have been historically underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.  The number of these students who have earned a BS in a math science has increased each year, approximately 150 students having received this degree in 2011.  Our surveys show that the great majority of these students are now in graduate school.  During its early years, the Alliance concentrated on the transition  from undergraduate school to masters and doctoral programs. As the number of students who were ready for this transition grew, the Alliance began to work with math sciences graduate faculty nationally to build Alliance Graduate Program Groups (GPGÆs): groups of faculty at math sciences graduate programs that have committed themselves to the best practices and community building which has been the hallmark of the Alliance.  Twenty math sciences graduate programs nationally have formed Graduate Program Groups and several more have applied to do so.  At least fifteen former Alliance Undergraduate Scholars have earned doctoral degrees in a mathematic science so far; we expect this number to increase rapidly over the coming years.  In 2009, several highly successful programs serving students from backgrounds underrepresented in the math sciences...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
