<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST 0552387&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI, Dr. Yervant Terzian, will head the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site program at Cornell University.  This is an eight-week summer program for student/mentor research in radio, radar, infrared, and optical astronomy on topics ranging from the solar system to the large-scale structure of the universe.  The students will mix with other summer program attendees at Cornell, take part in summer activities within the Space Sciences Department, attend a bi-weekly summer lecture series on various Astronomical topics, and will present their findings at a Summer Student Research Seminar.  Students may also accompany their mentors on trips to facilities such as Arecibo Observatory, Kitt Peak National Observatory, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (Green Bank), or Mt. Palomar.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program to-date has served a range of students, some of whom go on to careers in astronomy, and some of whom find that the experience sets them on a different career path, yet one that is well served by involvement in the REU program.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
