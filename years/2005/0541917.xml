<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0541917&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  David Fisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research lies between dynamical systems and&lt;br/&gt;geometry. Work of Furstenberg, Mostow, Margulis and others shows&lt;br/&gt;that certain dynamical systems are an important tool for studying&lt;br/&gt;geometric properties of important geometric spaces, particularly&lt;br/&gt;symmetric and locally symmetric spaces. . One important property&lt;br/&gt;of symmetric spaces is that they have non-positive curvature. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator plans to extend this work in several inter-related&lt;br/&gt;directions. The study of symmetric spaces will be generalized to&lt;br/&gt;include more general spaces of non-positive curvature as well as&lt;br/&gt;more general maps between spaces with an emphasis on infinite&lt;br/&gt;dimensional spaces.  The investigator will attempt to exploit&lt;br/&gt;these relationships to prove long-standing conjectures of&lt;br/&gt;Zimmer. The group of diffeomorphisms of a compact manifold acts&lt;br/&gt;on the space of square-integrable Riemannian metrics, which is&lt;br/&gt;naturally an infinite-dimensional space of non-positive&lt;br/&gt;curvature.  In previous work the PI has extensively studied&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of certain groups acting on ``flat" infinite dimensional&lt;br/&gt;spaces, and some present work can be viewed as generalizing those&lt;br/&gt;result to spaces that have curvature. Typically if one is a&lt;br/&gt;perturbing a dynamical system one already understands, the study&lt;br/&gt;of nearby dynamical systems can be reduced to properties of a&lt;br/&gt;flat infinite dimensional space. However, if one wants to&lt;br/&gt;classify dynamical systems which one does not assume are&lt;br/&gt;perturbations of ones that are well-understood, one is forced in&lt;br/&gt;a space that has curvature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamical systems is a young and important field of mathematics&lt;br/&gt;that investigates the evolution of physical or mathematical&lt;br/&gt;systems over time (e.g. fluid flow) while differential geometry&lt;br/&gt;is a more classical field that tends to study static&lt;br/&gt;configurations of curves and shapes in space. New ideas from&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems theory such as chaos and fractals have had a&lt;br/&gt;profound impact on our perception of the world. One of the&lt;br/&gt;deepest and most influential mathematical applications of&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems has been to the study of geometric properties&lt;br/&gt;of spaces with "many symmetries". The PI's research can be viewed&lt;br/&gt;as part of a general development in modern mathematics in which&lt;br/&gt;ideas from dynamics and differential geometry interact to lead to&lt;br/&gt;both proofs of old conjectures and exciting new discoveries. A&lt;br/&gt;key idea that appears repeatedly is that spaces that possess many&lt;br/&gt;symmetries must actually be homogeneous, i.e. any space with&lt;br/&gt;enough symmetry actually looks the same at every point. The PI's&lt;br/&gt;work on these topics has relationships with diverse areas of&lt;br/&gt;research including computer science (expander graphs and property&lt;br/&gt;(T) of Kazhdan) and celestial mechanics (KAM theory and stability&lt;br/&gt;of the solar system).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
