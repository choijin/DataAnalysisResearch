<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project, jointly supported by Molecular Biophysics in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, is to gain an understanding of how inter-residue interactions determine the three-dimensional structure of a globular protein and the pathways from the unfolded polypeptide chain to the final folded conformation.  For such an understanding, use is made of a physics-based approach, i.e. one based solely on the global optimization of a potential energy function (including the role of the solvent), without the use of secondary-structure predictions, homology modeling, threading, etc.  Such an approach requires both a reliable potential function and an efficient procedure for global optimization; this project is concerned with the development and improvement of the required empirical potential function.  Initially, a united-residue (UNRES) potential function is used.  UNRES will be improved by crystal calculations, with inclusion of entropy.  Then the refined UNRES potential function will be converted to an all-atom treatment by Z-score optimization of the all-atom potential function with inclusion of hydration.  The UNRES potential function is being improved by generating decoys with Langevin dynamics and incorporating entropy efforts, using a hierarchical optimization procedure.  The all-atom potential function (including a Generalized-Born solvation model) will be improved by the same hierarchical optimization procedure used to improve the UNRES potential function.  The search procedures will be carried out by improvement of a Conformational Space Annealing (CSA) method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide a basic understanding of the role of the inter-residue interactions that determine the conformational and folding properties of proteins, and will provide training, not only for the two co-workers carrying out this research, but also for several postdocs and graduate students working together with these co-workers.  Also, as was done during the current project period (when members of the group participated in outreach career exploration by 8th and 9th grade students from schools across New York State), graduate student and postdoc members of the group will participate in the Expanding Your Horizons in Math, Science, and Engineering program of Cornell University for primary school students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Scheraga  Disclaimer:       This Project Outcomes Report for the General Public is displayed verbatim as submitted by the Principal Investigator (PI) of this award.  Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this Report are those of the PI and do not necessarily reflect the view of the National Science Foundation (NSF).  NSF has not approved or endorsed its content.  NSF Research Grant 0541633, expired 04/30/2012.  Theoretical Studies of Protein Folding.  Carried out for five years at Cornell University.  Protein folding is a very important process in modern biology.  If a protein does not fold properly, i.e., does not attain its proper three-dimensional arrangement of its constituent amino acids, then it cannot perform its proper biological function, often leading to genetic diseases.  This project is devoted mainly to identify the physical forces that enable a chain of amino acids to fold into the biological active form of the resulting protein.  During the five years of this project, much information was obtained about the nature of these physical forces and how they interact with each other to fold the protein.  A computer program has been developed and enhanced to carry out the necessary mathematical steps to make use of these interacting forces.  The ultimate goal of this research is to apply this computer program to various important biological molecules, e.g., to one called ABeta which is responsible for Alzheimer's disease.  During the period of this grant, my research group has engaged in various outreach activities, such as working during the summers with high school chemistry teachers to develop a module to provide such teachers with content background and materials to carry out the learned activity in their classrooms.
