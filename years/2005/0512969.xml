<AbstractNarration>The PI proposes to develop and rigorously analyze new efficient and&lt;br/&gt;high-order accurate integral equation methods for acoustic scattering in&lt;br/&gt;two and three dimensions, with the longer-range goal of developing methods&lt;br/&gt;for full electromagnetic scattering (by inhomogeneous and even anisotropic&lt;br/&gt;media) in three dimensions.  These methods combine an existing FFT-based&lt;br/&gt;method for integrating over smooth regions of the inhomogeneity, with an&lt;br/&gt;accelerated, high-order accurate integration scheme, for small regions&lt;br/&gt;near scatterer discontinuities.  The PI also proposes to develop&lt;br/&gt;preconditioning strategies through two distinct lines of investigation:&lt;br/&gt;(1) preconditioning by means of a perturbation expansion about a simple,&lt;br/&gt;piecewise-constant, radially layered inhomogeneity and (2) preconditioning&lt;br/&gt;by means of the infinite frequency limit of the problem, i.e., geometrical&lt;br/&gt;optics.  To pursue a preconditioner based on geometrical optics, an&lt;br/&gt;effective method for computing the multi-valued solution to the eikonal&lt;br/&gt;equation in inhomogeneous media (capturing the reflection and refraction&lt;br/&gt;at discontinuous interfaces) will be developed by building on a recently&lt;br/&gt;developed phase-space-based level set method, which combines a spectral&lt;br/&gt;representation in the phase variables with a discontinuous Galerkin&lt;br/&gt;finite-element discretization in the spatial variables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of numerical methods to evaluate the scattering of waves by&lt;br/&gt;complex material structures plays an important role in an enormous range&lt;br/&gt;of scientific and engineering technologies.  Examples include radar and&lt;br/&gt;remote sensing, medical and biological imaging (e.g., CT-scans,&lt;br/&gt;ultrasound), laser-plasma interactions (e.g., in laser-driven fusion),&lt;br/&gt;photonic crystal design, nondestructive testing, neutron and electron&lt;br/&gt;diffraction, and exploration seismology.  At the same time, the ever&lt;br/&gt;increasing size and complexity of material structures of practical&lt;br/&gt;interest place many problems beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art&lt;br/&gt;computational methods, thus requiring new and innovative mathematical&lt;br/&gt;approaches.  The PI proposes to develop new efficient and highly accurate&lt;br/&gt;computational methods for such problems to enable the treatment of larger&lt;br/&gt;and more complex scattering structures.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
