<AbstractNarration>Geology (42) As part of a new degree program, this project is developing three new courses in planetary science.  The project is adapting a series of exemplary instructional practices from the literatures on geoscience, physics, and astronomy education.  The first course is an inquiry-based introductory course in planetary science, in which students will collect spectral data on local rock units using hand-held reflectance spectrometers, and conduct spectroscopic measurements by telescope. The second course focuses on the petrologic study of meteorites, lunar samples, and terrestrial rocks.  The third course is an upper-level offering on the spectroscopy of the planets, that makes in-depth use of tools introduced in the two previous courses.  The project assessment plan tracks student academic performance in the new courses, as well as their performance in the upper-level courses in physics and geology that follow them.  Student recruitment and retention in astronomy and geology degree programs, as well as in the new planetary program, are also being measured.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in the crossing of boundaries between geology, physics, and astronomy, as a means of bringing students to these disciplines.  These courses are modeling successful teaching practices, and inspire students to undertake further study in related fields.  The broader impact of this project lies in bringing female students into these three STEM fields, where women are under-represented.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
