<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0505778&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Richard Hind&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will conduct research in symplectic and complex&lt;br/&gt;geometry. Topics in symplectic geometry aim to both apply and&lt;br/&gt;extend the ideas and theorems of the Symplectic Field Theory as&lt;br/&gt;developed by Eliashberg, Givental and Hofer. The main application&lt;br/&gt;so far is to the classification up to Hamiltonian diffeomorphism&lt;br/&gt;of Lagrangian spheres in symplectic 4-manifolds, there is ongoing&lt;br/&gt;work aimed at establishing similar results for higher genus&lt;br/&gt;surfaces. In symplectic topology such classification results at&lt;br/&gt;present only exist in dimension 4. Nevertheless the proposal will&lt;br/&gt;also strive to increase our understanding of higher dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;One route to such an understanding is provided by work of&lt;br/&gt;Donaldson showing that, after a blowing-up operation, every&lt;br/&gt;integral symplectic 6-manifold can be realized as a Lefschetz&lt;br/&gt;fibration in which the fibers are symplectic 4-manifolds and the&lt;br/&gt;vanishing cycles Lagrangian spheres. Regarding the underlying&lt;br/&gt;theory, Symplectic Field Theory allows us to split a symplectic&lt;br/&gt;manifold along a hypersurface and apply holomorphic curve methods&lt;br/&gt;to study each part separately. This is a very powerful idea, the&lt;br/&gt;results above rely heavily upon it, but it is fundamentally&lt;br/&gt;limited in that it may not be possible to split a symplectic&lt;br/&gt;manifold along such hypersurfaces into pieces which are&lt;br/&gt;sufficiently small to be completely understood. Therefore the&lt;br/&gt;proposal will also work to generalize the Symplectic Field Theory&lt;br/&gt;to allow more general splittings, for example along hypersurfaces&lt;br/&gt;with corners. In complex geometry the proposal plans to continue&lt;br/&gt;work of Burns and Hind studying complex manifolds canonically&lt;br/&gt;associated to real analytic Riemannian manifolds, focussing&lt;br/&gt;especially on the case when the Riemannian manifold is a&lt;br/&gt;symmetric space of the noncompact type. Then we have a class of&lt;br/&gt;complex manifolds which gives a nice generalization of the&lt;br/&gt;classical bounded symmetric domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic geometry originated as the modern mathematical&lt;br/&gt;language of classical and quantum mechanics. This proposal will&lt;br/&gt;address basic mathematical problems in the area, in particular it&lt;br/&gt;will apply and extend the powerful new techniques known as&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic Field Theory. The Symplectic Field Theory is an&lt;br/&gt;exciting new development which promises to help us move rapidly&lt;br/&gt;towards our goal of describing the global nature of symplectic&lt;br/&gt;manifolds and Hamiltonian systems. As the problems are global in&lt;br/&gt;nature often they initially appear intractible, but the new&lt;br/&gt;methods offer the prospect of breaking down our analysis into&lt;br/&gt;more manageable local pieces. Eventually it should be possible to&lt;br/&gt;develop algorithms to solve typical problems in symplectic&lt;br/&gt;geometry. This will have immediate applications to theoretical&lt;br/&gt;physics and dynamical systems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
