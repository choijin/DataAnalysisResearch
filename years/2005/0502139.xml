    <AbstractNarration>0502139&lt;br/&gt;Tully&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a twenty-two-month research fellowship by Dr. Sarah E. Tully to work with Dr. Pauline M. Rudd at Oxford University in the United Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most successful vaccines utilize the power of neutralizing antibodies to elicit their effects. Development of such a vaccine for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been hampered due to the ability of envelope protein carbohydrates to protect the peptide backbone from antibody recognition. Recently, human antibody 2G12, an antibody that neutralizes a broad range of HIV-1 isolates, was found to recognize a cluster of carbohydrate moieties on the envelope protein. Generation of a library of glycoproteins similar to the 2G12 antibody would enable the development of different antibodies for HIV-1 vaccine formulations. To create such a library, the PI and her host are developing a convergent synthetic approach for the production of N-linked glycoproteins. Their methodology will have broad-based utility such that glycans, derived from chemical synthesis or from purified glycoprotein hydrolysates, can be attached without protecting groups to a synthetic peptide sequence in water with establishment of the correct b-aspartyl amide linkage present in N-linked glycoproteins. They will then explore the utility of their synthetic approach by constructing a glycoprotein library expressing two mannose-rich glycan structures in spatially-resolved loci as a model for the epitope of 2G12 and as an antigen for the generation of anibodies with similar activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Rudd's laboratory has established numerous international research collaborations with some of the best laboratories in glycobiology.</AbstractNarration>
