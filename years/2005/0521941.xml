<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;---------------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is intended for potential principal investigators who may submit proposals to the Division of Civil &amp; Mechanical Systems' (CMS) Infrastructure &amp; Information Systems (IIS) Program to discuss issues of research &amp; education within an informal setting in conjunction with the 2005 ASCE Construction Research Congress.  Workshop participants register the night prior where they are assigned to a working group and receive a "mock" research proposal; participants review the proposal before the workshop begins.  The workshop commences during lunch the following day with introductory remarks and two keynote presentations: the first about research methodology and validation and the second about integrating research into education.  Then, workshop participants break into their working groups to evaluate and report on the effectiveness of the "mock" research proposal.  Specifically, participants are asked to provide suggestions on how the "mock" proposal could be improved based on the information provided by the keynote speakers, the participant's own ideas and/or the discussions within the working groups.  The working group sessions are conducted much like an NSF review panel.  The workshop concludes with a general panel discussion about the strengths and weaknesses of the mock proposal. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The main goals of the proposed activity are: (1) to identify, invite, and bring together a select multi-disciplinary group of academic experts, which expertise fall within ISS' mission, and (2) to create alignment between the IIS' academic community around research methodology and the integration of research and education. From an intellectual merit perspective, this workshop  is designed to engage in a meaningful and focused dialogue, and also, in a unique, integrated, and holistic way, the IIS's academic community of experts from multiple disciplines that normally do not have many opportunities within which to interact with each other. From a broader impact perspective, this project engages actively the academic community served by the Civil and Mechanical Systems' (CMS) Infrastructure &amp; Information Systems (IIS) Program. This active engagement of the academic community will enhance and strengthen undoubtedly the infrastructure for research and education in the knowledge domains addressed within the IIS program.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
