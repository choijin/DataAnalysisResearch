<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator (PI) proposes to develop a science program that integrated the ground based instrumentation and observing facilities of San Fernando Observatory (SFO) with those of National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) and the Solar-B spacecraft (to be deployed in 2006). This program would be integrated into the curriculum of the California State University-Northridge (CSUN) Department of Physics and Astronomy to spur interest in experimental astronomy among undergraduate and graduate students. The proposer also plans to make multi-height magnetic field measurements of emerging sunspots, as well as near-simultaneous deep photospheric and chromospheric magnetic field observations of solar active regions, with Solar-B, the refurbished SFO spectroheliograph, and similar instruments at NAOJ. The ground based, high sensitivity near-infrared (NIR) measurements at SFO and NAOJ would complement the higher spatial resolution observations of Solar-B. As a part of longer-term program, the PI intends to collaborate with the NSF's Advanced Technology Solar Telescope project upon its completion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses the problem of diminishing manpower in the fields of experimental solar physics and astronomy by exposing undergraduate students to state-of-the-art observational solar physics near the beginning of their careers, motivating their further academic pursuits. The international collaboration would also contribute to the development of a long-term curriculum for experimental astronomy. This effort will play a vital role in enhancing astronomical education in the United States while furthering our understanding of fundamental problems in solar physics, from coronal heating to space-weather prediction. This project will lay a robust foundation for research and education in the field of experimental astronomy while engaging undergraduate and graduate students in active research.</AbstractNarration>
