<AbstractNarration>SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AMONG NON-SCIENTISTS:&lt;br/&gt;SOURCES ON MEDIEVAL WOMEN&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exploratory research will determine the feasibility of a new, major project on the&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of scientific knowledge in the Middle Ages. The theoretical and historical basis of&lt;br/&gt;the research has been established; funding is sought to survey the extent of accessible empirical&lt;br/&gt;evidence.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;As the basis for a comparative study of men's and women's familiarity with scientific and&lt;br/&gt;medical concepts from the ninth through the fifteenth centuries, the research will identify texts&lt;br/&gt;written by women that contain references to or discussions of learned concepts about the natural&lt;br/&gt;world. The exploratory research will permit preliminary mapping (in space, time, social locus,&lt;br/&gt;and scientific discipline) of women's knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;The project draws upon a significant literature concerning 1) natural philosophy and&lt;br/&gt;theoretical medicine produced by men; and 2) the participation of women in other domains of&lt;br/&gt;medieval society and culture. It will establish a primary source base from which to examine the&lt;br/&gt;scientific literacy of medieval women and the ways in which they deployed their knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;If the proposed research is successful, it will lay the foundation for innovation concerning&lt;br/&gt;gender and the command of systematic knowledge about nature. It will thus contribute to the&lt;br/&gt;history of science, as well as to medieval studies and women's/gender studies, It will have&lt;br/&gt;implications for the place of science in medieval culture, and, more generally, for the study of&lt;br/&gt;public awareness of scientific ideas. In addition, the study will provide historical context for a&lt;br/&gt;broad range of studies relating to gender in scientific education and scientific personnel.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is time-sensitive, because of the PI's research schedule and the availability&lt;br/&gt;of a graduate student Research Assistant with the appropriate skills and expertise.</AbstractNarration>
