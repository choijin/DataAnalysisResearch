    <AbstractNarration>This conference will be the 10th biennial meeting on Eukaryotic DNA Replication. It is the only regularly occurring meeting that is exclusively focused on eukaryotic DNA replication. Because of this focus, the meeting has played a major role in the rapid growth in the understanding of the eukaryotic DNA replication process and how it is integrated into the cell division cycle. The 2005 meeting will include a diverse array of topics including studies of: (1)chromosomal replication and gene amplification in organisms as diverse as yeast,Drosophila, Xenopus and mammalian cells; (2) the replication of virus chromosomes, including SV40, polyomavirus, cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus, papillomaviruses, and Epstein-Barr virus; (3) control of DNA replication in the cell cycle; (4) structure and function of chromosomal elements such as origins of replication and telomeres; and (5)connections between the DNA replication machinery and other critical cell cycle events; (6) DNA replication checkpoints and DNA repair. The format of the meeting will ensure that recent results will be communicated and discussed in an atmosphere of face-to-face contact, which can enhance progress and collaboration. The participation of young investigators and minority and women scientists will be encouraged. The organizers will use the funds from NSF to defray the attendance costs for junior, women, and minority scientists at the conference.</AbstractNarration>
