<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a seismological study of the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains (GSM), a Texas-sized mountain range buried beneath the ice sheets of East Antarctica. The project will perform a passive seismic experiment deploying twenty-three seismic stations over the GSM to characterize the structure of the crust and upper mantle, and determine the processes driving uplift. The outcomes will also offer constraints on the terrestrial heat flux, a key variable in modeling ice sheet formation and behavior. Virtually unexplored, the GSM represents the largest unstudied area of crustal uplift on earth. As well, the region is the starting point for growth of the Antarctic ice sheets. &lt;br/&gt;Because of these outstanding questions, the GSM has been identified by the international Antarctic science community as a research focus for the International Polar Year (2007-2009). In addition to this seismic experiment, NSF is also supporting an aerogeophysical survey of the GSM under award number 0632292. Major international partners in the project include Germany, China, Australia, and the United Kingdom. For more information see IPY Project #67 at IPY.org. In terms of broader impacts, this project also supports postdoctoral and graduate student research, and various forms of outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project was to image the seismic structure of the crust and upper mantle beneath the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains in East Antarctica to test models for the origin of the mountain range.  Proposed models include a hotspot, a collisional mountain belt, and a region of the broad East Antarctic Plateau capped with erosion-resistant rock.  A 26-station network of broadband seismic stations was deployed between 2008 and 2011.  Twelve of the stations were arranged in a 900 km long linear array as a continuation of the TAMSEIS N-S array.  Six stations were arranged in a second 550 km long linear array intersecting the first array, and an additional eight stations were installed between the two linear arrays to improve 3-D coverage.  The data obtain are of high quality and have been analyzed and modeled in many ways to image crust and upper mantle structure.  A 5-10 km thick crustal root was imaged under the mountain range, and it was also found that the upper mantle is characterized by fast velocities.  The fast velocities indicate that there is no hotspot activity in the mantle beneath the mountain range.  The fast upper mantle structure is also not consistent with recently proposed models invoking a Permian/Cretaceous rift system as the cause of the uplift. These findings point to a Precambrian origin for the high topography of the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains, as well as the crustal root, corroborating other studies invoking a long-lived highland landscape in central East Antarctica that has experienced very low erosion rates. The longevity of the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains makes them geologically unusual.  The data from this project are openly avaialbe via the IRIS data management center.
