<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL EXPLANATION&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to synthesize novel one-dimensional nanomaterials based on technologically and fundamentally important rare earth sulfides, such as ferromagnetic semiconducting europium sulfide (EuS) and intermediate valence metal samarium sulfide (SmS), and study their unique physical properties. These chemically synthesized single crystalline nanomaterials would enable both potential applications in spintronics and fundamental physical studies in nanoscale structures with highly correlated electrons. Taking a multidisciplinary approach, the PI and his co-workers will develop organometallic precursors to synthesize uniform or mixed rare earth sulfide nanowires by chemical vapor deposition, characterize the nanoscale structures and physical properties of the resulting nanomaterials using a variety of techniques in order to understand the synthesis-structure-property relationship. They will further investigate the relationship between ferromagnetism and semiconductivity of EuS nanowires and examine the size evolution of the fundamental properties. The PI also proposes to build an integrated educational program in materials chemistry by developing a graduate level course in nanomaterials chemistry, by encouraging and incorporating minority and underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in scientific research, and by collaboratively developing a Web based course on nanoscience and nanotechnology for high school teachers so that teachers can have the toolbox needed to incorporate elements of cutting edge science and technology into their curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION&lt;br/&gt;Nanometer scale wires (nanowires) that are made of technologically useful and fundamentally important rare earth sulfide materials will be created, and their unique physical properties will be investigated for a variety of potential applications, such as the next generation nanoscale spin electronic ("spintronic") and magento-optical information storage devices. Despite the interesting combination of magnetic and semiconducting properties that rare earth sulfide materials possess, materials issues remain to be addressed. This interdisciplinary research proposal will lay the scientific foundation to enable the creation and understanding of these high quality nanoscale materials.  Furthermore, an integrated educational program in materials chemistry will be built by developing a new graduate level course in nanomaterials chemistry, by encouraging and incorporating minority and underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in cutting edge scientific research, and by collaboratively developing the first Web based course on nanoscience and nanotechnology for high school teachers so that teachers can have the toolbox needed to incorporate elements of cutting edge science and technology into their curriculum. All of these will stimulate and engage the interest of students in science and technology and help to prepare the new generation of scientific and technological workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
