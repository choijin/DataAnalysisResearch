<AbstractNarration>This award will support the study of beam dynamics problems in space-charge dominated beams in low-energy high intensity synchrotrons, beam detection and manipulation techniques including beam cooling feedback correction, in high brightness storage rings, and development of a photocathode code. In collaboration with scientists in national laboratories, we will carry out experimental and theoretical studies on beam dynamics at various accelerators in order to increase intensity for nuclear and particle physics experiments. These proposed research topics are important to nuclear and particle physics research using high brightness particle beams. The proposed research is also important in training accelerator physics graduate and undergraduate students. Many accelerator scientists have graduated from Indiana University. These scientists have become leading accelerator physicists in national laboratories.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topics of our research have intellectual merit in providing physics models to understand phenomena such as chaos, strange and limiting cycle attractors, and bifurcation characteristics of nonlinear beam dynamics with beam cooling. The advanced beam manipulation and detection can provide better understanding in data handling and analysis for a broader community in science and technology. These results have been employed to control and alleviate collective beam instabilities in high intensity storage rings, and to achieve better understanding on the instability in plasma physics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our experimental and theoretical research results also have broader impact in providing improved beam quality, better design criterion for power supply ripple in high energy colliders, new methods for emittance preservation of high brightness beams, better design of compact medical synchrotrons, physics understanding of high gain free electron lasers, etc. Some applications of high brightness beams are radioactive ion-beam accelerators, spallation neutron sources, heavy ion fusion, biochemistry and bio-medical, material science, improved medical treatment, and defense research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
