<AbstractNarration>0506116&lt;br/&gt;Soboyejo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:  This project supports a collaborative research between Dr. Winston Soboyejo, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Princeton University and Dr. Mona Marei, College of Dentistry, Alexandria, Egypt.  They plan to conduct studies on the fabrication and characterization of titanium implants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  Recent research in implants and osseointegration suggests many avenues for improvement in dental screw design; this study will investigate the fabrication, design, and characterization of novel screw surfaces, and quantify the effects on osseointegration.  The RGD peptide will be chemically bonded to Laser-LokTM (BioLok International Inc.) dental screws containing laser-grooves (8 and 12 micrmeter width) via a novel self-assembly technique. This effort will combine the positive effects that the laser-grooved and the RGD-functionalized surfaces have both shown individually toward cellular adhesion and attachment.  In parallel, a screw will be designed to accommodate a PLGA polymer scaffold permitting mechanical fixation at the interface of the polymer scaffold and titanium screw. Successful fabrication through methods of casting, CNC cutting, and finalizing with surface treatments will produce a highly precise implant in the desired shape. The designed screws and surfaces will be tested in an animal model, and its material properties analyzed, as well as SEM imaging and IR analysis. All samples will be examined to quantify the level of osseointegration via radiograph images, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) for BMD calculations, histomorphometry, and microhardness/nanohardness testing. Additional analysis of the microchemistry will include SEM imaging and EDS to reveal calcium concentrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  The project involves development of materials that are of important application in the health field.  It also involves training of an undergraduate student at Princeton University. The project will develop collaboration in the field of bio and surface modification of materials.  Proper understanding of the titanium implants will be achieved through this program. Exchange of student knowledge is one of the strength in the proposal. The research results will be integrated into the PI's teaching and educational activities. This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
