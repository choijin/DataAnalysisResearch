<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0506737&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Thomas Mark, Scott J. Baldridge, Terry Lawson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal funds a conference in honor of Professor Ronald&lt;br/&gt;Fintushel's sixtieth birthday, to be held in late October or November&lt;br/&gt;2005 at Tulane University. Dr. Fintushel has led a distinguished&lt;br/&gt;career as a researcher in low-dimensional topology, particularly the&lt;br/&gt;differential topology of 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds and&lt;br/&gt;applications of gauge theory to that study. His work with various&lt;br/&gt;co-authors on group actions on low-dimensional manifolds, and more&lt;br/&gt;recent results with Ronald Stern on the homology cobordism group of&lt;br/&gt;homology 3-spheres, gauge theory, and constructions of ``exotic''&lt;br/&gt;4-manifolds, has been an inspiration to contemporary topologists and&lt;br/&gt;continues to provide new directions for inquiry in these areas. The&lt;br/&gt;past two decades have been a period of remarkable progress in&lt;br/&gt;low-dimensional topology, particularly the theory of smooth&lt;br/&gt;4-manifolds. This conference, involving leading figures in this area,&lt;br/&gt;will provide participants with both a context in which to understand&lt;br/&gt;recent advances and a framework for future endeavors. The speakers&lt;br/&gt;will include experts in fields that Fintushel has contributed to, with&lt;br/&gt;a focus on smooth 4-manifolds, and the audience will include graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and recent Ph.D.'s who will benefit from exposure to&lt;br/&gt;Fintushel's fascinating and creative work. Both Ronald Stern (UC&lt;br/&gt;Irvine) and Peter Ozsvath (Columbia) have already expressed interest&lt;br/&gt;in giving lectures; other invited speakers may include John Morgan&lt;br/&gt;(Columbia), Tomasz Mrowka (MIT), Allan Edmonds (Indiana), Danny&lt;br/&gt;Ruberman (Brandeis), Zoltan Szabo (Princeton), and Clifford Taubes&lt;br/&gt;(Harvard). The final schedule will be determined closer to the time of&lt;br/&gt;the conference in consultation with Dr. Fintushel; the influence of&lt;br/&gt;the guest of honor can often sway the balance in a speaker's decision&lt;br/&gt;to attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a conference in honor of an individual, the lectures will naturally&lt;br/&gt;center on those areas of research most influenced by that&lt;br/&gt;individual. Dr. Fintushel has made many contributions to an area of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics that has relatively recently become a crossroads among&lt;br/&gt;disciplines, both within mathematics and in theoretical&lt;br/&gt;physics. Conferences such as this are therefore increasingly&lt;br/&gt;important, providing researchers with a variety of perspectives on&lt;br/&gt;problems that are nevertheless united by common themes. As a joint&lt;br/&gt;project of Tulane University, Southeastern Louisiana University, and&lt;br/&gt;Louisiana State University, this conference will provide exposure for&lt;br/&gt;these mathematics departments on a national level and boost the&lt;br/&gt;reputation of the region as a center of research. This will increase&lt;br/&gt;the potential for the universities in this area to attract more&lt;br/&gt;high-quality faculty and students from around the country. Likewise,&lt;br/&gt;the conference will enhance the exposure of local current graduate&lt;br/&gt;students to the latest developments in research and to the researchers&lt;br/&gt;themselves.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
