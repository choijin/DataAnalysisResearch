<AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to use autonomous airships as a mobile cell phone network for&lt;br/&gt;temporary communication restoration in the case of large-scale disasters such as a flood,&lt;br/&gt;earthquake, hurricane, or terrorist attack. The Nonlinear Control Research Laboratory&lt;br/&gt;(NCRL) will study attitude and formation control of the airships when used in a cell&lt;br/&gt;phone network along with the necessary equipment and technologies needed to convert a&lt;br/&gt;group of airship to a mobile cell phone network.&lt;br/&gt;The NCRL is currently developing the mathematical model of a candidate airship&lt;br/&gt;along with the simulation environment for formation control research. This mathematical&lt;br/&gt;model is based on flight test data that was generated using the Gait Analysis and&lt;br/&gt;Innovative Technologies Laboratory. The research being proposed in this project will&lt;br/&gt;encompass three tasks that will extend our current research effort over a one-year period,&lt;br/&gt;1. Modeling and Airship Design&lt;br/&gt;2. Formation Control and Attitude Stability Design Airship implementation and&lt;br/&gt;validation&lt;br/&gt;3. Cell Phone Network Simulation and Small-scale implementation&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Upon accomplishing the objectives of the present research,&lt;br/&gt;significant advances will be made in the understanding of autonomous airship control&lt;br/&gt;using model predictive control techniques while configured to operate as a temporary&lt;br/&gt;mobile cell phone network. The use of model predictive control for aerodynamics is a&lt;br/&gt;new area of research due to the fast dynamics encountered on aircraft. The results of our&lt;br/&gt;research will make significant advances in applying model predictive control to the&lt;br/&gt;problem of autonomous airships and in aerodynamics in general.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact Statement: The following are the broader impact to society that this&lt;br/&gt;research would bring to society: 1) The implementation of an autonomous airship cell&lt;br/&gt;phone network will allow for the temporary restoration in an area that has suffered&lt;br/&gt;damage to its communication infrastructure. 2) Control and stability issues will be&lt;br/&gt;addressed which will have wide-ranging applications in the area of autonomous vehicles&lt;br/&gt;that are operating in a cooperative formation. 3) The proposed study will help train and&lt;br/&gt;support undergraduate students whose research interest is focused mainly on autonomous&lt;br/&gt;airships. 4) The results of this study will be disseminated through presentations at&lt;br/&gt;national and international conferences and publications in peer-reviewed journals.</AbstractNarration>
