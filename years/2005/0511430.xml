<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is the development and analysis of least-squares&lt;br/&gt;methods for partial differential equations (PDEs) arising from applications&lt;br/&gt;in fluid and solid mechanics.  These systems are naturally nonlinear and&lt;br/&gt;numerical simulation is typically difficult and expensive.  The&lt;br/&gt;least-squares finite element method is a powerful tool for many PDE-based&lt;br/&gt;applications in science and engineering.  One of the main characteristics&lt;br/&gt;of a least-squares formulation is that it transforms a given set of&lt;br/&gt;equations into a loosely coupled system of scalar equations that can be&lt;br/&gt;treated easily by multilevel finite element methods.  The finite element&lt;br/&gt;spaces for the individual unknowns may be chosen independently, based on&lt;br/&gt;simplicity and availability or from the physics of the underlying problem.&lt;br/&gt;The linear systems of equations resulting from well-posed least-squares&lt;br/&gt;discretizations are always self-adjoint and positive definite, and&lt;br/&gt;variational multigrid methods generally provide a robust, scalable solver.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the associated functional itself provides a natural sharp&lt;br/&gt;local error estimator, which can be used for effective adaptive mesh&lt;br/&gt;refinement.  Coupling nested iteration and Newton linearization with a&lt;br/&gt;least-squares discretization and multigrid iterative solver constitutes a&lt;br/&gt;robust, comprehensive solution strategy for difficult nonlinear problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project represents a focused study of least-squares methods for&lt;br/&gt;several linear and nonlinear elasticity and fluid flow problems, extending&lt;br/&gt;to applications in viscoelasticity.  Some research in these areas has been&lt;br/&gt;successful and preliminary results are encouraging, but much remains to be&lt;br/&gt;done.  This project includes both general solution methodologies for&lt;br/&gt;problems with strong nonlinearities and specific least-squares formulations&lt;br/&gt;for models that have not been analyzed in a least-squares framework.  The&lt;br/&gt;applications considered in this project include complex and specialized&lt;br/&gt;systems important in areas including engineering, physics, aerodynamics,&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric sciences, geology, and biomechanics.  One target application,&lt;br/&gt;for example, is a specific incompressible, non-Newtonain flow which arises&lt;br/&gt;in the modeling of blood flow. Here, a viscoelastic model that takes into&lt;br/&gt;account the elastic nature of the suspended red blood cells is to be&lt;br/&gt;considered.  In these and many other areas of interest, computer simulation&lt;br/&gt;of complex phenomena are currently limited by efficiency of numerical&lt;br/&gt;methods.  The basic techniques developed here will enhance the broader area&lt;br/&gt;of scientific computation by adding to the collective understanding of how&lt;br/&gt;to analyze and solve complex problems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
