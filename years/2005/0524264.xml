<AbstractNarration>Human languages are thoroughly contextual in nature. This fact can be seen plainly by considering how the meaning of a sound, word, sentence, or passage can change drastically when taken out of context, or placed in a different context. The contextual nature of language has proven to be a major challenge for developing computer algorithms that can understand or produce language, yet humans process language in context so easily that we are usually not even aware of it. Linguistic and cognitive scientists have been studying how humans process context for decades, often with respect to individual words in the context of other words. For instance, it is well established that a person's ability to recognize a word like "dog" is enhanced when it appears shortly after a word like "cat" that is related in meaning. Results like these are referred to as "semantic priming", and our knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie semantic priming and other kinds of contextual effects is mostly based on research using small handfuls of words chosen to make very targeted theoretical points. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support of the National Science Foundation, Drs. Hutchison and Balota will take a complementary approach to studying the mechanisms of semantic priming. Rather than restricting their scope to small handfuls of words, the investigators will develop a large database of semantic priming results for over 3,000 words of English. The database will include a range of statistics about the words and their usages, and the data will be made available to the research community via a powerful web interface. The database will help researchers throughout the world to advance theories and computational models of the processes that allow humans to not only overcome the challenge of context, but actually use context to their advantage in the comprehension and production of language. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Whether reading a book, attending a lecture, or engaging in a conversation, our understanding critically depends upon our ability to utilize the current context to guide us through the recognition of each new word in a sentence.  It is well established that a person's ability to recognize a word like "dog" is enhanced when it appears shortly after a word like "cat" that is related in meaning. Results like these are referred to as "semantic priming." The Semantic Priming Project investigated a wide range of both individual differences and item differences that may influence such use of context during word recognition.  In regard to items, words themselves differ in characteristics such as their frequency and spelling-to-sound regularity.  There is also a wide variety of ways in which pairs of words can be contextually related, including synonyms (e.g., couch-sofa), antonyms (e.g., hot-cold), forward phrasal associates (e.g., help-wanted), and category members (e.g., orange-grape).   Regarding individuals, potentially important differences include reading ability, vocabulary, age, degree of attentional control, and circadian rhythms.  Researchers at four institutions gave word recognition and other cognitive tests to nearly 800 participants across Bozeman, Nebraska, New York, and Missouri.      The resulting database (http://spp.montana.edu) contains a large set (over 1.27 million behavioral estimates total) of reaction-times (RTs) and errors for nearly 1,700 target words presented in either related or unrelated contexts.  The "priming" or "context effect is available for each of the 1,700 items and each of the 768 participants, along with pertinent information such as that discussed above connected to each item/participant.  Researchers will be able to search this site for invaluable data to experiment development, theory development, and model testing. For experiment development, researchers can use the site to select items for experiments based not only upon important characteristics such as type of relation (e.g., synonym), but based upon the size of the itemÆs priming effect (e.g., &gt; 100 ms). For theory development, researchers now have a large standardized empirical database from which to examine which individual and item factors produce the largest priming effects.  Finally, this database should serve as the standard from which semantic priming theories should be tested.        Last Modified: 11/04/2010       Submitted by: David A Balota]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
