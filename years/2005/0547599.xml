<AbstractNarration>CAREER- Achieving Diversity in Engineering Education:&lt;br/&gt;Cultivating Student Self-Efficacy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many women who leave undergraduate engineering and science programs believe less in their capabilities&lt;br/&gt;than those who stay, despite earning similar grades. Those who stay have a lower opinion of their&lt;br/&gt;capabilities than their male colleagues. Because self-efficacy beliefs correlate with motivation,&lt;br/&gt;performance, retention, and professional success, agencies and foundations have sponsored the&lt;br/&gt;development of interventions designed to promote women's self-efficacy in engineering. However,&lt;br/&gt;research has not sought to understand how specific efficacy beliefs are formed and how different aspects&lt;br/&gt;of the learning environment influence these beliefs. Using methodology that focuses on personal&lt;br/&gt;meanings, as qualitative approaches do, is particularly important for addressing these types of questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Objectives&lt;br/&gt;This project  will&lt;br/&gt;.  Assess and describe undergraduate engineering student self-efficacy beliefs&lt;br/&gt;.  Measure correlations of self-efficacy beliefs with student achievement, interest, and retention&lt;br/&gt;.   Characterize how the engineering learning environment facilitates or undermines positive belief&lt;br/&gt;       formation and processes by which students form their self-efficacy beliefs&lt;br/&gt;.   Identify how student levels of efficacy, the influences of the learning environment, and the processes&lt;br/&gt;      by which students form their efficacy beliefs change as students progress through their undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;      engineering programs and how these changes vary by gender and engineering discipline&lt;br/&gt;.   Develop, implement, assess, and refine course practices that enable and encourage students to&lt;br/&gt;       accurately assess their abilities&lt;br/&gt;  .   Disseminate findings and practices to faculty, faculty-in-training, advisors, and administrators in the&lt;br/&gt;      fields of engineering, science, technology, and educational psychology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mixed-method approach will be used.  Two cohorts of male and female engineering students at will be interviewed and surveyed longitudinally in their freshman through senior years. A sample of engineering lectures and recitation classes will be observed; engineering instructors, interviewed; and course materials, analyzed, enabling across-methods triangulation of results. The education plan includes commitments to develop and test course practices that promote engineering student self-efficacy.  The use of these practices will be promoted through the development, delivery, and assessment of workshops and a graduate-level engineering course. The work will be informed by social cognitive theory.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
