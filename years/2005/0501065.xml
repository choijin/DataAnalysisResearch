<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI's propose to concentrate their efforts on several classical problems in&lt;br/&gt;Analysis and Spectral Theory  that remained unsolved for the last 20--50&lt;br/&gt;years, due to the lack of appropriate technical tools.  Among the problems&lt;br/&gt;are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* bilipschitz equivalence for higher dimensional analogues of analytic&lt;br/&gt;capacity; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* two weight estimates for the Hilbert Transform;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* well-posedness of the inverse scattering problem for the discrete&lt;br/&gt;Schrodinger operator,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;i.e., uniqueness of the inverse nonlinear Fourier transform;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* selected problems of noncommutative harmonic analysis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the problems span several different areas of analysis and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics, our recent research revealed striking connections&lt;br/&gt;between  the proposed problems. To put it briefly, they all are unified by&lt;br/&gt;the fact that in all of them the same type of singular kernels (usually the&lt;br/&gt;Cauchy kernel) appears. Also, the problems share the same difficulty, the&lt;br/&gt;kernel got "spoiled'' by multiplication by virtually arbitrary functions&lt;br/&gt;(weights). Recent developments in the non-homogeneous harmonic analysis,&lt;br/&gt;which treats exactly this type of situations, made  successful solution of&lt;br/&gt;the proposed problems plausible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harmonic analysis investigates complex processes by representing them as a&lt;br/&gt;sum of elementary ones (sinusoidal waves, wavelets) with well understood&lt;br/&gt;behavior. A central part of modern harmonic analysis deals with "singular&lt;br/&gt;integral operators" of one type or another. Such operators are pervasive in&lt;br/&gt;the scientific landscape: they turn up in mathematical physics, probability,&lt;br/&gt;engineering, image processing, etc. While the theory of singular integral&lt;br/&gt;operators is now well developed (starting with works of Calderon and Zygmund&lt;br/&gt;and continued by  numerous researchers after them), it deals with  the&lt;br/&gt;operators defined on a nice "smooth" set, like the usual Euclidean space.&lt;br/&gt;However, in many problems one needs to investigate such operators on a "bad"&lt;br/&gt;set, like surfaces with singularities and even on more pathological sets.&lt;br/&gt;The non-homogeneous harmonic analysis  was introduced  by the PI's to deal&lt;br/&gt;exactly with such situations: recent solution by X. Tolsa of the famous&lt;br/&gt;subbaditivity problem for the analytic capacity is one of the most&lt;br/&gt;impressive applications of this PI's theory of nonhomogeneous analysis. PI's&lt;br/&gt;propose to attack several classical problems, where the framework of the&lt;br/&gt;non-homogeneous harmonic analysis appear naturally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
