<AbstractNarration>Current state of the art in nanotechnology is the study of advanced, high-performance nanoscale materials. In order to fabricate devices based on these materials, several fundamental issues need to be considered: novel nanofabrication techniques amenable to devices need to be invented, appropriate growth and processing techniques suitable to nanostructures need to be developed, novel methods must be devised to investigate properties of these materials and most importantly, device processing issues need to be considered for such small structures. In this proposal several of these critical issues will be addressed. Non-lithographic, nanofabrication methods based on porous alumina templates will be developed. Nitride semiconductor nanoarrays will be synthesized for UV-light emitters and spintronic device fabrication. &lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology is also concerned with developing new materials exhibiting exotic properties at the nanoscale level.  In this work, new nanoscale materials, magnetic alloys (FePt) and energetic nanocomposites (Al-Fe2O3) will be fabricated&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This is a unique proposal covering research in many different aspects of nanotechnology. Success of this research proposal will lead to development of highly efficient nanofabrication methods, development of advanced growth and processing methods and demonstration of novel nanodevices based on nitrides. Fabrication of UV light emitters will not only impact the optoelectronics industry, it will also have applications in advanced chemical and biosensors, relevant to national security issues. Spintronic devices will allow easy integration into present-day micro-electronic systems. FePt alloys are important materials for data storage devices and high density recording media while novel Al-Fe2O3 nanocomposites will find applications in energy storage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact: The interdisciplinary nature of this research proposal will have a broad impact in many different areas of research including magnetic materials, energetic nanocomposites, materials science, device physics and advanced engineering. A major goal of this program will be the creation of excellent student education and training programs. This will be achieved through development of advanced laboratory facilities, involvement of students in all aspects of the research plan, introduction of nanotechnology into courses, active recruitment of students from underrepresented groups into my research program, and by fostering inter-disciplinary and industrial collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
