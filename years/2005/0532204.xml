    <AbstractNarration>Funds are being provided via an interagency transfer to provide cost sharing for ongoing and new projects being conducted under the auspices of the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP).FY05 funds are requested for cost sharing seven ongoing projects: 1) incremental support for a NOPP project entitled "PARADIGM (Partnership for Advancing Interdisciplinary Global Modeling)" led by Lewis Rothstein (University of Rhode Island) 2) annual funding of the National Ocean Sciences Bowl; 3) support for the MOSEAN project awarded to Tommy Dickey of UCSB; 4) support for the Ocean.US office; 5) support for a study to create a library of marine animal sounds led by Jack Bradbury at Cornell University; 6) support for a marine mammal study of hearing by beaked whales led by Darlene Ketten at Woods Hole; and 7) a partner study to project # 6 (preceding) led by David Mountain of Boston University. The Office of Naval Research continues to be the lead agency to implement and fund most NOPP research and education programs. This arrangement helps to centralize and better control fiscal management, using cost sharing funds provided by other partnering agencies.</AbstractNarration>
