<AbstractNarration>Background&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis of large and/or geographically distributed scientific datasets,  is emerging as a key component of grid computing and holds great promise for scientific discoveries. However, such analysis tasks are complicated by low-level and specialized data storage formats, and lack of standard interfaces for accessing the data. Scientific datasets are typically stored in binary or character flat-files. These enable compact storage and efficient processing, but, make the specification of processing much harder.&lt;br/&gt;The overall motivation for this project is "future distributed and grid computing applications will need high-level abstractions and programming languages to access, retrieve, and process large-scale scientific datasets that are physically stored in compact low-level formats".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Develop a compiler to support a system of the nature described above involves a number of challenges.&lt;br/&gt;These challenges arise primarily because of the following four reasons:&lt;br/&gt;1) Supporting high-level abstractions, which implies that compiler not only needs to generate code that will correctly access data, but also needs to automatically achieve high-locality&lt;br/&gt; 2) Large Disk-Resident Datasets, which makes it quite challenging to generate low-level code that will have&lt;br/&gt;high data access locality&lt;br/&gt;3) Characteristics of the Applications we are targeting scientific data analysis, data mining, and&lt;br/&gt;image analysis applications that have not received much attention in the restructuring compilers community, &lt;br/&gt;4)Features of XQuery since XQuery is derived from functional, declarative, as well as database programming languages, a number of issues arise because of the constructs and programming styles it supports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-The PI is working on creating a new two quarter sequence on application-driven grid computing. Here, one of the topics that will be emphasized is the analysis of large datasets arising from real biological and medical applications.&lt;br/&gt;- The PI is currently working with three female Ph.D students, and expects to involve one of them in this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Together with many of his colleagues in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the Ohio State University, Agrawal is part of a collaboration plan with two HBCUs in the state of Ohio. &lt;br/&gt;This collaboration plan includes:&lt;br/&gt; 1) Guest lectures by OSU faculty&lt;br/&gt;and &lt;br/&gt;2) Research opportunities for HBCU undergraduates through independent study and summer projects jointly with OSU faculty (we hope to be able to use NSF REU supplements for funding this activity).</AbstractNarration>
