<AbstractNarration>Distributed applications and the hardware/software platforms on which they&lt;br/&gt;run are becoming increasingly complex. As a result, it is also becoming&lt;br/&gt;increasingly difficult to understand and then manage application behavior,&lt;br/&gt;particularly for applications that are critical to the ability of&lt;br/&gt;organizations to provide services for which they have contractual obligations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Georgia Tech's `Service Paths' project is developing technologies for&lt;br/&gt;(1) dynamically discovering the critical `paths' applications follow&lt;br/&gt;through distributed sets of services, and (2) managing such paths in&lt;br/&gt;order to improve an application's ability to meet dynamic service level&lt;br/&gt;agreements. Service path technologies will substantially improve systems'&lt;br/&gt;abilities to provide end-to-end guarantees and enhance the underlying&lt;br/&gt;systems' capabilities to provide such guarantees. Concrete outcomes include&lt;br/&gt;new system-level methods and abstractions to better understand current&lt;br/&gt;application behavior, new middleware abstractions suitable both for&lt;br/&gt;constructing and managing large-scale software overlays across many&lt;br/&gt;machines, and experimental results attained with virtualized platforms&lt;br/&gt;like PlanetLab and with novel hardware support for runtime platform&lt;br/&gt;virtualization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader significance: the costs of developing and changing modern IT&lt;br/&gt;infrastructures are now dominated by personnel rather than hardware.&lt;br/&gt;Technology providers have reacted to this fact by making it increasingly&lt;br/&gt;easy to develop complex distributed applications. Without also&lt;br/&gt;understanding and then being able to manage and control such applications,&lt;br/&gt;cost savings attained at development time cannot be translated to the&lt;br/&gt;continuing cost savings required to make U.S. industry competitive with&lt;br/&gt;low-cost, international providers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
