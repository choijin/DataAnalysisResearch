<AbstractNarration>UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF MARYLAND LOUIS STOKES ALLIANCE FOR MINORITY PARTICIPATION, PHASE III &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The  proposed  funding  will  support  the  continuation  of  a  comprehensive  program  connecting  students  with  the research  base  at  three  USM  institutions  that  began  an  Alliance  in  1995  to  extend  and  increase  the  impact  of initiatives to increase substantially the quantity and quality of underrepresented minority (URM) students receiving baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields.  With Dr. Freeman A. Hrabowski, III, President of the University of Maryland, Baltimore  County  (UMBC)  continuing  as  Principal  Investigator,  UMBC,  the  University  of  Maryland,  College  Park (UMCP), and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) will implement the proposed USM LSAMP, Phase III which is designed to serve undergraduate students, particularly those who are members of underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Building on lessons learned from the successes in Phase I and II and best practices from other LSAMP Programs and other initiatives with similar goals, the following measurable objectives have been established for the proposed LSAMP, Phase III. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To increase the enrollment of URM students in STEM fields annualy; &lt;br/&gt;To increase the retention to second year rate of URM students in STEM fields annualy; &lt;br/&gt;To improve the academic performance of URM students in STEM courses and majors annually; &lt;br/&gt;To increase the percentage of URM STEM students earning cumulative GPAs at or above 3.0 annually; &lt;br/&gt;To increase the six-year graduation rates of URM students in STEM majors; &lt;br/&gt;To increase the number of URM students who go on to graduate programs in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;NSF and other funds will provide support for the five major Alliance components: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Summer Component:  Includes a Summer Bridge Program to facilitate new students' transition to the &lt;br/&gt;university through academic support and summer research opportunities for continuing students &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Academic Year Component:    Includes  undergraduate  research  fellowships,  graduate  school &lt;br/&gt;preparation, intrusive academic advising, mentoring tutoring, monitoring, and other academic support; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Collaboration Component:  Is designed to enhance and provide a formal structure for colaborations &lt;br/&gt;among and between programs and initiatives on and off the USM LSAMP campuses with goals similar to &lt;br/&gt;those of LSAMP. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Curriculum Review and Revision Component:  The ongoing review and, as needed, revisions of the &lt;br/&gt;curricula for .filter" STEM courses will facilitate the success and retention in STEM majors of URM and other students. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Tracking and Follow-up Component:  The academic and career accomplishments of Program alumni &lt;br/&gt;will  be  tracked,  and  folow-up  contacts  will  be  made  with  them  to  encourage  their  persistence  in  STEM graduate programs and consideration of STEM careers, particularly in the professoriate. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Throughout their undergraduate years, students will be actively involved in research projects with faculty and other mentors,  at  the  partnering institutions  and  off campus  (including  national  laboratories), and  will be  encouraged  to present  their  research  findings  in  appropriate  settings.    Also,  in  Phase  III,  the  USM  Alliance  will  collaborate  with &lt;br/&gt;established programs operating on the campuses, including the NSF-funded Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate  (AGEP),  and  the McNair  Scholars  and  Upward  Bound  programs  funded  by  the  U.S.  Department of Education, among others that provide a pipeline with targeted services to support URM students from grade nine through the Ph.D.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As a Senior Alliance, the USM LSAMP is a comprehensive program designed to increase both the quantity and the quality of URM and other students who earn STEM B.S. degrees and are well prepared for graduate school.  Moreover, we have succeeded in identifying and implementing best practices that help to broaden participation in STEM significantly not only at the undergraduate level but also through the Ph.D.  Notable outcomes are provided below.  Undergraduate Degrees  Growth in STEM bachelorÆs degrees has been evident among all URM groups, but successful outreach and retention activities have resulted in the greatest growth occurring among Native American and Hispanic students.  STEM bachelorÆs degrees awarded to URM students rose from 2,011 during Phase I (1995-2000) to 3,011 during Phase III (2006-2010).  This represents a 49% increase. STEM bachelorÆs degrees awarded to Black or African American students rose from 1,543 during Phase I to 2,214 during Phase III.  This represents a 43% increase. STEM bachelorÆs degrees awarded to Hispanic students rose from 325 during Phase I to 734 during Phase III.  This represents a 126% increase. STEM bachelorÆs degrees awarded to Native American students rose from 27 during Phase I to 63 during Phase III.  This represents a 137% increase.   Undergraduate Enrollment and Progress  We have developed an increasingly healthy pipeline of students who are well prepared to complete STEM degrees and advance into the STEM workforce.  URM students enrolled in STEM bachelorÆs degree programs rose from 3,197 in year 5 of Phase I (1999-2000) to 4,259 in year 5 of Phase III (2009-2010).  This represents a 33% increase. Over time, there has been an increase in the number of URM students who achieve junior and senior classification and are well positioned to complete STEM bachelorÆs degrees.  URM STEM juniors and seniors rose from 1,572 in year 5 of Phase I to 2,032 in year 5 of Phase III.  This represents a 29% increase. While the number of URM students earning B.S. degrees in STEM has increased over time, there also has been broader participation in the traditionally least diverse fields.  For example, the percentage of B.S. degrees awarded to URM students in Geosciences, Physics/Astronomy, and Chemistry increased by 300%, 260%, and 208%, respectively, from year 5 of Phase I to year 5 of Phase III. Direct student participants, in particular, perform well academically each year, and both the number and percentage of these students who earn grades that ultimately will be competitive for graduate school continues to increase.  In year 5 of Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III, 132 (55%), 252 (76%), and 273 (72%), respectively, direct participants completed the academic year with cumulative grade point averages at or above 3.0 on a 4.0 scale.   Graduate Degrees  Since the USM LSAMP began in 1995, there has been improvement in campus climates supportive of STEM education for URM students at all levels resulting in increases graduate degrees.  STEM masterÆs degrees to URM students rose from 306 during Phase I to 445 during Phase III.  This represents a 45% increase. STEM doctorate degrees to URM students rose from 86 during Phase I to 122 during Phase III.  This represents a 42% increase. The USM LSAMP has received awards to conduct Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Programs for five cohorts of 12 BD Fellows.  These awards helped us to strengthen both our undergraduate and graduate education pipelines and create an expanded community of STEM scholars.  As LSAMP alumni, the BD Fellows have had a strong and positive influence on the LSAMP undergraduates.  Significantly, the USM BD program produced five Ph.D.s in academic year 2010-2011.   Alumni Accomplishments  USM LSAMP alumni are making important contributions across the STEM disciplines.  Many have gone on to graduate programs; others have gone directly into the workforce in a broad range of STEM careers from the professoriate to rocket science.  Successful strateg...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
