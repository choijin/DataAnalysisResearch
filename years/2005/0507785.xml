    <AbstractNarration>AST-0507785 / AST-0507697&lt;br/&gt;Eric Sandquist / Michael Bolte&lt;br/&gt;San Diego State University / University of California Santa Cruz&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Research: Stellar Physics from Cluster-Wide Samples in Globular&lt;br/&gt;Star Clusters&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;A series of observational tests of theories of the structure and evolution of low mass stars will be&lt;br/&gt;performed. Specifically, counts of globular cluster stars (i.e., luminosity functions) will be&lt;br/&gt;employed to determine evolutionary timescales. Also, internally-consistent photometry will be&lt;br/&gt;measured to compare stellar properties (luminosity, temperature) at different phases of evolution&lt;br/&gt;and at the same points of evolution across different clusters. Three aspects of the cluster colormagnitude&lt;br/&gt;diagrams will be examined: 1) The epoch of red giant branch ascent, including red giant&lt;br/&gt;evolutionary timescales, the red giant branch bump (its luminosity and sharpness), and the&lt;br/&gt;location of the red giant branch-tip; 2) horizontal branch and asymptotic giant branch morphologies,&lt;br/&gt;distributions, and evolution; and 3) blue stragglers and their radial distributions, distributions on the&lt;br/&gt;cluster color magnitude diagrams, and the presence of unusual blue straggler populations. The&lt;br/&gt;statistical nature of these investigations requires quality photometry of large samples of cluster stars&lt;br/&gt;which will be extracted from previously obtained wide field (for cluster outskirts) and high&lt;br/&gt;resolution (for cluster cores) images obtained at national and international observatories telescopes&lt;br/&gt;(plus archival images, including the Hubble Space Telescope where possible). Novel (within the&lt;br/&gt;astronomical community) statistics will also be employed in the analysis to assess&lt;br/&gt;significance/confidence levels of trends and relations.&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate and Master's students at San Diego will be heavily involved in this work - both with&lt;br/&gt;the reduction and analysis of the astronomical data and the application of advanced statistical&lt;br/&gt;methods. The training of a graduate student at UCSC is also supported here. The final photometry&lt;br/&gt;will also be made publicly available.</AbstractNarration>
