    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to generate a prototype high-resolution, high-speed spectroscopic system consisting of a 1060nm swept laser and a photoreceiver to characterize the scattering properties of gold nanoparticels. The research goals will be accomplished by pursuing four technical objectives: (1) Generate a wide range, narrow-band 1060nm swept-wavelength laser; (2) Develop a photoreceiver system optimized for speed and sensitivity; (3) Characterize the scattering properties of gold nanoparticles; (4) Verify theoretical model and identify key spectroscopic system performance parameters. The ability to perform high sensitivity imaging of diseases in molecular and cellular levels through contrast enhancing agents will greatly benefit the advancement of biotechnology and Nanotechnology. Various contrasting agents have been explored for imaging applications, including the traditional florescence and absorption dyes, to the latest semiconductor quantum dots and metallic nanoparticles. The recently engineered gold nanoparticles possess superior light scattering and absorbing characteristics as well as long-term stability, and when bound to antibodies, can enable high-contrast molecular and cellular imaging of various diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful the long-term objective of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a novel biological imaging modality based on a high-speed swept laser spectroscopic system at 1060nm region to interrogate bio-sensors made of gold nanoparticles. The new system should enable noninvasive disease detection with deep tissue penetration . This potentially powerful biomedical sensing modality can be created from a convergence of unique technological advancement in Nanotechnology, swept-wavelength laser system, and high-sensitivity photoreceiver. Furthermore, the inherent fiber-optics platform and Nanotechnology should enable a compact swept laser spectrometer for robust commercial deployment. The outcome of this project will accomplish three critical objectives: (1) A field deployable bio-chemical and bio-medical diagnostic system for security and healthcare; (2) An spectroscopic instrument to enhance research of nanoparticle sensors and drug discovery; (3) A new capability to facilitate the identification of diseases and the understanding of cellular and molecular biology.</AbstractNarration>
