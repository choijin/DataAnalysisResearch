<AbstractNarration>0505868&lt;br/&gt;JHON&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports US participation in a second Forum on Nanotechnology between the United States and Korea, to be held in the U.S. in early 2005. The meeting is co-organized by Dr. Myung Jhon of  Carnegie Mellon University and  Dr. Jo-Won Lee, Director of the Korean National Program for Tera-Level Nanodevices.  The First Forum was held in Seoul during 2003. It covered a broad range of research topics in nanotechnology, and was extremely well received.  The second is critical to assessing the achievements and recommendations made during the first Forum. It will complement the first Forum by providing a common platform for scientists and researchers from both countries to establish partnerships in nanotechnology development, focusing specifically on nanomanufacturing. Approximately half of the U.S. participants will be established senior investigators who will make presentations; the others will be early-career scientists and engineers. A roughly equal number of Korean presenters will participate. The presentations will include examinations of nanomanufacturing research, educational program development, mechanisms for cooperation, and plans for exchanging personnel. The Forum proceedings and findings will be published both on CD and on Carnegie Mellon's website and will be available to a broad audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits&lt;br/&gt;This Forum will promote the exchange of research and policy between the two countries in key areas of nanotechnology. The novel contribution here is the focus on nanomanufacturing research and the development of educational programs in nanotechnology, which is becoming increasingly important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the Forum is to promote not only industrial-academic partnerships, but also to have a high impact on education, including K through 12, by providing a new dimension to the lower-level science education. The Forum will result in the sharing of information and experiences in nanomanufacturing research and the development of educational programs focusing on nanotechnology. It will encourage and facilitate collaborative research initiatives between industry, government, and academia in the two countries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
