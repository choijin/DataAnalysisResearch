<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will combine theoretical analysis and applied tools to&lt;br/&gt;develop innovative models, methodology, algorithms and data analysis for&lt;br/&gt;functional data. A major goal of this proposal is to extend the reach of&lt;br/&gt;functional data analysis methods to sparse, noisy and irregularly sampled&lt;br/&gt;longitudinal data. Functional data and longitudinal data are assumed to be&lt;br/&gt;generated by random trajectories that correspond to realizations of an&lt;br/&gt;underlying stochastic process. These trajectories may be either observable&lt;br/&gt;or hidden. Relevant theory for estimation and inference will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;Current functional data analysis approaches and tools require densely&lt;br/&gt;measured functions or completely observed functions on a common domain,&lt;br/&gt;and abandoning these assumptions requires new tools. Similarly, extensions&lt;br/&gt;of functional data analysis to situations where one has both longitudinal&lt;br/&gt;and survival time components will lead to new practical statistical&lt;br/&gt;methods as well as challenging research problems. The development and&lt;br/&gt;application of new tools for curve warping in cases where a large fraction&lt;br/&gt;of the variability of random curves lies in variation of time scale is&lt;br/&gt;another challenging problem that will be addressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The statistical methods that will be developed by the investigator are&lt;br/&gt;motivated by the need to analyze data that include large samples of gene&lt;br/&gt;expression profiles, longitudinal studies in medicine and biology with&lt;br/&gt;multivariate or generalized measurements, and time courses of behavioral&lt;br/&gt;measurements, coupled with age-at-death information. It is expected that&lt;br/&gt;the results of the proposed research will contribute in a significant way&lt;br/&gt;to the analysis and interpretation of such data and will lead to new&lt;br/&gt;insights into underlying mechanisms of gene regulation, complex dynamic&lt;br/&gt;interactions in biological systems, and aging and longevity.</AbstractNarration>
