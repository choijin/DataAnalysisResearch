<AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;This project aims at providing/developing a model of environmental and thematic feature&lt;br/&gt;perception by blind and visually impaired map users. The project will also provide free, easily&lt;br/&gt;accessible, and easy to use tactile mapping software, downloadable from the Department of&lt;br/&gt;Geography at University of Oregon website. The software will supply teachers with the tools to&lt;br/&gt;create navigation maps for blind and visually impaired orientation and mobility education as well&lt;br/&gt;as create tactile socio-economic maps to be used as instructional materials in science and social&lt;br/&gt;science education. The Research Goals of the project are to:&lt;br/&gt;1. identify the most important environmental objects that are used during navigation,&lt;br/&gt;orientation and mobility by the blind and visually impaired&lt;br/&gt;2. identify how blind and visually impaired map users perceive, categorize and use these&lt;br/&gt;environmental objects&lt;br/&gt;3. based on the findings from goals 1 and 2, create and evaluate a library of symbols that&lt;br/&gt;effectively represent the environmental objects&lt;br/&gt;4. evaluate the threshold of socio-economic data representation/symbolization on tactile&lt;br/&gt;thematic maps&lt;br/&gt;5. create free, easily accessible Tactile Navigation and Socio-economic Mapping software&lt;br/&gt;that incorporates research findings from goals 1, 2, 3,and 4&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. Research Goals 1-4 will be investigated through the design of empirical&lt;br/&gt;experiments involving human subject volunteers. Researchers and practitioners still do not&lt;br/&gt;understand completely how blind and visually impaired map readers perceive environmental&lt;br/&gt;features and then how those features are best symbolized for map use. While some researchers&lt;br/&gt;have begun to investigate tactile map design, very little has been reported on tactile navigation&lt;br/&gt;map use and environmental perception. Moreover, little to no results has been reported on tactile&lt;br/&gt;thematic maps (neither design nor use). The results from the proposed research will build on the&lt;br/&gt;limited knowledge base and begin to develop a model of understanding of both the environmental&lt;br/&gt;features (important for tactile navigation maps) and thematic value differences (important for&lt;br/&gt;tactile socio-economic maps).&lt;br/&gt;In addition, currently teachers have no automated means to produce navigation and thematic&lt;br/&gt;socio-economic tactile maps for the education of blind and visually students. The Tactile&lt;br/&gt;Navigation and Socio-economic Mapping that will be authored in this proposed project will offer&lt;br/&gt;the ability for teachers and parents to create highly customized navigation and orientation maps&lt;br/&gt;for specific locations such as school, home, church, neighborhood, or playground. Moreover, the&lt;br/&gt;proposed software will allow the mapmakers to insert landmarks that are meaningful to the map&lt;br/&gt;reader. But, one of the most substantial advantages of the proposed software is the additional&lt;br/&gt;ability to create hundreds of US socio-economic tactile maps, products that are flatly unavailable&lt;br/&gt;in any realistic way (without expensive custom-ordering from a tactile production company).&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Law guarantees that this group&lt;br/&gt;will receive the materials they need for a free appropriate education. But, they don't have the&lt;br/&gt;socio-economic maps they need to achieve an understanding of the country that guaranteed their&lt;br/&gt;educational rights. The benefits this proposed project will bring to the underrepresented blind&lt;br/&gt;and visually impaired members of society are potentially monumental. The proposed project will&lt;br/&gt;deliver not only theoretical models addressing the understanding map use and environmental&lt;br/&gt;perception, but also the software, a tangible product that will enhance the infrastructure of both&lt;br/&gt;research and education.</AbstractNarration>
