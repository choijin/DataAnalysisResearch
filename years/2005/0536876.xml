<AbstractNarration>Two all-sky imagers sampling the OH nightglow are initially positioned in the Northern Utah, and Wyoming region.  These imagers generate all-sky images distinct by virtue of observation geometry, which are then tomographically inverted to produce two-dimensional intensity maps of short period (less one hour) gravity waves in the upper mesosphere.  Classical algebraic tomographic inversions and stochastic inversion algebraic inversions are compared with system (integral) and geometric tomographic models using the actual airglow data to isolate the best technique for wave structure extraction using two OH imagers.  Extension to 3-dimension descriptions of wave motion and vertical structure in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere is finally accomplished using coincident measurements of the OH airglow, the O2 airglow, and the OI airglow - which arise from different layers between 80-155 km.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed new methods to collect and analyze airglow&mdash;light emissions from the upper atmosphere&mdash;that are important to the study of atmospheric dynamics and the coupling of weather to the space environment.  The new methods were based on computed tomography (CT) approaches that were successfully applied to all-sky image measurements of airglow waves and structure.  The developed CT methods significantly advance the current state-of-the-art for upper atmospheric tomography investigations by providing CT methods optimized for data from only two stations.  This was achieved by comparing a range of CT methods for application to airglow imaging, by studying the accuracy of the CT images, and by developing a novel three-dimensional (3D) imaging method for the airglow emission layer using only two-station data [1].  The broader impacts of this research include new applications for satellite-based imaging studies and new approaches for medical imaging.  The airglow CT methods are currently being explored for studying structure in mesospheric ice clouds (the highest clouds on Earth) using novel image data from the NASA Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite.  Recent satellite studies have shown that the frequency of occurrence of these ice clouds is increasing, possibly due to changes in the upper atmospheric climate.  The CT methods developed on this project may also be exceptionally suited for translation to medical imaging, specifically for non-invasive diagnostic optical tomography.  A "spin-off" initial study applying the airglow CT methods to 3D imaging systems for breast and prostate cancer has been funded, and work is currently in progress to continue this and other medical imaging related research.   1.
