<AbstractNarration>This award is for developing a new Magnetic Resonance Stage Microscope analogous to an inverted light microscope but capable of imaging multiple hydrated opaque biological samples such as frog embryos with a spatial resolution of ca. 100 microns.  Current Magnetic Resonance Microscopes [MRMs] for small samples use cylindrical gradients of small internal diameter and RF coil designs that maximize sensitivity and efficiency at the expense of sample volume and easy access to the specimen. This new MRM design addresses these limitations and specifically targets applications in developmental biology. The project has three main objectives: 1. Development of uniplanar gradient and radiofrequency hardware for high field magnetic resonance microscopy of multiple opaque embryos ranging from 1-3mm in size. 2. Development of an incubation chamber with temperature, humidity and gas mixture control for use with the MR stage microscope in experiments lasting up to several days. 3. Optimization of embryological and imaging protocols for the stage microscope to facilitate more widespread adoption of the instrument by other research groups. The project combines existing approaches to uniplanar surface RF and gradient coil design with technical solutions to hardware cooling, sensitivity improvement, sample insulation and environmental control to develop a general purpose, noninvasive imaging tool for developmental biology in opaque embryos. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new magnetic resonance stage microscope can be used to image any small, hydrated, opaque system, including embryos, insects, marine animals, biofilms, bioreactors, cell cultures, porous media and plants. The stage microscope format provides unhindered access to the sample from above, encouraging the future integration of optical imaging equipment with magnetic resonance microscopy. Simultaneous optical imaging would allow correlation of superficial cell movements with deeper tissue organization from MRM. Ultimately, this new MRM may be commercialized. The project involves students at undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels in the instrument development within an active research setting. Multidisciplinary work includes skill development in physics, electrical engineering, imaging science and embryology and the opportunity to work closely with experienced physicists, engineers and biologists as an interdisciplinary team. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
