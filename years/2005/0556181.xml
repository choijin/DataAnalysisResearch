<AbstractNarration>This award supports a program for advancement in the representation&lt;br/&gt;theory of commutative Noetherian local rings.  The study of maximal&lt;br/&gt;Cohen--Macaulay modules over such rings has grown out of the theory of&lt;br/&gt;representations of Artin algebras, which has developed sophisticated&lt;br/&gt;theoretical techniques for classifying and characterizing module&lt;br/&gt;theories of non-commutative Artinian rings.  Classical problems from&lt;br/&gt;the non-commutative theory can often be stated directly in the&lt;br/&gt;commutative higher-dimensional framework, and this framework comes&lt;br/&gt;equipped with its own unique problems, specialized machinery, and&lt;br/&gt;deep, powerful connections with algebraic geometry.  The interplay&lt;br/&gt;between the two areas has been exceptionally productive for both.&lt;br/&gt;However, many of the most powerful tools of the Artinian arsenal are&lt;br/&gt;essentially noncommutative, in that they produce noncommutative rings&lt;br/&gt;even from commutative input, restricting their use in commutative&lt;br/&gt;algebra.  Recent theoretical advances in non-commutative algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry have begun to provide methods, including the notion of a&lt;br/&gt;non-commutative resolution of singularities, similar to those provided&lt;br/&gt;by classical algebraic geometry. Describing these non-commutative&lt;br/&gt;resolutions in terms of tools from the Artinian theory will allow the&lt;br/&gt;powerful tools of that area to be brought to bear on fundamental&lt;br/&gt;conjectures about the maximal Cohen--Macaulay modules over&lt;br/&gt;Cohen--Macaulay local rings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project lies at the intersection of the areas of commutative and&lt;br/&gt;non-commutative algebra, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry.  The&lt;br/&gt;classical aim of commutative algebra is to describe the solution sets&lt;br/&gt;of systems of polynomial equations by associating to them algebraic&lt;br/&gt;gadgets known as rings.  Non-commutative algebra, on the other hand,&lt;br/&gt;has developed theory for associating rings to directed graphs, also&lt;br/&gt;called quivers.  The synergy among these topics has enriched all four&lt;br/&gt;subjects, and has led to applications in such varied fields as&lt;br/&gt;robotics, statistics, cryptography, and particularly theoretical&lt;br/&gt;physics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
