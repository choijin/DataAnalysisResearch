<AbstractNarration>The PI investigates independence results in the study of countable&lt;br/&gt;convergence questions in the class of compact spaces. Some of the&lt;br/&gt;questions remain unresolved even in the presence of the Proper Forcing&lt;br/&gt;Axiom. The sequential order of a space is a natural ordinal invariant&lt;br/&gt;that measures the complexity of a sequential space; the question of&lt;br/&gt;whether there can be a finite or countable bound on this invariant for&lt;br/&gt;compact spaces has only been resolved under CH. We will also study&lt;br/&gt;continuous maps on the remainder of the Stone-Cech compactification of&lt;br/&gt;the integers which are finite-to-one. We will try to determine if such&lt;br/&gt;maps have to be "somewhere trivial" and whether the range space will be&lt;br/&gt;homeomorphic to the domain. This question has been fully resolved under&lt;br/&gt;PFA but not, for example, under MA. Two other questions about the&lt;br/&gt;remainder of N under PFA: can it be covered by nowhere dense P-sets and&lt;br/&gt;can there be non-trivial copies of the remainder?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one formalizes the limiting process of an infinite sequence of&lt;br/&gt;steps one is naturally lead to the notion of topological space. Points&lt;br/&gt;in physical space can be analyzed using the notion of a converging&lt;br/&gt;sequence, but just as mathematics has a need for a much broader&lt;br/&gt;understanding of points (e.g. functions or processes themselves lying in&lt;br/&gt;a space of like processes), so too has the need for a broader&lt;br/&gt;understanding of limit and topological space been developed to handle&lt;br/&gt;convergence in the more general settings. The investigation into the&lt;br/&gt;nature of generalized convergence, connections between conditions that&lt;br/&gt;may imply the existence of (the much easier to understand and apply)&lt;br/&gt;classical convergent sequences,  and the behavior of the convergence&lt;br/&gt;structure under deformations  is on-going and productive. These notions&lt;br/&gt;are very sensitive to the foundational axioms of mathematics and the&lt;br/&gt;questions serve as both a testbed for foundational study and a generator&lt;br/&gt;of new development. One of the most famously indeterminate questions of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, the continuum hypothesis (the "size" of the real number&lt;br/&gt;line) is intimately connected to these questions of convergence. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
