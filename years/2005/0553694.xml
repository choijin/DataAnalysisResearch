<AbstractNarration>Since Thurston formulated his geometrization conjecture, the study of infinite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds has risen to a prominent position in low-dimensional topology and geometry.  For the past 30 years four major conjectures have guided this area: Marden's Tameness Conjecture, Thurston's Ending Lamination Conjecture, the Bers-Thurston-Sullivan Density Conjecture and Ahlfors' Measure Conjecture; all have been resolved in the last four years.  The solutions of these conjectures have introduced new techniques into the field and opened the door to deeper investigation and the exploration of new directions.  In this Focused Research Group, the principal&lt;br/&gt;investigators propose to use these new techniques to deepen their understanding of the geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, both of infinite and of finite volume, to explore further their still mysterious deformation theory, to pioneer new directions for research in the field, and to develop connections with related branches of low-dimensional geometry and topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the time of Poincare, topologists have pursued the idea that certain spaces called 3-manifolds might be simply described.  In the 1970's, Thurston's geometrization conjecture showed topologists the power of bringing geometry to bear on this problem, and opened the possiblity for broad connections between topological, geometric and dynamical features that arise.  Using technical tools arising from recent breakthroughs, the PIs hope to interconnect further these different perspectives on the field, and expose early career mathematicians and graduate students to the new range of problems emerging from this fertile area.  The Focused Research Group will fund small conferences during its first and final year focused on emerging research areas, with introductory workshops to be run on the day prior to the beginning of the conference.  This project will also support the research of the principal investigators' graduate students and provide travel funding for their interaction across institutions. Each of these efforts will allow young geometers and topologists both to learn about the exciting recent developments in the field and to explore the new directions opened up by these developments.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
