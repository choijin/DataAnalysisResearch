<AbstractNarration>Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) are North American hawks that hunt and nest within the interiors of mature forests.  Their needs are often in conflict with forest management (fire suppression, timber harvest), and the concern now is that populations in the West are declining.  Little is known about the species' population trends and genetics because studying goshawks is difficult and expensive. Goshawks, however, molt their feathers every year, which are easily collected at nest sites.  These feathers provide DNA that is useful for uniquely identifying individuals and tracking them over time.  Genetic fingerprints from molted feathers will be used to study: (1) a fifteen-year population trend for goshawks on the Kaibab Plateau, in northern Arizona; and (2) connectivity and relatedness among goshawk populations in western North America. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Concern over population declines has prompted the filing of petitions to list goshawks in the West as endangered.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service cites the need for more studies to assess populations and to identify unique population segments (i.e., sub-species) that may warrant protection.  This research will provide information to guide management and conservation of goshawks.  Additionally, this research demonstrates the utility of cost-effective and non-invasive genetic methods based on molted feathers that do not require capturing and handling of animals in the wild. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
