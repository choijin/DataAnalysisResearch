<AbstractNarration>This five-year project investigates, tests and refines a comprehensive set of conjectures about school and district support structures that enhance the effectiveness of teacher development interventions in mathematics.  The project involves middle schools in four urban school districts that have partnered with the Institute for Learning at the University of Pittsburgh and has both a formal hypothesis-testing component and a design research component.  One outcome of the project is an implementation support framework that identifies key support structures, explains why they are important and illustrates how their development can be accomplished.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Middle School Mathematics and the Institutional Setting of Teaching (MIST) study bridged the divide in educational research between studies of policy implementation in school districts and investigations of the role of professional development in the development of high-quality mathematics instruction.  The study demonstrates the importance of framing large-scale instructional improvement as a process of organizational as well as teacher learning while simultaneously highlighting that issues of content have far-reaching implications for the school and district instructional improvement.     Working in partnership with the leaders of four large urban school districts, researchers from Vanderbilt University refined and tested a comprehensive set of strategies for improving the quality of math teaching on a large scale. These strategies encompass instructional materials, teacher professional development, mathematics coaches who support teachers in their schools, school instructional leadership, and district leadership. By using a mixed-methods approach, the researchers were able to look across a large longitudinal data set to refine conjectures about these strategies and their impact on classroom instruction. The MIST project exemplifies a new interventionist genre of research in which organizational design is at the service of large-scale instructional improvement efforts in mathematics education. Research of this type generates useful theoretical knowledge about the relationships between the school and district settings in which teachers work, the instructional practices they develop in those settings, and their studentsÆ mathematical learning.  The MIST project made substantial contributions to the field of educational research a developing a methodological approach that can be used by educational researchers who seek to build similar partnerships with school districts aimed at the system-wide improvement of mathematics instruction.  Project findings and process documentation will enable future researchers to anticipate and respond to some of the difficulties in forging reciprocal partnerships with school districts, whose changing natures require strategic planning and coordination of data collection and analysis.  The MIST project also developed a number of measures and analytical tools for assessing constructs central to the projectÆs hypotheses and conjectures. The surveys and interview protocols developed by the MIST team fill a gap in currently available instrumentation. During the instrument development process, MIST researchers conducted an extensive review of instruments available in the fields of mathematics education and policy and leadership.  This review revealed the disparity between research techniques and tools in policy research and research in mathematics education.  Most instruments developed by mathematics educators focus on the nature of teachersÆ instructional practices and the nature of the classroom learning environment, but do not attempt to document the school and district settings in which mathematics classrooms as located.  Conversely, instruments developed by researchers in policy and leadership attend to aspects of the institutional setting of teaching but do not take a position on what counts as high-quality instruction and do not take account of issues of content.  The instruments developed in MIST build on research on mathematics teaching and learning while simultaneously attending to the school and district setting of teaching. Furthermore, project researchers have developed associated coding schemes that will enable other researchers to assess teachersÆ, coachesÆ, and principalsÆ expertise with greater precision &ndash; such as participantsÆ Vision of High Quality Mathematics Instruction (VHQMI) and Vision of StudentsÆ Mathematical Capabilities (VSMC).
