<AbstractNarration>The Jones polynomial invariant of links presents two puzzles. The first &lt;br/&gt;one is its interpretation within the framework of classical topology and &lt;br/&gt;its relation to the fundamental group of the link complement. This &lt;br/&gt;relation is well-known for the Alexander polynomial, but its Jones &lt;br/&gt;analog is missing. I search for it by using the quantum field theory &lt;br/&gt;approach. I decompose the colored Jones polynomial in the semi-classical &lt;br/&gt;limit into a sum of many simpler invariants, which turn out to be &lt;br/&gt;multi-variable polynomial invariants of links. These invariants are &lt;br/&gt;arranged naturally into a `tower' and the Alexander polynomial lies at &lt;br/&gt;its foundation.  My goal is to study the properties of the other `higher &lt;br/&gt;level' polynomials and establish their relation to the topology of the &lt;br/&gt;knot complement. The second puzzle of the Jones polynomial is its &lt;br/&gt;polynomial structure, which does not follow easily from its &lt;br/&gt;Chern-Simons-Witten path integral presentation. An amazing explanation &lt;br/&gt;for the polynomial nature of the Jones polynomial comes from Khovanov's &lt;br/&gt;categorification program, which interprets the Jones polynomial as a &lt;br/&gt;graded Euler characteristic of a chain complex of graded modules, &lt;br/&gt;associated to a link up to a homotopy. I will study the possible quantum &lt;br/&gt;field theory interpretations of the Khovanov homology. Namely, the &lt;br/&gt;homology of the categorification complex should be a space of states for &lt;br/&gt;a 4-dimensional topological quantum field theory, which has to be &lt;br/&gt;constructed. This construction should help us to extend Khovanov's &lt;br/&gt;results to quantum polynomial invariants of 3-manifolds and to interpret &lt;br/&gt;their relation to 4-dimensional topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem of knot classification is very old and although its &lt;br/&gt;formulation is simple and transparent, it has not been solved yet &lt;br/&gt;despite concerted efforts of many mathematicians. One of the most &lt;br/&gt;successful approaches to knot classification is the construction of knot &lt;br/&gt;invariants, that is, the numbers, which can be easily computed by &lt;br/&gt;looking at a picture of a knot and which would be the same for all &lt;br/&gt;pictures representing the same knot. This area has undergone significant &lt;br/&gt;developments in the last 30 years starting with the invention of the &lt;br/&gt;Jones polynomial. This polynomial and the other invariants which &lt;br/&gt;followed it, are intimately related to quantum field theory and can be &lt;br/&gt;expressed as so-called path integrals. Thus many of the new ideas in the &lt;br/&gt;theory of knot invariants are inspired by methods and approaches of &lt;br/&gt;quantum physics. The goal of my research is to use the methods of &lt;br/&gt;quantum field theory in order to interpret the new `quantum' topological &lt;br/&gt;invariants within the framework of classical topology and to apply them &lt;br/&gt;to the solution of the knot classification problem.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
