<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) are currently being investigated and developed for various applications where technological demands require reduced component size and cost, while dramatically increasing device performance and functionality. These competing factors have presented significant challenges in device design. The Espinosa's group recently conceived a carbon-nanotube-based cantilever nanoelectromechanical device, which exploits the arrest of the nanotube in a pull-in state using the closed-loop feedback provided by the tunneling current at the cantilever end. This project will focus in the study of the device dynamics, its application to memory and logical operations as well as their large scale manufacturing. In contrast to other nanoelectromechanical systems, the device to be investigated does not rely on van der Waals forces to achieve the equilibrium configurations and therefore it is much more tolerant in terms of fabrication requirements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: In this work we propose to fabricate and experimentally characterize the recently invented carbon-nanotube-based cantilever nanoelectromechanical system. Moreover, a bottom up paradigm based on directed self-assembly of nanostructures will be explored in the manufacturing of arrays of devices. These developments are expected to impact the field of nanoelectronics and sensing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational and outreach component of this project will focus on providing opportunities to undergraduate and minorities students, through collaboration with existing programs within the NSF-NSEC at Northwestern University, to participate in 9-week summer internships. Likewise, modules on NEMS modeling and fabrication will be added to the classes the PI currently teaches&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
