<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit. The proposed work will address hypotheses regarding the&lt;br/&gt;biogeochemical interactions that lead to the removal of molybdenum, uranium, and&lt;br/&gt;vanadium from aquatic systems and the fractionation of Mo isotopes that occurs during&lt;br/&gt;organic matter decomposition. Our study site, Lake Tanganyika, is an ancient rift lake that&lt;br/&gt;has an oxygenated upper water column and sulfidic deep waters. The existence of&lt;br/&gt;sedimentary deposits underlying both these waters offers an exciting and timely opportunity&lt;br/&gt;to quantify changes in metal solubility and to test predictions regarding isotope fractionation&lt;br/&gt;associated with metal precipitation. Our work is guided by two hypotheses that predict a&lt;br/&gt;close link between metal accumulation rate and carbon cycling. These hypotheses predict&lt;br/&gt;different behavior for Mo isotopes depending on whether or not the overlying water has&lt;br/&gt;sulfide present. (1) In regions where the overlying water column is absent of sulfide, we&lt;br/&gt;hypothesize that trace element accumulation in the sediments and Mo isotope compositions&lt;br/&gt;are closely coupled to the cycling of organic carbon. (2) Where sediments are bathed with&lt;br/&gt;sulfide-rich water, we hypothesize that trace element enrichments remain sensitive to the&lt;br/&gt;organic carbon cycling but Mo isotope values are invariant. Although we use these&lt;br/&gt;hypotheses as a guide for our research, we do expect that the targeted elements will exhibit a&lt;br/&gt;range of sensitivities to organic carbon cycling and water column sulfide concentrations.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts I: Scientific value. The targeted elements already offer potential as&lt;br/&gt;biogeochemical tracers, and this proposal represents an exciting opportunity to address&lt;br/&gt;important issues regarding their environmental chemistry. Molybdenum isotopes also&lt;br/&gt;retain potential as a tracer for the availability of oxygen and sulfide through geologic time,&lt;br/&gt;and this proposal will allow us to examine how the presence of water column sulfide&lt;br/&gt;influences Mo isotope behavior. Finally, the African Great Lakes harbor rich records of&lt;br/&gt;climate history extending back to the Miocene. What we offer here is an opportunity to&lt;br/&gt;calibrate a suite of sedimentary tracers that could ultimately provide powerful insights on&lt;br/&gt;biogeochemical process, not only in Tanganyika, but in other sedimentary systems as well.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts II: Human impacts and opportunities for education. Lake&lt;br/&gt;Tanganyika is a valuable resource to the East African people. The lake contains a&lt;br/&gt;significant fraction of the Earth's fresh water and supplies the economies of several nations&lt;br/&gt;with a valuable fisheries resource. In a broad sense, this proposal offers tools for&lt;br/&gt;addressing questions related to how the lake's carbon dynamics have responded to past&lt;br/&gt;changes in climate. As part of this proposal, McManus will be participating in the Nyanza&lt;br/&gt;project during the summer of 2006. The Nyanza Project is an undergraduate/graduate field&lt;br/&gt;research program that offers opportunities to study paleoclimatology and geology in a&lt;br/&gt;continental rift cradling one of the world's oldest lakes. As a participant in the program&lt;br/&gt;McManus will be engaged in training both U.S. and African students, and we plan on&lt;br/&gt;having one African student and two U.S. students working on our field research. We will&lt;br/&gt;also support an OSU undergraduate during our second year of funding. Undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students have contributed significantly to the PI's research program resulting in abstracts&lt;br/&gt;delivered at major conferences, university-wide student research programs, and coauthorship&lt;br/&gt;on two manuscripts. Our college is beginning to engage students from our university's&lt;br/&gt;honors college in research and we are planning on initiating an REU program in the near&lt;br/&gt;term. We anticipate having a student from one of these programs participating in the&lt;br/&gt;proposed research as well. Finally, this proposal will provide support for a postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;research associate (Chris Siebert).</AbstractNarration>
