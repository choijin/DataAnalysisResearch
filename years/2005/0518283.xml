<AbstractNarration>The main focus of this research project is to create novel functional biocompatible materials from abundant carbohydrates that could lead to advancements in carbohydrate chemistry, materials science, biotechnology, and the biomedical field. This program will allow the discovery of novel materials with desired functionality based on renewable resources. Professor Wang's research will increase the availability of small molecule hydrogelators and allow others to explore their applications. The immobilization of enzymes using the hydrogelators obtained is important for biocatalysis, high throughput assays, and drug discovery. Diacetylene-containing hydrogelators can form stimuli-responsive smart gels that can be used as sensors for pH, temperature, and for sensing the presences of biomolecules and toxins. The new materials discovered will have biomedical applications as controlled release media, tissue-engineering scaffolds, and also for protein immobilization and purification. This will advance understanding of the correlation of molecular structures and macroscopic properties and help to guide other researchers in designing intelligent materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professor Guijun Wang of the University of New Orleans whose research involves several interdisciplinary research areas including organic synthesis, supramolecular chemistry, bioorganic chemistry and materials science. The broader impacts of the proposed work in addition to the potential biomedical applications are the training of students at all levels and the incorporation of this research into education. The training of students in these multidisciplinary areas will prepare them for future careers in biomaterials research, organic synthesis, and biomedical fields. Special efforts will be made to recruit undergraduate students, especially minorities, to conduct research, which can help to improve retention and stimulate interest in science fields. A website will be developed containing related scientific discoveries, background information, and career guidance for students. A planned future special topics course resulting from the current research and planned international collaborations will further increase the impact of this research program.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
