<AbstractNarration>Seismological studies have revealed the presence of large, low velocity anomalies&lt;br/&gt;in the lower mantle beneath Africa and the Pacific, and there is growing evidence that&lt;br/&gt;these anomalies may be caused by chemical heterogeneity, possibly due to a more-dense&lt;br/&gt;mantle component. A comprehensive geodynamical study into the development of&lt;br/&gt;thermochemical piles in the lower mantle will be undertaken by performing fully 3D&lt;br/&gt;spherical thermochemical convection calculations at Earth-like convective vigor which&lt;br/&gt;includes Earth's Cretaceous to present day subduction history. The proposed work&lt;br/&gt;involves a joint geodynamics-tomography approach to impose constraints upon&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous mantle models by direct comparisons between geodynamically-predicted&lt;br/&gt;and seismically-observed tomography. The objectives of this work are to:&lt;br/&gt;(1) develop a method of 'tomographic filtering' and spatial correlation which will&lt;br/&gt;transform geodynamic output to more closely resemble what it is expected to&lt;br/&gt;appear as from observational tomography.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Investigate the necessity of thermochemical models by determining whether&lt;br/&gt;isochemical models can predict observations from seismology. Previous work&lt;br/&gt;has hinted that this is not likely, however, only limited parameter sets have&lt;br/&gt;been observed.&lt;br/&gt;(3) To perform a comprehensive parameter search to understand how rheological,&lt;br/&gt;thermodynamic, and material properties affect the geographic position, areal&lt;br/&gt;extent, and height of dense thermochemical piles.&lt;br/&gt;(4) To ultimately place constraints upon the density and volume of dense piles&lt;br/&gt;that have been proposed to reside beneath Africa and the Pacific.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts associated with this work include providing resulting data to the&lt;br/&gt;GEON project which has been active in developing new, interactive methods to visualize&lt;br/&gt;3D geodynamical data sets with the ultimate goal of fostering collaborative efforts in&lt;br/&gt;science and education. In addition, new code development will be shared with the&lt;br/&gt;Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG). The proposed research will also&lt;br/&gt;form the basis of a Ph.D. student's dissertation, and will involve collaboration between&lt;br/&gt;seismology and geodynamics.&lt;br/&gt;-- &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robin Reichlin                                &lt;br/&gt;Geophysics Program Director                                                   &lt;br/&gt;National Science Foundation     &lt;br/&gt;4201 Wilson Blvd.,  Room 785                    &lt;br/&gt;Arlington, VA  22230                                                     &lt;br/&gt;PHONE  (703)-292-8556     FAX  (703)-292-9025&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upcoming Deadlines:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GEOPHYSICS:  December 1, 2004 (NEW EAR Program Announcement NSF 04-613)&lt;br/&gt;http://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsf04613&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSEDI:  August 25, 2005  (Program Announcement NSF 04-593) http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2004/nsf04593/nsf04593.htm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guidelines:&lt;br/&gt;NSF's latest Grant Proposal Guide is NSF 04-23 http://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg</AbstractNarration>
