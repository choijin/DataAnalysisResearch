<AbstractNarration>Inaccurate replication in the presence of DNA damage is responsible for the majority of cellular rearrangements and mutagenesis that are observed in abnormally dividing cells. DNA damage, such as that induced by UV irradiation, severely impairs the ability of replication to copy the genomic template and leads to the arrest of the replication machinery and gaps in the newly replicated DNA. The overall objective of this research is to identify the cellular mechanism(s) by which lesions encountered during replication are processed and repaired in vivo. This project utilizes two previously established cellular assays to monitor the molecular events that occur at replication forks arrested by DNA damage in vivo. This approach will identify the genetic requirements and conditions that determine when DNA repair or translesion synthesis functions at arrested replication forks to restore DNA synthesis. A second approach will characterize the genes and mechanisms that operate to process and repair lesions in the gapped substrates that are observed to arise in the newly replicated DNA of UV-irradiated cells. Through an understanding of how faithful replication is maintained in the presence of DNA damage, the conditions and events that can lead to mutagenesis, genomic rearrangements, or cell lethality will be elucidated. In addition, this project will be accomplished through a process that strengthens the undergraduate curriculum, creates a new molecular genetics laboratory for students, and increases student participation in research at this university. This project will significantly increase the number of potential young scientists that participate in research and increase the quality of science that students are exposed to in this region of the country.</AbstractNarration>

In addition, this research has been carried out at Portland State University, an urban institution that enrolls over 20,000 undergraduate and 3,800 graduate students, making it OregonÆs largest university.  Over 60% of the stateÆs residents live within commuting distance of the campus, and PSU has grown to become OregonÆs primary vehicle for meeting the stateÆs pre-professional and graduate education needs.  PSU now has the largest enrollment of MS and PhD students in the state and sends more undergraduates to nursing, dental, or medical school than any other Oregon university.  We have been able to effectively target our outreach programs and coursework with high school and community colleges, resulting in an unusually large proportion of new and first generation professionals among our PSU graduates.  The Biology Department has been integral to the growth of PSU, seeing our student enrollment increase by 65% in the last 5 years with growth projected to continue at a similar rate in the near future.  In 2004, we applied for and were awarded a PhD program for Biology by the State of Oregon, highlighting our growth in research strength in recent years.  Our department has pursued a consistent vision that has transformed the biology experience for undergraduates by focusing on 1) developing a research active faculty committed to undergraduate education, 2) providing undergraduate laboratory experiences that involve the latest equipment and software, 3) ensuring that our best and most committed students experience research as undergraduates, and 4) developing effective and successful outreach programs to serve our community colleges and OregonÆs K-12 teachers, which ultimately enhances the quality and performance of the students in our pipeline when they enter our program.  This research has provided training and research experiences for 7 graduate students, 12 undergraduates and 2 teachers from undergraduate colleges. I hav...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
