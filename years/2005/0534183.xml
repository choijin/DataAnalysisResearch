<AbstractNarration>Increasing concern with security issues in the world has led to greater interest in improving the technology and methods available for detecting deception. Under direction from Congress, the NSF and the Office of Science Technology Policy are facilitating a series of six workshops to address current and future research on the science and technology of security evaluations. This workshop focuses on identifying and interpreting behavioral clues in detecting deception including developing procedures for measuring behavioral variables and how technology may aide this process. Prior to the workshop, invited participants will communicate with each other through the exchange of a series of questions and answers via email. The workshop PI will serve as the pre-workshop email discussion leader and facilitator. The workshop will bring approximately 16 leading experts and practitioners together for two days in June 2005 at the NSF to continue the discussion begun via email. Both small group and large group discussions will be used to focus the ideas and experiences of the participants to outline the key issues and research questions that will underlie a series of proposed research directions. Participants will also address the ethical, legal and privacy concerns of current research. A final report will be prepared summarizing presentations and views of the workshop participants and the resulting research agenda.</AbstractNarration>
