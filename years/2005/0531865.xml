<AbstractNarration>The Biology and Mathematics in Population Studies program (BioMaPS) creates a research environment for mathematics and biology students to study the designs and patterns that exist in populations at the organismal and cellular levels. The objective is to equip 25 students over a five-year period with the skills to understand these patterns and to develop accurate models of biomedical and ecological phenomena.  The BioMaPS program promotes the integration of research and teaching in mathematics and biology by engaging students as both researchers and teachers. The students and faculty work together as research teams on integrative projects, asking innovative questions from both biological and mathematical viewpoints. The projects include modeling of ecological and evolutionary processes relating to fecundity, parameter identification, developmental stability, biodiversity, anthropogenic disturbances, and population fluctuations. Through a mentored research experience, undergraduates will gain insight into the connections that exist between biology and mathematics.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A defining aspect of the project is the collaboration of four female and three male investigators across two disciplines. These mentors have the ability to attract a diverse group of students based on their different but complementary backgrounds. The BioMaPS program will enhance existing partnerships with Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. In conjunction with the Biomathematics in the Commonwealth program, the BioMaPS program will promote the development of new partnerships with universities across Kentucky as well as nationally. The findings of the BioMaPS teams will be disseminated through presentations at local, regional, and national conferences as well as through peer reviewed publications. The BioMaPS program has the potential to increase enrollments in mathematics and biology by making a challenging and exciting area of study available to students.  The program advances discovery at the intersection of mathematics and biology by educating the next generation of professionals who can understand the mathematics behind the biology and the biological implications of mathematical models.</AbstractNarration>
