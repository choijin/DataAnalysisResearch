    <AbstractNarration>The investigator studies three broadly based areas of inquiry &lt;br/&gt;involving dependent observations. In the first area he develops &lt;br/&gt;accurate probabilistic tools for the study of self-normalized &lt;br/&gt;estimators in dependent variables. In particular he explores the &lt;br/&gt;intrinsic properties of long range dependence on the basis of &lt;br/&gt;the observed data. In the second area he develops copula based &lt;br/&gt;estimators for the probability of rare events in dependent data &lt;br/&gt;and introduces an approach for assessing the quality of models&lt;br/&gt;used in the prediction of these events. In the third area he &lt;br/&gt;develops a (probabilistically based) historical approach to &lt;br/&gt;boundary crossing under imperfect information and develops &lt;br/&gt;estimates for the expected time it takes a process to hit a boundary.&lt;br/&gt;The general nature of his approach provides estimates on ``average &lt;br/&gt;times'' rather than ``actual times''. Sensitivity studies are being &lt;br/&gt;performed to quantify the robustness of the estimates. The &lt;br/&gt;methodology is being calibrated by using extensive data banks on &lt;br/&gt;natural phenomena as well as by the use of computer intensive general &lt;br/&gt;circulation models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator is developing tools to aid in the understanding of &lt;br/&gt;the connections between historical information and the average time &lt;br/&gt;for the occurrence of natural events. He works closely with regulators &lt;br/&gt;in the development of general quality control tools with particular &lt;br/&gt;application to banking. His work is enriched by close interactions &lt;br/&gt;with graduate students contributing to the training and mentoring of a &lt;br/&gt;diverse group of scientists knowledgeable in the new approaches and &lt;br/&gt;able to formulate, develop and solve the problems they will encounter &lt;br/&gt;throughout their academic, public or industrial careers. His work has &lt;br/&gt;the potential of improving public confidence in banking and financial &lt;br/&gt;institutions as well as in enhancing the understanding of the role of &lt;br/&gt;historical data in the management of natural resources and risks.</AbstractNarration>
