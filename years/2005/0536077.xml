<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences (21). Based on the ConcepTests pedagogy pioneered in physics (e.g., NSF-DUE 9980802), and building on the Cornell University GoodQuestions project (NSF-DUE 0231154) that developed a library of classroom voting questions for calculus, the Project MathQUEST team is writing, testing, and evaluating a series of classroom (voting) questions for use in differential equations and linear algebra classes. Many of the questions are accompanied by commentary and discussion about their intent, explaining what issues they are designed to provoke and how they are expected to fit into a lesson about the corresponding material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work utilizes personal response systems, and an online database of approximately six hundred questions, correlated with linear algebra and differential equations texts, is being developed. This is an effective way to provide real-time feedback both to students and instructor, as well as to motivate students to participate in small group discussions of key mathematical concepts.  This method engages students by requiring every person in the class to consider a multiple choice or true/false question, to form an opinion, and to participate by registering a vote.  Evaluation methods include an external reviewer from the Cornell GoodQuestions project, as well as two discipline-specific consultants in linear algebra and differential equations, to evaluate prepared materials, provide on-site visits, and offer feedback for improving these materials.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The project is promoting the engagement of students in the classroom setting through the use of interactive components between students and teacher, and is  increasing the knowledge base related to improving student learning through the use of classroom questions and personal response systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Access to the online question bank database is being made available to everyone. Also, an e-mail listserv to help faculty develop their skills with classroom voting is being created to encourage discussion of problems, issues, and successes, and to foster a teaching community around this pedagogy.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
