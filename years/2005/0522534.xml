<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jane P. Chang &lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of California - Los Angeles&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0522534&lt;br/&gt;Title: Synthesis and Characterization of Erbium-Doped Metal Oxide Photonic Materials for Optoelectronics Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project involves the synthesis of erbium doped metal oxide thin films using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process with  -diketonate precursors to enable the incorporation of a high concentration of optically active erbium ions, while minimizing ion-ion clustering/interactions and maintaining the trivalent state of erbium. Specifically, it aims to study the reaction kinetics in an ALD process leading to a controlled doping of Er3+, implement state-of-the-art surface analytical techniques to elucidate chemical coordination and charge state of erbium as a function of erbium concentration, measure the photoluminescence and determine the absorption cross section for erbium ions, and integrate the synthesized erbium doped materials into micro- to nanometer scaled waveguides to test the optical performance. The success of this work will provide optimized processes for synthesizing optically viable erbium doped metal oxide thin films, and lay the foundation of future generations of more efficient optoelectronic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact is in the education and training of graduate, undergraduate, and high school summer intern students through engineering courses and hands-on research. Research outcome will be integrated into two courses developed by the PI to maximize the impact of the research, including an undergraduate laboratory course on Semiconductor Manufacturing and a graduate/undergraduate course on Surface and Interface Engineering. Female graduate students will be supported under this program to pursue Ph.D. studies. Senior research projects and summer positions will be offered to undergraduate students, especially women, to work on spectroscopic data collection and analysis to help their long-term career development in academia or industry. Summer internships will also be offered to female high school students through the outreach activities established by the PI to promote their interest in pursuing Science and Engineering when they enter college.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
