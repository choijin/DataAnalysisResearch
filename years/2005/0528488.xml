<AbstractNarration>Markov random fields (MRFs) provide a very general framework for&lt;br/&gt;capturing conditional independence in large collections of random&lt;br/&gt;variables.  The proposal is concerned with the spatial properties of&lt;br/&gt;MRFs, and with two widely used algorithmic paradigms for solving&lt;br/&gt;inference problems in them: Belief Propagation (BP) and Gibbs Sampling&lt;br/&gt;(GS).  Though widely used, these algorithms (especially BP) lack&lt;br/&gt;rigorous performance guarantees in most situations.  One major goal of&lt;br/&gt;the proposed research is a deeper understanding of the behavior of BP&lt;br/&gt;and GS for different classes of MRFs that arise in applications.  A&lt;br/&gt;central thesis is that the performance of these algorithms is&lt;br/&gt;intimately tied to the spatial structure of the underlying MRF.  By&lt;br/&gt;making this connection precise the project aims at an improved&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the algorithms and their relationship to one another.&lt;br/&gt;Based on this insight, a second major goal of the project is to&lt;br/&gt;investigate systematic methods for designing MRFs tailored to a&lt;br/&gt;specific application; the MRFs should have suitable spatial properties&lt;br/&gt;so that algorithms like BP or GS (or variants thereof) are both&lt;br/&gt;successful in practice and provably effective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Markov random fields are a rich class of mathematical models that are&lt;br/&gt;extremely well suited to capturing the behavior of large systems of&lt;br/&gt;independent components whose interactions are best described in&lt;br/&gt;statistical terms (rather than in terms of deterministic laws).  Such&lt;br/&gt;systems are ubiquitous in today's world.  As a first example, consider&lt;br/&gt;the millions of computers on the internet: the communication time&lt;br/&gt;between your computer and a given website is not a fixed quantity, but&lt;br/&gt;varies depending on the number of other users, the time of day etc.  A&lt;br/&gt;second example is the problem of modeling and predicting global&lt;br/&gt;climate, which depends on a very large number of factors that interact&lt;br/&gt;in statistically variable ways.  Modeling such applications with&lt;br/&gt;Markov random fields leads to a number of computational problems&lt;br/&gt;that---due to their extremely large size---are essentially impossible&lt;br/&gt;to solve exactly.  The primary goal of this research project is the&lt;br/&gt;development and analysis of efficient algorithmic methods for&lt;br/&gt;obtaining approximate solutions, with rigorous guarantees on accuracy&lt;br/&gt;and running time.  In light of the broad range of scientific and&lt;br/&gt;engineering contexts in which Markov random fields are used, basic&lt;br/&gt;research on these algorithms has the potential for very broad impact&lt;br/&gt;in many domains, including modern-day computing and communications&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure, intelligent systems for medical diagnosis, and the&lt;br/&gt;modeling of complex physical and biological systems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
