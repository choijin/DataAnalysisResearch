<AbstractNarration>This research is aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of developmental control in flowering plants.  These studies are focused on two genes (APETALA3 (AP3) and PISTILLATA (PI)) that control the identity of the floral organs in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana.  In ap3 and pi mutants, sepals develop in place of petals, and carpels develop in place of stamens.  Both AP3 and PI encode DNA binding proteins that are postulated to function together as a heterodimer.  Several lines of evidence suggest that AP3 and PI are components of a larger protein complex that is involved in specifying the identity of petals and stamens.  The goal of this research is to identify and characterize these additional components.  Two lines of investigation will be pursued.  First, the AP3/PI protein complex will be purified from floral extracts, and the components of the complex will be biochemically characterized.  Second, several novel genes identified in a genetic screen for PI modifiers will be cloned and characterized.  The proposed studies will have a number of broader impacts.  First, teaching and training of graduate students and undergraduate students will be promoted.  Two to three graduate students and four to six undergraduate students will participate in this project.  Second, these studies will enhance scientific understanding that will ultimately benefit society.  AP3 and PI are important for proper development of flowers.  Since flowers are the source of seeds and fruit, a detailed understanding of flower development has important implications for agricultural productivity and the quality of agricultural products.</AbstractNarration>
