<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Basor &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this project is to investigate the asymptotics of &lt;br/&gt;determinants of perturbations of convolution operators. Our goal will &lt;br/&gt;be to extend the classical  limit theorems to these operators, both for &lt;br/&gt;scalar and matrix-valued symbols, and for both smooth and singular &lt;br/&gt;symbols. For many of these operators, the constant term is the most &lt;br/&gt;difficult piece of the asymptotic expansion to describe. For &lt;br/&gt;matrix-valued symbols there are only a few cases where the constants &lt;br/&gt;can be explicitly described. In particular, we will investigate the &lt;br/&gt;asymptotics in the case of a perturbation of a Toeplitz determinant by &lt;br/&gt;a Hankel operator with possibly different symbol. Other classes of &lt;br/&gt;operators of interest are Wiener-Hopf plus Hankel operators and  Bessel &lt;br/&gt;operators. Classical operator methods will be used to study these &lt;br/&gt;problems as well as newer developments. For example, using the &lt;br/&gt;BorodinGeronimo-Geronimo-Case identity to bridge between smooth and &lt;br/&gt;singular symbols has been highly successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is increasing interest in finding asymptotic expansions of &lt;br/&gt;determinants of convolution type operators because they have &lt;br/&gt;connections to many problems in mathematical physics, including the &lt;br/&gt;Ising model (a model of a two-dimensional (or very thin) magnets), the &lt;br/&gt;classical dimer model, the entanglement problem in spin chain model, &lt;br/&gt;random growth models, and to the general area of random matrix theory. &lt;br/&gt;In these physical problems one is often interested in the complicated, &lt;br/&gt;unpredictable behavior of the models. Often a quantity that describes &lt;br/&gt;some statistical property of a system can be reformulated as a &lt;br/&gt;determinant approximation problem. The physical systems give &lt;br/&gt;predictions as to the right form of the approximation and show that &lt;br/&gt;many of the answers should be quite universal. The universality is &lt;br/&gt;especially important since it shows that many complicated systems and &lt;br/&gt;models are actually quite similar. Hence the idea is not simply to &lt;br/&gt;prove theorems and then find applications for the theorems, but to use &lt;br/&gt;the ideas of mathematical physics to give predictions of the &lt;br/&gt;mathematics and then conversely, to use the mathematics to tell us &lt;br/&gt;something about physical systems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
