<AbstractNarration>This project supports students at U.S. institutions to attend meetings of the Networking Networking Women (N^2Women) organization.  &lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the N^2 Women meetings and workshops is to foster connections among women in the communications and networking&lt;br/&gt;research fields. Each meeting will be co-located with a premier networking conference in 2017:&lt;br/&gt;IEEE INFOCOM 2017 in Atlanta, GA, ICCCN 2017 in Vancouver, Canada, and ACM SIGCOMM 2017 in Los Angeles, CA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this activity resides in the contributions that the student participants will make to&lt;br/&gt;(1) the N^2Women meetings, (2) the premier co-located conferences, and (3) the future scientific progress of the student's research.&lt;br/&gt;Participant support funds will allow these graduate students to attend high-quality technical presentations,&lt;br/&gt;be exposed to state-of-the-art research, and interact with leading researchers and fellow graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

She first outlined the evolution<br />a number of surprises of the Internet, and discussed methods for detecting Internet infrastructure outages, how to extend software-defined networking concepts to wireless networking, how to<br />achieve predictable performance in distributed systems. Finally, she gave an outlook on how we may evolve the Internet to tackle the future challenges of ubiquitous data availability from sensors<br />and devices everywhere. We also invited Professor Wenjing Lou (Virginia Tech) to give a keynote on ?The minority advantages: Benefits of being a female professor in science.? In this talk, she<br />shared with all participants about her 14 years of career experience as a female science professor and discussed on how being a minority can be an advantage in your career development, and ways to make it happen (i.e., a recipe of turning the lemons into lemonade). In addition, she shared her<br />role as a NSF program director, which offered a broad view of wireless networking and security research and funding opportunities from the perspective of NSF investment in these areas.</li> <li>In this workshop, we have developed a mentor/mentee program.<br />We would like to extend mentoring throughout the week for the students who are staying for SIGCOMM. In this case,<br />we are hoping to find mentors who can host mentees with similar research interests during the main SIGCOMM conference and workshops.
