<AbstractNarration>As more disciplines leverage computational and data-driven modeling, the security of campus cyberinfrastructure is becoming increasingly important in order to protect intellectual property and secure a competitive advantage for researchers. Often, facilities and projects funded by industrial partners and US government agencies create new institutional requirements for information security and assurance. Designed for open science, the Purdue University campus cyberinfrastructure does not currently have infrastructure in place to support the wide variety of security requirements stemming from this growing volume of aerospace, defense, and industrial projects being conducted on campus. The rapid pace of expanding partnerships has outpaced the campus cybersecurity framework, limiting the opportunities for researchers and students to conduct research. This project brings together engineering and research teams to develop a cyber attack detection and response capability for the Purdue University campus research network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project enhances the Purdue campus network to develop a security-assured research network infrastructure, and deploys novel adaptive monitoring tools as part of the campus cyberinfrastructure. Enhanced campus cyberinfrastructure empowers domain scientists to conduct research with heightened security requirements. The project also provides cybersecurity researchers with production network traffic data to develop and evaluate adaptive intrusion detection and response and flow-level anomaly detection. The proposed research will reduce the overhead of network security mechanisms, and improve their effectiveness, agility, and scalability. The project supports cybersecurity education and training by engaging students in deployment and operation of networking hardware and software. It provides students with a unique opportunity to apply their conceptual knowledge to practical situations and better prepares them to be part of the future workforce in cybersecurity. The highly interdisciplinary project team consists of security, networking and data science researchers, cybersecurity educators, campus Information Technology professionals and the engineering community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has enhanced the current high-speed, high-volume campus network to develop a security-assured research network infrastructure and deploy monitoring tools as part of the campus cyberinfrastructure. This enhancement empowered domain scientists to conduct research with heightened cybersecurity requirements. Improved network and perimeter security has enabled broader research impact through increasing partnerships with government agencies and industry, and strengthening Purdue's contribution to the Indiana economy in the long term.  Additionally, research on adaptive resource allocation will reduce the overhead of deploying the security mechanisms and improved their agility and scalability. Specifically, for intrusion detection systems that adapt to changing traffic load, research on developing an Elastic resource flexing system for Network functions VIrtualization (ENVI) will make scaling decisions based on an evolving neural network by periodically collecting data on system and infrastructure resources. Experiments with the Suricata Intrusion Detection System and the Web caching proxy Squid show that, compared to current rule-based policies, ENVI can automatically scale complex systems to avoid overload for varying workloads while achieving high resource utilization.  Learning a parametric Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) sequence model without examples of sequences, where the training data consists entirely of aggregate steady-state statistics, is used when we do not have sufficient samples of overload situations to train machine learning models.  The publications resulting from this project have been disseminated to interested researchers, educators, and the industry. The results have also been presented at major computer networking conferences and workshops such as ANCS, AAAI, and MOBICOM.  The paper on the campus deployment was voted as the Best Student Technical Paper in the "Facilitation of Advanced Research Computing" track at the PEARC 2019 conference.  The project has provided training for three graduate students, and has involved a large number of undergraduate and high school students. Experiences from this project have been included in the courses on computer networking and machine learning that the PIs teach.
