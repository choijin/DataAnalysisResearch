<AbstractNarration>An award is made to the University of Minnesota to acquire an Enhanced Climate Change Simulator, a unique instrument that simultaneously creates and measures future conditions outdoors in central Minnesota grassland, without chambers or enclosures, with the specific objective of simulating the atmospheric chemistry (CO2 concentration, atmospheric N deposition) and climate (temperature and rainfall) of the future, and monitoring a set of ecosystem responses. The Simulator includes equipment that modifies CO2, temperature and rainfall; and ancillary equipment to monitor and control those environmental variables, and to monitor abiotic and biotic (vegetation and soil organisms) responses of the ecosystem to the climate simulation. The Simulator will contribute to comprehensive research training for University of Minnesota students and postdocs, serve as a research platform for a wide array of collaborative and cooperative researchers at University of Minnesota and at other institutions, provide STEM education and training to primary, secondary and post-secondary students and educators, and provide public outreach through multiple media. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Simulator will contribute to important societally relevant scientific research. Only a handful of climate change simulators with similar capabilities exist around the world, and none controls as many aspects of future climate, nor has as long a continuous record of ecosystem response. Notably, the simulator will uniquely enable hypothesis testing about interactive effects of multiple global change factors on grassland ecosystems. Such interactive effects remain one of the biggest gaps in understanding that hinder predictions of whether terrestrial ecosystems will be resilient in the face of multiple global changes and whether their responses to global change will slow or accelerate the pace of climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award supported major upgrade of a unique outdoor field facility (the Enhanced Climate Change Simulator) that simulates future earth conditions for an important vegetation type. As such, it enabled the continuation and expansion of unique research experiments on the effects of rising CO<sub>2</sub> and climate change on the health and functioning of native grasslands growing in nature. The facility is important both because grasslands are a major component of global ecosystems but also because it operates as a model system for testing questions applicable to other ecosystems, such as forests, that are too large to test given limited available funding for this kind of research.&nbsp; Additionally, most facilities for environmental research are done in artificial conditions for short time periods (such as weeks to months) in controlled laboratory settings, which are excellent for certain types of research but of no use for other types that wish to understand longer term processes and changes. In contrast, the Enhanced Climate Change Simulator has enabled experiments of more than 22 years with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and of more than 9 years with experimentally warmed plants and soils, as well as different rainfall scenarios. The experiments have shown how loss of plant diversity, changing CO<sub>2</sub>, temperature and rainfall all impact the health, chemistry and growth of grassland vegetation. They also show how these global change drivers will influence how much carbon grasslands store in soils, and thus how they influence the extent to which grasslands more generally may be able to help slow climate change by increasing their carbon sequestration in soil. The experiments have been reported in multiple articles in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, adding to the collective scientific knowledge base. The findings have also been noted by policy makers and the global scientific community dedicated to understanding how we can mitigate and adapt to climate change. Finally, the facility has also been used for training, education and outreach.&nbsp; Dozens of undergraduates and graduate students have been involved in this research.
