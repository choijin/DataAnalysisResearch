<AbstractNarration>This award supports the purchase of an EyeLink Portable Duo eye-tracking system in the interest of advancing scientific exploration by faculty and undergraduate researchers at Carthage College, a small, liberal-arts institution. The EyeLink system provides researchers with a continuous report of where a participant is looking on a computer screen (relative to events within an experimental protocol) via the non-invasive measurement of near-infrared light waves as they bounce off the participant's cornea. Most of the eye-movements that people make are not under their conscious control. Consequently, eye-movements are a robust measure of online cognitive activity across many contexts and are frequently used as a proxy measure for attention. Researchers across disciplines at Carthage College will be using the EyeLink to explore a variety of topics, including: The relationship between eye-movements and awareness, how acuity changes across the visual field, the timecourse of eye-movement planning, the readability of fonts, interaction with video games, and visual search behaviors of expert and novice paleontologists at an archaeological dig. Beyond facilitating research, the EyeLink will be integrated with content in Psychological Science courses to ground and reinforce relevant concepts and increase student exposure to cutting-edge research methods. All the proposed studies - discussed below -will involve undergraduate researchers, thus affording students a rich opportunity to gain hands-on experience with this state-of-the-art research tool. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two principal investigators are faculty in the Department of Psychological Science who regularly engage undergraduates in senior thesis and summer research projects, and affiliated faculty from a variety of other departments have expressed interest in integrating the EyeLink into their research programs and student projects. The principal investigators study how information is sampled from the visual environment. The EyeLink will facilitate more direct testing of hypotheses in this domain. One study will explore whether entrainment to an irrelevant auditory rhythm impacts saccade generation during reading, an outcome that could adjudicate between competing models of eye-movements in reading. In a similar vein, a series of studies will explore the occurrence of express saccades, saccadic eye movements with a short latency (80-100 msec), during viewing of naturalistic environments. This interest in perception under naturalistic viewing conditions is echoed in two other projects. The first explores whether factors moderating attentional capture in artificial laboratory tasks continue to impact capture with dynamic, real-world stimuli. The second examines visual field inhomogeneities under more naturalistic conditions.</AbstractNarration>

The system noninvasively monitors participants? eye movements while viewing a computer display. In January, a representative from SR Research visited Carthage College to install and train a core set of faculty and student researchers on the system. Since the installation, the system has elicited great interest from undergraduate researchers and faculty across the college, and our laboratory space has been renovated to include a room devoted to eye movement research.    We have begun to use the tracker for community outreach.  In our Department, each semester culminates with public presentations by students completing their senior theses.  We have included hands-on eye-tracking demonstrations at these events.  We have also brought the eye tracker to a Carthage Library-sponsored function, which is open to the public.  We showcased the eye tracker as part of several demonstrations of perception and cognition in action.   With support from the Carthage Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) program, three students spent last summer learning to use the eye tracker and programming experiments to be conducted during the Fall 2018 semester.  These students will present their research on campus and at a regional psychology conference in the spring.  We also used the grant to motivate a new postdoctoral fellowship program within the Department of Psychological Science at Carthage College. We recently hired our first Teacher-Scholar Postdoctoral Fellow who specializes in eye movement research. Dr. Arryn Robbins engages in collaborative research with undergraduates at Carthage on topics related to eye movements and visual search. Finally, in an attempt to build interest among the student body, we organized a 1-credit seminar course on human eye movements which serves to introduce students to the breadth of research examining eye movements and the techniques used to do so. Ideas discussed in this class will likely plant the seeds for future student research.    Many experiments using the tracker are currently underway, in a variety of topic areas.    Dr. Anthony Barnhart (co-PI on the grant) frequently tests hypotheses inspired by performance magic. He has two experiments underway using the tracker.

Two undergraduate researchers are contributing to this project, which will be fulfilling one student?s thesis requirement for the Psychological Science major. Results from this project will be presented at the 2019 meeting of the Midwestern Psychological Association.   Dr. Barnhart?s second ongoing project using the tracker explores how a magician?s gender may impact that attentional deployment of their audience. Using a method developed in his previous eye movement research, we are monitoring participants? eyes while they watch a male or female magician perform a piece of magic that exploits inattentional blindness (our tendency to miss noticeable events while engaged in an attentionally-demanding task). Anecdotal accounts suggest that audiences may be more susceptible to inattentional blindness while viewing a female performer than a male. We are also exploring the extent to which any gender effect is modulated by other factors.    Dr. Leslie Cameron (co-PI on the grant) has initiated two eye-tracker projects.  First, she has been working with several students to explore the latency of saccades to targets in the so-called "gap" paradigm.  When there is a 200 msec interval ("gap") between the offset of a point of fixation and the onset of a target, some people make very short latency saccadic eye movements.  Thus far, we have replicated the basic finding and will continue to test participants to explore the possibility that the gap condition can result in the generation of a particular class of saccadic eye movements, known as express saccades.  The data collected to date have been part of group, class projects.  Second, Dr. Cameron has been working on improving students? ability to communicate clearly about graphical data.  In addition to working on this issue within a paradigm called Decoding the Disciplines, she is also exploring the eye movements and fixations of students and faculty as they interpret and describe graphs.  Dr. Cameron and one SURE student are poised to collect data and plan to present this work at the 2019 meeting of the Midwestern Psychological Association.
