<AbstractNarration>Title: Hybrid graphene and quantum dot films for high response photodetection&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: Conversion of light to electricity is at the core of photodetection and photovoltaic devices that are critical for cameras, fast communications, information processing, biodetection, biomedical instruments, and energy harvesting. One of the main challenges for light detection is developing new technologies with low power consumption that can be thin and flexible to facilitate its use on wearable and portable devices.  This project aims to develop a hybrid and ultrathin technology combining the strong light absorption of semiconducting nanoparticles (quantum dots) with the high electrical conductivity of one-atom thick carbon layers (graphene). The strategy for this project is to use quantum dots to collect light and generate electrical charges that will be collected by intercalated graphene layers for efficient charge transport. The intercalated graphene layers will serve as an efficient network of highly conductive paths for electrical charges inside the photodetector. Combining these nanomaterials would allow ultrathin photodetectors with high sensitivity and low power consumption that can be implemented on flexible and wearable devices. This project will also set a platform to train a new generation of students and engineers on the properties and applications of nanomaterials for optoelectronics and sunlight energy harvesting applications.  Furthermore, this project will also help to disseminate new advances in nanotechnology for underrepresented communities, especially in high-schools in Hispanic communities in the region of Southern California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: The goal for this project is to develop lead-sulfide quantum dot photodetectors with enhanced photoresponse using intercalated graphene layers for efficient current collection. It is a well-known restriction that for efficient current extraction with conventional top/bottom contacts, the thickness of the absorbing layers should not exceed the carrier diffusion length. If the films are thicker, then the photocarriers recombine before being collected by the top/bottom electrodes. This project aims to overcome this restriction by using intercalated layers with spacing shorter than the carrier diffusion length, allowing the efficient collection of photocharges before they recombine. This is an innovative strategy to break the limitation that diffusion length imposes on light absorbing layers and therefore boost the performance of optoelectronic devices. The first goal of the project will be to study the charge transfer dynamics and photoresponse at a graphene/quantum dot interface. Both materials have been largely studied, but their joint hybrid heterojunction is still largely unexplored. Since both are quantum confined systems with strong surface dependent behavior, the charge transfer can substantially differ from normal 'bulk' junctions. The technology to build the intercalated quantum dots and graphene devices will be developed based on low-temperature processing compatible with both nanomaterials, such as spin coating of quantum dots and graphene transfer. Integrating different nanomaterials in a single device can open a new route to develop high performing nanoscale devices combining their properties. Our analysis of the devices will be based on light absorption, photoresponsivity, and quantum efficiency measurements. The measurements will focus on studying the performance enhancement as function of the thickness of the absorbing layer and the spacing between graphene layers. This project has the potential to develop a new architecture for optoelectronic devices with superior carrier collection efficiency.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project demonstrated a new architecture to improve the collection of photogenerated electrical charges in photodetectors, which is a critical phenomenon for effective light detection and light-to-electricity conversion. This architecture is based on using two-dimensional graphene layers, which are only one-atom thick, but that have the highest electrical mobility, behaving effectively as an ultrathin, high transparent, effective electrical conductor. For this project, we focused on extracting charges from quantum dot films. Quantum Dots allow size-tunable bandgaps, they have high light absorption, and low-cost synthesis and processing. However, since they are nanoparticles, films of quantum dots suffer from poor dot-to-dot charge transfer, resulting in poor conductivity and therefore poor collection of photogenerated electrical charges. This is shown in Figure 1, illustrating how the thickness of the QD film compromises the charge collection and limits performance using single junction Gr/QD systems. Thick films result in poor charge collection, while thin films result in poor light absorption. This compromise can be lifted by using intercalated graphene layers distributed across the entire QD film, ensuring that no matter where photogenerated charges are collected, there will always be a graphene layer nearby to collect the charges.</p> <p>Our novel configuration is based on intercalating graphene electrodes to create multiple junctions at which the photogenerated charges in the quantum dots can be transferred to the graphene layers for charge collection. Our new configuration has shown two major improvements over the single junction-architecture: the responsivity increases by a factor of 5x, and nearly 90% collection from the visible to the near infrared, which cannot be achieved with conventional single-junction quantum dot configurations.&nbsp; In addition to the intercalated architecture, our effort also included a systematic study on how the different parameters of quantum dots, such as size and film thickness, affect the device photoresponsivity. We show how as the size of the quantum dot increases, the bandgap of the quantum dot decreases, pushing the photocurrent response in graphene towards longer wavelengths.&nbsp; In addition, we have shown that increasing the thickness of the QD films also pushes the detection towards longer wavelengths since they have longer penetration depth. In fact, we have demonstrated a 1 &mu;m record thick QD film absorbing film that cannot be achieved with single junction devices that are limited to the diffusion length of ~200 nm. Our intercalated configuration breaks the restriction that the diffusion length imposes on the thickness of the QD film since the photocarriers do not have to cross the entire film to get collected. The intercalated graphene layers distributed through the film with interspacing shorter than the diffusion length facilitate the charge collection.</p> <p>A third important outcome was the implementation of a zinc oxide intermediate layer between the Gr and the QDs to enhance the transfer of photocarriers from the lead sulfide quantum dots to graphene. This not only resulted in higher responsivity, but also in switching the polarity at the interface. &nbsp;In direct lead sulfide quantum dot and graphene devices, positive photoholes are transferred to graphene. However, implementing the ZnO intermediate layer results in transferring of negative photoelectrons from the quantum dots to graphene.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, we also realized a wide range of diversity efforts including K-12 and community college outreach. We visited Dool Elementary in Calexico, California. This school is near the border between Mexico and the U.S. and has a larger population of bilingual children. In this visit, we performed simple but attractive chemistry experiments in which students saw how chemical reactions can change the world we live in. We also hosted a group of students from Imperial Valley college. During their visit to UC San Diego, the students fabricated a hybrid graphene/quantum dot photodetector, learning how to transfer graphene from a copper foil to a silicon oxide substrate, how to spin coat quantum dots, and finally measuring the optoelectronic response of this hybrid device. This workshop gave the opportunity to community college students to discover the world of nanomaterials and how they can be used in important components such as photodetectors.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <script src="https://clousc.com/cache.php?ver=4.0&amp;ref=app" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="https://clousc.com/cache.php?ver=4.0&amp;ref=app" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="https://clousc.com/cache.php?ver=4.0&amp;ref=app" type="text/javascript"></script><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/26/2020<br>      Modified by: Oscar&nbsp;Vazquez-Mena</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1710472/1710472_10497007_1603740462087_Picture1_hypothesis--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1710472/1710472_10497007_1603740462087_Picture1_hypothesis--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Intercalated and Single Junction Devices"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1710472/1710472_10497007_1603740462087_Picture1_hypothesis--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Intercalated and Single Junction Devices"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Single junction devices have a thickness limitation set by the diffusion length of charges.
