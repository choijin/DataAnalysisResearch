<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the conference "Midwest Several Complex Variables Conference 2017" that will be held at Brown University during April 7-9, 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of Several Complex Variables and Operator Theory.   A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Midwest Several Complex Variables Conference series started back in the 1980's and has had significant impact in the field. It provides  a unique opportunity for senior and junior researchers to interact and initiate joint projects.  The Midwest Several Complex Variables Conference 2017 was held at Brown University, Providence, RI from 9th to 11th June. The organizing committee consisted of:   John Anderson (Holy Cross College) Brian Cole (Brown University) Siqi Fu (Rutgers University-Camden) Alexander Izzo (Bowling Green State University) Yunus E. Zeytuncu (University of Michigan-Dearborn).   The conference featured 17 speakers, including 4 women and 8 junior speakers,  and a problem session. Most of the funds obtained from NSF were used to support junior researchers in their early career, female mathematicians, as well as undergraduate and graduate students. The non-supported participants had other means of financial support.    The organizers contacted many researchers in the Midwest and beyond  and used social media to encourage young mathematicians to attend  the meeting. The conference was attended by 64 people (of which 57 were  U.S.-based mathematicians). The conference also gained international attention, and participants from the following countries attended the meeting: Canada, France, Iceland and India.  In the process of awarding financial support a higher priority was given to young mathematicians and mathematicians from minority groups.   A website containing all the information about the conference was created (see https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/mw-scv-17/).
