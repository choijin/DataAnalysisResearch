<AbstractNarration>The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU), a national, non-profit organization, has a long and distinguished record of providing summer internship opportunities through the organization's National Internship Program (HNIP).  Through HNIP, academically prepared students throughout the US and Puerto Rico have received quality internship assignments through various federal government agencies. Participants are exposed to various career options in the Federal sector that serve as a basis in helping students make informed career choices and solidify career objectives.  By partnering with the Federal government, HACU has been able to successfully place over 11,000 students in internships since NIP commenced in 1992.  In an effort to continue its collaboration with HACU, the National Science Foundation, a participating government agency, will offer challenging assignments that will broaden the exposure of students pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).  Internships create a unique opportunity to strengthen the human capital infrastructure to achieve excellence in STEM education, and help the Nation prepare a competitive, diverse STEM workforce ready to meet future challenges through discovery and innovation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intlellectuall merits of the project rest on the fact that this program benefits HACU particiapnts in a varierty of ways as it helps them make more informed academic and career decisions around their STEM interests..  The financial commitment  allows them tthe opportunity to garner an National Science Fondation(NSF) internship that would have been otherwise untenable financially. The interns get to intereact with professionals at the NSF that can offer them guidance. Many of these interns come from underrepresented groups in this field and it allows them to  enter the pipeline of professional opportunites in the federal government. This internship experience offers underrepresented STEM students the opportunity to use their acquired academic skills and apply them to a professional setting.  Many of the students are first generation students and gain access to career pathways into the federal government.  Throughout the internship experience, students are monitored and evaluated in respect to their performance  Over the course of the summers 2019, 17 interns participated in the NSF Summer Scholars Program as they came to Washington DC for 10 weeks from different geographic regions of the United States They receved professional development opportunties around topics that enhanced their professional knowledge, skills and attitudes.  Some of the interns during this time also received supplemtal funding to attend conferences that allowed them to explore their field of interests further as well.  An example of this type of confernece is the Sociery for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics in Science National Diversity in STEM Conference.  The HACU National Internship Program has served as a launching pad for many particiants that have worked at NSF through the internship.  By providing an intenship opportunity that allows students to explore STEM careers and receive mentorship from NSF interns will have a stronger network and insight into potentai careers.
