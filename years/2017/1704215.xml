<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><div id="MathJax_Message" style="display: none;"></div> <p>The project studied the foundations of analysis on metric spaces with the goal of improving our understanding of concepts like embeddings, differentiation, analytic inequalities and self-similarity. Analysis here means the study of geometric and quantitative objects, as well as their relationships, invariants and dynamic changes. The context was metric spaces, which either arise as abstract objects in the theory or as discrete objects related to computational and algorithmic problems. Our project yielded contributions to thirteen publications improving our understanding as well as introduced new tools in this field. The contributions touched upon four concepts: Self-similar Carpets, &nbsp;Modulus, and Differential Structures.</p> <p>Carpets are metric spaces homeomorphic to the standard Sierpi&#324;ski carpet. They arise in the context of the well-known Kleiner-Kapovich conjecture. It is of interest to understand and construct examples of such carpets with analytic properties, such as Loewner and Poincar&eacute; inequalities. Jointly with Cheeger we gave a large new class of examples of such carpets and proved a number of their properties. These examples, which we call snow carpets, are explicit and have self-similarity. In fact, an approximation of one of them is shown in the attached image. They serve as concrete examples to study and help in understanding the complexity of the previously mentioned conjecture. Jointly with Gong we also showed the existence of many non-self similar carpets which are Loewner, and connected these carpets to geometric notions such as quasicircles and uniformity. Underlying this notion was a new idea of iteration, which also yielded three contributions in the theory of self-improvement.</p> <p>Modulus is a weaker notion than Loewner or Poincar&eacute; for measuring richness of curves in a space. The project sought to understand positive modulus and spaces that admit positive modulus families of curves. We showed that such families of curves impose rigidity of bi-Lipschitz maps even in fairly irregular settings. This yielded a new "splitting theorem" for modulus as well as several non-bi-Lipschitz embedding results. One of these results answered negatively an open problem posed by Heinonen and Semmes by showing that the slit carpet does not embed into Euclidean space; see attached image for an approximation of the slit carpet. Interestingly, this non-embedding result also had a different and fairly short proof involving a quantitative differentiation argument. These results opened up a new possibility to study the geometry of families of curves supporting modulus and lead to new questions.</p> <p>Extending even further from the contexts of modulus, one may study the abstract theory of Sobolev spaces with as weak assumptions as possible. Towards this the project contributed towards a new result, with a remarkably short proof, that on certain cuspidal domains in Euclidean spaces two definitions of a Sobolev space coincide. Further, we studied the geometric descriptions of Sobolev spaces in general complete metric spaces and introduced a new p-differential for functions and a p-differential bundle for doubling metric spaces. Underlying these contributions is a new approximation method of Sobolev and Lipschitz functions, which lead to a sharper bound on duality. This approximation method has already shown promise for other applications and is expected to yield further insights. Overall, we now &nbsp;understand differential structures better and have new methods to approach problems about them.</p> <p>Related to the research goals, the project also sought to give research opportunities to students, equitable access to mathematics and to build a sense of community. In the first regard, we mentored three students in reading projects related to the project. We also volunteered for HOLA&nbsp; (Heart of Los Angeles) to tutor socially disadvantaged youth in mathematics. We continue such projects after the grant. Finally, we jointly organized a workshop on research in Analysis and Geometry, as well as helped jump-start a virtual seminar "Quasiworld" bringing researchers together from around the world to discuss topics on quasiconformal maps. Such virtual events show promise in giving equitable access to research and in inspiring new research results.</p> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML&amp;delayStartupUntil=configured" type="text/javascript"></script> <script id="texAllTheThingsPageScript" src="chrome-extension:/cbimabofgmfdkicghcadidpemeenbffn/js/pageScript.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML&amp;delayStartupUntil=configured" type="text/javascript"></script> <script id="texAllTheThingsPageScript" src="chrome-extension:/cbimabofgmfdkicghcadidpemeenbffn/js/pageScript.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML&amp;delayStartupUntil=configured" type="text/javascript"></script> <script id="texAllTheThingsPageScript" src="chrome-extension:/cbimabofgmfdkicghcadidpemeenbffn/js/pageScript.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML&amp;delayStartupUntil=configured" type="text/javascript"></script> <script id="texAllTheThingsPageScript" src="chrome-extension:/cbimabofgmfdkicghcadidpemeenbffn/js/pageScript.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML&amp;delayStartupUntil=configured" type="text/javascript"></script> <script id="texAllTheThingsPageScript" src="chrome-extension:/cbimabofgmfdkicghcadidpemeenbffn/js/pageScript.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML&amp;delayStartupUntil=configured" type="text/javascript"></script> <script id="texAllTheThingsPageScript" src="chrome-extension:/cbimabofgmfdkicghcadidpemeenbffn/js/pageScript.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML&amp;delayStartupUntil=configured" type="text/javascript"></script> <script id="texAllTheThingsPageScript" src="chrome-extension://cbimabofgmfdkicghcadidpemeenbffn/js/pageScript.js" type="text/javascript"></script><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/29/2021<br>      Modified by: Sylvester&nbsp;D&nbsp;Eriksson-Bique</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1704215/1704215_10477830_1622789531832_snowcarpet-black_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1704215/1704215_10477830_1622789531832_snowcarpet-black_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="An approximation of a snow carpet"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1704215/1704215_10477830_1622789531832_snowcarpet-black_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="An approximation of a snow carpet"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">An approximant of a new self-similar fractal space constructed in the project which is homeomorphic to the so called Sierpinski carpet, and which satisfies interesting analytic properties.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sylvester Eriksson-Bique</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sylvester&nbsp;D&nbsp;Eriksson-Bique</div> <div class="imageTitle">An approximation of a snow carpet</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1704215/1704215_10477830_1622789658250_slit4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1704215/1704215_10477830_1622789658250_slit4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Slit carpet approximant"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1704215/1704215_10477830_1622789658250_slit4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Slit carpet approximant"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">We proved that this metric space, equipped with the path metric, is - in the limit - impossible to embed well into Euclidean space resolving an open question in the field.
