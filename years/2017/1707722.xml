<AbstractNarration>This grant funds the travel of participants from the United States to attend the international conference "Analysis and Geometry on Graphs and Manifolds" to be held from July 31 through August 4, 2017, at the University of Potsdam in Germany.  The focus of this conference is the interplay between analysis and the geometry of the underlying space in both the continuous and discrete settings.  A main goal is to bring experts from these two different frameworks together in order to exchange ideas and develop techniques for a unified approach.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will focus on the prototypes for the discrete and continuous settings, namely, graphs and manifolds.  Both settings have an associated Laplacian and Dirichlet form which is non-local in the case of graphs and strongly local in the manifold case.  Thus, while there are many commonalities in terms of set-up and questions asked, the techniques are often quite different with no direct analogues between the two.  Recent advances in notions of curvature and intrinsic metrics in the discrete setting have lead to a better conceptual understanding of the similarities and differences between these two settings; however, a unified perspective is still incomplete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference website can be found at:  http://www.math.uni-potsdam.de/professuren/graphentheorie/events/conference/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Grant 1707722 facilitated the participation of a number of mathematicians working in the United States in the conference "Analysis and geometry on graphs and manifolds" which took place at the University of Potsdam in Potsdam, Germany from July 31st to August 4th, 2018.  The conference was organized by Radoslaw Wojciechowski (York College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York), the PI of the grant, in collaboration with Matthias Keller (University of Potsdam) and Daniel Lenz (Friedrich Schiller University Jena).  The idea of the conference was to bring together experts studying geometric properties via analytic tools in both the discrete and continuous settings.  The conference had approximately 90 registered participants and consisted of 5 days of talks.  Specifically, the morning session of each day consisted of four 30 minute talks by plenary speakers.  These talks were all videotaped and the videos for most of the talks are currently available on the conference website.  The afternoon session consisted of approximately 3 shorter talks.  Finally, on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, following the afternoon session, there was a Young Researcher's Symposium of approximately 5 short presentations by either graduate students or postdocs.  The talks of the afternoon sessions and the Young Researcher's Symposium were not taped but the slides of most talks are available online.  For more information, see the conference website: https://www.math.uni-potsdam.de/professuren/graphentheorie/events/conference/  The grant was used to cover the travel and lodging costs for 4 of the plenary speakers, 2 of the participants in the Young Researcher's Symposium and an additional 4 postdocs who all came from the United States to participate in the conference.  Outside of the talks, the conference offered ample time for interaction between the participants, fostering a creative and collaborative environment. Finally, there will also be a conference proceedings for the conference with two of the funded plenary speakers contributing.
