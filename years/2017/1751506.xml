<AbstractNarration>Title:&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: A Dual-Core Control Framework for the Next-Generation SiC Motor Drives&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;High-power motor drives lie at the heart of mobile electrified systems. Limitations imposed by silicon (Si) power semiconductor devices make it challenging to achieve the desired power density, efficiency, and reliability for future traction and propulsion drives. Fortunately, emerging silicon carbide (SiC) power devices enable a pathway to develop the next-generation motor drives. However, control practices must evolve from the existing approaches for Si-based motor drives to take advantages of SiC power devices. Innovations are also desired to address challenges related to the electromagnetic interference (EMI) issues due to the inherently faster switching of SiC devices, and the thermal management for higher heat fluxes. On the practical side, the research and development of high-power propulsion drives is hampered by the lack of testing facilities at a full power scale. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will develop and demonstrate a novel dual-core control concept comprising an electro-magnetic-thermal co-optimization framework for the next generation SiC motor drives. The proposed research plan will lead to an innovative solution overcoming the limitations of present control practices, and thus having the potential to transform the existing ways to model, monitor, and control the SiC motor drives. The research will be seamlessly integrated with several undergraduate and graduate courses as well as K-12 outreach activities at National Center for Reliable Electric Power Transmission (NCREPT) at the University of Arkansas. The main objective is to utilize research as a driving force to build a thriving and diversified power electronics program, and to inspire young individuals to pursue STEM careers. Thus, there will be various opportunities for student involvement in the research program, both in and out of the classroom, to develop a complete set of skills required in the power electronic profession.  &lt;br/&gt;The research goal of this project is to develop a dual-core control framework to co-optimize the electro-magnetic-thermal tradeoffs for the SiC motor drives. Control and optimization functions related to the performance of the motor and inverter will be implemented in two control cores. Critical information will be exchanged between the control cores to achieve the co-optimization objectives. More specifically, the research thrusts will include: 1) developing a novel model-based current ripple prediction approach and investigate ripple-based switching sequence optimization to mitigate EMI and reduce switching losses; 2) developing a reliable real-time junction temperature monitoring approach for SiC power modules and a new active thermal management method; 3) investigating a novel mixed-timescale modeling for the proposed dual-core control that also enables a new tool to study the stability of a power electronic system; and 4) revamping the megawatt-class NCREPT testing facility to develop a unique testbed for experimental studies at propulsion power levels. As an electro-magnetic-thermal co-optimization framework, the proposed dual-core control will disrupt today's model-based motor controller design practice. It will advance our understanding on the integration of real-time multi-objective optimization into motor drive controllers. It will also create a paradigm shift to address EMI mitigation and thermal management from the root causes, which are significantly different from the use of EMI filters and heat sinks that address only symptoms. In summary, this project will contribute to the theories and applications of optimal control, state estimation, variable switching frequency modulation, and thermal management in several aspects. Very importantly, the outcome of this research will benefit various sectors of the nation's economy because motor drive systems lie at the heart of a wide variety of industrial applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
