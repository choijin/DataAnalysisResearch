<AbstractNarration>Harnessing effectively the power of cloud computing and the benefits of ubiquitous data collection requires parallel advances in parallel algorithms, also known as multi-agent optimization. Unfortunately, these methods are vulnerable to cyber-attacks: if one or more of the platforms used is compromised and spreads incorrect values to other servers, the answers produced will be incorrect. It is not always possible to prevent this kind of attacks from occurring by relying on authentication alone. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies the vulnerabilities that exist in parallel algorithms, with the intent of understanding how to detect dysfunctional agents, isolate those that are compromised and restore the system functionality. The study of vulnerabilities in decentralized computation has important ramifications that go beyond the engineering discipline. In social science multi-agent optimization is used as a model for social learning. The study of malicious behavior will capture the effect of zealots in social settings that inject false information, steering the outcome of collective decisions towards specific actions that favors their interests.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Decentralized optimization algorithms have become in recent years the workhorse for machine learning with distributed data sources.  Inherently most algorithms are designed to trust each of the nodes/agents to provide accurate information, draw sensor data that are accurate and follow the correct update logic. Unfortunately, if any of these assumptions is wrong, these algorithms will fail to provide the correct answer.  The overarching goal of the project was to study the type of attack scenario that are possible and their impact, and to define new algorithm capable of sailing through such attacks.  The project focused on two main threads:  The first one, directly tied to the intellectual merit of the proposal, focused on distributed sub-gradient optimization (DSO) algorithms.  The second one was tied to our broader impact component, where we used our studies on consensus under the influence of malicious node to construct a mathematical model for social networks under the influence of zealots. We uncovered sophisticated/hard to detect attacks scenarios and introduced methods to process the updates  coming from the network to decide if or not to trust certain network agents. We provided countermeaures and a comprehensive view of hthe options available to deploy these security measures in practice.     The second research thread in thsi project was tied to our broader impacts section and pertained the analysis of misinformation campaign that afflict the social discourse and lead to poliriation of opinions. In fact, the primitive of average consensus has been studied separately by social scientist as a model for convergence of opinions in social networks.  In our social network work, we leveraged the work on average consensus under data injection attacks to capture what happens to their opinion dynamics when the social agents are exposed to pressure from zealots.  In particular we studied how the presence of zealots, that attack social learning by pressuring the remaining agents to follow specific polarizing beliefs, helps revealing social learning parameters that indicate the amount of trust/influence that the agents share.
