<AbstractNarration>An award is made to Columbus State University, University System of Georgia, to acquire a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to support and expand a diverse group of research programs within the Department of Biology, Department of Chemistry and the Department of Earth and Space Science. Ultimately, the incorporation of SEM technology to the curriculum of Columbus State University will directly increase undergraduate and graduate participation in research and encourage students to pursue careers as professional biologists, chemists, environmental scientists and geologists. Students working directly with faculty will use SEM technology to enhance on-going research programs that involve the university's field sites, museum collections, herbarium collections and molecular and chemistry laboratories. Research that includes an SEM experience will open up new opportunities to groups that are currently underrepresented in the Natural Sciences. The SEM will facilitate outreach opportunities for recruitment as well as the recruitment of high school students to STEM fields; Columbus State University will also work with regional two-year institutions that will make the SEM a part of their science courses as appropriate. SEM technology will also be incorporated into on-going STEM summer camps that target local high schools to underscore potential careers in the natural and biomedical sciences. The expectation is that some of the participating students will pursue careers including but not limited to: ecology, taxonomy, systematics, ecological genetics, entomology, chemistry and geology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will directly engage Columbus State University faculty, staff, graduate and undergraduate students across a diverse collection of disciplines such as biology, pollination ecology, conservation genetics, entomology, plant ecology, environmental science, geology and chemistry, to name a few. This research will ultimately aid in our understanding of the Natural Sciences, including the biological and physical diversity of the planet. In many cases research conducted by Columbus State University faculty, undergraduate and graduate students can now move forward with the use of SEM technology. For example, the analysis of pollen morphology by SEM technology will allow researchers to verify results obtained by molecular tools and provide resolution where data is currently absent. In particular, the SEM will be used for species identification and verification of pollen DNA barcodes as well as in the development and use of a number of educational, curatorial and bioinformatics programs for undergraduate and graduate education at Columbus State University. In turn, this would greatly facilitate international collaborations to utilize DNA barcoding to document global biodiversity.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A major goal for the acquisition of a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) at Columbus State University (CSU) was to expand a diverse group of research programs within the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, and Earth and Space Science in the College of Letters and Sciences (COLS). CSU is a regional, comprehensive, predominately undergraduate institution, in far western Georgia, and the preceding departments offer undergraduate degrees in Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Sciences, and Geology, as well as a Masters of Science in the Natural Sciences. The initial user group to employ the SEM represents a diverse collection of faculty across the three departments: Dr Burgess (Principal Investigator) studies pollen identification to enhance DNA barcoding data used to address questions in ecological genetics; Mrs. Elizabeth Klar (Co-Principal Investigator) conducts research on the correlation between aging and the occurrence of intersex in bass species and oversees the operation of the instrument; Dr. Clint Barineau (Co-Principal Investigator) studies tectonics of the Southern Appalachians and metamorphic history of rocks from the Blue Ridge and Piedmont composite terrains of Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina; Dr. Daniel Holley's (Co-Principal Investigator) research focuses on the modern polymer and nanoparticle characterization.&nbsp;The accessibility of the SEM on CSU's campus also includes researchers outside the initial user group. A diversity of research projects within COLS include, but are not limited to, studies on insect morphology for species identification, bacterial location in symbiotic relationships with plants, imaging of invertebrates for geometric morphometrics, elemental characterizations of ancient pottery, use-wear patterns on the margins of ancient stone tools, and the temporal and spatial dynamics of algal-based microbial communities composing algal wastewater treatment systems.The faculty and students learn how to operate the SEM and how to take research-grade photographs suitable for publication in high-caliber, peer-reviewed journals. Some of the research conducted with the SEM has been for obtaining morphological information or measurements while others have conducted EDS to obtain chemical composition data from their samples. The instrument has been used to collect data and images for the following undergraduate and graduate projects, just to name a few:1. Growth profiles of 34 million year old stingrays.2. Images of trilobites from a 500-million old fossil found in Georgia3. Geological samples such as historic soil samples and rocks4. Effects of herbicides on hydrilla tubers5. Morphology of zebrafish embryos6. Semi-quantitative chemical analysis of mineral samples7. Comparison of apatite compositions of fossilized and non-fossilized fish vertebrae8. Chemical analysis of mineral deposits in ancient bone fragments<br />The SEM is also being used for teaching in a variety of courses (e.g., Geology, Histology). For example, the SEM has been used by 6 undergraduate and 2 graduate students in an Ichthyology course to age otoliths of small freshwater fish. Demonstrations are conducted for courses in Histology and Geology, with hands-on exercises related to course content. Of note, the SEM is also continually being demonstrated to graduate students in the MS in Natural Sciences Program, which includes tracks in Biology, Chemistry, Geosciences, and Environmental Science.&nbsp;Images taken with the JEOL SEM were published in an article in the journal PALAIOS. This article was written by a faculty member* within the CSU Department of Earth and Space Sciences about his trilobite fossil research. In addition to the publication, one of the SEM images was selected to be on the cover of the PALAIOS May 2019 volume (Mrs. Klar captured the image using the SEM; See Schwimmer, David R.*, William M Montante. 2019. A cambrian meraspid cluster: evidence of trilobite egg deposition in a nest site. PALAIOS 34(5):254-260.)In addition, an undergraduate Biology student* presented her research in April 2019 at the Association of Southeastern Biologists in Memphis <span> </span>Tenn. This presentation included images taken of the vertebral centra of these stingrays (See Tillman, P.*, M.G. Newbrey, C. Boyd, and T.D. Cook. 2019.
