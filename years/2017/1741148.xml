<AbstractNarration>The project is funded by the STEM+Computing program, which seeks to address emerging challenges in computational STEM areas through the applied integration of computational thinking and computing activities within disciplinary STEM teaching and learning in early childhood education through high school (preK-12).  Computing and computational thinking are a central component of all STEM disciplines and a core 21st Century skill necessary for students' success in our global economy. The critical need for more robust and equitable pathways into high employability STEM and Computer Science (CS) fields is well-documented. This project expands and diversifies the college and career pipeline for high school students, particularly underrepresented students, by expanding access to the essential STEM and computing knowledge and skills demanded by the workforce. Building on an evidence-based digital learning model, EdAdvance and interdisciplinary partners in secondary education, higher education, and industry, will design, pilot test, and evaluate a series of CS courses that concurrently develop students' STEM and CS competencies. Newly developed digital CS learning modules will be integrated into a sequence of core required high school science coursework (Biology21, Chemistry21, and Earth &amp; Energy Essentials). This approach maximizes student engagement in rigorous computational learning across a concentrated course of STEM studies and facilitates national replication and scaling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aligned with the new coursework, over 1,200 students in 12 diverse school settings (urban, rural, and suburban) will collaborate in student-led teams to develop innovation challenge projects (ICPs) that present solutions to real world STEM and CS challenges. Students form product or service development teams and collaboratively establish their business or non-profit structure for ICP development. Student teams will present their ICPs at the nationally-acclaimed Student Innovation Expo, competitively judged by a panel of STEM and CS industry and higher education experts. For instructors, a comprehensive professional development model, including a Summer Institute, instructional coaching, and professional learning communities, prepares educators to implement the curricula with fidelity and advance their STEM and CS content knowledge and pedagogy skills. Resources developed over the three-year project period will be published under an Open Education Resources license and disseminated statewide with the support of the Connecticut State Department of Education, the Connecticut Regional Educational Service Center Alliance, and the Connecticut Association of Public School Superintendents, and nationally through partner networks. Researchers will examine the impact of this coursework on students': 1) STEM and computing self-efficacy; 2) STEM and CS career and education interest; 3) computing skills; and 4) 21st century inquiry skills. Formative assessment results and yearly analyses of the outcomes and fidelity of implementation will be used to design, develop, and test the coursework iteratively. Results of this research will inform the approaches and conditions that support the integration of computing skills into core high school science content, and will contribute to research on effective pedagogy and pedagogical environments to achieve equitable STEM and CS learning for all students.</AbstractNarration>
