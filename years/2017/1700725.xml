<AbstractNarration>This proposal is requesting travel support for participants (including students, early career scientists, and invited speakers without the necessary financial means) to participate in a five-day Chapman Conference on Dayside Magnetosphere Interactions to be held in Chengdu, China on 10-14 July 2017.  The conference is focused on open questions about the manner in which solar wind mass, momentum, and energy penetrate into the Earth's magnetosphere on its sunward-facing side.  The underlying mechanisms are responsible for the development of space weather disturbances around Earth.  The workshop is timely due, among other things, to the availability of a growing collection of multi-point observations from operating scientific satellites and new techniques for constructing global maps of electrodynamic parameters from both satellite arrays in low earth orbit and instrument networks on the ground. In addition, new insights are expected from comparing mechanisms for the penetration of solar wind plasma at Earth to those at other planets.  An international workshop is particularly valuable for progress because many of the combined data sets are the result of international collaborations. Chapman conferences have a long history of successfully bringing together international researchers (and students) in a workshop style atmosphere to address open questions at scientific frontiers. Such an environment, which intermixes a wide variety of viewpoints and diverse participants, provides a known incubator for new and innovative approaches that have the potential for enabling breakthroughs.  This environment is also a valuable educational experience for students and an opportunity for international networking.  Following the meeting, proceedings will be published in a volume of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Geophysical Monograph Series, which is expected to document the state of the field in this scientific area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only a few percent of the solar wind striking the Earth's magnetosphere actually penetrates through our magnetic barrier.  However, this small amount is responsible for the development of dangerous space weather disturbances throughout Geospace and the upper atmosphere.  Understanding the manner by which this penetration occurs will lead to improved forecasting of space weather disturbances and help to address a national priority focused on protecting and/or mitigating damage to critical space-vulnerable societal infrastructures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[AGU Chapman Conference on Dayside Magnetosphere Interactions Chengdu, China 10-14 July 2017   The American Geophysical Union sponsored a Chapman Conference on Dayside Magnetosphere Interactions. The Conference addresses the processes by which solar wind mass, momentum, and energy enter the magnetosphere. Regions of interest include the foreshock, bow shock, magnetosheath, magnetopause, and cusps, the dayside magnetosphere, and both the dayside polar and equatorial ionosphere. The meeting is particularly timely due to the results expected from NASA?s MMS mission which was launched in March 2015, arrays of new ground-based instrumentation currently being installed, and the ongoing operations of NASA?s THEMIS, ESA?s Cluster, and JAXA?s Geotail missions. Parallel processes occur at other planets, and recent results from NASA?s MAVEN mission to Mars, as well as ESA?s Mars and Venus Express missions was actively solicited.   The AGU Chapman Conference on Dayside Magnetosphere Interactions was held in Chengdu, China from July 10-14, 2017. This conference brought together 128 conference participants from over 20 countries. Conference participants were very satisfied with the quality of the science presentations (both oral and poster) and the opportunity for networking during the conference.  Many attendees felt that the conference broaden their perspectives of the topic and they learned something useful for their research.   This five-day conference included a series of invited tutorials on processes in the dayside magnetosphere and two overview talks on recent results from the MMS and Cluster mission. The tutorials allow graduate students and scientists with different expertise to become familiar with various topics. Presentations were given by a highly reputable group of scientists.   The funds from the NSF Award was used to support fourteen conference participants, most of them are graduate students and early career scientists.   The main objective of the conference was to present new results on dayside magnetospheric interactions based on datasets from Cluster, MMS, THEMIS, and Van Allen Probes since the last AGU Chapman Conference on Physics of the Magnetopause was held more than twenty years ago in 1994.

Two publication products have been produced as a result of the conference.  An AGU Monograph containing 25 chapters, is in progress entitled, "Dayside Magnetosphere Interactions".  The conference also produced a Special Issue in the Journal of Geophysical Research-Space Physics on the topic of this conference (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/toc/10.1002/(ISSN)2169-9402.DAYMINTER1).
