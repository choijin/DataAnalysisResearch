<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The United States faces significant challenges in rapidly and efficiently bringing emerging science and engineering innovations to use in industry and commerce. To maintain our world leadership in scientific and engineering research and education, we need processes that enable the practical and scalable application of promising discoveries from research and university laboratories. For university research to achieve greater impact, academic researchers and their students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) need tools and preparation for evaluating whether research discoveries can be readily translated into practical applications and eventual commercialization. For these reasons, NSF established the I-Corps training program in 2011 to support NSF-funded researchers in learning how to evaluate their scientific research for commercial potential. The National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance, Inc., d/b/a VentureWell, proposes to continue its work with NSF to plan, implement and evaluate five (5) additional I-Corps workshops (National Team Trainings) and two (2) National Faculty Training events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The I-Corps program provides NSF-funded principal investigators and their team members with funding&lt;br/&gt;and training enabling them to evaluate their technologies and research discoveries for commercial&lt;br/&gt;feasibility. The ultimate goal of the program is to increase the economic and societal impact of NSF&lt;br/&gt;research funding directly, through commercialization of research, and indirectly, by equipping scientists&lt;br/&gt;and engineers with skills and experience in developing and testing economically scalable models for the&lt;br/&gt;development of a product or technology. By the end of the program, I-Corps grantees are expected to&lt;br/&gt;reach a decision about the commercial readiness of their technology or product and take with them a set&lt;br/&gt;of skills that they can continue to apply in their research careers. Program participants evaluate and&lt;br/&gt;translate their research into applications that have commercial potential and can benefit society. Many&lt;br/&gt;participants will have identified promising commercial pathways that can lead to new high tech ventures&lt;br/&gt;or licensing opportunities. Since the program's inception, I-Corps teams have formed 350 companies that&lt;br/&gt;have attracted over $83 million in follow-on investment and grants. These companies operate in a broad&lt;br/&gt;range of sectors including health, energy, materials, agriculture and information technology and are&lt;br/&gt;geographically distributed across 43 states.</AbstractNarration>

Through our work with NSF on the I-Corps<span><sup>TM</sup></span> program, we have created a streamlined, repeatable process that has been successfully scaled to 14 cohorts per year over the past eight years, totalling 76 courses. During this expansion, VentureWell's execution and oversight of the program has ensured fidelity to the curriculum, consistently high-quality instruction and coaching, and seamless course management. To best evaluate program progress and results, VentureWell tracks economic and social outcomes of the course through surveys administered pre- and post-course, and at two separate time points after program completion, as well as through Pitchbook and tracking published federal awards. These data are collected, catalogued, analyzed, shared, and archived. VentureWell uses this data to inform and make improvements in the course and curriculum, and in doing so has designed information systems to hold and update this data for maximum integrity and real-time updates.</span></p> <p dir="ltr">Using this data, we find clear economic and social benefits of the I-Corps<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;program. Since the program's inception, I-Corps<span><sup>TM</sup></span> teams have formed 818 companies that have attracted more than $431,000,000 in follow-on investment and grants (see images 1-3 for a breakdown of the amount and type of follow-on funding raised by NSF I-Corps participants). These companies operate in a broad range of sectors including health, energy, materials, agriculture, and information technology, and are geographically distributed across 48 states. Based on follow-up survey data on teams through 2017, 319 teams had at least one participant engage in licensing activities following the course, and 58 teams had at least one participant who reported at least one granted patent. Pitchbook data indicates 1,272 jobs have been created by I-Corps<sup><span>TM</span> </sup>resulting businesses. Further, learnings from I-Corps<sup><span>TM</span></sup> become lifelong tools that scientific and technical researchers can apply continually and teach others, maximizing the impact of their ideas on the world and the economy. Using our evaluation and data infrastructure, we are able to report key demographic outcomes of the course over time (see images 4-6 for a breakdown of participant demographics across time), and work with NSF to understand how these outcomes could improve further.&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr">Several related grants, each with different scope, have in part supported this significant effort since 2011. Through this particular award, VentureWell supported the implementation and evaluation of teams in five national cohorts, including one pilot variation on the established course structure and one faculty training. This award also supported VentureWell in taking significant steps towards evaluations and data system optimization for the I-Corps<sup><span>TM</span></sup> program, with activities including conducting analyses of consistency by comparing participants' post-course ratings for the newly formed Upstate New York Node offering to existing nodes' first delivery of the course, and preparing the curriculum and curated best practices for pedagogical improvements. As the program grows, it is critical that program outcomes, pedagogy, and follow-on results are continuously evaluated in order to monitor and maintain the quality and consistency of the program. This award significantly contributed to VentureWell's ongoing efforts towards these goals.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/20/2019<br>      Modified by: Philip&nbsp;J&nbsp;Weilerstein</p>
