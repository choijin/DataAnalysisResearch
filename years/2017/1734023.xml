<AbstractNarration>This workshop aims to increase the diversity of the geoscience mentor pool through training that also serves to position young scientists of diverse backgrounds to serve as sea-going scientists or co-Chief Scientists participating in Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) research. It also aims to bolster the pipeline and build effective local networks through the pairing of high school teachers with these early career scientists. The workshop thus offers synergy by increasing the diversity of (1) scientists who are positioned to contribute both to IODP science and geoscience more broadly, and (2) mentors who research shows stand a better chance of positively influencing the educational and/or career pathways of undergraduate students of color (Kendricks, et al., 2013; Summers and Hrabowski, 2006). Direct scientific benefit will come from increasing diversity among the pool of young scientists that are broadly engaged in IODP science, allowing measurable impact on the trajectory of undergraduates in STEM fields through programs such as STEM Student Experiences Aboard Ships (STEMSEAS; Chang et al., 2014). This is a high priority for the NSF, UNOLS and other federally-funded programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop focuses on an opportunity to entrain a diverse cohort of young scientists into the geoscience- and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP)- pipeline, and at the same time, to position these same individuals to have measurable impact on the trajectory of undergraduate students from diverse communities nationwide through effective mentoring and engagement in critical issues of societal relevance.&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goals of the proposed workshop are to:&lt;br/&gt;1 - Encourage early career scientists and secondary-level educators from communities that remain poorly represented in STEM fields, and particularly geosciences, to participate.&lt;br/&gt;2 - Showcase and educate about Joides Resolution (JR)/IODP capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;3 - Increase the diversity of the talent pool that will apply to sail on IODP and related expeditions in the future.&lt;br/&gt;4 - Build a diverse mentoring pool for undergraduate STEM/geoscience students.&lt;br/&gt;5 - Create local partnerships to bolster the STEM/geoscience pipeline.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We hosted a 17-day sea-based professional development workshop during a transit on the drilling vessel JOIDES/Resolution (JR) from Subic Bay, Philippines to Townsville, Australia during Summer 2017. We hosted scientists partnered with K12 educators from communities that remain poorly represented in the geosciences in general, and in International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) science in particular.  Our objectives reflected strong leveraging between programs for which we recognized potential for robust synergy.  As IODP staff and scientists, and contributors to the STEM Student Experiences Aboard Ships (STEMSEAS) program, the organizers saw an opportunity to entrain a diverse cohort of young scientists into the geoscience- and IODP- pipeline, and at the same time, to position these same individuals to have measurable impact on the trajectory of undergraduate students from diverse communities nationwide through effective mentoring and engagement in critical issues of societal relevance.  The overarching goals of the workshop were to: (1) encourage early career scientists and K12 educators from communities that remain poorly represented in STEM fields, and particularly geosciences, to participate in the workshop; (2) showcase and educate about JR/IODP capabilities; (3) increase the diversity of the talent pool that will apply to sail on IODP and related expeditions in the future; (4) build a diverse mentoring pool for undergraduate STEM/geoscience students; and (5) create local partnerships to bolster the STEM/geoscience pipeline. The workshop was extremely successful in broad terms and we expect that some of our longer-term objectives will be met in time.  The participants worked during and following the workshop to add to our intellectual objectives and broader impacts objectives on several fronts. Participants that partnered from the Austin, TX area, Rachel Bernard and Colleen Henegan, published an education article focusing on bringing specialized microscopes into K12 classrooms to exam rock samples. Their article is: Bernard, R. and Henegan, C. (2018) A Polarizing View, The Science Teacher, v. 85, no. 1.  The article stemmed from work they did during the workshop to add a lesson plan to Colleen's high school AP Environmental Science class covering three required topics through the use of classroom microscopes: (1) the rock cycle; (2) intrusive vs. extrusive igneous rocks; and (3) porosity vs. permeability in sedimentary rocks. The lesson plan was readily adaptable to any high school or middle school course that covers the rock cycle or polarization of light, and addresses several standards including the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS). The lesson plan relies on accessibility of rock samples, microscope slides with thin slices of rocks mounted on them ("thin sections"), and polarizing filters. The filters transform a standard high school classroom microscope into an instrument appropriate for viewing rock thin sections. Rachel and Colleen created five classroom kits (called RocKits) for loaning to teachers in conjunction with the lesson plan. The RocKits are still currently available at Rachel's webpage following her move from TX to CA for a postdoctoral fellowship (https://www.rachel-bernard.com/rockits).   Another outcome stands out in that it touches on both intellectual merit and broader impacts.  Participant Dr. Diane Thompson initiated a twice-daily open ocean water sampling strategy in support of one of her basic research objectives.  This work contributed not only to ongoing research and equity initiatives (3 funded proposals), it connected the workshop organizers with her collaborator Dr. Jess Conroy at the University of Illinois.  Dr. Conroy reached out to the STEMSEAS project PIs (PI Lewis of this workshop and Sharon Cooper) proposing that the undergraduates on STEMSEAS ship transits likewise collect water samples twice-daily in the open ocean.  This work was woven into the Broader Impacts of an NSF Career Award to Dr. Conroy thus enabling STEMSEAS participants to do follow up work in Dr. Conroy's lab.  Synergies of this type continue to materialize as a direct result of the 2017 workshop.   Another outcome is from participant Kim Hatch, faculty member at Long Beach City College. The appended JPG file (Kim Hatch project) summarizes outreach activities that he spearheaded with great success in 2018.  Kim held pop-up events at three major College/Community fairs.  His events showcased IODP science as well as geoscience careers.    The participant team from central MA, Drs. Kerrita Mayfield a K12 teacher, and Mark Leckie a professor of geoscience at UMass, established a mechanism for Kerrita?s students to participate in field geology activities locally.  This type of exposure to STEM and to nearby higher education opportunitites provides on-ramps for Kerrita's students from Holyoke, MA, a community with a substantial population of underrepresented minority youth.   Lastly, participant Kim Hatch, faculty member at Long Beach City College, created content related to the geoscience pipeline. At 3 university/community pop-up events in 2018 he shared (see image): (1) career handouts; (2) pathways to a college major in geosciences by trasfer mechanisms to UC or CSU; (3) microfossil slides; and (4) JR videos.
