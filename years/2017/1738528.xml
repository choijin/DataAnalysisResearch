<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate compatibility of a novel polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) composite coating with metal-polymer bearings currently on the market, scale up the coating deposition process, and implement pilot processing lines. Currently, there is a need for a method to improve adhesion at the PTFE/metal interface while also reducing corrosion, friction, and wear. The implementation of this technology will aid in the transition from traditional lubricants to solid lubricants in manufacturing and has significant implications for the US economy and the environment. Currently, annual lubrication-related maintenance costs are as high as $1 trillion, and consumption of petroleum-based lubricants is estimated to reach 43.78 million metric tons as of 2016. The effective implementation of this technology will reduce maintenance costs and downtime by eliminating premature bearing failure. This project will serve as a proof point for the adoption of nano-coating technologies for reducing friction and wear in mechanical systems. It will also reduce barriers to entry for these coatings in industries dominated by outdated lubrication practices. The total applicable market size for metal-polymer bearings is estimated to be $1.0 billion, and a substantial near-term revenue opportunity for the proposed technology in this sector will be the focus of this effort. This beachhead opportunity serves as an industry validation point for the proposed technology and an entry point to other industrial and manufacturing applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is based on improving the adhesion and mechanical properties of PTFE liners in metal-polymer bearings using an adhesive biomimetic polymer. This technology increases the wear-life of PTFE coatings, allowing for applications from which they have historically been precluded due to high wear and delamination. During Phase I, the proof of concept was established through demonstration of strong adhesion, 40% reduction in friction, 80% reduction in wear and elimination of susceptibility to corrosion in current metal-polymer bearings. The focus of Phase II will be in tailoring the coatings for specific product applications and implementation. The proposed SBIR Phase II work will overcome the remaining technical hurdles and validate the use of this technology as both a solution for improving the adhesion between PTFE and substrates and as a replacement for current PTFE liners in metal-polymer bearings. The execution of this project will allow the realization of critical proof points needed by industrial partners and speed the adoption of this technology into product lines.</AbstractNarration>

The following were the specific objectives set out for this project:  1. Optimization of the coating exclusively for PTFE extruded film composite 1.0 lined bearings.  2. Optimization of the coating exclusively for PTFE extruded film composite 2.0 lined bearings  3. Optimize the adhesive technology within our coating to bond PTFE to EPDM rubber for Diaphragm Pump applications.  4. Develop a solid lubricant for chain driven drive trains that can be used in wet and muddy environments.  Due to the low surface energy of PTFE, adhesion to other materials is problematic. The use of PTFE in some engineering applications requires the increase of surface energy by chemical etching. PTFE surfaces have been etched using corrosive materials such as sodium-naphthalene and sodium-ammonium complex solutions. These solutions are highly toxic, making them difficult to store and dispose of.  Alternatively, mechanical keying methods can also be used. Here, PTFE composites are diffused into a porous metallic sublayer.  This creates a low-friction surface that is composed of both the porous metal and the PTFE composite.  Although this method shows excellent wear resistance and durability, it exhibits a coefficient of friction significantly higher than that of the PTFE composite material.  To solve this issue, at Surftec we developed a bonding method to attach extruded PTFE composite films to metallic substrates for metal/polymer bearing applications and to attach molded PTFE sheets to EPDM rubber for diaphragm pump applications.  Objectives 1 and 2 were both accomplished resulting in extruded PTFE film lamination with an adhesion strength of 16.1 lbf for extruded PTFE composite 1.0 and an adhesion strength of 12.2 lbf for extruded PTFE composite 2.0 (these composites are not identified to protect confidential information).  In both studies, failure occurred at the level of the extruded PTFE film, indicating that our adhesive coating creates an irreversible bond between the metallic substrate and the extruded PTFE laminate.  This process shows significant potential to replace traditional mechanical keying methods used in industry.  The advantage of SurfTec's adhesion method lies in preserving the low-friction properties of the extruded PTFE composite film.  In Phase I of this SBIR, tribological tests revealed a coefficient of friction of 0.15 which is 40% lower than what was observed in commercial samples.  Most notably, SurfTec?s coating also had a wear rate approximately 80% lower than commercial metal/polymer bearing surfaces.   In PTFE-EPDM diaphragm pumps, adhesive failure at the PTFE-EPDM interface is the main cause of failure. To bond PTFE to EPDM rubber, the PTFE surface is chemically etched using sodium-naphthalene or sodium-ammonium. One problem with this method is that it requires PTFE sheets to have a minimum thickness to allow for material removal during etching.

In this study, SurfTec's adhesive technology was used to replace chemical etching of PTFE sheets prior to bonding to EPDM rubber. Objective 3 was accomplished resulting in a PTFE-EPDM rubber adhesion strength of 35.6 lbf.  As seen in objectives 1 and 2, adhesive failure occurred at the level of the EPDM rubber.  This means that failure no longer occurs at the level of the PTFE-EPDM interface and the adhesive strength of the component is now significantly higher than in traditional etching methods.  Objective 4: Oil based lubricants are traditionally used in most chain driven applications. These lubricants effectively reduce frictional losses and extend the life of the components on which they are applied. The disadvantage of oil-based lubricants is their propensity to attract and hold dirt and sand which can be very problematic in gravel riding.

The drawbacks to dry lubricants are: 1) They quickly lose their lubricating properties and must therefore be reapplied much more frequently than their oil-based counterparts. Over time, most lubricants will inevitably begin to fail and may even produce byproducts that promote corrosion and wear of the chain. In this study we compare a novel hydrophobic lubricant, SurfTec 4-105, to traditional oil-based lubricants and commercially available dry lubricants.  The results, as seen in Figure 1, show that SurfTec?s formulation 4-105 reduces wattage expenditure in the power train by 17% compared to as-received SRAM PC 1110 chains.  Surftec 4-105 also showed a 2% reduction in energy losses compared to the closest commercial lubricant.  The resulting product has been licensed to a lubricant manufacturer and is currently available on the market.          Last Modified: 07/28/2021       Submitted by: Samuel Beckford]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
