<AbstractNarration>This research explores new directions in the representation of signals, based on certain&lt;br/&gt;mathematical ideas introduced by Ramanujan many decades ago. In particular the applicability of&lt;br/&gt;Ramanujan-sums in the representation of digital signals is studied in detail. Signals acquired and&lt;br/&gt;stored in many scientific areas such as speech, music, medical, genomic, and finance often&lt;br/&gt;contain hidden periodic patterns bearing important information. These are difficult to identify and&lt;br/&gt;localize because of the large volume of data, and extreme localization of information.&lt;br/&gt;Conventional representations of signals based on Fourier and wavelet transforms are not efficient&lt;br/&gt;for this purpose. This research involves the use of Ramanujan-sums to develop new&lt;br/&gt;representations that are efficient and economical. These offer insights into the role of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, especially number theory, in representation of signals in science and technology,&lt;br/&gt;with emphasis on particular hidden structures such as periodicities. Such representations are&lt;br/&gt;expected to have significant impact in scientific applications involving large data bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the research goes deep into Ramanujan subspaces, nested periodic subspaces,&lt;br/&gt;and Ramanujan filter banks, which are crucial to the representation of periodic sequences. This&lt;br/&gt;enables one to address some fundamental research problems in signal processing. This includes&lt;br/&gt;the minimum information that should be gathered from a discrete-time signal in order to identify&lt;br/&gt;multiple periodicities, the design of digital filter banks that serve as projection operators onto&lt;br/&gt;periodicity subspaces, and optimal design of dictionaries of atoms to represent sums of periodic&lt;br/&gt;signals with unknown integer periods. The research also involves the theory and implementation&lt;br/&gt;of gridless methods to achieve super resolution in period-estimation for continuous-time signals,&lt;br/&gt;and extension to two- and higher-dimensional signals.</AbstractNarration>
