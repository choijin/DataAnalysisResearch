<AbstractNarration>Three projects concerned with analytical and topological aspects of operator algebras are to be investigated. Operator algebras is an area of mathematics that emerged from the matrix mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics discovered by Heisenberg and further developed by von Neumann. The new (quantum) variables used in this theory are ensembles of (possibly infinite) matrices that satisfy suitable regularity properties. They are organized in various algebraic structures, called operator algebras, that can realized as linear operators acting on Hilbert spaces. The passage from functions to matrices often involves a process of quantization/deformation in which geometric structures are discretized in such a way that important topological spatial relations are distilled in the form of numerical invariants. The principal investigator will explore the theory of such deformations in the larger context of operator algebras. The goal is to exhibit and study new classes of algebraic and geometric structures which admit special deformations into finite matrices that capture subtle topological properties. The invariants that are to be investigated are intimately related to those that arise in the physics of novel materials such as topological insulators with crystalline symmetry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more technical terms, the purpose of the first project is to explore the class of connective C*-algebras. Connectivity is a homotopy invariant property with significant permanence properties. It has important consequences pertaining to absence of projections, finite dimensional approximations such as quasidiagonality, and geometric realizations of K-homology. The second project is devoted to embeddability into AF-algebras. The principal investigator will investigate K-theory invariants associated to quasi-representations and topological obstructions to quasidiagonality. For the third project, the principal investigator will explore characteristic classes of continuous fields of strongly self-absorbing C*-algebras in the framework of the generalized Dixmier-Douady theory that were developed with Ulrich Pennig.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The award supported research in Operator Algebras, an area of mathematics that emerged from the matrix formulation of Quantum Mechanics and its subsequent refinements. Our research focused on topological and geometric aspects of Operator Algebras.   The symmetries of geometric objects are organized in algebraic structures called groups. K-theory is a generalization of linear algebra where one allows for continuous families of linear spaces and linear maps parameterized by points in a geometric space.  For instance, the Moebius strip can be viewed as a family of one-dimensional linear spaces parameterized by a circle.   In our project, we studied how finite dimensional matrix approximations of groups or of operator algebras capture K-theory invariants.  In joint work with R. Willet and J. Wu, we proved a new duality theorem in K-theory, which identifies the K-homology of an algebra with the K-theory of a certain dual algebra, defined using asymptotic commutants.  Unlike the Paschke duality, our duality does involve any shift in dimension. This result has already found applications in index theory.    In previous collaborative work with U. Pennig, we introduced the concept of connectivity for a C*-algebra and we proved that connectivity that characterizes those separable nuclear C*-algebras whose K-homology can be represented by matricial deformations. As part of our project, we proved asymptotic stability for new large classes of connective groups. In particular, all finitely generated nilpotent groups are asymptotically stable.  A Bieberbach group is a torsion free crystallographic group.  In joint work with Ellen Weld, we solved the problem of which Bieberbach groups are connective in all dimensions.   A discrete group G is matricially stable if the finite dimensional approximate unitary representations of G are perturbable to genuine representations in the point-norm topology.  For large classes of groups G, we proved that matricial stability implies the vanishing of the rational cohomology of G in all nonzero even dimensions.  The Principal investigator has advised four PhD students, two of whom have graduated in 2020. Results obtained in our research were presented at several international meetings and in extended series of lectures at Universities in USA and Europe. We have co-organized the perennial Wabash seminars series and mini-conferences.       Last Modified: 08/13/2020       Submitted by: Marius D Dadarlat]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
