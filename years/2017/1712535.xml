<AbstractNarration>The last decade has seen great advances in scientific experimentation.  In biology, for instance, it has become routine to collect complex data that simultaneously quantify the levels of expression of many genes or proteins.  This project addresses the development of statistical methodology that allows processing of such data to obtain insights on cause-effect relationships among the units in the studied system.  Specifically, the proposed research addresses two key challenges, namely, how to tackle problems in which some important variables remain unobserved, and how to cope with the presence of causal feedback loops.  The research develops statistical techniques to infer cause-effect relationships and expands our understanding of which conclusions may possibly be reached under imperfect information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both feedback and latent variables bring about great challenges in graphical modeling because, in their presence, consideration of conditional independence is no longer sufficient to characterize and compare models.  This project focuses on linear models that allow for refined modeling of feedback loops and/or the effects of latent variables.  The PI will develop criteria for parameter identifiability, which is no longer guaranteed with feedback or latent variables.  The work will also determine conditions for when a model is of expected dimension as given by a parameter count.  Knowledge of dimension is needed for instance when setting degrees of freedom in statistical tests.  Next, the project will lead to a better understanding of constraints other than conditional independence.  Finally, the PI will develop new model selection methods in Gaussian as well non-Gaussian models.</AbstractNarration>

This project focused on graphical modeling of data from observational studies, which remain a primary source of information in the many problems in which experimentation is costly, difficult or unethical. Statistically, the observational case amounts to data in the form of a single sample from a distribution in a graphical model.  In this setting the proposed research made progress on two key challenges, namely, how to cope with the presence of latent (i.e., unobserved) variables and how to cope with the presence of feedback loops.    The research led to new combinatorial criteria to decide parameter identifiability in complex imperfectly observed models with or without feedback loops.  These criteria considered the case of linear causal relations and leverage algebraic relations among the parameters of interest and observable covariances.  Moreover, new algorithms were proposed for computation of parameter estimates in Gaussian and non-Gaussian models.  The progress on parameter identification also lead to new inferential method that solve model selection tasks in non-Gaussian graphical models with latent variables.  Finally, new statistical tests were developed that are able to assess hypotheses of independence.  These tests may be used in particular to assess independences among stochastic error terms appearing in the specification of the considered graphical models.   Several Ph.D. students were involved in specific parts of the project.  The outcomes were disseminated through publications in statistical journals, and extension packages for the R project for statistical computing.
