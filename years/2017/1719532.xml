<AbstractNarration>The research funded by this Rapid Response Research Grant supports the collection of data on post-disaster relocation decision-making. In coming years, the frequency and intensity of coastal flooding are anticipated to increase because of rising sea levels and amplified storm severity.  While there have been numerous studies of decision-making around temporary evacuation, surprisingly little is known about how people decide whether and when to leave permanently.  Ephemeral data collect by this project will be used to understand the factors that affect how people make migration decisions.  Findings from this research will be of use to city and regional  planners and local and state governments as they prepare for the outcomes of future disasters.  Therefore, a University of Georgia team composed of architect Brian Orland and anthropologist Meredith Welch-Devine will take advantage of the recent occurrence of Hurricane Mathew to learn more about how extreme events affect relocation intentions.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The researchers will focus their investigation on the Georgia coast. Hurricane Matthew's impact on the Georgia coastline offers an unusual opportunity to investigate how residents experienced the storm and how that experience affected thinking about future migration. The storm passed the Georgia coast at low-tide so the resulting surge was particularly revealing of where the future impacts of projected sea level rise and future storms would likely occur.  Residents now understand who will be impacted and how severely by future storm events. Because most residents eventually were able to return their homes, they comprise an ideal population from which to collect baseline data for longitudinal research.  The researchers will survey coastal residents about their beliefs and attitudes toward climate change, sea-level rise, storm events, and emergency preparedness. The survey data will be complemented by in-depth interviews with a sub-sample of residents stratified by social and economic status. The data will also be used as a baseline for future post-storm research in the area, as well as by social scientists seeking to improve theories of what factors most affect people's relocation choices after extreme events.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In the face of Hurricane Matthew, in October 2016, and Hurricane Irma, in September 2017, evacuation orders were issued to coastal residents of Georgia, and many fled the coast to take shelter in locations away from the threat of storm-related damage and flooding.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither storm was as bad as expected although Matthew resulted in $500 million in insured losses, Irma in $336 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the effects of such storms are compounded by ever-rising sea-level on the Georgia coast; nuisance flooding of the highway connecting Tybee Island to the coast is now a regular occurrence.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of rising sea level and more frequent and damaging storms, policy makers and planners might encourage coastal residents to leave the coast for less threatened areas, but there is little evidence that any migration is happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;People are attached to their homes, their neighbors and friends and sometimes lack the ability to move away for reasons of illness or poverty. &nbsp;</p> <p>We saw the aftermath of these two hurricanes as an opportunity to ask people with immediate and recent knowledge of storm effects to describe their attitudes and beliefs with respect to climate-related change and any intentions they might have to either move away from their current homes or to stay in place. We collected information in two ways: After Matthew we conducted 68 in-depth interviews with coastal residents and received 991 responses to an on-line survey.&nbsp;&nbsp;After Irma, we revisited 20 of the original interviewees and received 175 responses to a follow-up survey to our Matthew respondents.

Ensuring that coastal residents are well-prepared and supported to act in their best interests will require thoughtful and creative policy, and a strong commitment to equity.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the face of Hurricane Matthew, in October 2016, and Hurricane Irma, in September 2017, evacuation orders were issued to coastal residents of Georgia, and many fled the coast to take shelter in locations away from the threat of storm-related damage and flooding.  Neither storm was as bad as expected although Matthew resulted in $500 million in insured losses, Irma in $336 million.  However, the effects of such storms are compounded by ever-rising sea-level on the Georgia coast; nuisance flooding of the highway connecting Tybee Island to the coast is now a regular occurrence.  In the face of rising sea level and more frequent and damaging storms, policy makers and planners might encourage coastal residents to leave the coast for less threatened areas, but there is little evidence that any migration is happening.  People are attached to their homes, their neighbors and friends and sometimes lack the ability to move away for reasons of illness or poverty.    We saw the aftermath of these two hurricanes as an opportunity to ask people with immediate and recent knowledge of storm effects to describe their attitudes and beliefs with respect to climate-related change and any intentions they might have to either move away from their current homes or to stay in place. We collected information in two ways: After Matthew we conducted 68 in-depth interviews with coastal residents and received 991 responses to an on-line survey.  After Irma, we revisited 20 of the original interviewees and received 175 responses to a follow-up survey to our Matthew respondents. These are our findings:  Hurricane Matthew experiences factored heavily into Irma behavior.  After going through two hurricanes, people are developing "rules of thumb" based on the category of the storm and the angle at which it will strike. Respondents do not expect the worst from either sea level rise or increased storms accompanied by flooding.  Their concerns for either the region or personally for both kinds of impact fell between Neutral and Slightly Concerned. They were more concerned about the impacts of storms than sea level rise. Their concerns for personal exposure to sea level rise fell substantially after Irma.   Having experienced Matthew, fewer people chose to evacuate for Irma, citing the time taken to be able to get back and secure or repair their homes.  In making their choices, however, fewer relied on word-of-mouth to guide their decisions the second time around. While concerns are expressed, and the economics of repair have been challenging for some, the relatively small impacts of Matthew and Irma may be reinforcing the belief that the storms can be ridden out.  Sea level rise is less of an immediate concern and may be declining as a factor guiding people?s decisions to migrate or not. Factors such as age, household income, educational attainment, gender and distance/elevation relative to shoreline showed small and sometimes significant relationships to attitudes and expected behaviors, but not in any consistent patterned way.     Our data advance knowledge in understanding how coastal residents make decisions in the face of environmental change, their decisions shaped by numerous personal and physical location variables.  The word cloud charts accompanying this report indicate the values that draw people to the coast and show the range of issues impacting decisions in the aftermath of two significant ?wake-up? calls. We show that past experiences are important in determining future behavior, sometimes in ways we might not expect. Coastal Georgia residents appear to be becoming more comfortable with severe storms, and emergency managers may need to rethink their communication strategies, emphasizing the individuality of different storms.
