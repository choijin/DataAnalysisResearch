<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to conduct research and development of a novel secure communication waveform design technique in which not only the data of the communication is secure but the very existence of the communication itself is hidden. By exploiting a bio-inspired approach, a novel radio frequency waveform will be designed to serve multiple purposes and contain multiple layers of messages simultaneously. The developed radio frequency waveform exhibits no feature that can be exploited by the adversary to detect its existence through time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis, or cyclostationary analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project takes advantage of recent progress in the radar and communication communities and brings them together synergistically to develop an unprecedented low probability of detection, secure radio frequency waveform design. Existing low probability of detection waveforms do not provide a true low probability of detection and security capability when new advanced detection schemes such as cyclostationary analysis are brought to bear. This project employs a novel bio-inspired RF steganography scheme to obscure the communication signal within a radar signal. This newly designed signal remains an effective radar signal providing normal radar capabilities such as range measurement to its operators; but it also carries secure digital communication intended for designated receivers. Instead of limiting the transmission power of the signal in hopes of avoiding detection by the adversary, the newly designed waveform is broadcast at maximum power. However the adversary does not detect the existence of digital modulation embedded in the hybrid signal because it does not exhibit any feature when subjected to time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis, or cyclostationary analysis. This project is transformative because it provides a brand new way to design low probability of detection and secure communication and radio frequency systems, and it also paves the way to future development of a universal cognitive radio frequency platform where all radio frequency systems such as communication, radar, and navigation are designed jointly to optimize their performance and spectrum efficiency.</AbstractNarration>
