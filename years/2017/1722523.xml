<AbstractNarration>This is funding to support next year's CSCW doctoral research consortium (workshop) of approximately 15 promising doctoral students from the United States and abroad, along with 4-6 distinguished research faculty. The event will take place in conjunction with the ACM 2017 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, to be held in Portland, OR, on February 25-March 1, and which is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human Computer Interaction (SIGCHI).  The CSCW conferences are the premier venue for the presentation of research relating to the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities and networks (including collaborative systems and social computing).  The development and application of new technologies continues to enable new ways of working together and coordinating activities. Although work is an important area of focus for the conference, technology is increasingly supporting a wide range of recreational and social activities. CSCW has also embraced an increasing range of devices, as we collaborate from different contexts and situations.  Research published at CSCW is heavily refereed and widely cited; ranked as the second most impactful HCI conference by Google Scholar Metrics (after CHI), the 2016 event was attended by approximately 700 top researchers from academia and industry around the world.  CSCW 2017 will be the 20th conference in the series; more information may be found online at http://cscw.acm.org/2017/index.php.  The CSCW doctoral consortia, which began in 1992, have been highly successful in providing a forum for the initial socialization into the field of young doctoral scholars, and many of today's leading CSCW researchers participated as students in earlier consortia. These doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of CSCW researchers, allowing them both to sharpen the research skills and to create a social network among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. Maintaining and fostering research dialog among the diverse disciplines that are present in the CSCW community results in synergistic and transformative research collaborations. Because the students and faculty constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, including nationality/cultural and scientific discipline, the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Doctoral Colloquium at CSCW 2017 will be a 1.5-day event taking place on Saturday and Sunday, February 25-26.  Goals of the doctoral colloquium include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field mentor them and provide constructive advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference. The first day of the Colloquium will be an afternoon session to allow participants a chance to get to know one another with structured small-group activities, including modeling the tradition of practice talks and providing one another with feedback on their presentations.  Students who were paired for pre-colloquium feedback will listen to one another's talks and provide feedback.  Practice talks are a tradition in research labs with strong mentoring and training cultures; the Doctoral Colloquium will model this practice for students who may not be part of a large research lab.  During the second day, each student will make a formal 10-minute presentation about his or her doctoral research, culminating in a 20-minute session of discussion and feedback (both from members of the faculty panel and other student participants) on the work.  The feedback will be geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other CSCW research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  Additional feedback will be provided by faculty panel members in informal one-on-one discussions during meal times, break times, and throughout the remainder of the conference.  An informal working lunch will include an "interrogating research life" panel, in which mentors will give short statements and students will be encouraged to ask questions about different aspects of research life, including research career paths, funding, work-life balance, etc.  Follow-up activities (including poster sessions) will take place during the conference's main technical program.  Doctoral colloquium papers will be published in the Extended Abstracts for the conference, which will be available to attendees and online; in this way, the students' work will be disseminated in a more enduring form.  The organizing committee will take proactive steps to ensure diversity and increase participation from institutions and ethnic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented at CSCW; in particular, they will limit acceptances to a maximum of two students from the same institution.</AbstractNarration>
