<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Programs. Professor Adam Urbach from Trinity University and colleagues Laura Hunsicker-Wang, Corina Maeder and Christina Cooley have acquired an electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ESI-TOF-MS.) In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and study small quantities of chemical species within complex samples. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized into ions and the ions' masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows the structure of molecules in a complex mixture to be determined.  The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure both at the University and in the region. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students in research and research training using this modern analytical technique. It also provides training opportunities to many undergraduate students through a variety of programs that involve the chemistry, biology, physics, and engineering departments at Trinity, and colleagues at 2-year and smaller 4-year institutions in the San Antonio area, including Northwest Vista College, Our Lady of the Lake University, Palo Alto College, San Antonio College, Schreiner University, St. Mary's University, St. Phillips College, and University of the Incarnate Word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mass spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. The instrument may impact research on the development of methodologies for generating minimal protein affinity tags by means of protein semi-synthesis, on selective enzymatic digestion and on the development of a biosensing strategies through the synthesis of fluorogenic polymers from protein scaffolds. The mass spectrometer benefits investigations of the reduction potential in Rieske proteins using structural and electrochemical analysis and chemical modification of site-specific mutants.  Finally, the EIS-TOF-MS is used to characterize the role of the Dib1 protein in pre-messenger RNA splicing using a combination of structural, biochemical, and single-molecule techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant enabled the purchase of a new instrument that provides important new research capabilities to Trinity University, a primarily undergraduate institution in San Antonio, Texas.  The instrument comprises a high-performance liquid chromatography module coupled to an electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC-MS).  This instrument has become critical scientific infrastructure and has enabled substantial research accomplishments of the four co-principal investigators.  Several projects are highlighted here as important examples.     The Urbach Lab used the new instrument to characterize small proteins and their interactions with a synthetic receptor.  This work was an important step toward being able to detect and control natural proteins using synthetic and was published as a full article in Journal of the American Chemical Society with three undergraduate coauthors.  The Cooley lab used the new instrument to characterize the chemical synthesis of new initiators for making polymers that light up when they form, and of a drug that is designed to activate when it enters a site of an injury.  Their method for signal amplification is promising for applications in biotechnology and has already been applied to protein detection, with the instrument being crucial for characterizing initiators attached to proteins; this work was published in Chemical Science with five undergraduate coauthors.  Their method for drug activation demonstrates a potentially new therapeutic approach for certain disease states; this work was published in ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters with four undergraduate coauthors.  The Hunsicker-Wang lab used the instrument to characterize the production of proteins designed to study a core mechanism of cellular respiration.  Their studies, which incorporate the comparison of protein mutants and chemical derivatives of those proteins, has illuminated a chemical mechanism for the behavior of a key protein and suggests a role for the metal in regulating the activity of this system.  This work was published in Protein Science with nine undergraduate coauthors.  In addition, this state-of-the-art instrument has impacted many research groups and researchers.  Five research groups, including two postdoctoral research scholars, two postbaccalaureate research associates, and over twenty undergraduate research students have been trained on the instrument.  A new laboratory experiment was created for our core biochemistry laboratory course, and so far, 32 students have used the instrument through this experience.  Moving forward, this instrument will continue to be one of the most important research instruments in the department and will be central to the development of new research projects and new teaching laboratory experiences.
