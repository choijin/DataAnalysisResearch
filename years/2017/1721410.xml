<AbstractNarration>This project entails the build out of the simulation engine for a touch-based, mobile game designed to intuitively teach the basics of electricity and magnetism to children aged 5+.  The mobile game gives users a picture of what?s happening inside a circuit, and allows them to play with the charges, electric and magnetic forces, voltage, capacitors, transistors, etc.  The use of funds from this NSF SBIR Grant would include the research and development required to build and incorporate this simulator into the game.  This simulator is novel, is customized for educational use, must be extraordinarily fast, and is based on Maxwell?s Equations, the four equations that govern all of electricity and magnetism.  The successful completion of this project will create a new way of teaching electricity and magnetism to children, giving them a visual understanding of the concepts.  The goal is to make science and engineering more attainable subjects to pursue in higher education.  This will lead to an increase in the number of science and engineering graduates in the US, and help to close the international educational achievement gap, which experts agree represents over a $1T overall opportunity loss.  Besides having a profound effect on the US economy, this also benefits the individual.  In 2014, the DOE reported that the median starting income of a STEM (engineering) graduate was $74,000, almost $25,000 more than a non-STEM graduate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed real-time, interactive, multi-touch-based simulator would be the first of its kind; no combined two-dimensional field and circuit simulator exists today, particularly for use in an educational game.  This combined simulator only has 16 milliseconds to update its results, whereas a typical two-dimensional field solver could take minutes to hours to solve.  By using a novel simulator architecture and by focusing on speed and conceptual understanding at the necessary precision, the game simulator will be able to achieve the over 100x speed-up required.  The simulator needs to solve Maxwell?s equations and thus calculate and display the electromagnetic physics behavior at 60 frames per second, the rate required for interactive gaming. Several approaches are used to accomplish this.  This simulator is built from the ground up, with a unique choice of variables that prioritizes qualitative understanding over the circuit size and accuracy requirements of an industrial simulator.  The simulator focuses on components and circuits commonly used in teaching.  The simulator also utilizes the combined central/graphics processing hardware available in modern mobile devices.  With this simulator as the core gaming engine, the company is building a game where children as young as five can experiment with and intuitively understand the basics of electricity, magnetism, and circuits.</AbstractNarration>

"Combined" means that the 2 or 3-dimensional (2D/3D) fields and circuit nodal equations are simulated simultaneously and are interdependent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically, the focus is on electromagnetic fields, but other fundamental forces (such as gravity) and other physics behavior (contacts, collision, friction, damping, etc.) are often included in the game levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the simulator displays the electric fields, magnetic fields, and the energy per unit charge (voltage) everywhere on the screen (see figures for game level examples).</span></p> <p><span><span>At the start of phase I, Elloveo had roughly four dozen game levels in prototype form covering only electric fields and forces, with no field or voltage display.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Elloveo has a production-quality game including the engine and field/voltage display with over 100 levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;A single, robust game engine simultaneously simulates the electric, magnetic, and circuit behavior and allows the user to interact with and experience the forces and fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;The game is currently in the beta testing phase.&nbsp;&nbsp;Elloveo is currently running pilots in elementary, middle, and high schools for both user testing/feedback and to measure the educational efficacy.</span></span></p> <p><span><span>Broader Impact</span></span></p> <p><span><span><span>Elloveo's goal is to give kids the confidence that they can understand abstract, complex subjects like Electricity &amp; Magnetism by introducing the material in an interactive, engaging, visual way.&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, when the equations are introduced later, the material will not seem as daunting and difficult to understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The STEM, Common Core, NGSS, and other nationwide initiatives are all crafted to address the growing gap in technical education between the US and the rest of the world.&nbsp; Our game follows the guidelines set forth in these standards, while also presenting the material in a way that's accessible to learners in a broad range of ages.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>If schools embrace our technology, it's possible there will be a shift toward the more approachable, visual

Phase I grant period, Elloveo conducted classroom pilots with roughly 300 students.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have talked with many executives and designers from EdTech/gaming companies, as well as professors in

one-on-one discussions with a Director of a textbook publishing company, we have learned that their virtual labs allow students without access to expensive lab equipment to experiment with these physical concepts.&nbsp; This publisher already has a reach into school districts with all types of socioeconomic backgrounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope to partner with them in the near future, which would mean that Elloveo's engine would be used to create electricity and magnetism based virtual labs.&nbsp;Elloveo is excited about the opportunity to reach students of all backgrounds, by both partnering with companies such as this one, and making the game available on the App Store, in order to expand our reach and potential impact for students of all ages.</span><br
