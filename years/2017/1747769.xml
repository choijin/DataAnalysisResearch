<AbstractNarration>This project establishes the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Big Learning (CBL). With substantial breakthroughs in deep learning, the renaissance of machine intelligence is unfolding. The vision is to create intelligence towards the intelligence-driven society. Through catalyzing the fusion of diverse expertise from the consortium of faculty members, students, industry partners, and federal agencies, CBL seeks to create state-of-the-art deep learning methodologies and technologies and enable intelligent applications, transforming broad domains, such as business, media, healthcare, Internet-of-Things, and cybersecurity. This timely initiative creates a unique platform for empowering our next-generation talents with real-world relevance and significance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission is to pioneer novel deep learning algorithms, intelligent systems, and novel applications through unified and coordinated efforts in the CBL consortium via fusion of broad expertise from our large number of center faculty members, students, industry partners, and government agencies. The Carnegie-Mellon University site will focus on deep learning algorithms and platforms and work with other sites on novel applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CBL is expected to have broad transformative impacts in technologies, education, and the society. CBL seeks to create pioneering research and applications to address a broad spectrum of real-world challenges, making significant contributions and impacts to the deep learning community, the industry and the society at large. The discoveries from CBL will make significant contributions to promote products and industrial services in general and CBL industry partners in particular. As the magnet of deep learning research and applications, CBL offers an ideal platform to nurture next-generation talents through world-class mentors from both academia and industry, disseminate the cutting-edge technologies, and facilitate industry/university collaborative research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The center repository will be hosted at http://nsfcbl.org. The data, code, documents will be well organized and maintained on the CBL server for the duration of the center plus five years. The internal code repository will be managed by GitLab. After the software packages are well documented and tested, they will be released and managed by popular public servers, such as GitHub and Bitbucket.</AbstractNarration>
