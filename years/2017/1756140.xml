<AbstractNarration>The American public remains deeply divided about a range of social issues from inequality to immigration. Social media sites are often blamed for deepening such divisions by creating "echo chambers," or preventing people from being exposed to opinions from those who do not share their views. This research examines whether experimentally disrupting such echo chambers--by exposing a large sample of two antagonistic groups to social media messages from the opposing group--can increase moderation and compromise. The results of this research will thereby promote cooperation by helping policy makers and industry leaders design whether and how to regulate social media sites and ensure the inclusive deliberation that is essential for the function of our public institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Social scientists have become increasingly concerned that selective exposure to information within social media echo chambers may contribute to political polarization and divergent public attitudes about controversial issues such as inequality and immigration. This research draws upon social network analysis and social psychology in order to develop a set of hypotheses about the relationship between social media echo chambers and political attitudes and evaluates them via a mixed-method field experiment on Twitter that combines quantitative surveys, automated text analysis, and interviews with a large sample of Americans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project produced the first field experiment to study how social media echo chambers contribute to political polarization using both quantitative and qualitative methods. A large sample of Americans who use Twitter were offered financial incentives to follow bots created by the Primary Investigator's research team that exposed them to 24 messages from members of the opposing political party each day. In the initial study, approximately 1,200 respondents completed an online survey before and after following these bots for one month. In the follow up study, approximatey 120 respondents were interviewed in an open-ended fashion for 1-2 hours before and after following the bots. Whereas the first study identified a "backfire effect" that resulted from exposing people to opposing views-- that is, people became more partisan, and not less-- the follow up study provided critical information about the mechanism that produced this study-- specifically, a new theory about identity threat, status, and political polarization on social media. Together, the results of these studies have been published in leading journals, received national media attention from more than 30 different outlets, and resulted in multiple consultations with major social media companies about how to reduce political polarization on their platforms. The research was also instrumental in spawning a new research team-- centered at Duke university-- called the Polarization Lab. The Polarization Lab's mission is to create a new form of social media that will enable Americans to have more effective conversations about politics. Its research has already been published in leading venues, and covered by national media outlets. We also engage in regular consultations with government, community groups, and social media platforms as we develop this new forum.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/21/2020<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;Bail</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
