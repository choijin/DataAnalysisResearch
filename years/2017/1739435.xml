<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to renovate the support structure designs for part overhang geometries in powder-bed Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing (EBAM). It is hypothesized that the poor thermal conductivity of sintered powders is the root cause of part defects such as warping associated with part overhang (or similar) geometries. Hence, the required function of support structures is not from the weight-carrying standpoint; rather, the complex thermal and mechanical phenomena of the EBAM process, which lead to residual stresses and distortions, should be studied for functional support designs. Specifically, this research will characterize sintered powder porosity and its effects on thermal properties, develop finite element thermomechanical simulations incorporating porosity-dependent thermal properties for temperature and stress predictions in EBAM, evaluate overhang geometry effects on the part thermomechanical behaviors in EBAM and correlate with warping severity, and investigate different support patterns to evaluate the effectiveness of a designed support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this research will enhance the performance and efficient usage of the EBAM technology through improved and effective support structures. Thus, the project will directly benefit the users of metal Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies, strengthening the global competitiveness of the nation's industry. Collaborating with one of primary EBAM users, Marshall Space Flight Center, the research team may further apply findings to tackle pragmatic problems that exist in AM technologies. Moreover, new process understanding from this research will benefit studies on other powder-based AM processes such as selective laser sintering. In addition, working with the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, the research team will disseminate the project results timely and widely to the AM industry. Further societal impacts of this research include reviving high school students' interest in engineering and technology, particularly, from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The primary objectives of this research are to (1) understand the distortion associated with part overhangs in powder-bed electron beam additive manufacturing (PB-EBAM), and (2) renovate the support structure designs for part overhang geometries. In PB-EBAM, metallic particles (50 to 100 microns in diameter) are laid to one thin layer (about 100 microns thick) and then subject to electron beam scanning to heat, melt the particles and then fused at desired locations to form a solid object layer by layer. Because of repeated high-rate heating and cooling in the PB-EBAM process, parts produced are prone to have residual stresses and distortions. Such process-induced defects become worse for geometries like overhangs, undercuts or similar, which require adding support structures to constraint the overhang from deforming. However, the added structures have to be removed from the part after the fabrications, which increases the cost and decreases the production rate.</p> <p>Through a series of experimental and numerical studies, this project has achieved the following major outcomes. First, the project makes contributions toward fundamental understanding of overhang distortion behaviors in PB-EBAM. In essence, the powder particles underneath the overhang have a poor thermal conductivity, causing much worse heat dissipation compared to the non-overhang area, under which the solid material has a much higher thermal conductivity facilitating effective heat dissipations.</p> <p>Second, to overcome the overhang distortion issues, a new concept of support structures, which are not in contact with the overhang, was investigated. From a computational study, using finite element analysis, to simulate temperatures and stresses in PB-EBAM during fabricating an overhang area, it has been shown that an overhang alone will result in significant distortions. On the other hand, by adding a solid piece (called heat support), which will be fabricated together with the part, underneath the overhang will effectively reduce the distortion. <strong>Image 1</strong> shows the result of overhang distortion from the simulation study of making a simple overhang by PB-EBAM. It is noted that just an overhang itself will have a large distortion. However, if a solid underneath the overhang is included, the deflection can be reduced by about 50%.</p> <p>Thirdly, several experiments have been designed and conducted to prove the concept and to examine the working conditions. The experiments involved the model design, PB-EBAM fabrications and evaluating the geometry of fabricated overhangs to determine the effectiveness of the heat support. <strong>Image 2</strong> compares the overhang specimens fabricated with different support structures: (a) no support, (b) conventional tooth-contact support, and (c) heat support. It shows that (1) the specimen without any support has severe distortion, (2) the specimen with a conventional support has no distortion due to constraints from the structure attached, which will be tedious to be removed, and (3) the specimen with the heat support has virtually no distortion, and yet nothing attached to the overhang. <strong>Image 3</strong> shows a closed-up comparison in the overhang areas between (a) no support and (b) with heat support. It clearly demonstrates that the heat support is effective in distortion reductions for overhang parts.</p> <p>Lastly, the concept of the heat support for overhang parts has been tested with different overhang geometries and a different powder-bed electron beam additive manufacturing machine at the Manufacturing Demonstration Facility in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the results further support the effectiveness of the heat support and demonstrate the potential for some niche applications in the industry. <strong>Image 4</strong> presents different overhang examples to which the heat support was shown effective.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/24/2018<br>      Modified by: Kevin&nbsp;Chou</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1739435/1739435_10261649_1543090390228_Image1_1739435--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1739435/1739435_10261649_1543090390228_Image1_1739435--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Overhang distortion from the simulation study"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1739435/1739435_10261649_1543090390228_Image1_1739435--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Overhang distortion from the simulation study"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Image 1 shows the result of overhang distortion from the simulation study of making a simple overhang by PB-EBAM.
