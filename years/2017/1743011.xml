<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in a workshop-style mathematics conference entitled Structures on Free Resolutions and taking place at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, TX, from October 26-28, 2017. It will bring together established and early-career researchers to give lectures and participate in workshop activities on closely related topics, with a goal of fostering an environment conducive to collaboration and discussion. The topics to be included in this workshop are representative of the rich area of commutative algebra and its quickly changing landscape. About 45 participants are expected, which includes 9 invited speakers. Participation by women and members of underrepresented minorities is particularly encouraged.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This workshop will contribute to the fields of commutative and homological algebra by providing a focus for a topic that has seen a lot of progress recently: structures on free resolutions. Topics represented at this workshop will include generic free resolutions, linearity, Boij-Söderberg theory, Tate resolutions, detection of Koszul and Golod properties, rationality of Poincaré series, growth and structure of Betti numbers, and studies of syzygies, which represent a wide range of approaches to studying structures on free resolutions. One can expect that this meeting will set the ground work for future research in this area by identifying important motifs and questions as well as starting new conversations and collaborations related to these topics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A conference in commutative and homological algebra, entitled "Structures on Free Resolutions" was held October 26-28, 2017 in the Department of Mathematics &amp; Statistics at Texas Tech University. The conference had 40 participants and featured 15 speakers and 2 workshop sessions. One goal of the conference was to bring together researchers whose work involves the theme of free resolutions, aiming to both identify future research directions in the area as well as to give an access point to graduate students interested in pursuing research in these topics.  Mark Walker of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln set the stage for the conference by giving a colloquium talk about his substantial recent progress on the "Total Rank Conjecture," a classical conjecture involving the ranks of free modules in a minimal free resolution. Walker also led an engaging workshop session that allowed all participants to grapple with related conjectures. Another session, led by Daniel Erman of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, explored the question of how researchers go about finding open questions&mdash;which many early career researchers found especially helpful&mdash;with the goal of generating new directions in research related to the topics of the conference.   In addition, talks were given by the following speakers&mdash;in order of presentation: Jason McCullough ("Bounds on Invariants of Prime Ideals"), Adam Boocher ("Inequalities on Betti Numbers"), Seth Lindokken ("Matrix factorizations and Betti numbers of finite length modules"), Matthew Mastroeni ("Koszul almost complete intersections"), Jerzy Weyman ("Finite free resolutions and root systems"), Juliette Bruce ("Asymptotic Syzygies in the Semi-Ample Setting"), Daniel Erman "GL-noetherianity and Stillman?s Conjecture"), Liana Sega ("Golod homomorphisms: constructions and applications"), Alexandra Seceleanu ("Resolutions for powers of ideals and consequences on symbolic powers"), Robert M.

The participants for this workshop traveled from all over the United States, and included students of underrepresented minority groups, women, and faculty from a variety of types of institutions.

Additional funding, provided by Horn Professor Linda Allen of Texas Tech University, was used for other expenses not covered by the NSF funding (such as travel for senior researchers).  Intellectual Merit:  The topics in this workshop were representative of the rich area of commutative algebra and its quickly changing landscape. The workshop contributed to the fields of commutative and homological algebra by providing a focus for a topic that has seen a lot of progress in the past 10-20 years: structures on free resolutions. This meeting set the ground work for future research in this area by identifying important motifs and questions as well as starting new conversations and collaborations between researchers working in different branches of this topic.  Broader Impacts:  The workshop provided a benefit to many early-career faculty, post-doctoral researchers, and graduate students by giving them the opportunity to meet, work, and interact with others in their area of research.  This workshop allowed graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients a chance to become involved in research; in particular, about one third of the talks were given by graduate students and post-doctoral researchers.
