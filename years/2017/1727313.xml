<AbstractNarration>This award focuses on the study of scalable nanomanufacturing of one-dimensional and two-dimensional hierarchically-ordered structures using three concurrent self-assembly techniques followed by photo-manipulation. The noncontact photo-manipulation strategy is simple and benign and offers new levels of tailorability in the dimensions and engineered functionalities of the hierarchical structures. These hierarchically-ordered structures can be exploited for use in a variety of applications such as sensors, lithography masks, solar energy, photonics, and catalysis. The research project is integrated with nanoscience education across several levels. Plans are in place to recruit undergraduate and under-represented minority students to participate in research activities. High school science teachers will be invited to summer workshop for transferring nanomaterials science and technology knowledge to high school classrooms. High school students will be given opportunities to learn nanoscience and nanomanufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When compared with conventional top-down lithography methods, the bottom-up evaporative self-assembly technique is simple and cost-effective and offers a means of organizing nonvolatile materials into useful intriguing structures. This project aims to investigate a simple yet robust meniscus-assisted self-assembly technique that enables large-scale nanomanufacturing of hierarchically-ordered structures. The research focuses on self-organization driven by wetting-dewetting phenomena. The hierarchical nanostructures are formed by capitalizing on three concurrent self-assembly processes occurring at different length-scales. First, 1D hierarchically-ordered structures composed of photo-responsive homo-polymers and nanoparticles are manufactured via a synergy of meniscus-assisted self-assembly and water condensation at the micron-scale and spontaneous self-assembly of nanoparticles at the polymer solution/water interface at the nano-scale. Second, a reliable and scalable strategy for 2D hierarchically-ordered structures comprising photo-responsive di-block copolymers and nanoparticles are developed by performing two successive meniscus-assisted self-assembly processes. Finally, the 1D and 2D hierarchically-ordered structures are photo-manipulated by linearly polarized light irradiation to yield a new class of structures with tailored dimensions, geometries and functionalities. The resulting hierarchical structures can serve as functional materials for potential applications in sensors, catalysis, optics, electronics, optoelectronics, and magnetic devices.</AbstractNarration>
