<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Block copolymers are materials that are capable of self-organizing into functional nanostructures that are of technological relevance in applications ranging from membranes for water purification to next-generation lithium ion batteries to high-performance polymer photovoltaics. The realization of these technologies is hindered by defects in block copolymer nanostructures that form during the self-organization process and that reduce the properties of materials. The goal of this project is to establish a transformative new process to control and reduce the number of defects in block copolymer nanostructures. This will promote the development of scalable and economic fabrication processes for materials with improved properties. The program will support the teaching of a new laboratory course on polymer materials and provide training for one graduate student and several undergraduate student researchers. Ongoing collaborations with educators at minority serving institutions will be leveraged to support the participation of minority students. Finally, the potential of novel educational technologies based on 'haptic human-computer interactions' as a means to engage and attract middle and high school students to the study of science and engineering will be established. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fabrication of large-grained microstructures with reduced defect densities presents a prerequisite to the application of block copolymer (BCP) materials across a wide range of innovative material technologies. Understanding of the mechanism of grain growth and the evolution of defect structures during the annealing process is therefore a subject that is of fundamental relevance to both the science and engineering of BCP-based materials. The objective of this project is to elucidate the role of filler-matrix interactions on grain coarsening in miscible BCP/homopolymer blends and to test the hypothesis that grain boundary complexion transitions -- i.e. transitions within the phase of filler that is segregated to grain boundary interfaces -- increase the driving pressure for grain growth and hence the rate of grain coarsening. In a first part, the program will be focused on establishing the miscibility range and (equilibrium) microdomain formation in BCP/homopolymer blends systems in which the homopolymer forms a LCST blend with the host copolymer domain. In a second part, the project will focus on establishing the effect of filler/matrix interactions on the energy of grain boundary interfaces in quiescent organized films. If successful, this project will provide a basis for the development of novel processing strategies towards low defect-density BCP materials that harness the 'catalytic' effect of designed filler additives on grain coarsening to efficiently organize BCPs into desired large-grained microstructures. The program will enhance the teaching of a new class on "Soft Material Microstructure and Properties" and provide training for one graduate and several undergraduate researchers in the critical area of polymer and nanoscale materials. Finally, the benefits of kinesthetic experiments to the teaching of polymer and material science will be evaluated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Block copolymer-based materials have been proposed as a platform for innovative material technologies in areas ranging from dynamic photonic sensors to solid state ion conductors or polymer photovoltaics. A common thread among many of these proposed applications is that the copolymer acts as a template for ‘functional fillers’ and that the function itself is related to transport properties (such as ionic or electronic conductivity) of the filler. Material performance then depends on the diffusion of the filler within the copolymer host. Because diffusive processes in ordered materials are sensitive to the concentration of defects it is important to understand the relation between processing and defect concentration as well as the effect of filler addition on the formation and evolution of defects in block copolymer materials. The intellectual merit objective of the research program performed within the project DMR 1709344 was to understand the role of filler interactions on grain coarsening in block copolymer/homopolymer blends. Specifically, the objective was to test the hypothesis that attractive interactions between the two components counteract the segregation of filler within defects and raise the energy of grain boundary defects as compared to the pristine copolymer material. Research within this project demonstrated that attractive interactions can, in fact, be harnessed to modulate the energy of defects in copolymer microstructures. An algorithm was developed to harness interactions to accelerate the formation of polymer structures with reduced defect free densities. These results contribute to guidelines for the design of process conditions that amplify desired structural features in functional polymer-based materials. Because of the relevance of defects within a material on its properties, our results can enhance the design of polymer materials with novel or enhanced properties.    The broader impacts objective of this project was to demonstrate the application of force feedback joysticks as haptic emulators for the augmentation of hands-on teaching in Covid-19 related distance learning environments. As part of this project a ‘distance learning toolkit' was developed that consists of a force-feedback joystick programmed to emulate a variety of physical experimental situations including, but not limited to, the tensile deformation of materials, the deformation of molecular structures, chemical bonding interactions, charge interactions or magnetic interactions. The device acts as centralized learning interface that is being installed by the student and operated by the students and/or instructor. Individual program modules allow the emulation of experimental learning situations. The PI currently works with the Technology Transfer Center at Carnegie Mellon University to pursue further development of this technology.
