<AbstractNarration>Global warming is proceeding at an unprecedented rate and one that will ultimately result in large-scale reorganizations of ecosystems worldwide with greater impacts at high latitudes and with shifts in climate patterns.  Responses of these northern ecosystems could be varied: some organisms may disappear, some may thrive, and still others migrate to these Arctic regions. Although the answers to these questions are largely unknown due to the lack of modern analogs, potential answers lie buried in the fossil record of ecosystems that existed when the Earth was engulfed in a greenhouse world.  Giraffe Pipe is the best known geologic analog of an Arctic lake that existed under a warm climate. The main objective of this project will be to utilize the microfossil remains to reconstruct the evolution of this Arctic lake ecosystem. Undergraduate students will be involved in the research, a high school teacher will be trained in methods, and an interactive presentation will be developed with the Connecticut Library Consortium for public use.&lt;br/&gt;The study will develop a novel suite of proxies that incorporate attributes of individual microfossil taxa and whole ecosystems; there will then be used to reconstruct the ontogeny of the Giraffe waterbody.  Shifts in biological organizations, changes in chemical conditions, and modifications of the physical setting will be resolved and coupled with regional climate through concurrent pollen analyses.  The findings will also document associations of organisms that were highly successful at colonizing warm water habitats and simultaneously able to survive long, dark, and mild Arctic winters.  Further, the work will result in documentation of numerous new fossil species, contribute to the evolutionary histories of poorly studied organisms, and document the migration capabilities and survival strategies of microbes under changing environmental conditions. In summary, the Giraffe locality represents an unparalleled opportunity to examine an Arctic lake ecosystem and the numerous organisms that inhabited it, under a warm greenhouse world.</AbstractNarration>
