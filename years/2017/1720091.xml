<AbstractNarration>In this EAGER project, the investigators will study the occurrence of twins in human populations, with a focus on high twinning rates. Fraternal twinning rates vary across populations, and this variation and the potential adaptive advantages of having twins are not fully understood. Previous research by these investigators and others suggest that both genetic and environmental factors are involved. This project will collect initial information on the scale and timing of twinning in one population with an extremely high twinning rate, which will provide a foundation for subsequent research projects to understand the cultural, biological, evolutionary, and environmental contexts of multiple births in modern humans. The project also supports international research collaborations and may lead to findings that inform fertility research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spontaneous dizygotic (DZ) twinning occurs with the release and fertilization of two oocytes. A genetic component to dizygotic twinning has long been recognized, potentially including genes related to follicle cohort size and multiple implantation, but no clear inheritance pattern has been identified. Environmental factors such as smoking may also influence twinning rates. The investigators will collect information on twin occurrence in a village in southern India, to reconstruct when the village started to have twin frequencies that are out of the normal range of other Indian populations, and to begin to explore the potential effects of microevolutionary processes and environmental chemical exposure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With the support of an EAGER award, Dr. Madrigal (from USF) and Drs. Savarimuthu and Francis (from Kannur University) did anthropological fieldwork in Kodinhi, in the State of Kerala in South India.  Drs. Savarimuthu and Francis had received permission from the Panchayat (the local government) for us to interview members of the community. Dr. Madrigal obtained IRB permission from USF to do the same. The purpose of our fieldwork was to obtain genealogies of the families with twins, as far back as they could remember, so that we could determine when the families started having twins.   Kodinhi is not as small as the media have portrayed it.  It is dominated by a rural landscape and includes two blocks of small business with a bus stop. It has large rice plantations. The majority of its population is Muslim.  The Panchayat head assigned to us a member of the Panchayat as our local guide. This person took us from house to house to collect genealogies.  The local government supported us in this and many other ways. Indeed, the entire village received us with open hearts. We visited families in the entire Panchayat of Kodinhi because everyone told us that there were areas in which people had more twins than others.  Moreover, we wished to sample the very few Hindu families in the region as well.   Fieldwork was extremely successful.  The people of Kodinhi wish to understand why they have so many twins. They are concerned by the press coverage and by the unwelcomed notoriety that has come with their ?celebrity? status.  Marriage practices: Most families favor close-cousin marriage (on either the mother?s or the father?s side).  Indeed, first cousin marriage is quite common.  We also observed marriages of first and second cousin once removed and of uncle and niece. When wives are not members of the same family, they may come from other towns or wards.   A changing community: Kodinhi is in the midst of a large economic and social change, as many of its males are choosing to stop working in the traditional occupations associated with agriculture and are taking positions as workers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  There, they are well paid, and are able to save money for building quite luxurious houses.  This new arrangement is changing the family dynamic as this is leaving the women in power of decision-making about the household economy, the children?s education, and even for running for political positions in the Panchayat.   Results.  We interviewed members of twenty-six extended families and obtained twenty-six pedigrees. For some of them the first generation went back as early as the 1920s.  For some of them the first generation was more recent, closer to 1940.  Some of the members of one pedigree appear in another pedigree, since some families tended to exchange mates with each other.  For this reason, a few individuals are counted twice in the total number of individuals.  Nevertheless, the total number of individuals (alive and deceased) in our pedigrees is 1686.    Figure 1 shows the precipitous rise in the frequency of twin vs. singleton births.  This increased frequency in twin births is highly significant with a Fisher?s  exact test (p=0.001).  This graph shows that beginning in the decade of the 1960s, the number of twin births increased. However, between 1990 and 2000 and up to the present, the increase has been extraordinary. In contrast, the number of singleton births shows a modest increase through the years, which is expected as life conditions, particularly health care, improved in the region.  Since the 1990s several of the families we interviewed had more twin pregnancies than singleton pregnancies. To our surprise, the frequency of twinning is not different by ward (p=0.3622).     Conclusion. This project made possible by the support of the NSF EAGER grant is (to our knowledge) the first scientific report of the twinning ?epidemic? in Kodinhi. We were cognizant that it was necessary for us to visit the site and report the twinning frequencies before a larger grant could be requested.  For that reason, the EAGER grant was ideal for our needs.   At this point, it would be inappropriate for us to offer hypotheses about the cause of this massive twin frequency change.  However, we are currently pursuing other work that is helping us accrue preliminary data on the genetic bases of monozygotic (MZ, or identical) and dizygotic (DZ or fraternal) twinning, which is going to be useful for requesting a larger grant in which we will obtain biological data.   In sum, the Kodinhi twin epidemic is real. It is not a media frenzy.  We are forever indebted to the NSF for this EAGER grant and to the Kodinhi community who opened their homes and hearts to us.  We hope to continue to work with and for them.          Last Modified: 02/18/2019       Submitted by: Lorena Madrigal]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
