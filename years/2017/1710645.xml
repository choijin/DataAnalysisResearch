<AbstractNarration>This is an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology, under the program Research Using Biological Collections. The fellow, Doug Booher, is conducting research and receiving training that utilizes biological collections in innovative ways, and is being mentored by two sponsoring scientists at two host institutions: Corrie Moreau (Field Museum of Natural History) and Andrew Suarez (University of Illinois). The fellow's research aims to describe and explain the changes in the abundance, distribution, and diversity of native species as non-native species arrived and spread. Human-caused transport of non-native plants and animals is moving species at unprecedented rates across the globe. These introduced species are the second leading cause of extinctions. Therefore, understanding how invasive species impact ecological communities over different time scales is a major question in ecological research. In Florida, approximately 25% of 239 ant species are non-native and about half these introductions happened in the last 35 years. The fellow is assessing the impact of invasive ant species, using very large and geographically extensive collections of ant communities collected in Florida over the past several decades, supplemented by older records in museum collections. In addition to pursuing these research interests, the fellow is engaging in public outreach programs for grade-school age children as well as training future scientists through integrative biology internship programs while conducting research at Field Museum and the University of Illinois.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has two main objectives in using available museum collections: (1) to investigate the long-term fates of invasive species and the corresponding dynamics of native communities after invasion to test competing hypotheses of community assembly i.e. neutral vs. niche assembly; and (2) to evaluate the importance of seven traits hypothesized to explain the ecological success of invasive species. Traits hypothesized to confer competitive success are continuous reproduction, polygyny, supercoloniality, omnivory, habitat generality, nest opportunism, and worker polymorphism. For these objectives, the fellow will investigate community dynamics at two phylogenetic scales: at a coarse phylogenetic scale, communities of all ants, and at a finer phylogenetic scale, communities of congeneric ants. In Florida, there are five common and/or diverse ant genera with native and non-native representative species. This will allow for a phylogenetically controlled statistical comparisons of ant community dynamics where members of these communities are more likely to overlap in life history and ecological traits due to shared ancestry. Once digitized, the collections data of this research will be publicly available through Antweb.org.  As one of the largest and longest time series collections of ants from a single region, these data will be invaluable to community ecologist, invasive ecologists, pest management scientist, evolutionary biologist, biodiversity scientists, climate scientists, and conservationist.</AbstractNarration>

However, how these declines translate to changes in species diversity and community structure are unknown. This award provided funding to evaluate changes in ant biodiversity over a 50+ year period in the southeastern U.S. The primary aim of this research was to understand how invasive ant species, such as the red imported fire ant, and land use change impact ecological communities over long time scales. I used the large and geographically extensive collections of ant communities throughout the southeastern US over the past several decades housed at Archbold Biological Station, supplemented by older records in museum collections housed in the bulk insect collections at The Field Museum. This was accomplished by (1) Quantifying dynamical community changes in the distribution, abundance, and diversity of existing species as new non-native species arrive and spread and testing these dynamical data against predictions of alternative community assembly hypotheses. (2) Determining what (if any) effects non-native species had on functional trait diversity and phylogenetic diversity. This research focused on Florida ant communities, a state with 58 non-native and 182 native ant species.</p> <p>The biological collection records together provided a clear and striking picture of the dynamic changes taking place in ant communities across Florida's natural areas. Non-native ants are common in all of Florida's natural undisturbed habitats and have increased in collection frequency (Figures 1 and 2). Non-native ants have had high diversities and abundances in natural areas throughout FL over the entire collection period (1965-present, Figures 1) with highest diversities and abundances in southern FL and lowest diversities and abundances in northern FL. Divided into equal latitudinal regions of southern, central, and northern FL, temporal trends show the replacement of native species by non-native species that did not appear to be leveling off more recently, but predict further increase in all regions. In the most invaded region of southern FL non-native ants have steadily increased from around 50% of the ant species found in a community sample in 1965 to more than 80% by 2019. The central region of FL had a similar increase (30% to 60%) while the northern region of FL has remained relatively stable until recently with 20% to 30% of species in a community sample being non-native (this increase only significant between 1985 and 2019). Several observed patterns point to non-native ants being better competitors and displacing native ants such as the loss of native diversity as higher proportion of non-native ants increase through time. This is especially prominent within the most abundant and diverse ant genera where we see non-native ants increasing while native species become rarer or stay rare. In examining species-specific trends through time, it becomes clear that the dominating influence of this overall general trend is due to a handful of non-native species that have become highly abundant and occur in a wider range of habitats than most natives.</p> <p>A consequence of functionally similar alien species making up a higher proportion of communities is reduced functional diversity through time. The loss of native diversity is therefore likely to extend to the loss of ecosystem functionality as some of the most frequently encountered native species (seed dispersing ants in the genus <em>Aphaenogaster</em>) have become rare with no related species expected to be a functional equivalent.</p> <p>The data, methods, and novel statistics developed from this research will help inform future methodology for monitoring and measuring biodiversity. The strikingly clear results of loss of native diversity and increases in homogenization of ant communities across Florida?s natural undisturbed habitats provides a first glimpse into the pervasive effects of non-native arthropod species within native systems and calls for additional studies to determine to what extent are there also losses of ecosystem function. This research has made clear the need for often overlooked and highly diverse arthropod communities to become part of the focus of bio-management practices and biomonitoring. These research results showing are currently being prepared in a manuscript for publication.</p> <p>This award also promoted inclusive hiring and professional development to undergraduate students including paid internship positions to under-represented women in science.
