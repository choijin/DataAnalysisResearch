<AbstractNarration>This project is to support doctoral student travel and participation in the IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI 2017) in Park City, Utah. The ICHI2017 conference provides a supportive scientific forum for students focusing on computing, health- and bioinformatics.  ICHI2017 provides a forum for expert and peer critique of students' research with the goal of improving their science. Student participants will also have the opportunity to receive networking support and career advice from internationally-recognized experts. Overall, the travel support brings together students with experts who might not otherwise engage with one another and engage in multidisciplinary science the area of health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal supports doctoral students by providing a Student Doctoral Consortium focused on encouraging students to learn from peers and experts from multiple perspectives to understand how innovative computing and informatics combine to make the most impact in the area of health. In addition, student participation in rapid talks and roundtable provided at the conference enables students to explore their science and see different career paths for researchers in this area. The ICHI2017 conference exposes participants to different scientific disciplinary approaches, supports networking with conference attendees and is designed to support the development of the next generation of scholars in health- and bioinformatics.</AbstractNarration>

Students applied for travel awards, justifying the need for the request, together with a letter of support from their advisor. The applications were reviewed and ranked based on a number of criteria (e.g., type and number of submissions/presentations, minority group). To increase participation, the selection committee decided to offer partial support to a larger number of students. The amount of the award was based on the same criteria used in the selection process as well as estimated costs (e.g., some students were international). In all, 15 graduate students, including several from under-represented groups, used the travel awards to attend ICHI 2017 and to present their work. Several also participated in the Doctoral Consortium associated with ICHI, where they received individualized feedback on their research from a faculty/industry mentor. A special panel was also organized featuring several of the mentors. The students were able to ask questions to the panel on such things as how to be successful, career paths and opportunities, etc. Throughout the duration of the conference, the students had ample opportunities to interact with other members of their research community.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/17/2018<br>      Modified by: Christophe&nbsp;G&nbsp;Giraud-Carrier</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
