<AbstractNarration>CAREER: Algorithms for Next-Generation Genomics&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop algorithms for new and emerging high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies.  These technologies are lowering the cost of DNA sequencing by orders of magnitude and thereby enabling a variety of new applications.  These new applications, combined with the varying characteristics of the DNA sequences produced by these technologies, are increasing demand for efficient algorithms to interpret the resulting large volumes of DNA sequence data. The PI will develop a new class of robust algorithms for genome assembly and discovery of DNA sequence variants.  Some of these algorithms will rely on the availability of a closely related reference genome sequence, while others will operate de novo directly from the individual DNA sequences (i.e. reads) produced by a DNA sequencing machine.  In the latter case, the PI will design algorithms   that exploit longer range DNA sequence information available in newer single-molecule and nanopore sequencing technologies.  These algorithms will retain high sensitivity and specificity while scaling to billions-trillions of nucleotides and thousands of genomes. Finally, the PI will introduce combinatorial algorithms for the study of genome rearrangements in heterogeneous mixtures of DNA sequences.  Such mixtures arise in metagenomics or cancer genomics, where the DNA that is sequenced is a mixture of genomes from different species, or from cells harboring different mutations, respectively.  The PI collaborates closely with biologists and technology developers to ensure relevance and applicability of the algorithms.  At the same time, some of algorithms and techniques from graph theory, combinatorial optimization, and probability that are developed in the proposal are applicable to problems outside of biology. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will be integrated with an educational component that includes the development of undergraduate seminar in personal genomics, a summer research experience in computational biology for high-school students, and the incorporation of a computational biology module into a summer computing camp for 9th grade girls. The PI will continue to actively mentor and recruit undergraduate and graduate students, including women and underrepresented minorities. Finally, software implementing the algorithms will be freely distributed to the scientific community through a public webserver.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project we developed algorithms for new and emerging high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies.  In the past decade, the cost of DNA sequencing has declined dramatically and additional technologies such as microfluidics and single-cell analysis have expanded the applications of DNA sequencing technologies.    In one major research theme, we developed algorithms to analyze data from "third-generation" sequencing technologies that measure the sequence of longer DNA molecules than obtained by current technologies.  Specifically, we developed an algorithm to identify structural variants -- differences between genome sequences that are larger than 1,000 nucleotides -- using a single-molecule sequencing technology from Pacific Biosciences.  We also developed an algorithm to identify structural variants using a novel linked-read sequencing technology from 10X Genomics that combines a novel molecular barcoding strategy with high-throughput Illumina sequencing.  In both cases we show that the longer DNA molecules measured by such technologies provides improved performance in measuring structural variants.  Finally, we also developed a new algorithm to analyze the structure of DNA molecules using a technology called Hi-C that combines proximity ligation with high-throughput sequencing to identify regions of DNA that are physically close together in the cell.  In a second major research theme, we developed algorithms to analyze cancer evolution from DNA sequencing data from a bulk tumor sample.  Most tumors consist of a mixture of normal cells and one or more populations of tumor cells.  This intra-tumor heterogeneity complicates the identification of somatic mutations that drive cancer development, but also reveals information about the evolutionary history of the tumor.  In this project, we developed several algorithms to infer the cancer genome(s) and their proportions in a bulk tumor sample and to infer phylogenetic trees that describe the ancestral relationships between the mutations in a tumor.  These algorithms analyze different types of somatic mutations that occur in cancer including single-nucleotide changes in DNA and larger duplications and deletions of genomic regions, known as copy number aberrations.  In a third major research theme, we developed algorithms to analyze data from single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing technologies.  These technologies overcome the limitations of traditional bulk sequencing that measure DNA and RNA from a mixture of cells.  However, single-cell sequencing technologies have other limitations is that the genomic signal obtained from individual cells is sparse.  We developed algorithms to overcome this sparsity by combining signal from multiple related cells.  The computational approaches developed in this project are widely applicable to analyze genomes of many species, including human and cancer genomes.  We applied these algorithms to large collections of human and cancer genomes in collaboration with biologists, helping biologists identify genetic variants that may be important for cancer diagnosis or treatment. All algorithms developed in this project were implemented in open source, publicly available software for use by the research community.      Coupled with our research objectives was an educational program that focused on expanding opportunities in computing research for groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in the discipline.  As part of this program, several high-school students and undergraduates undertook research projects during the summer mentored by the PI and members of the PI?s research group.
