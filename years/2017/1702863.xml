<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in the 26th International Conference on Ultra-relativistic Collisions (Quark Matter 2017), which is designed to bring together theoretical and experimental physicists from around the world to discuss new developments in high energy heavy ion physics as well as developments in understanding strongly interacting matter at extreme conditions.  The conference will provide valuable opportunities for early career scientists to present their own research and to interact with leaders in the field. This conference will be held in Chicago, Illinois February 5 - 11, 2017.  The organizers of the conference will use accepted best practices to increase diversity.</AbstractNarration>
