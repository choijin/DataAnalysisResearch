<AbstractNarration>The first detection of gravitational waves from the collision of two massive black holes by the twin Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington in 2015 not only confirmed Einstein's predictions of the existence of gravitational waves  but also ratified years of efforts in the development of gravitational wave detectors (GWD).  Gravitational wave detectors are interferometers in which an intense laser beam bounces between two sets of mirrors in orthogonal arms.  Gravitational waves cause differences in the path length of the laser beam between the two interferometer arms, giving rise to a distinct interference pattern that when analyzed identifies the event that created them. The detection sensitivity of GWD is determined by various noise sources, among which, thermal noise of the coatings in the mirrors of the interferometer is a main component. Thermal noise in the high reflectance amorphous oxide coatings in the interferometer's mirrors causes path length differences that can mask the signals from gravitational waves. To increase the sensitivity of present GWD and meet the demands of future GWD, a concerted effort to understand and control the mechanisms that give rise to thermal noise in amorphous oxide coatings is imperative. This work will form part of that effort. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports research aimed at demonstrating  amorphous oxide coatings with significantly reduced thermal noise and superior optical properties that will enable an approximate 10x increase in sensitivity of state-of-the-art GWD. The research effort has two specific aims: 1) to  realize  amorphous metal oxide thin films by ion beam sputtering with reduced thermal noise through a systematic parametric study of the deposition conditions used to grow single films; and 2) to engineer  multilayer dielectric coatings using these materials with reduced mechanical loss compared to state-of-the-art. A synergistic characterization effort will support the materials' growth. In particular the CSU researchers will collaborate with Caltech researchers to assess mechanical loss in single and multilayer dielectric coatings. This research will support the LIGO program in different ways. Through fundamental studies in amorphous oxides it will enable investigations of the physical mechanisms that  come into play in affecting thermal noise. It will also offer the opportunity to seek for new coating designs that will increase sensitivity of advanced LIGO and of the next generation GWD. Synergistic collaborations with the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) Coatings Group are planned to congruently advance the fundamental material science and coatings engineering efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Amorphous oxides are the backbone of optical interference coatings for high finesse optical cavities as gravitation wave detectors.   The coatings in the test masses of Advanced LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Detector) use a combination of stacks of Ta2O5:TiO2 and SiO2 amorphous thin films to achieve a reflectance &gt; 99.95% and impressively low absorption loss at the laser wavelength.  The challenge these coatings present is that internal friction, mainly from the Ta2O5:TiO2 layers, causes minute vibrations that  introduce noise in the weak signals generated by the interferometer in the detection of gravitational waves.   This research project is motivated by the need to understand the sources of internal friction in amorphous oxides and how to control them by modifying growth conditions and creating new materials that are combinations of binary oxides.    Through a series of comprehensive material studies our work has identified: 1) a new alloy, GeO2 mixed with TiO2 with internal friction lower than Ta2O5 mixed with TiO2 and thus has potential to realize interference coatings with lower mechanical loss than state-of-the-art; 2) nanolaminates of two binary oxides  are not favored over mixtures to reduce room temperature internal friction; 3) fundamental mechanisms that affect the type of defects that give rise to internal friction in glass forming GeO2 deposited by ion beam sputtering.  The findings of this work are contributing to advance interference coatings broadly and specifically to improve the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors.
