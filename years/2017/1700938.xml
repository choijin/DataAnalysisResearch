<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of US participants in the "Conference in Harmonic Analysis at the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS)" that will be held July 17-21, 2017, in Edinburgh, Scotland. The support is directed at graduate students, psotdocs, and other early-career mathematicians. For additional information see the conference website: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.icms.org.uk/workshops/harmonicanalysis .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is timed to take maximum advantage of recent progress in the field of harmonic analysis and to harness the momentum generated by those major developments (e.g., advances in multilinear inequalities and Fourier restriction theory; the introduction of algebro-geometric methods, such as the "polynomial method" of Dvir, Guth, and others). The list of speakers includes virtually all of the world's most prominent researchers in harmonic analysis. The program allows ample opportunity for junior mathematicians to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

A large number of events were held with a view to promoting interaction between participants.  Through this award, eight very early career mathematicans (graduate students and postdoctoral mathematicians) were able to recieve travel funding to attend this conference. Without this support, participation would not have been possible. The feedback from the participants was extremely positive, pointing to the high standards of the lectures, the range of new ideas, and the opportunities to learn and interact with others. There were many events aimed at promoting interaction. The overall assessment of this program by the supported participants was that they were able to to develop or sustain contacts likely to result in new research and that receiving travel funding was important to their careers.
