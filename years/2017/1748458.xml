<AbstractNarration>This project provides a forum for the presentation and discussion of NSF's Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP)Science Policy Research Reports.  The principal investigators of each of the seventeen reports will be invited to present a report that provides evidence-based recommendations for policy and practice.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be organized around seven major themes: (1) improving communication to facilitate more informed decision making;(2) improving data for decision makers;(3) investigation of tools to support innovation, such as inducement prizes; (4) benefits of interdisciplinary and collaborative research efforts; (5) benefits of research portfolios versus large projects; (6) impacts of inclusivity and immigration on the science labor force; and (7) opportunities for entrepreneurism. Members of STEP's Innovation Policy Forum will serve as moderators.</AbstractNarration>
