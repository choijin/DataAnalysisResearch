<AbstractNarration>Proposals from SEA are fundamentally different form others is this panel because SEA does not support any NSF-funded science. Rather the program is a shipboard educational experience that has offered high-quality academic programs to college, high-school, and graduate students, as well as K-12 teachers, for 45 years. The National Science Board recently named SEA the recipient of its 2016 Public Service Award for making a substantial contribution to increasing public understanding of science and engineering. NSF recognizes that many SEA alumni are professionals working and teaching in the marine sciences and related fields and for that reason have allowed for limited support through the SSSE Program. The panel considered this when it evaluated the requests and found unlike the Instrumentation Proposal, there were several items here that were poorly explained and that the whole proposal was a bit unclear. The overall rating was Good-Very Good. That said it is clear that SEA needs overboarding sheaves. Their top priority was a leval winding sheave with an expensive monitoring device. This was way over the top in terms of what this Program would support. Instead, the Program will fund the purchase of two overboarding sheaves but has counseled the group to consult with other operators, i.e. WHOI, who is located down the street, and purchase sheaves with load pins which could provide the digital output and load information they need. SEA appreciated the advice and will do exactly that. No other items on the proposal will be funded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Program recommends an award of $19,465 for the purchase of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) 2 Overboarding Sheaves                        $19,465</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Through this award, Sea Education Association (SEA) upgraded the hydrographic winch-wire-sheave system used to deploy oceanographic equipment on one of its sailing research vessels, the <em>SSV Corwith Cramer</em>. Recognized by the National Science Board&rsquo;s 2016 Public Service Award as an important contributor to increased public understanding of science and engineering, SEA brings university students to sea on international voyages of exploration and marine science research. We place our shipboard labs and technical equipment in the hands of our students, allowing them to conduct investigations into coastal and open ocean phenomena of their own design; they then analyze, document, and communicate the findings of their projects. When sampling to thousands of meters below the ocean surface, it is critical that SEA&rsquo;s scientific staff maintain an accurate understanding of the wire rope status (amount of wire paid out, speed at which it is moving, angle relative to the sheave, and amount of tension) for both safety and research reproducibility purposes. The new NSF-funded overboarding sheave replaces a system that has been in service for over 20 years and enables us to directly measure all of these parameters. The purchased complementary winch-wire display system shows this information about wire movement and tension in real-time and viewable from our on-deck deployment zone; SEA is now also able to track such data during deployments and we feel more confident with deeper and increasingly complex sampling given these upgrades. Beyond SEA academic semester programs, the data collected on our two ships is shared with scientists interested in similar questions or geographic areas at institutions without open ocean access, as well as with the local communities and schools in regions we visit. Each year, nearly 250 students and collaborators sail on SEA vessels and utilize NSF-funded oceanographic equipment; over half are women and a significant number identify as underrepresented minorities. All program participants, regardless of academic major or professional interest, are required to learn about marine science and work in the shipboard laboratory. The technical skills and environmental literacy gained through an SEA experience shape tomorrow&rsquo;s researchers, policy-makers, conservation stewards, and leaders.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/02/2018<br>      Modified by: Paul&nbsp;S&nbsp;Joyce</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1723634/1723634_10479457_1522680937026_SEA-SSSE1_CorwithCramer--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1723634/1723634_10479457_1522680937026_SEA-SSSE1_CorwithCramer--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SSV Corwith Cramer"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1723634/1723634_10479457_1522680937026_SEA-SSSE1_CorwithCramer--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SSV Corwith Cramer"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SSV Corwith Cramer</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sea Education Association</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Paul&nbsp;S&nbsp;Joyce</div> <div class="imageTitle">SSV Corwith Cramer</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1723634/1723634_10479457_1522680992350_SEA-SSSE2_CorwithCramer_TAPSSheave--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1723634/1723634_10479457_1522680992350_SEA-SSSE2_CorwithCramer_TAPSSheave--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SSV Corwith Cramer TAPS Sheave"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1723634/1723634_10479457_1522680992350_SEA-SSSE2_CorwithCramer_TAPSSheave--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SSV Corwith Cramer TAPS Sheave"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SSV Corwith Cramer TAPS Sheave</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sea Education Association</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Paul&nbsp;S&nbsp;Joyce</div> <div class="imageTitle">SSV Corwith Cramer TAPS Sheave</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1723634/1723634_10479457_1522681041797_SEA-SSSE3_CorwithCramer_TAPSSheave--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1723634/1723634_10479457_1522681041797_SEA-SSSE3_CorwithCramer_TAPSSheave--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SSV Corwith Cramer TAPS Sheave"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1723634/1723634_10479457_1522681041797_SEA-SSSE3_CorwithCramer_TAPSSheave--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SSV Corwith Cramer TAPS Sheave"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SSV Corwith Cramer TAPS Sheave</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sea Education Association</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Paul&nbsp;S&nbsp;Joyce</div> <div class="imageTitle">SSV Corwith Cramer TAPS Sheave</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
