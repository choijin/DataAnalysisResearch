<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of 52 undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral students at the 44nd Annual National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers (NOBCChE) Conference, held Oct. 30 - Nov. 3, 2017 in Minneapolis, MN. Selected participants are from underrepresented minority groups in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides opportunities for participants to engage in four major areas of focus: 1) technical and professional development; 2) networking and mentorship opportunities with professionals working in STEM fields; 3) exposure to high-profile minority role models in STEM; and 4) academic and professional STEM career advancement opportunities. Student participants interact with peers and professionals from industry, government, and academia to develop collaborations and to explore opportunities to pursue graduate degrees in the chemistry or chemical engineering disciplines. These opportunities may not only impact these specific participating individuals, but also benefit the larger community of STEM field practitioners as these activities are useful in recruiting and retaining individuals from underrepresented talent pools. NOBCChE seeks to increase the number of minorities in the STEM workforce, particularly those in the chemistry or chemical engineering fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF award entitled "Increasing Underrepresented Minorities in STEM: The 44th NOBCChE Annual Conference: Community, Leadership and Partnership" supported 52 undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral students to attend and participate in the conference. The 44th NOBCChE Annual Conference was held October 30 -  November 3, 2017 at the Radisson Blu and the Marriott in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota. The theme for the conference was "Community, Leadership and Partnerships."  The mission of NOBCChE (National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers) is to build an eminent cadre of people of color in science and technology. Through local, regional, national, and global programs that assist the membership in fully realizing their capabilities and potential in academic, professional and entrepreneurial pursuits in chemistry, chemical engineering, and related STEM fields is how NOBCChE accomplishes its mission.  The 52 selected participants were from underrepresented minority groups in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. This award provided the 52 participants to engage in 4 major areas of focus:  STEM Professional and Technical Development; STEM Executive Coaching, Mentoring and Networking Opportunities Exposure to Prestigious Minority Models in STEM, and Academic and Professional STEM Career Advancement Opportunities   Student participants interacted with peers and professionals from industry, government, and academia to develop collaborations and to explore opportunities to pursue graduate degrees in the chemistry or chemical engineering disciplines. In addition, participants were awarded the opportunity to share their research experience via a poster presentation and/or oral presentation. Students were provided professional development in the areas of resume writing, interviewing skills, etc.   These opportunities did not only impact the 52 participants but also benefitted the larger community of STEM field practitioners as these activities were useful in recruiting and retaining individuals from underrepresented talent pools.   The activities of the 44th NOBCChE Annual Conference contributed to the diversity and inclusion literature on retention and professional development for undergraduate students, graduate students, postdocs, and early career professionals. In addition, the activities built on proven best practices for improving the participation of minorities and other students in research and professional development experiences that encourage and enhance student success in Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and related STEM fields. O  The NOBCChE conference had innovative programs, creative partnerships, and increased the number of underrepresented groups in the STEM workforce.  The broader impact and benefit of the 44th NOBCChE Annual Conference to NSF was as follows:  Exposing underrepresented minorities, including women, to new ideas and innovations in an atmosphere with other accomplished minorities in STEM.   Encourages students to pursue graduate degrees, post-doctoral, internships and cooperative opportunities in related STEM disciplines, thus increasing the pipeline for ideas and innovations.   Exposure of students to career opportunities which may lead to students who later in their career will choose employment opportunities as scientists and engineers in either the government, academia, or industry sectors.   Overall, the broader impacts were to increase minority participation in STEM and increase the knowledge base for what does and doesn?t work at minority conference with respect to recruiting and retaining minorities in STEM.
