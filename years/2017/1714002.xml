<AbstractNarration>This EAPSI award will support efforts that impact the global use of semiconducting polymers, e.g. "semiconducting plastics", that are able to conduct electricity, for military, space and electronic device development. Semiconducting polymers and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/copper (Cu) composites coaxial nanofibers for electronic devices using the Electrospinning technique. CNTs and Cu are well known by their ability to conduct electricity. Their unique properties (electrical behavior and nanofiber structure) can result in fabricated electrical devices that are 1000 times smaller than a human hair. Devices such as diodes, field effect transistors and sensors can be fabricated. Coaxial nanofibers will be prepared using the electrospinning technique, a low-cost, fast and reliable method for nanofiber fabrication. This research will be conducted as a collaboration between the Advanced Materials Bio &amp; Integration Research Laboratory at the University of South Florida (USF) and Dr. Seeram Ramakrishna of the National University of Singapore (NUS). Dr. Ramakrishna is a global research leader in material sciences and a pioneer in the use of electrospinning and nanostructured materials for applications in healthcare, the environment, energy, and defense &amp; security providing a unique insight for electrospinning data acquisition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actual progress in coaxial fibers has advanced in many fields, but, for the first time, two organic semiconductor polymers will form a p-n junction in a coaxial structure, resulting in functional diodes of approximately 100 nm in diameter. These structures, formed with the presence of CNTs, a well-known natural p-type material, and Cu composites, enhances the characteristics of the nanofibers extending the applications of the coaxial structure that can go from single nanofibers to fully functional yarns. This structure can be arranged to form intelligent textiles, electroactive water and air filters, membranes and electronic devices as exposed, advancing the cutting-edge of coaxial nanodevices for efficient cost effective electronic device development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Singapore.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p style="text-align: left;">This EAPSI award supported the efforts that impact the global community in the use of semiconducting polymers, e.g. "semiconducting plastics", that are able to conduct electricity, for military, space and electronic device development. Intelligent textiles, air/water filters, bone scaffolds, and drug delivery applications have all directly benefitted from the development of the reliable and low-cost electrospinning technique for fiber fabrication. This technique has also been successfully used to fabricate fibrous electronic devices. Diodes, field effect transistors, and sensors that use organic semiconductive polymers offer unique characteristics that can be found only in such polymers (e.g., excellent thermal stability, tunable electrical conductivity, mechanical flexibility, and chemical/biological functionality). In this work the electrospinning technique is used to fabricate, for the first time, a polymer-polymer semiconductive coaxial-structure nanofiber from the p-type regioregular polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and the n-type conjugated ladder polymer poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL). The P3HT was successfully used as the core and the BBL as the shell, thus forming a p&ndash;n junction that is cylindrical in form. This research significantly expands the current knowledge of organic electroactive polymer structures for efficient coaxial flexible arrays. These arrays are expected to have increased electrical efficiency and lower power requirements, thus advancing the state-of-the-art for fiber-based devices.
