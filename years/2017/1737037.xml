<AbstractNarration>The latest of Earth?s five largest mass extinction events occurred coeval with the impact of a ~14 km asteroid into the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico), ending the Mesozoic Era. In April-May 2016, the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP), with co-funding from the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP), successfully cored with nearly 100% recovery from 505-1337 m below seafloor into the resulting 200 km-wide Chicxulub impact crater. These cores record an extraordinary sequence of impact and post-impact events. This project will investigate these unique cores further to understand the local and global effects of the only impact conclusively linked to a mass extinction event. This research is part of a larger international effort, including ~40 scientists from 14 countries, and also supports education and mentoring at the graduate and post-graduate level. Project researchers will continue to engage in outreach and education through media interviews, museum displays, and other activities to highlight the research to the general public.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recent IODP-ICDP drilling expedition at Chicxulub recovered the first-ever samples of an unequivocal peak ring. A peak ring is a discontinuous ring of mountains observed within the central basin of all large impact craters on rocky planets. The discovery that Chicxulub?s peak ring consists of largely granitic crust uplifted by ~10 km calibrates impact models, allows for observation of impact processes, and for a first-order assessment of the environmental consequences of the impact (?kill mechanisms?). Newly recovered cores include the uplifted target rocks: melt-rich impact generated rock types, hydrothermal deposits, a tsunami bed coupled with a settling layer, and the resumption of carbonate sedimentation. These lithologies record processes spanning from minutes to millions of years post-impact. The proposed work will: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Reconstruct thermal history of the peak ring and the duration of the impact-induced hydrothermal system to determine how these processes affected the return of life to the crater.&lt;br/&gt;2. Compare rock fragments in the impact rocks to pre-impact stratigraphy to quantify the volatiles released and constrain models of impact-induced climate change and extinction. &lt;br/&gt;3. Find the first conclusive evidence of the asteroid within the crater to tie to global K-Pg boundary records and identify the possible influence of metal toxicity.&lt;br/&gt;4. Investigate the fossil record of the boundary sequence, in concert with the sedimentology, stratigraphy, and environmental chemistry, to illuminate possible killing mechanisms and determine the pace and timing of the recovery within the crater from the weeks after the impact through the early Paleocene.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 200-kilometer diameter Chicxulub impact crater formed 66 million years ago when a 10-kilometer diameter asteroid collided with the Earth near what is presently the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico.  The impact resulted in a global catastrophe known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction, which is famous for the demise of approximately 75% of plant and animal species on Earth, including the non-avian dinosaurs.  Chicxulub crater is exceptionally well-preserved and contains an inner "peak" ring formed from granitoid crustal rocks that were uplifted from an initial depth of approximately 10 kilometers due to the impact.  The peak ring also contains recrystallized impact melt rocks and breccias (i.e., rocks formed from fragmented, unmelted rocks well as shards of recrystallized impact melt rocks). In 2016, the Chicxulub peak ring was sampled during International Ocean Discovery Program and International Continental Scientific Drilling Program Expedition 364. In this research, we explored the effects of the impact at ground zero with a broader goal of understanding the formation and post-impact physical, chemical, and biological evolution of craters.     Magnetic minerals record the orientation of Earth’s magnetic field at the time their host rocks form or experience a later remagnetization event such as exposure to high pressures, heat, or the formation of new magnetic minerals by hydrothermal activity.  Because all of these effects may be produced by impact events, paleomagnetism (the study of ancient magnetizations preserved within rocks) is an ideal tool for studying crater formation processes. In the Rutgers Paleomagnetism Laboratory, we studied the magnetizations preserved within Chicxulub peak ring rocks to try to unravel the conditions experienced by rocks within the crater.    In our work, we found that impact melt rocks within the Chicxulub peak ring recorded the Earth’s magnetic field immediately after impact as they cooled from initially high temperatures. Impact melt rock magnetizations are exceptionally strong and explain the existence of a "magnetic anomaly" that is observed from aircraft-based magnetic field measurements.    In contrast, we found that impact breccias acquired their magnetization over a much longer period (&gt;150,000 years after the impact) and recorded changes in the orientation of the Earth’s magnetic field over time.  We interpret the long timescale of these magnetic recordings to be due to the formation of new magnetic minerals within the crater’s hydrothermal system.  The migration of hot fluids within impact breccias was facilitated by exceptionally high porosities (approaching 40%) within these rocks.  Our findings demonstrate that hydrothermal systems within impact craters can last for significantly long periods of time and may provide habitats for heat-loving microbial life forms.    We also found that the majority of uplifted granitoid basement rocks contain magnetization directions that imply that their magnetization was acquired prior to their final emplacement positions.  This suggests that, even though the granitoids experienced very high shock pressures (approximately 20 gigapascals), mechanical shock effects and shock-induced heating alone may have been insufficient to fully remagnetize these rocks.  However, granitoids that were located immediately next to impact-produced melt rocks and appear to have been fully remagnetized by the heat associated with the injection of those impact materials into the granitoids, or in some cases by formation of new magnetic minerals by hydrothermal activity.    In summary, we have demonstrated that the strongest magnetizations within craters may be sourced from impact melt rocks, and that long-lived hydrothermalism may also significantly contribute to a crater’s overall magnetic signature.  We have also learned that impact hydrothermal systems may persist for hundreds of thousands of years within craters of this size range and can therefore act as habitats for heat-loving microorganisms.  Our work provides a framework for understanding magnetic signatures and habitability within impact craters on Earth as well as on early Mars, where water was once more abundant.    The aforementioned research was disseminated to the scientific community through a number of research publications and presentations at international conferences.  Some of these publications garnered media attention and were featured in print and online media around the world.  The research outcomes have also been directly shared with the general public in numerous formats.  The Principal Investigator detailed many of the research findings about Chicxulub crater via a personal appearance on a NOVA television episode entitled "Day the Dinosaurs Died", which aired on the PBS network and was subsequently released on streaming platforms.  The Principal Investigator also gave two public lectures about the research for the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, as well as numerous additional seminar presentations at universities across the country.    This project supported the professional development of the Principal Investigator (a female, early-career, tenure-track Assistant Professor) as well as the training of a female and non-traditional Ph.D. student.
