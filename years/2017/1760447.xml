<AbstractNarration>During hurricanes, residents continue to refuse mandatory evacuation orders because of their pets. In other cases, evacuees leave animals behind. Both of these issues are a problem for emergency managers and households because both scenarios can lead to loss of life, considerable distress among pet owners, and logistic challenges for first responders and shelter coordinators. The PETS Act (2006) was designed to solve some of these problems, especially as they were highlighted after Hurricane Katrina. During Hurricane Matthew -- and more recently with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, however, the evacuation of people and their companion animals still presents on-going challenges. Communication about pet-friendly sheltering, the distance and resources required to travel to these locations, and time spent preparing for evacuation with animals all present significant evacuation barriers to residents. This project explores the strategies used by groups amidst Hurricanes Harvey and Irma that resulted in the successful and timely evacuation of companion animals and also explains the ways in which residents made decisions based on their animals. The benefit of this research is through the potential to enhance evacuations by identifying "best practices" for stakeholders managing pets. The researchers may also uncover issues related to social vulnerability, organizational coordination, quick response fieldwork strategies, and other aspects of the research that could be considered important for methodological advances in disaster research and the broader body of knowledge on disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Companion animals are connected to human residents and families. When people refuse or delay evacuation because of their pets, this may lead to loss of life. Therefore, improving evacuation compliance levels associated with the management of pets is a matter of risk reduction. Situated in the broader work on evacuation, disaster policy, and protective action, the three main purposes of this project are to: 1) expand the definition of Focusing Events Theory through group mobilization after policy change in the context of the PETS Act 2) identify and measure the protective action aspects of pets and evacuation from an evacuee perspective, and 3) to use the theoretical model components to create tangible strategies for improved evacuation of companion animals and evacuees. The data from the project involve mixed-methods and are collected in areas heavily impacted by Harvey and Irma in Texas and Florida. Qualitative data ensure the richness of narratives connected to the evacuation decision making surrounding pets, while the quantitative data ensure that the research variables can be measured in multivariate statistical analyses. Results are disseminated to emergency managers and other groups working with understanding and managing and helping people and their companion animals in disasters.</AbstractNarration>

Throughout the course of the project, the investigators gathered data across 6 major disasters: Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, Hurricane Florence (NC and SC), the Tubbs Fire (Santa Rosa, CA), the Hawaii Lava Flows (Puna District, HI), and the Camp Fire (Paradise, CA). The team data included mixed methods primary data from in-person interviews as well as web-based surveys of 315 evacuees and 42 program coordinators (includes volunteers, managers, first responders, and animal shelter coordinators).

In terms of Focusing Event theory, our findings suggest that while pets in disasters remains salient on national news media coverage in each disaster, the specific scope of the PETS Act of 2006 demonstrates several limitations. For example, the PETS Act is designed for sheltering companion animals in the acute phase of the emergency. From our data, many issues arise for families after the disaster (during recovery) that lead to surrender of the animals (i.e. affordable rented housing that allows pets). The broad social issues related to pets and evacuation impact the effectiveness of the overall evacuation and have implications for future evacuation events. For example, our preliminary findings suggest that when organizational communication breaks down for logistics of animal evacuation, human volunteers were less likely to be trusting of organizational leadership and planning.</p> <p>The broader impacts for the research include findings that can be carried over from animal evacuation ?best practices? to all evacuation planning. For example, preliminary findings from our data suggest that organizational capacity influences the overall success of the evacuation. Specifically, volunteer training, diversity of funding for smaller organizations, and partnerships with community-based groups led to more measurable and successful outcomes after the evacuations (i.e. less people surrendering animals because of innovative systems such as foster networks). Findings also suggest that community capacity and access to resources also influence the overall success of the recovery for animals in the disaster zones. Specifically, a policy implication from this research includes planning for long-term preparedness in communities, which includes low cost and easy to access spay and neuter services and educational outreach regarding the importance of microchipping. Spay and neuter decreases the number of displaced animals after disasters (owned and un-owned) and microchipping increases the chance of reunification.

Preliminary findings were presented at the Annual Natural Hazards conference in 2018 and a book is in progress (in review with a publisher). The audience for the book will be a combination of practitioners, scholars, and individuals who are interested in improving systems for evacuations of companion animals in disasters.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/25/2019<br>      Modified by: Sarah&nbsp;E&nbsp;Deyoung</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1760447/1760447_10523774_1553519410528_Foundpets--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1760447/1760447_10523774_1553519410528_Foundpets--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Ad hod reunification site"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1760447/1760447_10523774_1553519410528_Foundpets--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Ad hod reunification site"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Ad hoc pet reunification site in Coffee Park, CA</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sarah E.
