<AbstractNarration>This is funding to support a Doctoral Consortium (workshop) of approximately 12 promising graduate students from U.S. institutions of higher learning, along with at least 3 distinguished research faculty as mentors, to be held in conjunction with the Tenth International Conference on Pervasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments (PETRA 2017), which will take place June 21-23 on the island of Rhodes, Greece.  The PETRA mission is to promote interdisciplinary research on ways to use pervasive ambient intelligent environments to improve the quality of life and enhance human performance with greater capabilities.  It is the only annual conference that brings together theoreticians and practitioners from a wide variety of disciplines to focus on the application of pervasive technologies to assistive environments.  Outcomes of this conference have a broad impact in diverse application areas such as manufacturing, transportation, energy systems, security and safety, robotics, healthcare, biomedicine, environment and conservation.  PETRA brings together very different types of technologies to also address important social and healthcare issues for sensitive populations, such as the elderly, or persons suffering from chronic conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Cerebral Palsy and other disabilities or traumas.  The PETRA proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library, and the authors of the best papers are invited to submit to special journal issues after the end of the conference.  More information about the conference may be found online at http://www.petrae.org.  The PETRA 2017 Doctoral Consortium will afford student authors of papers accepted for presentation at the conference a unique opportunity to gain additional exposure for their innovative ideas while also receiving reinforcement for the importance and value of conducting research with societal impact.  The workshop will allow the junior participants to create a social network both among themselves and with senior colleagues. The organizing committee will make a concerted effort to attract participants who are women, members of under-represented minorities, and persons with disabilities; to further assure diversity, NSF funds will be used to support no more than 2 student participants from any one institution, and if 2 students are supported, one of them must be a minority or person with disability.  To date, over 150 students based in U.S. educational institutions have been able to benefit from NSF support of the PETRA Doctoral Consortia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the Doctoral Consortium, which will consist of special sessions at the beginning, during, and at the end of the conference, are to increase the exposure and visibility of the participants' work within the community, to help establish a sense of community among this next generation of researchers, and to help foster their research efforts by providing substantive feedback and guidance in a supportive and interactive environment from a group of senior researchers.  The special program organized for the students includes sessions between the doctoral students and the faculty mentors, in which the students will discuss their work and ask questions; the faculty mentors will provide constructive comments on the students' work and address their questions.  Each student will be asked to submit a report that provides feedback about the conference, regarding the benefits they received, which presentations they liked and why, and how certain papers and topics relate to their work. After they finish these reports, students will participate in small group breakout sessions to discuss them, and the faculty mentors will provide guidance on how to proceed for further journal publication.  Students will also have the option to submit a poster paper and to attend conference workshops on special topics.  Short papers on the participants' work will be published in the conference proceedings, and a summary report on the event will be posted on the conference website.</AbstractNarration>

The discussions included issues related to making good progress with the Ph.D. thesis. how to best design experiments to collect data, and team work.   Major findings of this project include:  PETRA DC students presented their work to a knowledgeable international audience of experts and interacted with the assigned doctoral consortium faculty mentors, who provided them with useful comments and ideas on how to best continue and advance their Ph.D. research.  The students learned about how to improve their presentation style and build confidence from this experience. The DC students had the opportunity to network with students from other universities and share ideas and approaches for a successful career in computing and applications.  The students had one-on-one meetings with companies working on assistive technologies and with experts who helped them develop career models and gain motivation from opportunities available after graduation. The students' scientific contributions were publicized widely through the PETRA conference ACM Digital Library proceedings that gave their work visibility.  The DC funding highlighted the support of NSF towards young researchers and gave visibility to the departments and institutions in the US where the students came from.   Conclusions: The project was very successful and beneficial to the DC students. The aims of the project were achieved and the scope of the proposed work has been completed.  The PI does not anticipate any further action on this award.       Last Modified: 07/27/2018       Submitted by: Fillia S Makedon]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
