<AbstractNarration>The timing, location, and circumstances of the origin of modern humans has long been of interest among paleoanthropologists and the public. Ongoing studies continue to refine our understanding of early modern humans, and these studies necessarily rely on sparse fossil evidence. This doctoral dissertation project will contribute to the known fossil record for a critical time and place by describing newly-recovered early modern human fossil material near the time of modern human range expansion beyond Africa. The project will support mentoring and training of undergraduate students, including female and first-generation college students. It will also support the establishment of long-standing positive connections between young researchers and research institutions, and their continued participation in research and educational activities. The results of this project will be communicated to the public via a broadcasted radio interview and other media. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes the original description of the skeletal anatomy of an early modern human partial skeleton, as well as additional, more fragmentary human fossil material recovered from the same sedimentary package. These fossils were recovered from a Middle Stone Age archaeological context at Halibee, Middle Awash, preliminarily dated to ~100 kya. The skeletal anatomy of these fossils will be described with reference to anatomically modern human populations, and systematic comparisons of the Halibee fossils with their closest fossil relatives will be completed, including Neanderthals, Homo erectus, and chronologically intermediate groups. Understanding how Middle Pleistocene fossils relate to one another and to later modern humans has been hindered by the sparseness of the Pleistocene postcranial fossil record, and by the variable combinations of plesiomorphic and derived traits displayed by the known fossil specimens. The chronological and geographic position of the Halibee fossils makes them critical to understanding these relationships.</AbstractNarration>

The major goal of this research project was to complete the initial description of the skeletal anatomy of this modern human partial skeleton and the associated postcranial remains. In order to describe the fossils comprehensively and discover how they inform our understanding of human evolution, the initial description was done comparatively by placing the fossils in the context of recent modern human variation, and the variation we see in fossils of genus <em>Homo</em> over the course of the last two million years. Measurements and qualitative observations were collected from the Halibee fossils and from five recent modern human groups, which collectively span five museums. The Halibee fossils are housed in the National Museum of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa, and the modern human skeletons studied for comparison span the Smithsonian?s National Museum of Natural History (groups from northeastern Africa and the Levant), the Raymond A. Dart Collection at University of the Witwatersrand (southern Africa), the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Identified Skeletal Collection at the University of Coimbra (western Europe), and the Phoebe A.

The age, sex, and height estimates for the partial skeleton indicate that the individual was a young to middle-aged male of tall stature. Comparisons of the partial skeleton with the recent modern human groups indicate that this individual falls well within the modern human range of variation for most skeletal traits, but falls at the edge of or just outside of the range for a few traits.
