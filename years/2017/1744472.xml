<AbstractNarration>The National Alliance for Partnerships in Equity Education Foundation (NAPE) will partner with a diverse group of organizations from six states (CO, ID, NM, NV, UT, and WY) to form the Intermountain STEM (IM STEM) project, an NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilot project focused on the goal of increasing the participation and closing achievement gaps in STEM education, including career and technical education. These organizations whose programs impact the formal STEM education system include: Departments of Education; Higher Education agencies; governor supported STEM Action Centers; universities; secondary school districts; community colleges; Department of Energy National Labs; businesses, non-profits and others. The partners in this effort will identify effective practices focused on the common set of objectives and create a model to bring them to scale by employing a collective impact approach. Through the project, the participating organizations will create a common agenda, identify shared metrics, implement mutually reinforcing activities, and maintain continuous communication. This effort addresses directly the lack of diversity of the STEM workforce; a societal challenge of significant magnitude because of its impact on innovation, national security, environmental safety, and income inequality in the US. The IM STEM?s mission to increase the diversity of students who are successful in STEM education will create a more STEM literate society, ensure the contributions of a diverse STEM workforce, and level the playing field for entrance into high wage STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The capacity of IM STEM to bring large well-resourced organizations to bear on the broadening participation challenges in STEM will advance the knowledge of how creative social innovations, like collective impact, can create transformative institutional and cultural change. The collection, evaluation and scaling of effective research-based solutions to close equity gaps in STEM will advance inclusion in STEM. Initially, the IM STEM project will pilot the scaling of NAPE's professional development (PD) programs - Program Improvement Process for Equity and Micromessaging to Reach and Teach Every Student - that have proven to impact equity gaps in STEM and career and technical education (CTE). The six participating states are interested in scaling their current small scale implementation of NAPE's PD programs and will also incorporate selected emerging practices. This design and development launch pilot will provide the vehicle for identifying support mechanisms for scaling of the PD and the identification of additional scaling opportunities with other effective practices of the participating partners. These efforts have the potential to develop a model for expansion to other states wanting to scale effective practices.</AbstractNarration>

IM STEM included stakeholders from government, business, education, and communities across six states (Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming) who represented science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, career and technical education (CTE), and workforce development. IM STEM used a collective impact model to create systems changes in state-level agencies and organizations with the goal of providing diverse students access and opportunities for success in STEM and CTE.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Collective impact initiatives are characterized by five core elements: backbone support, a common agenda, continuous communication, mutually reinforcing activities, and shared measurement. </span></p> <p><strong><span>Backbone Activities:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;NAPE served as the backbone supporting the formation of the network and its nascent efforts, together with a strong and committed Steering Committee.

However,&nbsp;developing specifics to achieving that mission was more difficult. The diversity of the partners, the breadth of the mission, and the need for more time to focus the network's efforts could explain why developing a specific agenda was difficult.</span></p> <p><strong><span>Continuous Communication:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;We implemented multiple communication vehicles: a personal welcome email from a Steering Committee member when an individual signed up as a network participant; social media via Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter; monthly e-newsletter; and listserv.

IM STEM used a collective impact model to create systems changes in state-level agencies and organizations with the goal of providing diverse students access and opportunities for success in STEM and CTE.   Collective impact initiatives are characterized by five core elements: backbone support, a common agenda, continuous communication, mutually reinforcing activities, and shared measurement.   Backbone Activities: NAPE served as the backbone supporting the formation of the network and its nascent efforts, together with a strong and committed Steering Committee. We built a network with more than 1,000 members committed to addressing equity in STEM and CTE. However, it was a challenge to create a sense of shared ownership among the partners so that the backbone wasn't driving the initiative. With limited financial and human resources, we found it difficult to engage Steering Committee members for the long haul and to involve Network members beyond attending meetings.  Creating a Common Agenda: We were successful in establishing a broad shared vision and mission to create a cross-state alliance of formal education system partners who are committed to systems change that creates a culture of success for every student in STEM, ultimately leading to a more diverse STEM workforce. However, developing specifics to achieving that mission was more difficult. The diversity of the partners, the breadth of the mission, and the need for more time to focus the network's efforts could explain why developing a specific agenda was difficult.  Continuous Communication: We implemented multiple communication vehicles: a personal welcome email from a Steering Committee member when an individual signed up as a network participant; social media via Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter; monthly e-newsletter; and listserv. These strategies did not create the two-way communication platform we intended, but they did facilitate network building and resource dissemination.   Mutually Reinforcing Activities: We used workgroups to develop activities across states in the Network. These resulted in the creation of a STEM Equity Program Evaluation Rubric (IM STEM, 2019); STEM Asset Map sharing from three states (Idaho, New Mexico, and Wyoming); and creation of a pilot STEM Asset Map in Nevada. Steering Committee members chaired and participated in workgroups, but engaging the larger group of Network members in these activities was challenging.  Shared Measurement:  The Metrics, Data Collection, and Reporting Workgroup studied the feasibility of cross-state data sharing, which resulted in updating NAPE's national CTE data dashboard.

Typically, collective impact is conducted at a community level, and few models use this approach to facilitate systems change across states such as IM STEM. We hope the following lessons learned will help in considering the use of collective impact to create systems change.  Don't boil the ocean: The collective impact process should identify very specific outcomes the partners want to achieve.   Get it right from the beginning: The collective impact process requires input from all stakeholders into a common agenda and strategic plan that everyone owns. Don't assume that everyone owns the plan if they were not involved in creating it.   Commit adequate resources to support the backbone: To ensure continued progress, collective impact work requires the support of a backbone entity that can serve as convener, provide staff, and collect and report results.   Build on the strengths of the partners: Be sure that all partners have a meaningful role to play and are responsible for some aspect of the work to give them ownership and a reason to be engaged.  Stay true to your common agenda: Once set by the partners, revisit the common agenda regularly to reinforce the partners' commitment to it.   Take time to do this work. Be patient: It takes time to create real change. "Collective impact is a long-term play, not a shortcut to social change" (Stachowiak &amp; Gase, 2018).  All of the successes and challenges were well worth the effort. The lessons learned were significant and will be applied as the organizations involved in this pilot continue to be creative and innovative in collaborating to increase opportunities for diverse learners in STEM and CTE.
