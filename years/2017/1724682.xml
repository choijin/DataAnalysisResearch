<AbstractNarration>When public money is used to fund research, federal science agencies expect excellence in advancing science, along with a clear description of the accompanying societal benefits. This project examines trends for increasing the accountability of scientific research, and identifies new directions for improving the usefulness of science for meeting societal needs. The research presented here has the potential to advance the effectiveness of the STEM community for making its results more relevant to non-academics. The knowledge generated here can help funding agencies demonstrate the societal value of investments in scientific research. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research report reviews the latest elements of the debate surrounding broader impacts in terms of: scientific autonomy versus public accountability, societal concerns versus acceptance of scientific results, the relative advantages of peer review and metrics, and various new mechanisms for encouraging broader impacts. The report offers evidence-based recommendations for policy makers concerned to account for the return on investments in scientific research. The report considers the effects of media, the politics of transparency, the development of a relativistic culture, and compares these developments to policy innovations such as the Impact Agenda and Open Science movement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant produced a research report that offers an environmental scan of recent US and international developments surrounding efforts to promote the broader societal impacts of scientific research. Since October 1997, the National Science Foundation has required grant proposals to describe not only the intellectual merit, but also the "broader impacts" of the proposed research. Reviewers judge proposals based whether they contain good science, and whether the science will benefit society. However, like many other science policies, the actual implementation is more complicated than the policy sounds. As a result, researchers have studied "broader impacts" policy as a topic of inquiry.  Intellectual Merit  This report provides the scientific community and policy makers with a better understanding of the current state of research into broader impacts, outlines trends, and points toward fruitful new directions for research. The report concludes that the central question surrounding broader impacts today is how best to combine the traditional focus on the supply side (scientists disseminating facts to the public) with greater attention to the demand side (the public?s receptivity to science) in order to enhance communication and benefit society.   Policy Recommendations  Conduct research on both the ?supply side? and ?demand side?. The question of      broader impacts has broken loose from its origin in the science and policy      communities to become fundamentally inter- and transdisciplinary in      nature. Future research on broader impacts must account for both 1) the      original, intra-scientific debate surrounding broader impacts (issues of      autonomy and accountability, resistance versus acceptance, peer review and      metrics) and 2) the ongoing changes in the overall cultural receptivity of      science. To better respond to the changing receptivity of society to      scientific insights, Congress should recognize the increased relevance      of NSF?s Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences, and      support its mission with increased funding. Require the assessment of potential ?grimpacts?. It is unrealistic,      and increasingly politically na&iuml;ve, to present accounts of scientific and      technological impact as always ?win-win?. Therefore, the requirement      for imagining possible broader impacts should be modified to include an      account of the possible negative impacts (or ?grimpacts?) of      technoscientific advance. Acknowledge the ?ecosystem? of broader impacts. Disciplinary      standards and university promotion and tenure criteria usually reward      scholarly impact at the expense of broader impacts activities. Therefore, funding      agencies should create venues for ongoing dialogue with higher      education policy groups, professional societies, and others to realign the      higher education reward system with the realities of Broader Impacts 2.0.    Broader Impacts of Suggested Policy Changes  The new cultural environment for receptivity to science highlights the need for expanded broader impacts research in areas such as history, anthropology, media studies, psychology, political science, philosophy, and science, technology, and society studies. Increased funding for social, behavioral, and economic sciences, especially with a focus on understanding the demand side for scientific and technical knowledge, will help us learn how best to maximize the value to taxpayers of tax dollars spent on research. A genuine effort to account for the potential negative impacts of research on society holds the possibility of increasing the level of trust society has that the research it funds will actually benefit society. On the other hand, ignoring potential grimpacts will continue to feed a post-truth narrative. Aligning university promotion and tenure guidelines with funding agency policies to promote broader impacts activities is a tall order. However, doing so will increase the chances that researchers will take broader impacts activities as seriously as they do scholarly impact.
