<AbstractNarration>This research project involves acquiring a high-resolution, non-destructive 3-dimensional specimen micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging instrument to study the structure of 3-dimensional biomaterials as well as animal and plant tissues. This state-of-the-art instrument is a state-wide resource available to all researchers across the South Dakota region. The acquired micro-CT significantly enhances the infrastructure and collaborative atmosphere in three research universities, namely the University of South Dakota, South Dakota State University, and South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, as well as the non-profit research organization, Sanford Research. This instrument enables an increased number of successful research projects and the training of future scientists and engineers. This instrument-acquisition project leverages the long-standing state-wide network, enabled by the NSF EPSCoR, the NSF REU, and the NIH IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence programs, to attract new faculty researchers and to inspire young people in STEM studies and careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquired instrumentation enables important studies expected to contribute to the fundamental understanding of the signaling pathways in determination of a variety of tissue development (e.g., bone, blood vessel, tumor and plant root system) and the relationships between the structure and function of materials and tissues. The specific projects enabled by the micro-CT instrument include: 1) Modulation of adult stem cell functions by innovative bone-matrix mimicking 3-dimensional scaffolds; 2) Imaging of novel antibacterial materials for bone repair; 3) Engineering of desensitizing and remineralizing scaffolds in the dentinal tubules of human teeth; 4) Study of the role of Notch signaling pathway in bone development and tumorigenesis; 5) Development of innovative 3D electrospun nanofibrous polymer/mineral composite scaffolds; 6) Identification of the role of miRNAs in soybean nodule development; and 7) Biomechanical investigation of the effect of irradiation therapy on healthy and cancerous bone. Results from these studies form the foundation for the development of innovative biomaterials and new drugs. This award is funded by the Office of Assistant Director of Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of South Dakota acquired a Scanco MicroCT50 3D micro-computed tomography (microCT) imaging instrument and deployed it to advance research, train students, and engage with industry.  The instrument is used by academic researchers at USD and South Dakota State University and corporate researchers from Sanford Health and Raven Industries.  It has been a critical tool for junior faculty to secure data for impactful publications and graduate students to solve meaningful problems.  The microCT was used to improve the understanding of bone tumorigenesis and soybean root nodule development.  The microCT has been a critical tool that has improved the understanding of the genetic factors in determining congenital bone diseases such as lateral meningocele syndrome and bone cancer such as osteosarcoma. In the bone disease field, the use of high-resolution micro&ndash;computed tomography imaging to assess trabecular and cortical bone morphology has become a standard for quantification.  In addition to biomedical research, the microCT has been used to answer critical developmental questions in agriculture as well.  Nitrogen fixation is achieved by the symbiotic relationship between the soybean and soil bacteria.  The microCT was used to develop methods to non-invasively image internal structures of the root nodules, especially the vasculature.  This allowed for both qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the vascular architecture and the infection zone morphology.
