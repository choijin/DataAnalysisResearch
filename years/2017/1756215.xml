<AbstractNarration>This research focuses on models of dynamic strategic behavior, in which two parties (individuals, nations, corporations, agencies) interact repeatedly over a long horizon and make decisions that have a persistent impact on the environment. The PIs are developing algorithms to simulate behavior in which each party has consistent beliefs about how others will behave and is maximizing their own welfare given those beliefs. These computational methods can be applied to a wide range of models that are used in various fields of economics, as well as in other disciplines such as international relations and evolutionary biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the PIs study the pure strategy subgame perfect equilibria of infinitely repeated games with geometric discounting and a stochastic state variable. The state variable determines the set of actions that can be taken by the agents in each period of the game and the resultant payoffs. Conditional on the actions taken by the players, the state evolves as a Markov chain. The objective of the research is to develop algorithms for computing the discounted payoffs that players can obtain in subgame perfect equilibria starting in each state. The PIs will also develop and distribute software packages that implement the algorithms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have obtained new theoretical results for stochastic games with perfect monitoring. These results underlie a new algorithm that we have proposed to compute the set of subgame perfect equilibria of such games, for arbitrary values of the discount factor. In the context of the two-player case we have developed an implementation of our theoretical algorithm that is web based and publicly available at: http://www.benjaminbrooks.net/software.shtml  for unrestricted use by interested scholars.  Stochastic games are extremely important in economics, and the social sciences more broadly, but they are probably understudied due to the lack of algorithms to analyze them effectively.  Thus, our project is very important for applied researchers who would like to compute equilibria and see how changes in underlying parameters affect the game. Such exercises are also extremely useful to students attempting to understand the nature of dynamic strategic interactions. User-friendly tools have not previously been available for stochastic games.  Our work provides such tools.  Stochastic games provide a framework to analyze strategic interactions in environments in which underlying conditions are evolving over time in ways that may depend on the actions taken by the interacting agents. Examples are wide- ranging and include problems of natural resource depletion, common resource use, global warming, investment and R&amp;D by competing oligopolists, arms races by rival superpowers and domestic political competition.  To the extent that social scientists can solve concrete stochastic games related to such issues (for instance, the depletion of natural resources, climate change and the like) they will be able to offer more informed advice to policy and other decision makers.
