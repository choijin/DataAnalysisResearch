<AbstractNarration>This proposal will support a week-long summer school on Cognitive Robotics to be held in Boston, Ma in June 2017.  The summer school will be a combination of invited talks and tutorials, which are designed to introduce students to issues in planning and execution from perspectives of both Robotics and Cognitive Artificial Intelligence, and daily labs, which are designed to give students hands-on experience with robotic hardware and state-of-the-art software tools for developing robotic behaviors.  The summer school will help expose graduate students to cutting-edge ideas at the intersection of Robotics and Cognitive Systems and will help to form a new community of researchers in this interdisciplinary area.</AbstractNarration>

The intended audience for this summer school included top graduate students, postdocs, and junior researchers, from both the cognitive AI and Robotics disciplines. A feature of our summer school was that we offered students a comprehensive autonomy architecture to use and take home and to offer a unified hands on experience in class.  Advanced tutorials were offered on those major elements of planning and perception that are key to developing capable autonomous systems, and focused on the daily themes of robust execution, motion planning, activity planning, perception and manipulation, and planning with uncertainty and bounded risk.  The summer school included a strong hands on focus, using a common robotic execution architecture that unifies the many methods presented, together with daily robotics labs and a grand challenge for the week, which emphasized modeling and integrated application.    The overall architecture provided included an architecture for a decision layer (Enterprise), which the cognitive AI community uses to combine decision-making components into a planning and execution system, coupled to an architecture for a mobility layer (The Robotics Operating System - ROS), which the robotics community uses to combine its manipulation and perception components.  The idea behind offering a decision layer architecture was to tie the cognitive systems community together, much in the way ROS and similar architectures have done for robotics, and to bring these two communities together, through the hybrid Enterprise/ROS architecture. This architecture was employed in daily labs, centered around the daily tutorial themes, and a grand challenge, which helped students to apply the combined methods they learned throughout the summer school.
