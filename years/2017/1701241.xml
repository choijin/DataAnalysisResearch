<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a recent innovation of designing digital circuits with threshold-logic circuits to fill the need for achieving reductions in power consumption and size of digital systems, at advanced technology nodes.  The threshold-logic circuits and the concomitant design methodology is important because, from a user's perspective, it will enable mobile systems such as laptops and smartphones to operate much longer between recharging of the batteries, and reduce their size and weight. It can also lead to reducing the energy usage of bigger systems such as desktop computers, and massive data centers.  From a manufacturer's perspective, it can result in cost savings, improved reliability and more competitive products.  The project will result in enhanced design tools, the design of threshold-logic primitive cells, and the design of a prototype circuit at least one advanced technology node to serve as a proof-of-concept of its robustness and scalability at lower geometries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This threshold-logic based digital design technology has the following unique features: (1) a new architecture and method of operation of certain digital circuit primitives, and (2) a new way of incorporating them automatically in larger circuits using existing design tools, i.e., without disrupting the existing design methodologies, so that it can be easily adopted by industry.   These features provide the following advantages: smaller circuits, lower dynamic power consumption, lower standby power consumption, and lower variations in power, all without sacrificing speed, when compared to the leading competing digital ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) technology in this market space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery (successfully demonstrated at 65nm node) toward commercial application: the scalability of the technology and design methodology to advanced (smaller geometries- 40nm, 28nm) technology nodes, including overcoming physical design challenges, maintaining robustness to increased process variations, and scaling the accompanying software tools to industrial-scale circuits. These challenges will be addressed by first developing the circuit libraries in 40nm, which is still a key technology for many companies competing in the $1T IoT (internet of things) market, and then advancing to 28nm in FD-SOI.  The performance and capability of the design software will be enhanced by developing better interfaces to existing commercial design tools, and use of faster software libraries and commercial software platforms.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, personnel involved in this project, Ph.D. level graduate students, will continue to receive significant training that requires developing a broad range of design and analytical skills, in multiple technical areas, as well as learning how to meet exacting industrial design standards.  Other activities will include summer internships with companies that have expressed interest in the threshold-logic technology, visiting companies and presenting and marketing the research outcomes to industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Thi project was aimed at designing and fabricating a digital integrated circuit chip in an advanced technology node to serve as a proof-of-concept demonstration of a novel technology that was developed under a previous PFI-BIC grant (#1237856) and NSF ICORPS grant (#1565921).  The outcome of the PFI-BIC grant was a fundamentally new way to design digital circuits.  These are the circuits that go into practically every electronic device that people use and interact with--small, low cost processors in home appliances, to the hundreds of sophisticated processors that are used in cars, planes, smartphones, etc.  The list is practically endless. The new approach to digital system design was a systematic method to embed circuits called binary neurons within digital circuits to simultaneously reduce the power consumption and area of the latter, without sacrificing performance.  The approach included three innovations:  A patented design of a digital circuit architecture that implements a new type of logic primitives referred to as threshold logic gates (TLG); A patented design of a novel standard cell library of TLGs, which is compatible with conventional cell libraries used by Commercial synthesis, optimization and physical design tools; and patented algorithms that optimize a logic network for power using a combination of conventional logic gates and TLGs.   The circuit architecture, cell library and technology mapping algorithms were all designed to ensure total compatibility with existing commercial design flows, allowing fully automated synthesis, optimization and final layout using commercial tools. The approach has been demonstrated on large function blocks using state-of-the-art commercial design tools: results showed a 25%-35% reduction in dynamic power, 20%-40% reduction in leakage, and a 10%-25% reduction in area, all without sacrificing performance. The effort resulted in 11 patent applications (5 issued and 6 pending).  While the basic research has been completed under the PFI-BIC grant, and the results show great promise for commercialization, this project  was aimed at eliminating a few challenging barriers that remain before the technology can be commercialized.  The goals of this project were formulated based on the two key outcomes of the ICORPs project. They are  demonstrating robustness of the proposed technology at smaller geometry nodes while ensuring that all the benefits shown for 65nm are indeed retained;  determine the minimum viable product (MVP) that might be easy to adopt by industry; demonstrating that the software developed can accommodate industrial-scale circuits.   Our effort to improve the robustness of threshold logic gates led to us to explore threshold logic circuits in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). Their intrinsic reconfigurability provides an almost obvious opportunity to exploit all the advantages of low power and high performance of threshold logic circuits. Toward this end, we developed a new architecture for FPGAs that includes threshold logic cells within the Basic Logic Block (BLE) along with the conventional Lookup Tables (LUT). We demonstrated excellent improvements in performance, power and area of Threshold Logic FPGAs.   During this (final) reporting period (07/01/2019 - 12/31/2019) we explored a radically different path to improving the robustness of threshold logic gates, while still maintaining their significant advantages in power, performance, and area.  We discovered that the new architecture has the potential for solving a fundamental security problem, namely, the need to prevent the design of integrated circuits (ASIC)  from being stolen when they are disclosed to a foundry for fabrication.   Thus, our new goal is to market the technology developed under this award as a unique solution to addressing security of ICs, while maintaining all the benefits that were the primary motivation for project in the first place.  The aspect of security that can be addressed here is the prevention of theft of the ASIC design by a foundry.  Existing methods of securing a design come with a very high cost in terms of increased power and area, and reduced performance. We are pleased to report that we have made a significant breakthrough.  The new architecture and design methodology not only results in a dramatic improvement in the robustness of our threshold logic gate circuit (which in turn also vastly expands the set of functions that can be computed by a single cell), but also allows for completely securing the design of an ASIC and preventing a foundry from discovering the function of the circuit. The modified circuit design now allows us to target an entirely different market - namely, the US defense establishment.  The new design provides the US defense industry a perfectly secure way to manufacture its ASICs at any foundry without disclosing the function of the chip.
