<AbstractNarration>Forests in the western US are facing warmer temperatures and larger, more severe wildfires than at any time in recorded history. Lodgepole pine forests of Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming) are well adapted to large, severe wildfires, which have burned at 100 to 300-yr intervals during the past 10,000 years. However, the interval between fires is shortening, making it likely that young forests will re-burn before fully recovering from previous fires. How forests will respond to more frequent fire and warmer, drier conditions is not known. Wildfires during summer 2016 burned young forests (less than 30 years old) that grew after the momentous 1988 Yellowstone Fires. These recent fires produced an unexpected opportunity to study the characteristics of short-interval fires and their effects on western pine forests. Sampling soon after severe fire is necessary because the time to find field evidence of burn severity is very short after the fire, and most tree seedlings establish during the first year after the fire. This RAPID award will measure burn severity, tree establishment and carbon storage in young forests that burned in 2016. Results will be immediately useful to regional forest managers, and mini-documentary videos will explain effects of increasing fire activity on western forests to a wide audience. Field data also will be used to improve computer models of forest growth and to assess burn-severity patterns across the US northern Rocky Mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field studies in areas burned in the 1988 fires that burned again in 2106 will test three hypotheses. (1) Short-interval fires will reduce forest resilience because burns will be of high severity, and post-fire conifer regeneration and carbon storage will be substantially reduced. (2) Post-fire climate will amplify consequences of short fire-return intervals such that post-fire conifer establishment will be substantially reduced (or fail) in re-burns where conditions are warm and dry. (3) Regionally, the proportion of high-severity fire will be greater in short-interval than long-interval fires, but landscape patterns of high-severity fire will be similar. Burn severity, tree regeneration and carbon storage will be measured during summer 2017 in 0.25-ha plots following standard protocols. A seed addition experiment will be conducted to separate effects of seed supply from post-fire climate conditions on tree seedling establishment. Plot-based burn-severity data will be used to validate satellite-based burn-severity metrics and to map spatial patterns of burn severity in short-interval fires across the Northern Rockies. This study will help scientists and managers understand conditions likely to change forest ecosystems fundamentally in a future with more fire.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Conifer forests in western North America are facing warmer temperatures and larger, more severe wildfires than at any time in recorded history. Subalpine forests historically burned in severe fires (stand-replacing fires that kill all the trees) separated by centuries-long fire-free intervals. The forests are well adapted to such fires, and tree regeneration after fire is rapid and abundant. The thriving young lodgepole pine forests that regenerated after the 1988 Yellowstone Fires and now blanket much of Yellowstone National Park (Figure 1) nicely illustrate how well these forests rebound after fire. But as climate warms, fire return intervals are projected to decline sharply by mid century, from 100-300 years to only a few decades. While increases in fire size, severity, and frequency are already evident, the consequences for forest ecosystems are not clear. The timing, sequence, and location of wildfires cannot be planned in advance, so scientists must respond quickly when opportunities to study effects of changing disturbance regimes arise. This study was a rapid response to recent fires in Greater Yellowstone (Wyoming, USA) that reburned young lodgepole pine forests that regenerated after wildfires in 1988 and 2000. Such short-interval fires are expected to become much more common by mid century, but whether forests will still have the ability to recover after such fires is not known.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We conducted field studies during 2017 in areas of short-interval fire within the 2016 Berry Fire (Grand Teton National Park; Figure 2) and Maple Fire (Yellowstone National Park; Figure 3). Our goal was to determine how fires that reburned these forests in &lt; 30 years affected burn severity, early postfire tree regeneration, and carbon stocks. Some areas burned as a ?typical? crown fire (Figure 4). However, in other areas, nearly all biomass was combusted ('crown fire plus'; Figure 5) where prefire trees were very dense and small in diameter. Postfire tree seedling density was reduced six-fold relative to the previous (long-interval) fire, and high-density forests were converted to sparse forests. Carbon losses to combustion were much greater than measured previously in long-interval fires. A simulation model was then used to project rates of carbon recovery with and without the reburns. High carbon losses in reburns were plus sparse tree regeneration delayed simulated carbon recovery by &gt;150 yrs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To complement the field observations, a replicated seed-addition experiment was conducted to assess effects of environmental conditions--especially soil temperature and moisture--on lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir seedling establishment (Figure 5). Seeds of both species were planted in 2017 and monitored throughout the 2018 growing season. Tree seedling establishment was extremely low for both species on south-facing slopes, which were very warm and dry. No additional natural tree seedling establishment was recorded in 2018. Furthermore, seed dispersal from surrounding live forest into reburns was minimal because surrounding live forests were young and short. The consequences of short-interval fires may be amplified if burned areas exceed thresholds of soil moisture needed for tree seedlings to establish, and if there is little seed dispersal from nearby live forests during the early postfire years.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Fire frequency is increasing and may exceed the historical record as climate continues to warm. This study found that short-interval severe fires in lodgepole pine forests of Greater Yellowstone led to substantial losses woody biomass and reduced tree regeneration, which together delayed simulated recovery of aboveground carbon for &gt;150 yrs. Results suggest the potential for profound changes in forest structure and function if short-interval fires become more common in a warmer world with more fire.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We produced two videos that were central among our broader impacts. These were widely distribution by the University of Wisconsin-Madison and University of Washington via social media. We also engaged widely with journalists and varied news media, gave public presentations, wrote articles for a general audience, and led a field trip for regional forest and fire managers. This project provided research opportunities for undergraduate students and contributed to the training of graduate students and postdocs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/18/2019<br>      Modified by: Monica&nbsp;G&nbsp;Turner</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1719905/1719905_10475667_1555602212078_Fig1_Maple_Unb2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1719905/1719905_10475667_1555602212078_Fig1_Maple_Unb2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Maple Unburned 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1719905/1719905_10475667_1555602212078_Fig1_Maple_Unb2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Maple Unburned 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1.
