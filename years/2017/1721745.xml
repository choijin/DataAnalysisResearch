<AbstractNarration>Many governance measures are developed by lawyers, government officials, and experts in science and engineering whose specialized knowledge inform the development of standards and the measures of outcomes. Yet when those regulatory mechanisms break down, remedies can be hard to identify. Stakeholders, including environmental organizations, may pursue remedies in courts at regional, national&lt;br/&gt;or transnational levels. Courts in these different jurisdictions therefore become a significant but understudied part of the policy-making apparatus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop invites scholars to synthesize new models of legal mobilization in this pressing regulatory environment (1) through litigation;(2) through local and regional governance;(3) through the variable expertise taken as relevant to making decisions, including data analytics expertise and law.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A group convened to discuss sociolegal  about extreme weather events.  Topics included lawsuits and other legal strategies concerning regulation of emissions and the purposes of regulation, the management of investment strategies, and frameworks for understanding just governance for managing extreme weather events for the benefit of people.  The discussion of investment included analysis of recent moves to disinvest in fosill fuels, and unintended impacts of that investment strategy.  Leading cases gathered in databases concerning litigation for responsibility for extreme weather events were analyzed in terms of causation, potential for change, and time.  People also discussed rebuilding and dilemmas in rebuilding after extreme weather events.  Dimensions included different ways of understanding time as well as problems of variation in the place of events.  Scholars included people from Spain, the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States.  Therefore, the project offered excellent opportunities for comparison.  Since extreme weather events have created tremendous damage in the United States and elsewhere, comparison of governance strategies and consideration of timelines, causation, and response are crucial contributions to understanding.  As a result of the analyses presented at the workshop, scholars have submitted manuscripts for consideration for publication with the International Institute for the Sociology of Law.  This publication will be available as open access, available to inform teaching and research around the world.    We expect this publication to be complete in summer 2018.
