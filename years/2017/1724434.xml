<AbstractNarration>This proposal will support US-based Ph.D. students working in artificial intelligence the opportunity to share their knowledge and interact with each other and more senior researchers, to learn about different sub-fields within AI, and to be mentored in research, publication, and career opportunities. This goal will be accomplished by partially supporting the travel costs for US-based Ph.D. students to attend the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), which is one of the premier international conferences on research in artificial intelligence. The conference, which in 2017 will be held in Melbourne, Australia attracts an international crowd that includes academics, industry workers, entrepreneurs, and funding agency leaders.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project funded a selected group of Ph.D. students from the US to attend the Doctoral Mentoring Consortium at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI, which was held in Melbourne, Australia, August 19-25, 2017.  The Doctoral Mentoring Consortium consisted of a full day of activities, which included: one invited speaker who talked to the students about how to optimise their PhD and postdoc life thinking strategically about their career  and the actions needed to get there; a career panel which included  faculty at different career stages and researchers from industry; short talks by the students who had an accepted abstract on their research; a poster session.  Sharing research ideas and collaborating on research projects across national boundaries is becoming critical to accelerate the research progress, avoid duplication, and produce a greater return on investment.  The fact the Doctoral Consortium included students who are not studying in the US (none of them funded under this grant) exposed the students to different cultures and broadened their professional networks outside their own institution and their own country, preparing the foundations for long trem international cooperation and better cultural awareness.  The students funded by this project have received unique and highly valuable training.  A valuable part of training new researchers is to give them the opportunity to interact with leaders in their research field outside their own research group.  This helps the students seeing their work in a broader context, gives them opportunities for receiving different feedback, and makes them more independent of their research advisor. The students had multiple opprtunities to extend their professional network to other students and senior researchers.
