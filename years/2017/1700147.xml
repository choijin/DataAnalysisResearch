<AbstractNarration>The mathematical analysis of dynamical systems -- systems which evolve through time -- has found diverse applications in fields from economics and weather forecast to engineering and astronomy. Many systems arising from such applications tend to exhibit chaotic behavior and can be very difficult to analyze directly. Nevertheless, it is always possible to obtain useful information about such systems by studying their long term behavior. The overarching goal of this project is to develop new methods to study the long term behavior of dynamical systems in a theoretical setting and to explore applications to the mathematical subject of combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by Furstenberg's proof of Szemeredi's theorem using ergodic theory in 1977, several results in Ramsey theory and combinatorial number theory were since obtained using ideas and methods from dynamical systems. The interplay with combinatorics has likewise enriched the fields of ergodic theory and topological dynamics with a wealth of interesting new problems. The two main research directions of this project are:&lt;br/&gt;1. To develop new techniques within the framework of dynamical systems to solve Ramsey theoretic problems, with emphasis on those concerning partition regularity of (systems of) non-linear equations.&lt;br/&gt;2. To improve the understanding of the long term behaviour of measure preserving systems by exploring the phenomena of multiple recurrence and convergence of  multiple ergodic averages along polynomials and other natural classes of sequences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During this project, we worked to improve the current knowledge on Ramsey theory, with a particular focus on the qualitative and arithmetic aspects of the subject, on multiple recurrence in Ergodic theory, and on the connections between the two subjects. The project lead to the development of new tools, as well as improvements on existing techniques in order to answer currently open questions in these areas.  A major achivemet of the project was the resolution, in joint work of Joel Moreira, Florian Richter, and Donland Robertson, of an old conjecture of Erdos.  The result is that any subset of integers with positive upper density contains all of the sums of elements of two infinite sets.  The proof features two different decompositions of an arbitrary sequence into a structure componant and a pseudo-random component.  The methods are sufficiently general such that they allo wthe proof of a version of the Erdos conjecture in the more general setting of countable amenable groups.   In addition, several collaborations were continued, continuing on the theme of finding new patterns in large subsets of the integers.  This lead to the discovery of new recurrence phenomena in ergodic theory, along with transflations of the results to sufficiently large sets of integers, showing that such sets contain new patterns.    All results of the project were dissminated in meetings and conferences, in publication in peer reviewed journals, and in publiciation on the arXiv and on webpages.
