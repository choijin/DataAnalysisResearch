<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;In quantum materials such as superconductors and topological insulators quantum physics underlies most important properties. Unraveling the puzzles posed by these materials is one of the main scientific challenges of the 21st century, with direct relevance to new generations of electronic, energy, and medical technologies. This project is devoted to observing how these materials evolve in time after being hit by a short laser pulse. Using a new experimental technique, pump-probe Raman spectroscopy, the researchers make movies of how quantum materials evolve in time taking frames every 0.00000000000001 sec. Light travels a fraction of a millimeter during these time intervals, so very fast processes can be detected in slow motion. A weak laser pulse may kick some electrons out of their orbits. These will hit atoms and other electrons revealing interactions between electrons and the atomic lattice. If the laser pulse is strong, the material can briefly go into a different state, e.g. a superconductor will lose superconductivity. Observing how it comes back to the original state reveals otherwise hidden mechanisms. This knowledge is used to test fundamental theories and helps to harness quantum materials for practical applications in electronics, photonics, and energy. The work is carried out at the ultrafast laser spectroscopy laboratory at the University of Colorado (CU)-Boulder built with the funds provided previously by the National Science Foundation (NSF). It is be a part of a Ph.D. thesis of two graduate students and contributes to undergraduate education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on groundbreaking measurements of materials where quantum physics underlies most important physical properties. The general goal is to understand how these materials behave away from thermal equilibrium: The investigated sample is driven out of equilibrium by a short laser pulse, and another time-delayed laser pulse probes its relaxation by serving as the excitation laser for Raman spectroscopy. The work is carried out at the new ultrafast laser spectroscopy laboratory at the University of Colorado (CU)-Boulder built with the funds provided previously by National Science Foundation (NSF). The laser system at the heart of this laboratory is one of the most advanced of its kind in the world. It is utilized for pump-probe angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and pump-probe Raman spectroscopy. This project represents the Raman component of this effort. All Raman active excitations are tracked during relaxation. These include phonons, magnons, and some electronic excitations across gaps of up to 5eV. Raman scattering can directly probe the energies, lifetimes, and population of excited states (e.g. phonon occupation numbers). The time-resolved Raman scattering measurements are on charge density wave (CDW) systems, different types of superconductors, Mott insulators, and novel spin-orbit materials. They display diverse and often still enigmatic physical phenomena of great interest and the principal investigator already investigated them by other related techniques. It is a part of a Ph.D. thesis of two graduate students and contributes to undergraduate education.</AbstractNarration>
