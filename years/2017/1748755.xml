<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation's Nanoscale Science and Engineering Grantees Conference: Progress in Nanotechnology will be held December 12-13, 2017 in Arlington, Virginia.  Now in its seventeenth year, the conference is held annually to highlight the research and education activities of currently-funded projects. The conference brings together researchers, educators, and practitioners from academic, industry, and government sectors to share progress, discuss challenges, and explore new opportunities for collaboration.   This year's conference focuses on foundational nanotechnology and infrastructure, grand challenges, and convergence of disciplines in nanomanufacturing.   In addition to keynote presentations on these topics, the conference features panel discussions expanding on the main topics, poster sessions presenting current research, and multiple networking opportunities.  The conference supports dissemination of grant-funded research results and fosters ideation of new avenues of exploration, promoting advances in many disciplines including public health and medicine, environmental science, cybersecurity, materials, and manufacturing.  Nanotechnology as a component of improving the public perception of science and nanotechnology education is also a component of the workshop. The conference also affords NSF program directors opportunities for discussions with principal investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Day 1 of the conference includes keynotes and panel discussions on Progress in Foundational Nanotechnology and Infrastructure.  The agenda includes nanoscale modeling/simulation and use of big data, nanotechnology-based devices and systems by design, and two-dimensional materials and quantum phenomena in nanoscales systems, along with updates from nano-centers.  The Day 2 agenda focuses on Progress in Grand Challenges and Convergence, with invited speakers and panelists presenting on manufacturing networks and nanotechnology, advanced nano-biomanufacturing convergence across disciplines, and brain-like cognitive systems.  Panelists with expertise in brain-inspired computing hardware architecture and brain-machine interfaces, and nano device re-creation of neural and synaptic functions will discuss how nanotechnology contributes to brain-like computing and share visionary ideas for the next twenty years.  A working lunch on best practices when portraying nanotechnology research and development in video and on the web is a highlight.  The conference closes with educational and societal aspects of nanotechnology, with panel discussions on nanotechnology immersion in the public perception of science, societal aspects of nanotechnology and converging technologies, and convergence in education.</AbstractNarration>

The 2017 grantees conference concluded successfully with 31 speakers and panelists presenting on foundational nanotechnology and infrastructure, grand challenges, and convergence of disciplines in nanomanufacturing. The conference featured keynote presentations on these topics, panel discussions, and a poster session where students and researchers shared current progress on 27 projects.  The conference offered multiple networking opportunities through breaks, working lunches, and a poster session on the first night.  Participants had the opportunity to share research results simultaneously with colleagues across many disciplines and sectors. The overarching goal each year is to foster development of new areas of exploration, promoting advances in broader disciplines such as public health and medicine, environmental science, cybersecurity, materials, and manufacturing. Attendees also discussed nanotechnology as a component of improving the public perception of science in general, and nanotechnology education. The attendees were well engaged with the presentations and panel discussions, easily consuming and often exceeding allotted Q&amp;A time.  Finally, the conference afforded NSF program directors opportunities for informal interaction with principal investigators.  Registered attendees were surveyed after the conference to determine the effectiveness of the event. Findings include:  97% slightly agree&ndash;strongly agree:       "The conference topics were of general interest to the nano community."  91% slightly agree&ndash;strongly agree:        "The presentations were engaging and useful."  100% slightly agree&ndash;strongly agree:     "I was able to learn about progress in areas outside my normal research topics."   94% slightly agree&ndash;strongly agree:       "Networking opportunities at the conference were valuable."  Additionally, 74% of respondents indicated they will attend the conference again in 2018, with 26% unsure at the time of the survey.  Several responses suggested topics for the upcoming year, including outreach and engagement strategies, nanoparticle drug delivery, nanotechnology in soft materials, and quantum information science and technology.  The conference website maintained by the University of Massachusetts, http://nseresearch.org/2017 , contains archival information on the presentations, highlights, and posters.  The organizers thank all participants and collaborators for their help making the 2017 conference a success.  We also thank the National Science Foundation for its continued support of this event.       Last Modified: 10/15/2018       Submitted by: Lynn Zentner]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
