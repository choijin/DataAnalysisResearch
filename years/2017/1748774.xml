<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/ commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to reduce loss of life in disaster rescue on rough terrain. Disaster rescue can endanger the lives of both the victims and the first responders, with the Red Cross reporting 400 deaths in disaster rescue in the past 20 years.  More than half of the casualties were volunteers who entered unchartered risky environments. Future deaths could be prevented by utilizing semi-autonomous technology to explore the regions of disasters, provide surveillance to inform first responders, and assist in the rescue of victims until human first responders can arrive. By dropping the proposed shape-shifting robots from aerial vehicles, these mobile robots could explore previously difficult to reach areas for effective emergency response. This proposed technology will also have broader impact in use for scientific monitoring and surveillance as well as for educational applications for K-12 students, teachers, parents, roboticists and hobbyists. With the potential to have large impact (with over 3 million potential teachers; 1 million teachers alone in secondary schools), robot kits could be marketed for educational applications, especially for schools trying to meet the Next Generation Science Standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/ commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to reduce loss of life in disaster rescue on rough terrain.

Shape-shifting Robots for Disaster Rescue, Monitoring, and Education</strong></p> <p>With the funding from this I-Corps grant, Squishy Robotics expanded our customer research and tested tensegrity sensor robot prototypes for the first responder and hazardous material (HazMat) market. We also developed a business case and models that validate our move to commercialization. At each stage of this work, we sought customer feedback through one-on-one interviews, focus groups, and on-site participation during field trials and testing. Our technology platform, which builds on previous robotic prototypes for space exploration using spherical six-bar tensegrity structures, is currently being used in training scenarios by some of the largest fire departments in the United States.</p> <p class="Normal2">Based on customer research, we focused our customer development energy and time on the disaster response market. Disaster rescue can endanger the lives of both the victims and the first responders as they enter unchartered, risky environments. Our semi-autonomous robots are able to explore the regions of disasters, provide surveillance to inform first responders, and assist in the rescue of victims until human first responders can arrive. The value proposition of our robots is to save lives, reduce risks and increase efficiency in disaster response.</p> <p class="Normal2">Squishy Robotics? shape-shifting robots have been successfully airdropped from drones and helicopters (400-foot and 600-foot airdrops, respectively). Airdrop testing has been conducted by current and potential customers. Two of the largest fire departments in the country?the Houston Fire Department and the Los Angeles County Fire Department?have entered into partnerships with Squishy Robotics and are currently running training scenarios using our technologies, preparing their first responders to use our robots during emergencies. Our technology is demonstrating that our rapidly deployable robots can reach difficult-to-access areas and transmit the video, locational, chemical, and situational data that first responders need to keep themselves and the public safe. With each training session, our company learns more from these first responder customers as well as from their department leaders and decision-makers.</p> <p class="Normal2">In November 2018, Squishy Robotics demonstrated how our robotic technology can assist emergency first responders and saves lives during critical disaster situations while participating in Operation Convergent Response at the Guardian Centers in Perry, GA. Squishy Robotics was the only company to successfully airdrop sensitive equipment from a drone onto earthquake rubble, demonstrating to all attendees that we can deliver a desired package of sensitive equipment within three feet of an earthquake victim. This public safety technology expo and live demonstration event was co-sponsored by Verizon and Nokia and introduced our company to emergency response teams from throughout the country. We continue to communicate and develop customer leads with decision-makers that we met at this event.</p> <p class="Normal2">We have also conducted interviews with governmental, military, and private company representatives who have indicated that our technology likely has a broader use impact for scientific monitoring and surveillance. Squishy Robotics is continuing this customer outreach and research, expanding our contacts among fire department commanders, forestry and air-quality specialists, sensor and robotic companies, EPA scientists, and military personnel.</p> <p>Throughout this grant, Squishy Robotics was able to mentor diverse graduate and undergraduate students in various engineering disciplines as well as students in other majors, such as business. &nbsp;Through public presentations and outreach activities, Squishy Robotics has received wide media coverage in industry, business, and the general press.</p>
