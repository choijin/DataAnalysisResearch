<AbstractNarration>This award supports the sixth Poisson Geometry Conference to be held at the University of Notre Dame on May 4-7, 2017. The Poisson Geometry Conference series consists of regular meetings in North America of mathematicians interested in Poisson geometry and its applications, attracting leading experts and young researchers alike. The aim of the series is to promote interaction between mathematicians inspired by problems arising in physics, and physicists searching for new mathematical tools.  The meetings  also serve as a unique forum for junior mathematicians from all over the United States to learn about cutting edge developments in Poisson geometry and to disseminate their own research results in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poisson geometry originated as the mathematical formulation of classical mechanics as the semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics. Its history began with classical work by Poisson, Hamilton, Jacobi, and Lie, developing into a separate field in its own right around 1980 via the work of Lichnerowicz and Weinstein. Today, Poisson geometry influences and is influenced by many adjacent areas of mathematics, including symplectic geometry, generalized complex geometry, Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids, geometric mechanics, cluster algebras, integrable systems, quantization, non-commutative geometry, stratification theory, and the geometry of singular symplectic and Poisson structures. The "Gone Fishing" workshops provide an excellent opportunity for members of various groups working on related areas from different perspectives to exchange new ideas and stimulate collaboration.  The goal of each workshop is to address important questions and future directions of the subject. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference website: http://www3.nd.edu/~conf/pgc2017/</AbstractNarration>
