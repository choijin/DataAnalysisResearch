<AbstractNarration>The fifth generation of wireless communication promises to provide Gigabits per second data transfer rates and communication delays of less than a millisecond. Significant challenges must be overcome in designing a system architecture such that data intensive and/or latency sensitive applications can obtain the information that they need for peak performance. Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has the potential to enable wireless efficiencies that are critical to support the strict guarantees desired by new applications such as virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) or the control of swarms of unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs). The goal of this project is to design, develop and demonstrate SPLICE, a Secure Predictive Low-Latency Information-Centric Edge wireless network that will be able to provide information guarantees to these emerging applications. The project will also contribute to workforce development by means of curriculum development in this domain and recruitment of students from under-represented groups in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work is anchored in an ICN implementation called Named Data Networking (NDN), which will be able to effectively tie together application demands and wireless links. The research is organized into three inter-dependent thrusts: (i) Applications for an Information-Centric Wireless Edge: This thrust will define the performance criteria and determine the architecture of the focus application of the project: VR/AR. It will exploit multiple dimensions of commonality between instances of such applications through fast content caching and retrieval, and multicast services. (ii) ICN for the Wireless Edge: explore how information exchange via caching and markets would be accomplished, and how to design secure and privacy-preserving data transfer methods. A key novelty is the use of proactive secure caching that learns the value of applications and ensures they are cached ahead of demand. (iii) Wireless Communication for Information-Centric Networks: employ multicasting capabilities of wireless communication while simultaneously achieving low-delay guarantees and low-complexity feedback mechanisms, via a mix of coding, caching and scheduling techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated the design of a new paradigm for Internetworking. Traditionally, the networks communicate by using IP addresses that identify the end-hosts. This paradigm has served us well for several decades, but that most of the traffic carried over the network is now content rather than communication between two users, a new paradigm has been developed. This paradigm allows networking to happend based on naming the content rather than the end-hosts. Such an architecture is called Named Data Networks (NDN) or more generally Information Centric Networks (ICN).  The goal of our project has been to design, develop and demonstrate a secure predictive low-latency Information-Centric Edge wireless network that will be able to provide information guarantees to these emerging applications. To that end, the project has generated a significant advancement over the state-of-the-art across the following dimensions:  Prefetching of predictable demands:   We developed a novel way of pre-fetching content (e.g., content that would be most popular) through predictions in order to reduce the delay that the end user would experience and improve the reliability of the content.  Multicasting of common demand sfor low delay: We developed new and efficient techniques to multicast popular information to a large number of end-users simultaneously in order to dramatically reduce the load on the network and simultaneously improve the delay.   Distributed caching: We developed a framework for distributed caching of content for service over unreliable channels. Our investigation revealed two counterintuitive insights that are in stark contrast with the principles of distributed caching under reliable conditions: (i) that resources-pooling is no longer optimal in the presence of channel unreliabilities, and (ii) that, even under symmetric unreliabilities, it is necessary to allocate unequal cache spaces to otherwise identical distributed caches. This allowed a new caching framework to be developed for ICN systems.   Load Balancing: A critical techniique used for distributed reousrces acorss the network or data centers is called load balancing. We developed a very general  framework called Local-Estimation-Driven (LED) for solving the load balancing problem for multiple dispacthers, and multiple servers, serving a large user population.  We were able to develop policies that were provably optimal in terms of delay and show substantial performance improvements over the state of the art.   The technological advances have significant societal impacts by providing new principles and methods for efficient, low-cost, and large-scale content distribution in future communication networks. Moreover, the project has contributed to the training and education of the next generation of engineers with diverse backgrounds.
