<AbstractNarration>This project funds participant support for the 7th through 9th annual Boston University/Keio University Workshops, with the 7th Workshop, to be held June 26-30, 2017 at Boston University, focusing on Geometry and Mathematical Physics. The 2018 workshop will focus on Dynamical Systems, and the 2019 workshop will focus on Number Theory. The funding is dedicated to partial support for advanced graduate students and recent PhDs based at US institutions outside the Boston area.  The workshops will provide participants with the opportunity to hear advanced talks in their research fields, to present their own work in a professional setting, and to network with each other and with senior experts.  Through funding from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Keio University faculty bring similar participants to these workshops from Japan. As a result, these workshops strengthen research ties between the US and Japanese mathematics and statistics communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops follow a format in which senior faculty lecture on recent research directions in the morning, and recent PhD recipients and graduate students present their own work in the afternoon.  Poster sessions accommodate additional presentations, and each workshop includes a discussion section on open problems in the field and other issues of particular interest for early-career participants, such as career placement.  The workshops provide websites with lecture notes and slides from the research presentations, which serve to disseminate these cutting edge research results to the broad communities. More information can be found at the workshop website http://math.bu.edu/keio2016/index.html.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For the past nine years, the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Boston University has hosted a joint workshop with the Mathematics Department at Keio University (Japan) on advances in research areas of common interest.  These five-day workshops are explicitly designed to be accessible to advanced graduate students, and so are a complement to the many conferences that are aimed at senior research faculty. One unfortunate but perhaps inevitable feature of more high powered conferences is that junior participants often find the atmosphere exciting but  intimidating. This NSF grant funds the participation of advanced graduate students and recent PhDs at the workshop, with the goal that junior particpants find the atmosphere exciting but not intimidating.  The funded participants have the opportunity to give a professional talk in an environment where networking with senior faculty is encouraged.    The three workshops covered by this grant are: Geometry and Mathematical Physics (2017), Dynamical Systems (2018), and Number Theory (2019).  The schedule and lecture notes from these workshops are available at http://math.bu.edu/keio2017 (and the same URL with 2017 replaced by 2018 or 2019).  In total, this grant covered costs for 18 junior participants.  The total number of participants in the three workshops was approximately 150.  Funded participants anecdotally reported very favorable impressions from the workshops. Unfortunately, the 2020 workshop had to be cancelled due to the coronavirus, but we expect to continue in 2021.       Last Modified: 05/27/2020       Submitted by: Steven Rosenberg]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
