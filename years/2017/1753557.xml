<AbstractNarration>1753557 (Badurdeen). "Enabling the Circular Economy through Sustainable Manufacturing" will be theme for this Forum organized by the Institute for Sustainable Manufacturing (ISM) at the Lexington Convention Center, Lexington, Kentucky. The concept of Circular Economy promotes a restorative approach through regenerative design to concurrently pursue sustained economic growth, environmental protection, and societal wellbeing. Given that manufacturing is an engine of wealth generation in many economies, adopting sustainability practices in manufacturing is imperative to the Circular Economy vision. Sustainable Manufacturing to promote the Circular Economy is only feasible through a total and multi-lifecycle based approach to closed-loop material flow by adopting the 6Rs of Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Recover, Redesign and Remanufacture. This Forum will bring together experts from academia, industry and government agencies to discuss opportunities and challenges to Enabling the Circular Economy through Sustainable Manufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Forum will provide a venue for emerging and early career researchers as well as graduate students engaged in sustainable manufacturing to interact with prominent researchers and industry leaders in sustainable manufacturing. This will facilitate a greater dialogue in related areas and also facilitate increased awareness of others' research to foster more collaboration between different organizations. The dissemination of forum presentations through different channels and scholarly publications will also help increase understanding of how sustainable manufacturing can enable the Circular Economy. The Forum will include an Emerging Researcher Showcase with presentations from early-career researchers, and also a Student Poster Showcase.</AbstractNarration>

The event was attended by 61 participants and included a large number of presentations from invited speakers and early-career researchers.  Specific objectives of the project were to:  Identify, invite and support the attendance of tenure-track faculty engaged in research is sustainable manufacturing and related areas Identify, invite and support the travel expenses for experts from industry and academia to share cutting-edge practices and challenges to sustainable manufacturing Support the attendance of graduate students to attend the forum and to participate in the poster session   Outcomes of the Award: The main features of the 6th IFSM included the following activities.  Invited presentations by experts in Circular Economy and Sustainable Manufacturing An ?Emerging Researcher Showcase? with presentations from early-career researchers (expenses covered through a National Science Foundation funded grant) A panel discussion on "Enabling a Circular Economy through Sustainable Manufacturing" A ?Student Poster Showcase?   Funding requested through this proposal was used to provide travel support to U.S. based invited speakers, particularly the tenure-track Assistant Professors conducting research in related areas as well as selected graduate students to attend the 6th IFSM. The workshop was also attended by a large number of industry participants.
