<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program provides support for projects to design, implement, and assess strategies that can lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. The one-year project at Dillard University seeks to establish the foundation for building STEM student success. The overall goal is to significantly increase the number of underrepresented minority students who complete STEM majors and enter into the STEM workforce or continue in a graduate program in a STEM field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives and activities are designed for reforming the curriculum and for recruiting and retaining STEM students. These activities include course redesign to align freshman year courses in mathematics and the sciences, a STEM Saturday Institute for high school students and their science teachers, and a summer bridge program for entering freshmen. Upper level STEM majors are involved in the project as mentors, tutors and facilitators. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and what is learned through this project can serve as a model for other small liberal arts institutions.</AbstractNarration>

In addition, courses that require computer-based data acquisition and analysis will have access to the lab.  Saturday STEM Institute:  During the spring of 2018, 26 high school students and three teachers participated in the Saturday STEM Institute during the spring of 2018. The institute was conducted over four consecutive Saturdays and was led by STEM Program Coordinators.   The Institute was tailored towards enhancing high school students? preparation for undergraduate studies and introduced participants to the STEM programs at DU.   Participants conducted experiments in various science, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) areas. The track for teachers and counselors focuses on benchmark measures in science and mathematics along with strategies to recruit students to major in STEM disciplines. 10 DU STEM majors served as assistants.  Stipends were provided for all participants. Outcome:  Four participants enrolled in DU in the fall of 2018; two participated in the Pre-Frist Year Bridge Program; one student successfully completed the MAT 121 Integrated College Algebra course as a participant in the ESP.  Pre-First Year Bridge Program:   Twenty-three incoming freshmen students participated in a ten-day residential bridge program at DU from June 13-23, 2018.  The program introduced students to the academic expectations of college and provided opportunities to frost social and academic relationships with peers, staff, and faculty.  Major components of the program include: (1) Molecular Biology Boot Camp that provide students an opportunity to gain hands-on research experience and exposed them to various molecular techniques; (2) Math Boot Camp that covered important math concepts, test-taking strategies, and tips to overcoming math anxiety; (3) English and Communication Boot Camp that exposed students to various  types of writing assignment and an opportunity to enhance their communication skills; (4) Orientation sessions that introduced students to STEM faculty, administers, and campus support program.  Participants were provided housing, meals, and travel stipends and mentored by five juniors and seniors STEM majors.  Assessment of the program includes student surveys and faculty reflection statements.  Outcome: All twenty-three participants completed the program successfully (100%); twenty-one (91%) enrolled at DU in the fall semester following the program and pursued a STEM major and was supported by a book voucher valued at $1,000.00.  In summary, results from the planning grant will be used as the foundation for the development and submission of a full HBCU-UP Implementation Grant.
