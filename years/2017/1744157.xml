<AbstractNarration>The conference Transformation Groups 2017 will be a meeting of mathematicians specializing in various aspects of transformation group theory. The conference will be held on December 14-19, 2017, at the Independent University of Moscow. The speakers will be leading experts in various aspects of transformation groups who are making major contributions to this and related fields. The conference will be a major event, attracting a large segment of the mathematical community working in various aspects  of transformation group theory. The broad spectrum and great current interest in the topics to be discussed at  the conference will make it especially useful for early-career mathematicians.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transformation group theory plays an important role in various areas of mathematics, from algebraic geometry to  representation theory to analysis. The aim of the conference is to present current progress on the following related topics: algebraic groups and geometric invariant theory including the theory of spherical varieties;  transformation groups in differential geometry, analysis and topology; structure and representation theory of Lie algebras and their generalizations, such as affine and vertex algebras or W-algebras; and discrete subgroups of Lie groups and discrete transformation groups. More details about the conference are available at https://www.mccme.ru/tg2017/.</AbstractNarration>

The conference was held in Moscow, Russia, December 14-18, 2017 alternating between the Independent University of Moscow, Higher School of Economics and Skolkovo Institute of Technology. Their talks covered important recent developments  and techniques in various subjects related to transformation groups. The conference was a major event, it had more than one hundred participants.  The intellectual merit of the conference was talks by invited speakers on a broad range of topics that included  Invariant theory and other connections to  Algebraic geometry, the structure theory of semisimple algebraic groups and their Lie algebras, connections to Representation theory and to the theory of discrete subgroups of Lie groups and of reflection groups. The conference allowed to better understand connections between these important subjects.  The broader impact of the conference was a participation of many young mathematicians and mathematicians from underrepresented groups some of whom were invited speakers. The conference was attended by participants from more than 10 different countries. Of eight participants supported by the grant, six were graduate students and postdocs and three were female. The conference was an important contribution to their professional development. Videos of most talks as well as slides of all slide talks are available through the conference webpage.
