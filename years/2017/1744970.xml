<AbstractNarration>Glacial retreat in West Antarctica is correlated with ocean warming; however, less is known about the ocean's effect on East Antarctica's glaciers including Totten Glacier located on the Sabrina Coast. The retreat of Totten Glacier has global significance as the glacier drains a sector of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet that contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by as much as 3.5 meters. This study looks to determine the influence of ocean temperatures on East Antarctic glaciers, including Totten Glacier, over the last ~18,000 years by studying seafloor sediment around Antarctica. These sediments, or muds, include the remains of microscopic marine organisms as well as tiny particles originating from eroded Antarctic bedrock. These muds provide a record of past environmental changes including ocean temperatures and the advance and retreat of glaciers. Scientists use a variety of physical and chemical analyses to determine how long ago this mud was deposited, the temperature of the ocean at that location through time, and the relative location of glacial ice. In this project, researchers will refine and test new methods for measuring ocean temperature from the sediments to better understand the influence of ocean temperatures on East Antarctic glacier response. Results will be integrated into ice sheet and climate models to improve the accuracy of ice sheet modeling efforts and subsequent sea level predictions. Results from this project will be disseminated at scientific conferences, in the scientific literature, and more broadly to the general public via the St. Petersburg Science Festival and at the Oceanography Camp for Girls. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The influence of ocean temperatures on East Antarctic glaciers is largely unknown. This research focuses on ice-proximal Antarctic margin paleoceanographic proxy calibration and validation, which will improve understanding of past ocean-ice sheet interactions on a variety of timescales. In this project, researchers from the University of South Florida will (1) further develop and refine two ocean temperature proxies, foraminifer Mg/Ca and TEX86, for use in ice-proximal Antarctic continental margin sediments and (2) investigate deglacial to present (~18-0 ka) ocean-ice interactions at the outlet of the climatically sensitive Aurora Subglacial Basin. The proposed research utilizes sediment trap, sediment core, and physical oceanographic data previously collected from the Sabrina Coast continental shelf during NSF-funded cruise NBP14-02. Studies of existing sediment cores will integrate multiple paleotemperature, meltwater/salinity, nutrient, bottom water oxygen, and sea ice proxies with geophysical and lithologic data to understand past regional ocean-ice interactions. While the recent international Antarctic research focus has been on understanding the drivers of West Antarctic Ice Sheet retreat, models suggest it would be imprudent to ignore the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, which is proving more sensitive to climate perturbations than previously realized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
