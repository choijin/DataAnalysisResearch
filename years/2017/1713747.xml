<AbstractNarration>After the outstanding success of the 2014, 2015 and 2016 KAUST-NSF Research Conference on Electronic Materials, Devices and Systems for A Sustainable Future, the KAUST-NSF Research Conference on Interactive Electronics 2017 will be held from 30th January to 1st February 2017 at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia. This award support the travel expenses for seven excellent junior faculty members, researchers, postdocs and graduating students from USA to attend this conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the conference is to continue the positive momentum garnered from the 2014 to 2016 assembly of the global scientific community at a common stage to steer discussion towards scientific and engineering research progress in the area of Interactive Electronics. The proposed symposium will again gather world leading researchers, mid-career and rising stars, and the KAUST research community to exchange ideas and to foster a collaborative platform to pursue fundamental and applied research in the area of interactive electronic devices, materials and systems. Disciplines like (i) Chemical and Biological Science and Engineering; (ii) Environmental Science and Engineering; (iii) Marine Science; (iv) Electrical and Computer Engineering; and (v) Material Science and Engineering will be covered. Sensors, smart devices, energy harvesting, storage, and cyber-physical systems will be some of the important topics that are planned to be discussed in the conference. Some of the tangible outcomes are: a) Establishing a culture of sustainability-focused high-tech research; b) Attracting bright young minds from all over the world for exchange of ideas; c) Promoting science-engineering education and research through collaboration; d) Promoting the participation and contribution of women in science and engineering; e) Promoting science, technology, engineering and math among the K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>

Bright Minds Session to attract high quality junior faculty and research scientists (one EE faculty candidate identified by KAUST)  ? WISE: Women in Science and Engineering session to inspire women (one of the most engaged sessions with 50+ participants)  ? NISE: Next-gen in Science and Engineering with TKS to inspire K-12 students (DIY winners presented and followed-up by hands-on workshop on DIY electronics &ndash; specially organized for Grade 5 children &ndash; 65 participants)  ? DIY Electronics Innovation Challenge (Global Competition)  ? Poster competition and Tech exhibition     ? Town hall meeting about future of interactive electronics. 60+ participants.  The KAUST-NSF 2017 Research Conference was successful held at KAUST while achieving the overall goals of  1. Promotion of USA and KAUST research through faculty talks, posters by students and post docs, event in TKS, partnership with NSF.  2. Intimated engagement, exchange of ideas, broader networking opportunity through discussions, companionships, lunch for all.  3. In the technical sessions, 7 women scientists from KAUST and overseas presented their works. In the WISE session, 11 women speakers from US, Europe and Mideast shared their experiences. Every visitor was pleasantly surprised about the healthy gender ratio in KAUST.  4. 10 researchers from USA, spanning in a career stage from junior, mid-career and senior, were invited to the event.  This grant supported 2 while the rest of the invitees were supported by KAUST.          Last Modified: 07/31/2018       Submitted by: Huili (Grace) G Xing]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
