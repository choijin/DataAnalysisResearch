<AbstractNarration>General Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research demonstrates that women of color face barriers such as lack of mentorship, financial resources, and significant familial responsibilities in their pursuit of higher education and subsequent careers in political science. Political science is one of the most male and Anglo dominated fields of study in the social sciences. Descriptive representation within the academic profession is important to perceptions of legitimacy, service to students, and development of knowledge. The goal of the conference is to provide attendees the necessary skills and networks to enter the academy, successfully achieve tenure and sustain their careers thereafter. This workshop brings together scholars from different universities, at different stages in their careers, to deepen intellectual engagement and to build coalitions that support excellence in diversifying the political science profession. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Descriptive representation within the academic profession is important to perceptions of legitimacy, service to students, and development of knowledge. The goal of the conference is to provide attendees the necessary skills and networks to enter the academy, successfully achieve tenure and sustain their careers thereafter. This workshop brings together scholars from different universities, at different stages in their careers, to deepen intellectual engagement and to build coalitions that support excellence in diversifying the political science profession. The workshop includes an opening plenary session that focuses on the development of intersectionality work in the discipline and a discussion of the discipline and the role of women of color therein. It also includes a series of breakout sessions that focus on various aspects of academic development. The workshop will facilitate deep mentoring by pairing graduate students, junior, and mid-career participants by interest, with structured one-on-one mentoring time embedded into the schedule.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>On August 30, 2017, Drs. Melissa R. Michelson and Jessica L. Lavariega Monforti brought together a diverse group of women of color in political science, including undergraduate students, graduate students, tenured and untenured faculty, and administrators, for a day-long workshop hosted in San Francisco, CA. The workshop included breakout sessions about how to become a more effective researcher and negotiator, how to write grants, and how to reach out to community organizations in order to launch pracademic projects. Plenary sessions examined the institutional barriers faced by women of color in the profession and what to do about them, and strategies for maintaining work-life balance given the extensive service demands often placed on women of color by their departments and institutions. Networking sessions facilitated connections and mentoring between graduate students, junior, and mid-career participants.</p> <p>Prior to the start of the workshop, participants completed an anonymous survey about their self-perceptions as a woman of color in political science. Another survey was collected at the close of the workshop, to measure the effect of the day's events. In addition, participants were invited to participate in focus groups during the subsequent few days, to collect additional data about the experiences of women of color in the discipline. Those data will be combined with similar data from previous workshops (held in 2013 and 2015) to document the institutional climate perceived by women of color in political science and whether there are measurable shifts in that climate over time.&nbsp;</p> <p>Women of color are severely underrepresented in political science and face ongoing challenges. The 2017 workshop provided skills to participants to help them mitigate those challenges. This includes the fostering and encouragement of a growing mentoring network of women of color in the political science discipline, including both students and faculty. These strengthened connections among the participants will enhance research and teaching on women of color in the discipline, and will enhance the well-being and professional careers of participants. More broadly, the workshop provided women of color with tools and strategies to be successful in their careers; this diversity strengthens political science overall.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/01/2018<br>      Modified by: Melissa&nbsp;R&nbsp;Michelson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1727645/1727645_10507234_1533143236209_MelissaandJessica_WCPS17--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1727645/1727645_10507234_1533143236209_MelissaandJessica_WCPS17--rgov-800width.jpg" title="WCPS17 San Francisco"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1727645/1727645_10507234_1533143236209_MelissaandJessica_WCPS17--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="WCPS17 San Francisco"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Drs.
