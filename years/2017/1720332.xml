<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Mark P. Hertzberg at Tufts University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decades of research in both particle physics and cosmology have led us to a set of so-called "Standard Models" which provide tremendously successful descriptions of the universe over a vast range of energy and length scales.  However, future revolutions in physics will arise from tackling the various shortcomings of these models.  In particular, some of the greatest mysteries that remain concern the nature of dark matter, the details of early-universe cosmology, and a deep understanding of the structure of gravitation.   Professor Hertzberg's research will tackle these subjects through the formulation of theoretical models and the exploration of connections to experiment and data.  As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting fundamental scientific research into the nature of the universe.  Furthermore, this project is envisioned to have significant broader impacts as it will involve postdocs and engage the public in an important way through public lectures and popular articles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, Professor Hertzberg will investigate axion dark matter in galaxies, develop novel inflationary models that probe new physics, and investigate theories of spin-two particles.  This involves the development of theoretical models that demand internal consistency and greement with data, all within the framework of effective field theory.  The primary work on the dark-matter front is to determine the clumpiness, distribution, and possible evidence for axion dark matter. The primary work on the early-universe front is to determine if reasonable inflationary models exist that improve agreement with CMB data on large scales beyond the standard scale-invariant models.   Finally, the primary objective on the gravity front is to determine if general relativity is the uniquely consistent effective theory of spin-two particles.</AbstractNarration>
