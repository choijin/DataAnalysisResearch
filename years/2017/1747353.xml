<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve health and save lives while addressing a market opportunity of over a billion dollars per year. Worldwide particulate matter air pollution is responsible for nearly as many deaths as cancer, and more than malaria and AIDS combined. The goal of the project is an inexpensive, consumer market air pollution sensor that offers performance comparable to laboratory instruments that cost hundreds to thousands of dollars. The proposed technology has important societal benefit as it will help mitigate the negative health effects of air pollution in the environment, home, and workplace. The proposed project contributes to scientific knowledge and understanding by investigating novel particulate matter analysis techniques and enabling a highly-sensitive, portable, and low-cost monitor for studies of air pollution. With the form-factor of a AA-battery, it is the only particulate matter air pollution sensor that can fit in devices like the Amazon Echo or Google Nest. Markets for the sensor include smart homes, smart cities, green buildings, automobile cabin monitoring, air purifiers, industrial hygiene, and others.Â &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will investigate a novel sensor for monitoring particulate matter air pollution. Existing air pollution monitors are expensive, large, and power hungry. The monitors on the consumer market use optical techniques that provide only a proxy estimate of pollution levels and are unable to detect ultrafine particulates which have diameters smaller than 100 nanometers. These ultrafine particulates pose serious health risks. The sensor of this work employs thermophoretic deposition of airborne particulates from a sample stream onto an acoustic wave resonator, and determines the mass deposited by measuring the frequency shift of a sustaining electronic oscillator circuit. The monitor of this work detects particulates from a few microns in diameter to ultrafine, and provides a true mass concentration measurement of the pollution, which is acknowledged as the industry gold-standard. Key activities of the proposal include the development of innovative techniques to collect and analyze particulates and to improve the sensor stability and lifetime. Anticipated technical results include enhanced monitor longevity, improved level of detection, improved manufacturability, and a significant reduction in power consumption. Coupling the sensor to a cell-phone or other wireless device would enable dense temporal and spatial wireless air quality measurements.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the last couple of years, more and more research has shown that exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollutants is associated with cardiovascular disease, asthma, lung cancer and other illnesses. In the United States alone the CDC estimates that asthma costs $20 billion annually in medical care, lost work days and early deaths.  In fact in 2019, air pollution is considered by the WHO as the greatest environmental risk to health bar none. Microscopic pollutants in the air can penetrate respiratory and circulatory systems, damaging the lungs, heart and brain, killing 7 million people prematurely every year from diseases such as cancer, stroke, heart and lung disease.  Around 90% of these deaths are in low- and middle- income countries with high volumes of emissions from industry, transport and agriculture.  There is an important need for inexpensive devices that monitor PM in smart cities, IoT devices, and air purifiers, and to monitor pollutants such as diesel exhaust, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), and nanoparticles.  AMI's PM mass monitor leverages state-of-the-art micromachined-electromechanical-system technologies to achieve unprecedented reductions in power consumption, cost, sample flow rate, and form factor.  The Phase I effort improved the sensor level of detection and investigated low-cost foundry-based manufacturing techniques looking towards high-volume production for consumer markets.  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project contributed to scientific knowledge and understanding by investigating novel aerosol collection techniques and enabling a portable and low-cost PM monitor.  The proposed technology has important societal impact by enabling those seeking to improve air quality and reduce the health impacts of airborne PM in the environment, home, and workplace.  The proposal has clear commercial need and has significant potential to create economic growth.  The 2019 worldwide addressable market for the technology is over $1 billion.  Several leading companies have written formal letters of interest in the technology.       Last Modified: 02/08/2019       Submitted by: David Woolsey]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
