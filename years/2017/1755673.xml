<AbstractNarration>The stress caused by resource scarcity is known to impact people's health. However, not all people and communities respond the same. In the research supported by this award, the researcher investigates the processes that produce these variable outcomes. Research in the United States and elsewhere has shown that multiple factors, at the community as well as the individual level, work together to produce health outcomes. Therefore, it is not surprising that policies that focus only on individual economic challenges may miss the positive and negative effects of community-level buffers already in place. This research project, which also trains a graduate student in the collection of empirical scientific data, seeks to answer the questions: How do communities respond to economic stress? How do communities buffer against it, and do these mechanisms unintentionally facilitate unhealthy behavior? The answers to these questions are of critical importance to U.S policy makers committed to improving local health outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be undertaken by Case Western Reserve University anthropology doctoral student, Megan M. Schmidt-Sane, under the supervision of Dr. Janet W. McGrath. The research will be conducted in two communities in Kampala, Uganda. Uganda was chosen for the research because recent changes in local government labor policies have put many people out of work. Therefore, because the researchers have access to baseline health data, the situation is a natural experiment in how people respond to sudden economic stress, how traditional buffering mechanisms are put into play, and whether these mechanisms prevent or increase poor health outcomes. The researcher will collect data over one year using a mixture of qualitative and quantitative anthropological methods, including: community censuses, surveys, in-depth interviews, and participant observation. These data will allow her to assess specific pathways between the larger socio-economic context, individuals, and risk, resilience, and vulnerability. Findings will facilitate integrating these concepts  as well as scientific understanding of the mechanisms by which economic stress affects health. This can then become the basis for improved policy in the United States. Results will be disseminated widely in academic and public health settings, providing insight into the factors that are simultaneously resilient and vulnerable, and the potential pathways to resilience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project fieldwork was conducted in Kampala, Uganda from June 2018 to June 2019. During this time, a community census, survey, in-depth interviews, and participant observation were conducted to investigate the political economy of health among low-income men in urban Uganda.   During the first month of the fieldwork, a community census was conducted to document and assess health and social services in the study community. Interviews were conducted with local leaders and health service providers. This work was done to better understand the dynamics of vulnerability and resilience in low-income Uganda.    A survey was created covering topics such as demographics, economic status, history of arrest and incarceration, social support, access to health services, and health knowledge. The survey was administered to 292 men. The men were selected from the community. First, community locations where men congregate were identified and numbered from 1 to 33. These 33 locations were randomized, and men were recruited from each location to complete the survey.   A subset of 54 of the men who completed the survey were interviewed on topics including childhood experiences, urban migration, parental guidance and support, substance use, current relationships, experiences of police arrest, and other topics. Participant observation was conducted in public spaces throughout the fieldwork to learn more about daily life in the community.  This research demonstrates the importance of social and economic factors on men’s health in low-income urban Uganda. Men are exposed to numerous risks in their environment, from high population density to economic inequality, poverty, and aggressive policing. Additional vulnerabilities include economic instability, frequent arrests, high cost of living, exposure to violence, and being part of the younger generation (under 35 years).  The primary research findings are that:  Although health services are readily available in the community at no cost free, many men do not access these services due to the numerous other stressors in their lives that impede them from seeking services. Men employ a variety of strategies to address these stressors (inequality, poverty). These include various resilience-building strategies that may have paradoxically adverse consequences on health as, for example, when men work in the informal economy due to lack of opportunities in the formal sector. This has the unintended consequence of putting them at risk of arrest due to regulation of the informal economy.  Social groups that are necessary for men to build resilience often have the unintended consequence of negatively affecting health. These strategies for building resilience work to build status in the low-income community, but they also must be leveraged to encourage healthy behavior, which can be done through health programs.
