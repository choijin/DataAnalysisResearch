<AbstractNarration>Unique properties of the Terahertz (THz) band such as the non-ionizing energy levels of THz waves, coupled with micrometer-scale wavelengths offer key advantages in sensing, spectroscopy, and imaging applications. For example, absorption signatures of molecular resonance are rich in the THz band and enable key remote sensing and spectroscopy techniques for scientific research in astronomy, cosmology, physics and chemistry. Nevertheless, contemporary THz spectroscopy and imaging tools rely on single-polarization sensors, thus, vital polarimetric information in the sensed THz signals is often lost. In this project, a fully-polarimetric THz sensor will be developed, which will enable, for the first time, an entirely new modality for THz spectroscopy and imaging by harnessing the polarization properties of THz waves. Polarimetric THz imaging and the associated sensor hardware could change the paradigm for THz imaging by harnessing polarimetric data. It is important to note that the impact of "polarimetry" in the RF, microwave as well as optical bands cannot be understated, with key applications impacting many aspects of society. For example, polarimetric radars keep us safe from intruders and optical ellipsometers are routinely used in many areas of solid state materials engineering, including the multi-billion-dollar semiconductor industry. The fully-polarimetric THz sensor and the associated THz-spectroscopic polarimetry tools proposed here will usher in new sensing and imaging applications in the much-needed areas of biomedical sensing, chemical spectroscopy and pharmaceutical evaluation, to name a few. In addition, the proposed work will result in a laboratory-scale spectroscopy tool that can be readily incorporated into the academic curriculum to serve as a hands-on experimentation and training testbed to inspire students to pursue their education in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the proposed effort will realize, for the first time, novel photoconductive antenna arrays with radiation pattern and polarization purity over the THz frequency band spanning from 100 GHz to 5 THz, integrated with pulsed and/or continuous-wave laser sources to generate wideband, or tunable, fully-polarimetric THz-band sources and detectors with 3-times improved image resolution and improved spectral sensitivity. With the availability of these novel sensors, first-ever polarimetric sensing data in the form of THz reflectometric images will be demonstrated. As a most relevant and high-societal-impact application, cancer margin detection and identification using THz polarimetry will be pursued where the material properties of the healthy and malignant tissues are very close to each other due to similar bound water content. With the full-polarimetric nature of the proposed sensor, THz images obtained by the proposed sensor exhibits significantly improved contrast and thus conventional THz imaging will be significantly enhanced by the additional degrees-of-freedom afforded by the new sensor. Moreover, the compact sensor topology proposed here will be commensurate with endoscopic applications and could likely result in a clinical trial upon the completion of the proposed effort.</AbstractNarration>
