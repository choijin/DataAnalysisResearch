<AbstractNarration>As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative research, approaches, and resources for use in a variety of settings. The project will bring together science museum visitor experience developers, visitor studies staff, indoor location technology developers, cyber-learning researchers, and STEM informal learning specialists for a two day conference, COMPASS (Conference on Mobile Position Awareness Systems and Solutions), to address the achievements and potential of indoor location aware mobile (ILAM) technology in science museums. The pre-conference work, the conference itself, and a subsequent e-publication will provide multiple, informed perspectives and knowledge around ILAM for science museums to develop apps for visitors' own smartphones to enhance and personalize the visitor experience and to experiment with new kinds of inquiry-based learning. The goals of the conference are to form an integrated vision by consolidating expertise from disparate disciplines connected to ILAM tech development, to transform visitor mobile tools to provide more innovative forms of interaction and personalization, and to open new avenues for visitor research with automated data collection and analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The COMPASS conference will bring together 80 participants for two days in September 2018 at the Exploratorium in San Francisco, CA. The first dissemination will take place in a presentation at the ASTC conference the following month in October 2018. A webinar sharing insights from COMPASS and inviting others to engage will be held in March 2019 hosted by ASTC and accessible by ASTC members and non-members alike. A companion COMPASS e-publication  will be released for free download, also in March 2019, with summaries of conference proceedings, key issues identified, case histories of ILAM in museums, white papers and other resources. Conference outcomes include establishing a community of practice or special interest group and establishing common goals for future collaborative work. By gathering a diverse range of perspectives and expertise to share research and evidence based findings, COMPASS include collective problem solving and an informed cross disciplinary approach to planning and implementing ILAM technology in the museum environment. The conference will explicitly address the benefits and quality of open source code and protocols and how techniques could be shared among institutions.  As professional experience with deploying ILAM apps grows, this tool could be used to increase accessibility for diverse visitor populations, put in use at smaller and medium sized science centers, and applied to a variety of research studies, increasing the impact for funders and benefiting the science center community at large.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Conference On Mobile Position Awareness Systems and Solutions (COMPASS) was held at the Exploratorium September 6-7, 2018.   The goals of the convening and dissemination activities were to:  1) Form an integrated vision by consolidating expertise from disparate disciplines connected to Indoor Location Aware Mobile (ILAM) tech development.  2) Transform visitor mobile tools going beyond basic digital content to more innovative forms of interaction and personalization.  3) Open new avenues for visitor research with streamlined data collection and analysis.  To serve these goals, the COMPASS team successfully programmed, publicized, and presented a focused two day conference at the Exploratorium in San Francisco, CA, and carried out dissemination in the months after the conference.  The eighty conference attendees and speakers were from a wide range of institutions and industries: museums, university labs, cultural institutions, visitor research, independent consultants, and app agencies.  Most attendees came from the United States.  Others were from Canada, Sweden, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia. Attendees freely shared their questions, experiences and practices; collaborated on identifying goals; and critically examined the role, as well as the practical and creative potentials of indoor location aware mobile apps in informal learning institutions.  The conference speakers and breakout session discussions addressed:  case histories of six different location-aware app projects at six museums the potential of location-aware apps to support visitor research the current status of laboratory engineering research on mobile location-aware devices and systems including why there currently is no single standard  the potential for collaboration or open source work in museums how and why to protect user privacy and obtain meaningful consent for digital apps from visitors what resources are required, what processes are effective, and how to budget mobile technology projects in museums what's next for location-aware technology in informal learning environments understanding this technology within the larger contexts of informal learning, visitor studies, and ed tech research    Attendees were surveyed post-conference and the evaluation responses made evident that the conference met the three primary goals of the project. (1) More than half of the attendees met and engaged with individuals outside of their field or community. (2) All attendees reported they had increased their understanding of how other museums have experimented with the technology.  (3) A presentation on timing and tracking technology for visitor research received high marks for usefulness and relevance.  In addition to the immediate impact on attendees, 90% planned to share what they learned with their colleagues on their return, increasing the reach of the conference content. Nearly all attendees reported that they had a better understanding of the technology and its constraints and nearly all reported they had learned more about privacy issues with apps and what they could do to protect visitor privacy.  Attendees noted the importance of the candid tone of the conference. They commended speakers for sharing what did and didn't work, acknowledging projects that went wrong, being honest about what the budget was spent on, and what the rate of app usage was. Attendees also gained valuable insights on how an app should work in harmony with the overall visitor experience. They appreciated hearing about app development at smaller museums and how apps could serve as a flexible accessibility tool allowing independence for low-vision visitors.  From post conference communication there are many indications that valuable interdisciplinary connections were made and alliances formed, generating further dialogue, exploration of collaborations, and collective problem solving in the subsequent months.  COMPASS publications include:  COMPASS Conference Proceedings (e-publication), Conference evaluation, 2018 ASTC conference poster, 2019 CAISE PI Summit poster, and an article for CAISE (in preparation).  These products expanded the dissemination of timely information among practitioners. COMPASS conference insights were also shared via Twitter during the conference, via a webinar after the conference, and in a 2019 ECSITE conference session.  The conference content and collateral are important interdisciplinary resources, strengthening confidence of practitioners for decision making, and informing future strategy for institutions within the broader ISL community and potential institutional collaborations. The conference dissemination products are freely accessible to share current knowledge and best practices with informal learning institutions and their collaborators.
