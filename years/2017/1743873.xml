<AbstractNarration>A century ago Max Weber, a German historian and social scientist, gave a celebrated lecture, entitled ?Science as a Vocation."  The lecture provided an overview of the external conditions of scientific work?employment security and circumstances, pay, competition, promotion opportunities--and examined the personal experience of science and its human and societal meanings.   With Weber's work as a benchmark, this workshop examines stability and change in scientific careers in order to summarize what is known, to identify areas where new knowledge about work life and career are needed, and to use what we know to suggest ways to attract, motivate, and arrange scientific work that ensure its continued success.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Conference participants systematically and comparatively analyze science as a vocation today, to address both its external conditions and internal meanings and rewards, in diverse national contexts. They consider how the institutional dynamics of science systems, changing modes of research support and performance, and evolving science-society relationships change the shape, content, and attractiveness of scientific careers within academe and outside.  Of concern are the direction and dynamics of change, the potential policy and programmatic responses, and the likelihood that emerging forms of scientific work life and career will meet the challenges that lie ahead.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ About a century ago Max Weber, a noted German economist, historian, and sociologist, spoke to students at the University of Munich on the topic of "science as a vocation (or calling)."  His aim was to describe the conditions and rewards awaiting those who would pursue a career in science.  Comparing academic science in the US and Germany, Weber began by discussing the external conditions of science--job security, pay, independence--then turned to the personal meaning and rewards of a life in science. Over the century since Weber spoke science has grown exponentially, distributed widely, and become essential for our health, wellbeing, and security, and so it is important to ask, as Weber had asked, what are the circumstances and prospects confronting a person who is called to a career in science?   We organized a workshop of experts from Europe, Asia, Latin America, and the United States to analyze and compare conditions in those varied national and policy contexts.  The workshop focused on three main issues confronting early career scientists: establishing independence and a progessional identity, balancing work and family (or life) responsibilities, and bearing up under pressure to perform in measurable ways.  Taken all together, the group became concerned that the conditions of employment in science are becoming so challenging that capable scholars are unwilling to heed the call to a career in science.    We plan to publish the workshop papers as a collection in the journal Science, Technology &amp; Human Values.  This Project Outcomes Report for the General Public is displayed verbatim as submitted by the Principal Investigator (PI) for this award. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this Report are those of the PI and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation; NSF has not approved or endorsed its content.
