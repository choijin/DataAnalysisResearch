<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2017 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Henri Roesch is "Geometric Analysis." The host institution for the fellowship is University of California, Irvine, and the sponsoring scientist is Richard M. Schoen</AbstractNarration>

Firstly, within black hole geometries, the researcher verified the validity of a conjectured relationship between the area of a black hole and the total mass of a system under small space and time variations of the Schwarzschild spacetime. The Schwarzschild spacetime is the famous model of a single static, spherically symmetric black hole in vacuum. Secondly, the researcher extended prior techniques utilized in the famous isometric embedding problem within the field of differential geometry and applied them to the study of light. The researcher was able to uncover much of the intrinsic structure within conical geometries of light, as well as identify substructures critical to the measurement of total mass and energy within an isolated physical system.
