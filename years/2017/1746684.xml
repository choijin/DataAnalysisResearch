<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a universal design kit for silicon photonics that will include, for the first time, the ability to design and produce, in a fabless model, a cost-effective, silicon-controlled, tunable laser.Â &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project goals will include the analysis, design, and fabrication of silicon photonic integrated circuits for back-reflection suppression. A key research objective will be to enable the design of a customized, silicon-controlled, tunable laser capable of insertion into a high-speed data communication link based on hybrid III-V/Si integration. A key development objective will be to enable the assembly and manufacture of the silicon photonic integrated circuits using industry-accepted back-end-of-line integration methods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Optical links, which use photons instead of electrons to transport and manipulate information, offer many advantages compared to traditional electronic links found in today?s computers. Optical interconnects created with silicon photonic devices can transmit more information over larger distances, and are more energy efficient than copper-based links.  However, successful commercialization of silicon photonics platform has yet to include an integrated, tunable laser. This fact has limited the platform?s market penetration into because many applications would prefer the compactness, reduced complexity, and lower cost of an integrated source.  Axalume has demonstrated a tunable, chip-scale, integrated laser. The laser consists of two chips: a compound semiconductor optical gain chip, that provides the seed light, and a tunable external-cavity to complete the laser.  The external cavity is made with silicon due to the low-cost functionally that can be designed into it. The integration is performed with fully-processed chips, which allows the development of independently optimized silicon photonic and gain devices at separate foundries. Currently no one offers tunable laser products co-integrated with silicon photonics. Productizing this laser will enable a large range of applications that need a low cost silicon-compatible laser. These include high-speed optical communications links, laser ranging, probes for optical sensors in the Internet of things, and others.  Axalume?s laser enables the user to tune the lasing wavelength, or color, of the laser.  This feature is very important, especially for advanced communication systems, which rely on multiple transmission wavelengths. A fast-growing segment which could inevitably have the largest impact is in sensors, such as laser ranging and detection which can use wavelength tunability translated to angular beam steering to enable autonomous vehicles. There are also a range of spectroscopy and display applications that use tunable lasers. Integration and driving down costs in such laser could have a tremendous positive impact on society beyond communications into bio-sciences, autonomous cars, and eventually the internet of things.  During its Phase I Seed SBIR program, Axalume developed and demonstrated a novel method to suppress interference and back-reflections between the chips which has the potential to significantly lower the manufacturing complexity and cost of the laser and provide a sustainable advantage to the company.
