<AbstractNarration>Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics undergraduate education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. This project at North Carolina Central State University will investigate mathematical modeling with probability distributions and will provide an opportunity for undergraduate students to enhance their statistical knowledge through research experiences. The researcher has established a strong collaboration with faculty at Georgetown University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count data arise in a variety of situations and are often modeled with a Poisson distribution. In many cases, however, the data do not satisfy the Poisson distribution's property of equal mean and variance. This project will examine the two-parameter Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distribution that accounts for over-dispersion where the variance is greater than the mean and under-dispersion where the variance is less than the mean. The CMP distribution captures the Poisson, Bernoulli, and geometric distributions as special cases. The first goal of this project is to conduct a simulation study which compares properties of the CMP distribution to those of mixed Poisson probability distributions, such as the Poisson-lognormal, Poisson-Lindley and Poisson-inverse Gaussian, that have traditionally been used to model over-dispersed data. The second goal is to derive and develop inferential methods for a bivariate CMP distribution. To demonstrate the flexibility of the CMP distribution and its extensions, applications to real-world data will be considered. This research will expand the class of probability distributions that are available to model count data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Count data can be found in practically every field, and appropriate statistical methods are needed to analyze these data. The Poisson probability distribution is often used to model the behavior of count data. In many cases, however, the data do not satisfy the Poisson distribution's assumption of equal mean and variance.  This project examined flexible models that accommodate data over-dispersion (i.e., when the variance is greater than the mean) and under-dispersion (i.e., when the variance is less than the mean).  The project considered the Poisson-inverse Gaussian (P-IG) regression model which is used to model over-dispersed count data.  The P-IG regression model is a mixed Poisson regression model in which the random effects (or mixing) distribution is inverse Gaussian.  Previous research has presented different opinions concerning the effect of small deviations from distributional assumptions of the random effects.  Our research conducted simulation studies to investigate the robustness of maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) when the random effects distribution is misspecified.  Our results showed that the regression parameter estimates are robust, yet the random effects variance estimates can be sensitive to mixing distribution misspecification.   In addition, the project examined the two-parameter Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distribution which accommodates over- and under-dispersion. Our research explored the theoretical properties of extensions of the CMP distribution.  First, the sum-of-CMP (sCMP) random variable, its distributional properties, and related inferences were developed.  To demonstrate its flexibility, an application of  the sCMP distribution to fetal lamb movements was presented. On-going work considers a bivariate CMP distribution, which produces marginal probability distributions that have a flexible form and includes several special case distributions for certain parameters. Both the sCMP and bivariate CMP distributions provide flexible alternatives for modeling the sum of counts and bivariate count data containing data dispersion.  This research has explored and expanded the class of probability distributions that are available to model count data. The project has provided research and professional development experiences for two graduate students and four undergraduate students pursuing degrees in mathematics at a minority-serving institution.  As a result, this project has broadened the pool of talented individuals who are prepared to enter the workforce or pursue advanced degrees in mathematics, statistics, and data science.
