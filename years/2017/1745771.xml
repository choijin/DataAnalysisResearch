<AbstractNarration>The proposed workshop will bring together awardees of the NSF Science of Learning Program. It seeks to capitalize on NSF investments in the Science of Learning to build community among diverse interdisciplinary researchers studying learning, and to build capacity so that investigators can readily reconfigure and mobilize collaborations to capture new opportunities offered by NSF priority areas. As examples, how technology impacts the way we learn and work, as well as how we might harness Big Data to gain greater insight into real-world learning are areas of relevance to the NSF's 10 Big Ideas (https://www.nsf.gov/about/congress/reports/nsf_big_ideas.pdf). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This gathering will include researchers from several disciplines under one large umbrella, including neuroscience, cognitive, behavioral and social sciences, computer and information sciences, engineering and education. The proposed effort is needed as there is currently no professional society meeting to support this interdisciplinary Science of Learning community of investigators and their trainees. The gathering seeks to foster information exchange and resource sharing, and to build trust among community members for successful interdisciplinary research. The workshop format will include small group discussions on topics that include new insights and methodologies that offer opportunities to make transformative advances in fundamental knowledge about learning over the lifespan, and intersections in interdisciplinary research that offer opportunities for convergence research in support of NSF's Big Ideas. In this way, the workshop will leverage the group's collective interdisciplinary intelligence for "Big Idea" problem-solving and the unique opportunity to work on problems that are larger than any taken on by individual laboratories. A survey of the research and other needs of the Science of Learning community will be conducted. The diverse disciplinary representation of the participants and the requirement to communicate and discuss science across a broad audience will have broader impacts in building an active and vibrant community capable of addressing complex societal problems through collaborative efforts. In addition, and as part of the workshop, plans will be developed to promote better communication of research findings to educational practitioners, policy makers, and the public. This will help to bridge the gap in understanding between basic research findings and their relevance to social challenges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The goals of the project were to foster information exchange and resource sharing among the diverse communities that work on the science of learning, as well as supporting the development of a community organized around understanding human learning. We hosted a conference ?Understanding the role of the Science of Learning in Education Policy.? Meeting attendees were asked to offer their guidance on priorities and next steps.  The overarching priority reported by meeting attendees was developing a community structure to support research and continued dialogue among the various communities. Many endorsed a global network of networks to link stakeholders (researchers, educators, national funding agencies, entrepreneurs, philanthropists, and policymakers).  Such a network could draw on the expertise of researchers in the field of the Science of Learning and associated field such as DBER (Discipline-Based Education Research), and educators? expertise in educational priorities, practical research design, and accumulated knowledge in communities such as SoTL (Scholarship of Teaching and Learning).
