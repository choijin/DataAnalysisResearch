<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to render the tedious, time-consuming, and expensive manual process of contract review and negotiation as archaic.  The outcome from the proposed research will accurately review and negotiate in-bound contracts based on a user's history of reviewing and negotiating just a handful of similar contracts and will result in (a) a 50-90% reduction in companies' contract review and negotiation time and (b) standardized risk across all contracts within an organization.  Furthermore, the proposed research will provide small and medium-sized businesses with the ability to afford and obtain the same quality of legal review of in-bound contracts as the largest and most sophisticated companies in the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will develop the first system to automate edits in contracts through semantic sentence alignment with deep learning techniques.  The proposed research will expand upon state-of-the-art methodologies for unsupervised learning of distributed representation of various length text segments and then launch the first and only machine learning platform that automates contract review and negotiation with semantic editing capabilities.</AbstractNarration>

The project?s findings resulted in several key improvements to BlackBoiler?s automated contract editing tool.  The first research result was an improved tokenization system that allowed for the analysis of relevant text blocks within a contract.

Improvements to existing methodologies were necessary as most sentence tokenization methods are not trained on contract text.

Using these models, the research improved upon existing methods for determining the correct treatment of text within a contract. More specifically, the research resulted in an improved systems for determining if text black was "acceptable," needed to be "revised," or was properly "rejected." The research also resulted in improvements to monolingual alignment of sentences to facilitate the transfer of edits between sentences with similar semantic meaning. Finally, the research resulted in further developments of a systems that allows for multiple layers of annotation information over a text string.
