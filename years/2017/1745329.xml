<AbstractNarration>The 2017 Midwest Geometry Conference will take place at Kansas State University in Manhattan, KS. on November 17 - 19, 2017. It will bring together geometers and geometrical analysts from the Midwest and beyond to share ideas and recent results. Geometric analysis is an area of mathematics that study geometric quantities via  changes in the quantities. For example, the shape of a water droplet may be  determined  by thinking about the way deforming the side of the drop would change the forces on the side of the drop. Workshops  are an especially effective way to encourage and produce  research in this  field. Research is often performed by collaborators and a workshop gives collaborators  time to work, and allows new collaborations to form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speakers and participants at the workshop work on  gluing results for  minimal surfaces, the Einstein constraint equations and curvature flows. Capillary surfaces may be represented as well. Isometric group actions and spaces with curvature bounded from below  will also be represented.  It has been a while since gauge theory was represented at the  conference, but with new  faculty working in geometric topology moving into the region, it is reasonable to expect  more gauge theory and Floer theory at future workshops. The website for the workshop is: https://www.math.ksu.edu/events/conference/2017_Midwest_Geometry.html</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The result of this project was the 2017 Midwest Geometry Conference held at Kansas State University. Roughly 60 mathematicians attended this conference. Some researchers came from as far away as China. The conference was a showcase of recent results in geometry topology and geometric analysis. Highlights from the conference included the pair of talks of Yusin Dong on subelliptic harmonic maps. Dan Knopf gave a well-received talk about Non-Kahler Ricci flow singularities and Xuan Hien Nguyen give a lovely talk on mean curvature flow.  Several conference participants made significant progress on on-going research projects. This will result in a number of research publications.     Many of the participants were graduate students or young researchers, and so attending the conference gave them a chance to form collaborations and learn about different branches of geometry that they might later research.  On the other hand, for the more senior attendees, in addition to potentially attracting students many of them had collaborators who came to the conference, and so they were able to advance those collaborations and therefore their research.     Plans for future meetings were also made at the conference. In addition to future workshops in the Midwest conference series, Shihshu Walter Wei submitted a proposal for a Special Session on Harmonic Maps and Related Topics in The joint International Meeting of the Chinese Mathematical Society and the American Mathematical Society, Shanghai, June 11-14, 2018. It was approved. Yuxing Dong and Shihshu Walter Wei have also organized the meeting that was taking place at Fudan University, Shanghai, China. The special session had a wide appeal, attracting participants from undergraduate, graduate students to world-class mathematicians, and there were 18 speakers from all over the world.        To the extent that mathematics is used in all of the sciences and engineering, and since geometry is a part of mathematics, the work done is likely to eventually be used by engineers and inventors creating products that make all of our lives easier and better.
