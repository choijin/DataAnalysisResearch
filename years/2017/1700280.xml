<AbstractNarration>In combinatorics, one often considers graphs and hypergraphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise and group-wise relations among objects.  Applications of these objects then appear in many branches of mathematics, computer science, and the natural sciences.  In some settings, it can be very useful when these objects possess quasirandom properties.  As such, quasirandom graph and hypergraph theory constitutes a well-studied area of modern combinatorics. Important and applicable results here include Regularity Lemmas, which guarantee that all large graphs and hypergraphs admit decompositions into relatively few parts, where most of these parts are quasirandom.  Moreover, it is also known that these decompositions can be efficiently constructed.  Constructive regularity lemmas form the primary area of the research supported by this award.  the PI studies applications of algorithmic (hypergraph) regularity lemmas to constructive combinatorial problems arising in theoretical computer science.  Moreover, the research proposes that several distinct theories of quasirandom hypergraphs are essentially interchangeable, which would say, in particular, that all of them are constructive.  These projects, and others, will contribute to an existing and long-studied regularity-based infrastructure within graph theory, combinatorics, and theoretical computer science.  These projects also serve as a basis for the mentoring activities of the current researcher at a large metropolitan university, and the funds help to support public students working in this area.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Szemeredi Regularity Lemma (1975) guarantees that all large graphs G can be partitioned into a number of classes, where most of these classes are epsilon-regular, and where the number of classes depends only on the choice of epsilon.  For over four decades, this result has been highly impactful and influential in Combinatorics, and its varied use became known as the Regularity Method.  Szemeredi's Regularity Lemma was extended in important ways.  One extension due to Alon et al. gives a polynomial-time algorithm for constructing the partition it guarantees.  Other work by several authors extended it to a hypergraph setting, where the partitions which arise are necessarily technical, and where different authors considered different points of view.  Rodl et al. considered a concept of r-discrepancy, while Gowers considered a concept of deviation.  Recent work of the PI, Rodl and Schacht showed that the deviation-based Regularity Lemma can be made constructive. The project seeks to show that the underlying concepts of discrepancy and deviation are essentially equivalent, and therefore both regularity lemmas can be made algorithmic.  (This is known to be true for 3-uniform hypergraphs, where discrepancy and deviation are also equivalent to a third concept known as minimality.)  The PI also considers a handful of applications of the work above to several constructive combinatorial problems, including coloring, packing, and testing problems for hypergraphs, among others.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The remarkable Szemer&eacute;di  Regularity Lemma guarantees that for every &epsilon; &rsaquo; 0, every graph G = (V, E)  admits a partition of V into parts V1,&hellip;,Vt, where all but &epsilon;t2 pairs (Vi, Vj) are &epsilon;-regular (see  below), 1 &le; i &lt; j &le; t, and where the integer t is bounded from above  in terms of &epsilon; only, and not on the size |V| of the graph G. Here, (Vi, Vj) is &epsilon;-regular when all subsets Vi&prime; of Vi of size |Vi&prime;| &gt; &epsilon;|Vi| and all subsets Vj&prime; of Vj of size |Vj&prime;| &rsaquo; &epsilon;|Vj| satisfy |d(Vi,Vj) - d(Vi&prime;, Vj&prime;)| &lsaquo; &epsilon;, where d(Vi&prime;, Vj&prime;) = e(Vi&prime;, Vj&prime;) / (|Vi&prime;| |Vj&prime;|) is the density of (Vi&prime;, Vj&prime;), and e(Vi&prime;, Vj&prime;) is the number of edges of G with an endpoint in each of Vi&prime; and Vj&prime;.  The main point here is that when (Vi, Vj)  is &epsilon;-regular, it behaves very similarly, in certain regards, to a random bipartite graph with bipartition Vi U Vj of the same edge density.  In fact, this regular partition (V1,&hellip;, Vt) guarantees that some strong conclusions for G depend only on &epsilon; and the distribution of the densities d(Vi,Vj) over 1 &le; i &lt; j &le; t.  Broad and numerous applications of the Szemer&eacute;di Regularity Lemma resulted over the decades since its discovery, including to areas of extremal graph theory, combinatorial number theory, discrete geometry, and theoretical computer science.   The regular partition (V1,&hellip;, Vt)  above has remarkable properties, but how does one construct such a  partition?  The proof of the Regularity Lemma provided little insight,  and only around 20 years later was the problem resolved by Alon et al.  Their algorithm allows some of the existential applications of the Regularity Lemma (indicated above) to be converted to constructive solutions for the underlying graph problems.   Extensions  of the Szemer&eacute;di Regularity Lemma to hypergraphs were completed by R&ouml;dl  et al (2006) and by Gowers (2008), although not in identical ways.   These works are highly technical to discuss, and we can't go into  details here, save that these works imply some dramatic results in a  wide array of combinatorial problems.  Once again, the question of how one  constructs the regular partitions these lemmas provide is not answered  by the original proofs themselves.  The central achievement of this  project (joint among Nagle, R&ouml;dl, and Schacht) was the completion and publication of a polynomial time algorithm constructing such partitions.    Some  applications of this work were also considered in this project.  For  3-uniform hypergraphs (3-graphs, for short), let F be a fixed 3-graph  and let H be an n-vertex host 3-graph.  We would like to find the  largest collection of edge-disjoint copies of F inside of H.  In the  case of graphs, this problem is known to be NP-hard.  We proved that a  collection of asymptotically optimal size can be constructed in  time polynomial in n.  Our result extends work of quite a few authors,  most importantly of Haxell and R&ouml;dl (2003), who proved the analogous result for graphs.   Other  variations along these lines were also considered in this project.  In the hypergraph regularity algorithms above, what is the  precise running time (in terms of n, the number of vertices  of the k-graph to be regularized)?  Our work with R&ouml;dl and Schacht gives  O(n3k), which is not optimal.  An earlier regularity lemma  of Czyrgrinow and R&ouml;dl (2000), providing significantly weaker  partitions, runs in time O(n2k-1log5n),  also not optimal.  My PhD student J. Theado and I considered these  running times for k=3.  We proved an algorithm for the  Czygrinow and R&ouml;dl regularity lemma which runs in time O(n3),  and which provides stronger partitions than those promised there.   These partitions are not as strong as those with R&ouml;dl and Schacht, but  they admit a few applications on 2-coloring  3-graphs.  A 3-graph G = (V, E) is 2-colorable when there  is a partition V = X U Y where every edge e of E meets both X and Y.   When for (X, Y), every edge e of E meets X in  precisely 2 places, we say G is (2, 1)-colorable.  Fix an n-element  vertex set V.  Joint work with T. Molla and J. Theado shows that for any  2-colorable 3-graph G = (V, E), one may construct a 2-coloring V = X U Y  in average time O(n&sup3;), averaging over all 2-colorable 3-graphs G = (V, E).  With T. Molla we proved that for any (2,  1)-colorable 3-graph G = (V, E), one may construct a (2, 1)-coloring of  G in average time O(n&sup3;), again averaging over all (2, 1)-colorable  3-graphs G =(V,E).  These results extend work of Person  and Schacht (2011) and of Balogh and Mubayi (2011).       Last Modified: 12/08/2020       Submitted by: Brendan T Nagle]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
