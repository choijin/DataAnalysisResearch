<AbstractNarration>A cyberphysical system (CPS) in biology requires sensor input that represents, as closely as possible, cell activity. Much work is expended on the development of wearable sensors that detect the expression of cell activity filtered through many processes. Recent work discloses that gene transcription can be thought of as a signal, with periodic oscillations over time. The well-known 24 hour light-dark cycle has protean effects however shorter and longer cycles not only exist but have important roles to play in health and disease. Detection of these signals and their perturbation is likely to be of great use in a robust health focused CPS. The exact nature of these signals and the mathematical structure underlying them will form the basis of this proposal. The societal impacts go beyond the new sensors to include the development of open source methods allowing the dissemination of new mathematical models and insights. into measurement of cellular processes.                                      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses the critical problem of generating cell-level physiologic data as a substrate for an effective CPS in health.   Applying  new, unbiased signal processing techniques, the team has recently identified new periodicity in RNA over time. This signal provides a robust insight into cell function and its changes. The team will address the ability of the new techniques in specific situations  to uncover signals to be used as inputs for a human health CPS sensor. This signal processing technique will be used to identify oscillations in genes associated with defined chronic metabolic diseases of humans such as diabetes, inflammation, and cancer). These candidate genes  will be used to construct a precision signature for input into a CPS sensor. The concepts and data will be used to construct mathematical equations describing the longitudinal DNA transcripts previously identified.  Taken together, these two activities will provide an integrated mathematical picture of periodic gene transcription that then sets the stage for novel sensor design that will provide prediction and control in a human-based CPS. The project will develop a new platform for understanding the cell that will be made widely available via a Web-based open source platform.</AbstractNarration>

The challenge is to take a large number of inputs representing the cellular dysfunctions associated with chronic disease and make them understandable for sensor inputs overtime. Since chronic disease develops over long periods of time and its manifestations can only be viewed over long periods of time we needed a way of organizing cellular data with a time function.  There are many difficulties inherent in this approach. Not the least of which is the multiplicity of metabolic parameters that are representative of normal cell function and cell function in disease. It is generally not feasible to detect all of these and even if that were possible integrating them into an understandable and manageable metric is challenging.  We decided to build a model of cellular function using the output of an experiment looking at periodicity in gene expression. The 24-hour circadian cycle is a result of a complex interplay of genes and is measurable by detecting RNA in timed specimens. This RNA is detected accurately by sequencing and this is a method superior to the former standard, microarray. We were looking for new patterns, those not typically associated with the 24 hour cycle. But finding these patterns is difficult in an experimental model. Using the eigenvalue pencil developed by one of us (ACA) we analyzed the output of genes longitudinally, over time. We were able to detect a novel 12 hour cycle that was independent of the circadian cycle , showing that the eigenvalue pencil was capable of distinguishing oscillations in complex biological systems.  We then used the eigenvalue pencil in a number of different situations and a number of different biological systems and have been able to develop ?signatures? that are unique to certain biological processes.  With this as a beginning, we are examining a number of large datasets with the idea of understanding not only periodicity but also biological signatures with the hope of simplifying inputs for cyber-physical systems.
