<AbstractNarration>A myriad of engagement opportunities between universities and companies exists across a partnership continuum, including research collaboration, technology commercialization, curriculum support, internships, and jobs. While relationships between companies and universities in metropolitan areas are stellar examples of robust innovation ecosystems that easily foster university-industry partnerships, many universities and companies in non-metropolitan areas struggle to create equivalent ecosystems. Numerous research-intensive universities are located outside metropolitan areas. Engagement between these institutions and industry is of equal importance, as their economic, educational, and social impacts in local communities and states are especially pronounced. Metropolitan regions possess innate assets that are unavailable to non-metropolitan areas; however, valuable and translatable lessons from metropolitan models can be mirrored in non-metropolitan areas to stimulate creation and growth of innovation and economic ecosystems. Non-metropolitan regions and institutions also possess unique attributes and research opportunities that can be leveraged to grow and establish relationships with companies and enhance the economic ecosystem in the region and state. This National Science Foundation supported workshop will promote a national discussion on strategies that universities and companies can design and implement to encourage partnerships with and between institutions and industry, specifically when one or both parties are located and operate outside metropolitan areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Arkansas, in collaboration with the University-Industry Demonstration Partnership, will organize a three-day forum in Fayetteville, Arkansas, for universities and companies outside major metropolitan areas to consider how to develop and grow strong industry engagement programs to bolster local and state innovation ecosystems. The workshop will leverage diverse experts and recruit attendees from metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas across the United States to participate in discussions about practical approaches that can be used by academic, corporate, government, and nonprofit groups in a community. Attendees will assess existing national models, brainstorm new programs and ideas, and develop steps that can be taken to improve academic-corporate engagement in non-metropolitan regions and support collaborations with the objectives of advancing university missions (teaching, research, service, and economic development), company goals, and local and state economies. Topics for discussion include existing national programs that universities and companies can use as a basis for research collaboration that can lead to economic development at the regional, state, and national levels; successful (and not so successful) strategies for university-industry engagement; strengthening graduate and undergraduate research; technology commercialization; career development and workforce pipelines; global competitiveness and influence; and the importance of diversity and inclusion in innovation teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Attendees learned how various constituents and key stakeholders in diverse communities can effectively evaluate successful strategies and approaches and deploy them in their local environments, with emphasis on advancing university missions of teaching, research, and service (including economic development), addressing company business goals, and strengthening local and state economies by forming and supporting innovation ecosystems, research commercialization, startups, technology- and knowledge-based job growth and creation, and attracting talent and existing companies to a non-metro region.

In addition to a formal workshop report, a toolkit for broad dissemination is being developed. The toolkit captures learnings from workshop presentations, Q&amp;A discussions, breakout sessions, and panels, and the tools address the workshop's six key topic areas. The toolkit can be used by both workshop attendees and non-attendees as a "how-to" guide and compiled resource list so that others can recreate or adapt what was shared at the workshop. Since many non-metropolitan areas are considered rural environments and these regions are typically populated by groups underrepresented in STEM, then the toolkit will be particularly useful to companies, communities, and universities in non-metro areas, those in EPSCoR states, and to minority serving institutions. Since UA and UIDP do not consider the focus of the workshop to be a closed topic, then the toolkit is a living document that captures continued conversations resulting from the workshop; therefore, additional tools that support the six key workshop topics will be developed and added to the toolkit and new tools in new topic areas will arise as the UIDP community continues to discuss topics related to university-industry engagement in non-metro areas. Feedback and survey results from the UA workshop indicated continued interest in the workshop topics and sufficient merit for UIDP to plan a workshop series on university-industry engagement in non-metropolitan areas; therefore, the next workshop is scheduled for 2021 at Cornell University and will further address the topics and outcomes from the 2019 UA event.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/28/2019<br>      Modified by: Cynthia&nbsp;Sides</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Arkansas (UA) partnered with UIDP (University Industry Demonstration Partnership) to plan and host a workshop, University-Industry Engagement outside Major Metropolitan Areas and Megacities: Identifying Issues and Finding Solutions. The workshop was held May 21-23, 2019, in Fayetteville, Arkansas, on the UA campus. Attendees representing over eighty universities, companies, foundations, government agencies, and economic development organizations participated in an international discussion about shared challenges in non-metropolitan areas, as well as strategies and best practices that universities and companies can design and implement to encourage partnerships between institutions and industry operating and located outside major metropolitan areas.     Intellectual Merit   Academic-corporate collaborations can be challenging, particularly for universities and companies located outside major cities; however, these institutions, as well as local, state, and national foundations, governments, and economic development organizations, are interested in enhancing the value proposition from collaborations in these regions. Fortunately, there are competitive and strategic reasons for such collaborations. Workshop sessions addressed six key topic areas: 1) leveraging and enhancing university research strengths, 2) managing strategic partnerships, 3) accelerating university research translation and commercialization, 4) talent connections, 5) placemaking, and 6) advancing local economic development.

These mechanisms will not only foster collaborative environments between universities, but they will also allow companies (located in metro and non-metro areas) and universities (metro and non-metro) to explore building and growing partnerships by strengthening opportunities in graduate and undergraduate research, internships/co-ops, programs like NSF IUCRC and I-CorpsTM, startups, and research commercialization.     Broader Impacts  The workshop convened a critical mass of strategic and tactical academic, corporate, government (federal, state, and local), foundation, and economic development leaders from the United States and Canada, with a majority representing non-metropolitan or rural regions, including significant representation from sixteen NSF EPSCoR states. Participation by regionally and economically diverse attendees prompted discussions about practical approaches to university-industry collaboration where one or both parties are located outside a major metropolitan area.
