<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project stems from a new generation of cement formulations that will enable more cost effective maintenance, operation and (re)design of critical wastewater transport systems than are currently available.  This I-Corps project leverages successful reuse of industrial byproducts for rehabilitating corroding utility conduits in place, as well as creating a new generation of corrosion resistant wastewater infrastructure.  Industrial by-products that are otherwise discarded as low value, or hazardous wastes, are recycled in a way that concurrently strengthens concrete while substantially increasing its corrosion resistance.  This I-Corps project investigates a competitive commercial approach to reduce resource consumption and pollution associated with replacing large masses of concrete, including, but not limited to subterranean utility networks.  This enables a corrosion control strategy that is sustainable and synergistic with the protections that critical wastewater infrastructure provides for environmental health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project exploits the ability of common charcoals and steel slags to confer antimicrobial properties into cementitious materials.  Forwarding a new generation of inexpensive antimicrobial building materials is the heart of this I-Corps project.  By incorporating small amounts of granulated industrial wastes, intellectual merit is realized by exploring engineering applications for new concrete admixtures that are effective against corrosion while conferring increased strength.  While most concrete pipe rehabilitation efforts employ acid resistant resins to protect (damaged) concrete pipe, this I-Corps project leverages a preventative materials approach that inhibits the microbes responsible for the concrete corrosion process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This iCorps grant was not executed and returned to NSF in its entirety.  This is because the industrial mentor decided that applying company could successfully incorporate its future without iCorps resources.  The team has since interfaced with a large company that produces the end product of this technology and has scheduled a full-scale pilot demonstration.  This industrial partner is also providing significant market research in the concrete pipe sector, the substance for which was to be (partially) provided through the iCorps training).  Given the industrial parter was willing to not only provide financial resources and up-to-date market research (North American, South American, European and Australian markets), the iCorps mentors decided that iCorps training was obsolete in this context; thus, the proposal was recinded and finances returned to the NSF, through the University of Colorado's Office of Contracts and Grants.  The team has since demonstrated that the subject of the iCorpts grant (fowarding and pricing new concrete formulations, which resisist microbially induced corrosion), are in-fact extremely competitive from a materials pricing perspective.  These new formulations will be extended into full-scale demonstration studies as proposed in the original iCorps submission.  The iCorps mentors deemed that iCorps would be an opportunity cost in terms of market and resoruces timing and the grant was thus returned.
