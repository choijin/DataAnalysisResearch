<AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how novel electronic states emerge has become a central research topic in condensed matter physics. Identifying the organizing principles for such electronic matter will facilitate discovering materials with novel and useful functionalities. The goal of this project is to investigate this theme in two separate venues: Kondo lattices and topological materials. An entanglement of localized states with itinerant electrons in a so-called Kondo lattice leads to a novel electronic state with greatly enhanced mass at low temperature. How exactly this process occurs and its relationship to a further transition into an ordered state will be studied in detail. For this purpose, measurement techniques to probe how electron waves interfere in such a system will be employed. Novel electronic states, called topological, that cannot be continuously transformed to ordinary states can exist in a certain class of materials and they are known to exhibit exotic properties, such as conducting electricity on their boundaries without dissipation while behaving as insulators for transport through the bulk. In this project, the nature of superconductivity induced in these topological states and the elusive Majorana particles that could potentially help in building a quantum computer in the future, will be probed using similar measurement techniques. Graduate and undergraduate students will take parts in this project by carrying out experiments and data analysis and attending workshops/conferences to disseminate the results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;Recent years have witnessed resurging interest in understanding the organizing principles for novel quantum matter. This project aims at unraveling the underlying mechanism for emergent phenomena in Kondo lattices and topological materials. The hidden order phase in URu2Si2 has long defied an unambiguous determination of its order parameter. Towards resolving this problem, the detailed hybridization process between localized states and itinerant bands and its relationship to the hidden order transition will be investigated using spectroscopic techniques such as quasiparticle scattering and tunneling. Other closely related Kondo lattice systems will also be studied. Novel topological electronic states emerge due to a combined effect of unconventional band structure and Fermi surface topology. Understanding their underlying physics is a frontier research topic. In this project, the nature of proximity-induced superconductivity in topological materials and Majorana fermions predicted to exist in such systems will be probed using tunneling spectroscopy and other phase-sensitive measurements. Graduate and undergraduate students will take parts in this project by carrying out experiments and data analysis and attending workshops/conferences to disseminate the results.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this project, electron spectroscopic studies have been carried out to understand emergent phenomena in three representative strongly correlated materials: URu<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>, CeCoin<sub>5</sub>, and SmB<sub>6</sub>. Their electronic properties at low temperature cannot be understood by just considering those of individual ingredients, namely, itinerant electrons and localized moments, whose behaviors are well understood at high temperature. Generically, the many-body interaction involving large coulomb repulsion energy leads to totally new ground states such as mundane heavy electron state, superconductivity, and topological phase. Despite intensive research, the origin of the phase transition that occurs in URu<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub> has baffled researchers for more than three decades, thus dubbed hidden order. This project has addressed a few key questions regarding a more plausible route towards unveiling its microscopic origin. First, the mere mingling of itinerant and localized electrons is found to have no direct correlation with the type of emergent ground state. Second, unlike what has been widely considered, scattering off collective excitations in an ordered state is found to cause the gap-like temperature evolution of electrical resistivity. Thus, these findings raise serious questions on the viability of the itinerant picture for the hidden order and suggest that localized electrons are the active player, setting the future direction. The superconductivity in CeCoIn<sub>5</sub> has been investigated for a long time and thought to be well-understood until recently. However, this project has discovered that a very new mechanism may be at work for the electron-electron pairing, a microscopic process essential to exhibiting superconductivity. The very process that leads to the screening of local moments and, thus, the formation of heavy fermions would provide pairing interaction to the electrons in this material if there exist two cooperative channels for the screening. If established, this finding will have immense impact on the field of superconductivity as it dismantles the conventional wisdom, which might also be needed to unravel the pairing mechanism in several other family of unconventional superconductors. Lastly, SmB<sub>6</sub> has been known to be a topological insulator, meaning its surface is metallic while the bulk is insulating. This class of materials are among plethora of topological materials that have been discovered in the last decade or so. Due to inherently strong correlations in SmB<sub>6</sub>, the properties of emergent topological surface states are intimately tied to bulk properties. This project has unraveled their intriguing interplay with bulk excitations, which sensitively depends on the level of disorder. This finding is exemplary in that similar behaviors are likely to be exhibited in other correlated topological materials. Also, this result will attract wider attention from the field in regards to several ongoing debates at it provides firm spectroscopic information crucial to addressing them.</p> <p>The project has engaged several young scientists in carrying out the proposed research on various occasions. One undergraduate, two graduate students, and one postdoctoral researcher were trained for the electron spectroscopic techniques employed in this project as well as several other relevant techniques. Undergraduates, high school students, and local science teachers have also been engaged in the research via the Internship, Honors Thesis, REU, and RET programs offered at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. They have closely interacted with each other in various settings such as working together as a team and presenting research results at group meetings and conferences including the annual APS March Meeting.
