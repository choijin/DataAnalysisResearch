<AbstractNarration>This project relates to artificial photosynthesis (AP) - the process by which solar energy is directly harvested and stored in chemicals such as hydrogen.  AP is a critical emerging technology for ensuring the Nation's future needs for sustainable energy and chemicals.  Presently, AP photoelectrode materials lack the ability to sustain stable high efficiency.  The project will address this challenge by studying the mechanisms behind photoelectrode degradation, along with efforts to improve the stability of tantalum nitride (an efficient AP photoelectrode) by integrating it with a nitride-based organic coating and catalyst material.  The results will contribute significantly to the eventual goal of employing artificial photosynthesis as a large-scale solar energy storage solution.  The experimental efforts will be complemented by educational efforts designed to develop novel curricula aimed at educating non-science majors on the importance of renewable energy.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The project is inspired by the principal investigator's recent success in understanding the factors that limit the performance of tantalum nitride (Ta3N5).  The previous results suggest that surface passivation by a non-oxide material, together with a catalyst, is needed to actualize the full potential of Ta3N5 for high-efficiency solar water splitting.  Graphitic C3N4 (g-C3N4) represents a rare material choice that meets the requirement.  The project is also conceived within the context that g-C3N4 has been shown effective in promoting a 2-electron pathway for water oxidation.  Together, the system presents a unique opportunity to study material-related issues at the photoelectrode/water interface for solar energy applications.  The experiments will generate important insight into photoelectrode destabilization mechanisms.  They are also expected to yield practically useful strategies to address critical issues such as low photovoltage and poor stability.  The most significant outcome will be the first demonstration of water splitting at efficiencies &gt;10% by a photoelectrode/water junction.  Specific aims will be directed at 1) demonstrating conformal and uniform g-C3N4 coverage on the surface of Ta3N5, with carbon nanodots (CDots) deposited on the g-C3N4 as a co-catalyst to disproportionate the hydrogen peroxide formed during water oxidation; 2) characterizing the structure of the hybrid material; 3) conducting electrochemical and spectroscopic characterization to probe whether the introduction of g-C3N4 mitigates the Fermi level pinning effect that is typical to Ta3N5; and 4) measuring the charge transfer kinetics at the photoelectrode/water interface on Ta3N5 with and without g-C3N4 to understand how g-C3N4 influences the charge transfer rates.  Beyond the technical objectives, the project will provide an opportunity to expand the sustainable-energy workforce through graduate and undergraduate student education, and build upon previous successes by the principal investigator's team in educational outreach.  A new collaboration with educational experts will be formed to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of these efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project studied Ta3N5 as a promising photoelectrode material for the applications of solar water oxidation, which is an important step for artificial photosynthesis. The project made significant contributions in three main areas: material synthesis, characterization of thermodynamics and kinetics at the solid/liquid interface, and a general strategy to protect efficient photoelectrodes.  Intellectual merits: This project tested the hypothesis that Ta3N5 itself is highly efficient in absorbing light and using the energy to excite charges but its performance is sensitive to surface chemical structures. Due to displacement of nitrogen (N) atoms in Ta3N5 by oxygen (O), the performance of Ta3N5 can be quickly compromised.

A promising strategy for this goal is to deposited a protection layer that is effective in extracting the photogenerated holes and using them for water oxidation reactions. GaN was found to be a good choice for this purpose. Additionally, water oxidation catalysts are required to facilitate the chemical reactions that take place on the surface. To understand the system, a photoelectrochemical (PEC) characterization protocol was developed. It utilizes a chemical system in which Ta3N5 does not exhibit decays to report on the detailed thermodynamic and kinetic information at the solid/liquid interface. The information played important roles in advancing the understanding the mechanisms by which the performance of Ta3N5 is influced by surface chemical species.  Broader impacts: The knowledge generated by this project will likely find broad applications in the field of photocatalysis as light-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency is of critical importance but is often poorly understood.
