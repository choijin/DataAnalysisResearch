<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve food safety and security of hand harvested food crops through individualized geo-spatial data collection. Much like highway cameras have an ability to tell the status of traffic on a given freeway are vastly improved through the individualized data of each driver and their phones, hand harvested food can benefit from improving traceability and transparency from block level data to single points of harvest, recalling intersecting mapping data. Geo-specific data can also enable better land productivity measurement over textual block data.  Individualized, personally owned, data enables workers to have portability of information, building a resume of dependability and performance.  In addition, it becomes an integral component of a viable transparency scheme.  The project will potentially improve the economic standing of harvesters, improve the capability of farmers to better understand their workforce and land, assist marketers with improved data to insure against breakdowns in food safety, and enable consumers transparency without added steps to the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project further develops improved data collection methods in high-value hand-picked specialty crops. The data in question is a precise record of who harvests what, where and when.  Contextual data (quality, irrigation/fertilization data, cultural practice maps, etc.) are added and visualized for farmers.  The project will test the relationship of data sets toward improved decision skills; better management depends on better measurement.  It provides a better understanding of inhomogeneities in space and time.  Addressing these inhomogeneities leading to investigation and reductions of variance.  The system will enables comprehension of bottlenecks and workflow problems in labor process and allow dynamic and real-time decisions.  The system will also allow quantitative approaches toward finding optimal decisions in several parts of the system and provide a platform for decentralized decision-making based on common data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This I-Corps project was designed to investigate data analytics in high-value hand-picked specialty crops. The data in question is a precise record of who harvests what, where and when; added contextual data would be quality, irrigation/fertilization data, cultural practice maps, etc.  The project will test the relationship of data sets toward improved decision skills; better management depends on better measurement.   With enough combined data, can farmers better comprehend workflow bottlenecks and problems in the face of variations in land, quality, quantity, and labor?  This I-Corps project tested various business hypotheses in this direction.   The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve food safety and security of hand harvested food crops through individualized geo-spatial data collection. Hand harvested food can benefit from improving traceability and transparency from block level data to single points of harvest. Geo-specific data can also enable better land productivity measurement. Individualized data enables workers to have portability of information, building a resume of dependability and performance. In addition, it becomes an integral component of a viable transparency scheme. The project will potentially improve the economic standing of harvesters, improve the capability of farmers to better understand their workforce and land, assist marketers with improved data to insure against breakdowns in food safety, and enable consumers transparency without added steps to the system.   In this proposal, we interviewed a large number of stakeholders in the high-value hand picked specialty crop industry to identify interest and value in data of this type.  We found broad interest in this data, but a complex picture of how value could be extracted from this data.       Last Modified: 09/15/2019       Submitted by: Richard Sowers]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
