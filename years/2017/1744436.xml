<AbstractNarration>The University of Guam (UOG) NSF INCLUDES Launch Pilot project, GROWING STEM, addresses the grand challenge of increasing Native Pacific Islander representation in the nation's STEM enterprise, particularly in environmental sciences. The project addresses culturally-relevant and place-based research as the framework to attract, engage, and retain Native Pacific Islander students in STEM disciplines. The full science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pathway will be addressed from K-12 to graduate studies with partnerships that include the Guam Department of Education, Humatak Community Foundation, Pacific Post-Secondary Education Council, the Guam Science and Discovery Society, the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) and the University of Alaska-Fairbaanks. As the project progresses, the project anticipates further partnerships with the current NSF INCLUDES Launch Pilot project at the University of the Virgin Islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pilot activities include summer internships for high school students, undergraduate and graduate research opportunities through UOG's Plant Nursery and the Humatak Community Foundation Heritage House. STEM professional development activities will be offered through conference participation and student research presentations in venues such as the Guam Science and Discovery Society's Guam Island-wide Science Fair and SACNAS. Faculty will be recruited to develop a mentoring protocol for the project participants. Community outreach and extension services will expand public understanding in environmental sciences from the GROW STEM project. Project metrics will include monitoring the diversity of partners, increases in community engagement, Native Pacific Islander participation in STEM activities, the number of students who desire to attain terminal STEM degrees and the number of community members reached by pilot STEM extension and outreach activities. Dissemination of the GROWING STEM pilot project results will occur through the NSF INCLUDES National Network, partner annual conferences, and local, regional and national STEM conferences.</AbstractNarration>

Already to date, we have two of the Pilot INCLUDES GROW HS participants in our current NSF INCLUDES: SEAS Island Alliance undergraduate program, and a few Pilot INCLUDES GROW undergraduate fellows entering our graduate programs.  Additionally, pilot GROW undergraduate fellows continue in the pathway by remaining active in the University of Guam SACNAS Chapter Student Organization, other University of Guam grant opportunities, REU’s, and job and internship opportunities in local marine and environmental science agencies.     Goal 3: Expand awareness of STEM importance and opportunities throughout the Micronesia region using the university extension and outreach model.         A 212 square-mile island with 165,000 people, Guam is the largest and most populous island in Micronesia, a region of 2,100 islands spread across 2.3 million square miles. Guam is the southernmost island of the Mariana Archipelago. The islands north of Guam in the archipelago are known as the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI).     The DDLP INCLUDES fellows conducted a workshop on watershed restoration techniques in the islands of Rotan and Saipan in the CNMI. Rota is situated 90 km north of Guam.  The island is 12.3 miles long and 4.2 miles wide, with a land area of 32.87 mi2 and a population of ~3,200 (2000 US Census) people.  Saipan is located 128 km north of Rota.  It is the biggest, the northern most, and the capitol of CNMI.  Saipan is about 12 miles long and 5.6 miles wide, with a land area of 44.55 mi2 and a population of ~ 48,000 people (2017 US Census). The Northern Marianas College (NMC) is a community college with its main campus on Saipan and an instructional site located in Rota.     One undergraduate GROW fellow, one graduate GROW fellow, and a faculty mentor traveled to and conducted two workshops on Rota and Saipan. The fellows used outreach techniques they learned during their fellowship. The GROW fellows also incorporated other watershed restoration techniques researched by other students and members of the GROW research team.  These were based on the university extension and outreach model, translating STEM related issues into terms and practices easy to use by natural resources managers. After their presentation, the fellows facilitated a discussion on ways to successfully implement the watershed restoration techniques.     Additionally, extension and outreach activities were conducted on Guam, extending the reach of the pilot to over 1,360 additional community members.
