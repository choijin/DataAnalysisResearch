<AbstractNarration>This award will support the 2017 Summer Biomechanics, Biotransport and Bioengineering Conference (SB3C2017) being held in Tucson, Arizona; June 21-24, 2017. The SB3C meetings, and their predecessor SBC meetings, are generally considered the premiere annual meetings for biomechanics. The primary purpose of the meeting is to promote state-of-the-art research, collaboration, and international scientific discourse in the broad field of bioengineering with focus on biomechanics, biotechnology, biotransport, biomaterials, tissue engineering, rehabilitation and design. The organizing committee for SB3C2016 is drawn from individuals in academia and the industry with significant experience in running the previous summer meetings. The meeting and its precursor meetings have traditionally provided a high-quality, multidisciplinary biomedical engineering event since the early 90's and contributed to training many generations of academics and researchers. Notably, the summer meetings series has, since its inception, prioritized the integration of students into the meeting to support their professional development and future connection to the biomechanics, biotransport and bioengineering research community. For many years, students have made up more than 50% of attendees and presenters. The theme of this year's meeting is "Growth, Development, Remodeling, and Repair". In addition to the direct impact this conference will have on the mainstream bioengineering community, it serves an important cross-fertilization role, since attendees are drawn from a very broad range of disciplines beyond the biomechanics community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aims of the project are to sponsor travel fellowships for females and under-represented minorities; and, to sponsor the prestigious Student Paper Competition by covering the meeting registration costs of the top 40 BS and MS competition submissions. Finalists and winners in the student paper competition can add this information to their resumes, and the competition provides an opportunity for students to develop as researchers and is a significant career boost, enhancing retention of the most talented students and providing role models for all student attendees. Through the technical proceedings and conference web site, information presented at the meeting will be available to multiple societies and to the public at large. Further, the conference has historically had, and is expected to continue to have more than 50 percent of the attendees being students and postdoctoral fellows and more than 25 percent female attendees. For the second time, the organization committee has been extended to include a Diversity Chair. Through the travel fellowships and associated workshops, the PI plans to establish this meeting as the "go to" conference for female and under-represented minority attendees.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This grant provided support for undergraduate and graduate students to attend a scientific conference. The conference is called the Summer Biomechanics, Bioengineering, and Biotransport Conference (SB<sup>3</sup>C), and brings together engineers and scientists who study biomechanics (which includes topics such as how the heart and muscles work, or how to repair and replace joints damaged by arthritis), biotransport (topics such as blood flow and oxygen transport in the body), and other related topics. This conference is particularly focused on providing an opportunity for students to present their work, meet and obtain advice from senior researchers in their field, and begin developing their own careers. Thus, the goal of the conference grant was to help students attend the meeting who might otherwise be unable to afford it. About half of the funds were used to support 26 of the 59 students who applied for Diversity Travel Grants. The recipients of these awards were women or minorities who are traditionally under-represented in science and engineering. The other half of the funds were used to pay the conference registration fee for undergraduate (B.S.) and Masters (M.S.) students who submitted highly-rated abstracts to the SB<sup>3</sup>C Student Paper Competition. NSF support enabled these students to attend the conference and present their work in a poster session, where they could discuss their work with bioengineers from across the country. For many of these students, this was their first opportunity to present at a national scientific conference, and we expect the experience to increase the likelihood that they will choose to pursue careers in STEM fields.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/01/2018<br>      Modified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;W&nbsp;Holmes</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
