<AbstractNarration>The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Program recommends an award of  $90,421 for the purchase of the following:&lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;1) Replacement Tender/Workboat $69,954&lt;br/&gt;2) Electronic Chart Upgrade $6,174&lt;br/&gt;3) Navigation Depth Sounder $14,293&lt;br/&gt;     $90,421</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 2017 Shipboard Scientific Support Grant &ndash; Outcomes  This grant was originally funded to purchase the following equipment &ndash;  Deck Equipment:  1- Replacement of existing 5.0 meter Safeboat tender with new Zodiac Mil-Pro Model 550 SRMN rigid-hulled, foam-collared tender, with a 90 horsepower outboard.

All items have been purchased and installed aboard the R/V ATLANTIC EXPLORER.  Additional items purchased:  The following additional items were also purchased with this grant, through cost-saving measures that included crew labor, wherever possible, and invoice savings from the equipment vendors during the procurement process:  1 - New Nobeltec electronic charting software, to replace the recently-purchased Rosepoint software. After the purchase and installation of a new computer and the Rosepoint software, it was found that Rosepoint did not live up to its description &ndash; it was difficult to use, not particularly user-friendly, and not well-suited for the work environment aboard the vessel.
