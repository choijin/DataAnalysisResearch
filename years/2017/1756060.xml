<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Troy MathFest Undergraduate Conference" that will be held at Troy University, April 6-7, 2018 in Troy, Alabama. The conference focuses on undergraduate research; its purpose is to provide an accessible forum for undergraduates to present their work on mathematical projects.   A distinguished mathematician will provide a keynote lecture.   It will also facilitate the introduction of attending students to various local, regional, and national graduate programs. The goal is to give students a sense of the next steps in pursuing a career in the mathematical sciences.  Of special focus is providing opportunities for woman and members of underrepresented groups to attend and participate in this conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.   The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.   More information will be made available at:&lt;br/&gt;https:/troy.edu/mathfest/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ TROY MathFest 2019 Project Outcomes Report for the General Public  Support for this grant was provided by the National Science Foundation grant Conferences and Workshops in the Mathematical Sciences; Award Proposal ID: 1756060.      TROY MathFest 2018 was an undergraduate mathematics conference held on April 6-7, 2018 at Troy University in Troy, Alabama.  This was our 12th such conference, but the first that was directly supported by the National Science Foundation?s Conference Grants program.  Some of our previous conferences were supported, however, by the MAA NSF-RUMC (NSF Grant DMS-0846477) grant for regional undergraduate mathematics conferences.  Our conference?s intellectual merits included providing a forum for primarily undergraduates (and some graduates) in mathematics to present their work on projects, an opportunity for all attendees to learn mathematics not otherwise known to them by attending presentations and connecting with the speakers, and to be exposed to prominent mathematicians in the invited lectures.   Some of the broader impacts included the following:  For the undergraduate students attending the conference, by virtue of attending the presentations, they would have learned some mathematical ideas that are new to them. As a result, their scientific literacy and appreciation would have improved. For the undergraduate students who gave a presentation in this conference, this would have given them the experience of preparing and delivering a presentation, which better prepares them for their future careers, regardless of whether it is in mathematics.  In this sense, it helped contribute to a better future workforce.  For those pursuing careers in mathematics, this would help in the preparation of some of the next generation of mathematicians, by giving them experiences which will benefit them for graduate school and beyond.   Below are some final counts:  There were about 140 attendees from 15 different colleges/universities.   There were 38 presentations by undergraduates, two by graduate students, and four by faculty. There were 5 students in our poster session. There were two invited lectures by Professors Chris Rodger (Auburn University) and Joseph Gallian (University of Minnesota Duluth).   We had a calculus competition with about 30 participants. There were representatives/graduate program coordinators from 7 universities. The grant allowed us to provide lunch and refreshments to the attendees, pay for the invited speakers, and to provide some travel support for student speakers from other universities.      As this was an undergraduate mathematics conference where students do not typically have new results (it may be known to the mathematics community, but not to the student at the outset of the project) , we do not anticipate publishing the results.   We do believe that this is an important endeavor to host this conference, so that we give undergraduate students in mathematics this opportunity for its intellectual merits and broader impacts as stated above.
