<AbstractNarration>General Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biological mechanisms that generate biological rhythms are critical for life, as most organisms on earth have to adapt to cyclical changes in their environments. The time-scales associated with these changes vary widely, and thus so do the mechanisms that allow organisms to use them to predict their environments and survive. Identifying the fundamental principles associated with such diversity requires a broad range of intellectual inputs. The conference supported by this award will therefore bring a diverse group of investigators together from across the United States and Latin America, including senior scientists who are leaders in the field of biological rhythms and young investigators just beginning their training, to foster the exchange of ideas and to provide training and mentorship opportunities for the young investigators from Latin America. Senior US investigators will run in-depth discussion groups with young scientists from Latin America during a one-day workshop, and pairs of senior-junior scientists will then interact one-on-one throughout the following week at an associated conference. This not only provides excellent mentorship opportunities for the young scientists, but also the potential for new ideas for the senior scientists that come from fresh perspectives. A high proportion of the US scientists that will be supported are women, and the international collaborations between US and Latin American scientists will promote growth in the field for investigators across the Americas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a small meeting that will pair senior US and Latin American scientists with graduate students and postdoctoral associates from Latin America during an intense, one-day workshop in Valparaiso, Chile, followed by continuing interactions between mentors and trainees during a subsequent meeting on the topic of biological rhythms. There will be four roundtable discussions on 1) Neural Circuits Associated with Sleep; 2) Sleep and Human Performance, 3) Neural Models of Rhythmic Physiology, and 4) Mechanisms of Entrainment. Each will be jointly chaired by US and Latin American senior scientists, and attended by graduate students and postdoctoral associates from Latin America. The senior scientists will briefly discuss their research, followed by intense discussion groups with the students. Each senior scientist will be paired with a young scientist and expected to have follow-up interactions with that student during a subsequent meeting Chronobiology that all participants will attend. In the past, these interactions have led to multiple, collaborative papers that include both the senior and junior scientists. This meeting, like those, is expected to greatly benefit both senior and junior scientists across the Americas and lead to significant discoveries in the field of biological rhythms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of the Travel Grant were to allow eleven senior U.S. scientists in the Sleep and Biological Rhythms fields to participate in the 2017 meeting of the Latin American Society for Chronobiology.  The Conference took place in Novermber 2017 at the University of Valparaiso, Chile.  Notably, one of the visiting US scientists - Professor Michael Rosbash of Brandeis University - had one month earlier received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.  That honor greatly enlivened and added significance to an already dynamic Conference.  The major activities assigned to the eleven sponsored scientists included (i) promoting pedagogy in the field, by participating in a pre-Conference mini-course on the elements of Sleep and Circadian Rhythms research for Latin American junior scientists; and (ii) promoting personal interactions with local junior scientists and trainees.  Sponsored PIs were assigned specific posters of trainees to visit and discuss. Through these extensive formal educational presentations and directed personal interactions, the general aim was to promote the professional development of local junior scientists by offering exposure to leaders in these fields.  Numerous long term relations were established between the NSF-sponsored PIs who attended the Conference and junior scientists from Latin American in the fields of Sleep and Circadian Rhythms.  In so doing, these efforts are providing a long-term boost to the career development of numerous young scientists in these growing fields, and are strengthening scientific ties across the Americas. The spcific outcomes are documented in an attached file, submitted as a Supporting File ("LASC 2017- Post-Conference Contacts).
