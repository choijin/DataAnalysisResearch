<AbstractNarration>The Mendocino Fracture Zone (FZ) off the west coast of North America is a fault system with a large difference in seafloor age (about 27 My) from north to south across the FZ. Because seafloor cools as it ages, there is an associated temperature difference (300 degrees at 60 km depth) that is well understood from cooling models. It is known from laboratory studies of mantle rocks that electrical conductivity and seismic velocity both depend on temperature, but there are uncertainties associated with these laboratory predictions because it is difficult to predict, and then replicate, conditions in Earth's mantle beneath the crust. One significant uncertainty is the role of water, which decreases the strength of rocks and increases electrical conduction. By measuring electrical conductivity and seismic velocity across the Mendocino FZ, this project will effectively calibrate the combined effect of temperature and age, while keeping other factors, such as mantle chemistry, largely constant. Since seismic and electrical methods are widely used to study the geology of Earth's interior, these results will be broadly useful to the Earth science community. This project will also provide important constraints on the nature of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) at the base of the oceanic tectonic plate. While the oceanic ridges, ocean trenches, and transform faults that form the lateral boundaries of the tectonic plates are well studied, the largest plate boundary of all, the LAB, is poorly understood. This project aims to assess the extent of partial melting as a function of temperature difference, and also determine any depth dependence of the LAB with age. The ship time for this project is provided by the University of California ship funds program, and through this project will provide seagoing experience for 16 graduate students. The data will be used as the basis for the PhD thesis of a female graduate student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project plans to deploy 21 ocean-bottom electromagnetic (OBEM) recorders fitted with seismic sensors (hydrophones and differential pressure gauges) during a transit of the R.V. Roger Revelle from Newport, Oregon, to San Diego, California. The instruments will occupy a 200 km long north-south line and will be left to record for several months before being recovered on another cruise out of San Diego. Magnetotelluric response functions will be estimated from the time series data, and inverted for electrical conductivity across the FZ. Earthquake arrival times will be picked from the seismic recordings to estimate travel time differences north and south of the Mendocino FZ. Acoustic chirp data will be used to correct for the effect of variations in sediment thickness on arrival times. The lithosphere and asthenosphere across the fracture zone were presumably formed from compositionally similar mantle upwelling, so any differences in the conductivity and seismic velocity across the fracture zone can be attributed to differences in temperature and partial melt. Sediment thickness and underway data collected across the Mendocino and Pioneer FZs will be used to refine models of flexure due to differential thermal subsidence and estimate the strength of the FZ by comparing the data with models of partially locked faults.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A major goal of this project is to study the effect of the 27 My age difference across the Mendocino Fracture Zone (FZ) on upper mantle structure, using marine magnetotelluric (MT) data.  Models of how tectonic plates cool with age predict a 300&deg; C temperature difference beneath the crust across the FZ.  The marine MT method uses natural variations in Earth's magnetic field to probe the electrical conductivity of the oceanic crust and mantle, by measuring magnetic and electric fields using instruments deployed on the seafloor and then converting these data to conductivity models.   Because the electrical conductivity of mantle minerals increases with temperature, we expected to observe the temperature difference across the FZ in models generated from the MT data we collected.  Further, molten rock is much more conductive than solid rock, and so any melt in the crust or mantle should also be visible in our models.  In October 2017 we deployed 21 seafloor MT instruments across the Mendocino FZ from the research vessel Roger Revelle during a transit from Newport, Oregon to San Diego, California (Figure 1).  The instruments collected 2 months of data until the batteries expired, and all the instruments were recovered on another cruise on the Revelle during a transit from San Diego to Newport in June 2018.  Raw data were processed into MT responses which were then used to compute electrical conductivity models.     Our  models show a marked conductivity contrast across the fracture zone, with the younger, hotter side being more conductive, as expected. The models show an increase in conductivity that is in good agreement with the depths to the 1200&deg; C isotherm, about 20 km on the younger (north) side and 60 km on the older (south) side (Figure 2).  This corresponds to a thickening of the Pacific tectonic plate (defined by a rigid lithosphere) as it gets older and cools.   However, the rapid increase in conductivity at the base of the plate  suggests that melting, rather than just temperature, is determining conductivity structure.  This is consistent with other studies where high conductivities at the base of the lithosphere are interpreted as upward migration of (less dense) melt though the mantle  which then ponds at the depth and temperature where the melt freezes.  Because melt is much weaker than solid rock, this layer of melt at the base of the lithosphere makes it easier for the rigid plates to move across the mantle, essentially lubricating plate tectonic processes.  This is an important constraint on how we interpret the dynamics of plate tectonics.    On the southern, older side of the fracture zone, we see a conductive feature that approaches the seafloor from the mantle under the fracture zone (c1, Figure 2). This conductor is co-incident with bathymetry that is suggestive of volcanic eruptions south of the fracture zone, and we may be imaging the migration path of the melt that formed these volcanic features, presumably when the northern, younger plate was formed at the Gorda mid-ocean ridge to the east of our study area.  During the deployment and recovery cruises we chose transits that targeted areas where seafloor bathymetry data were previously lacking.  The multi-beam bathymetry data were incorporated into global data sets which are used by thousands of scientists.  We also collected seismic data on the seafloor instruments, which will be used in future studies to look at differences in structure across the FZ.  Seven graduate students from UC Santa Cruz and UC San Diego took a Geophysical Methods at Sea course during the deployment cruise, which also included lectures prior to the cruise and post-cruise data analysis.  During the recovery cruise, we hosted several  STEMSEAS (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Student Experiences Aboard Ships) students.  The STEMSEAS program aims to provide ship-based, 6-10 day exploratory experiences for undergraduates from diverse backgrounds aboard NSF-funded research vessels.  UC San Diego graduate student Valeria Reyes-Ortega was chief scientist on the recovery cruise, and will submit her PhD thesis on this work in 2021.
