<AbstractNarration>With funding from the National Science Foundation's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, this project entitled "The Finishers Program: A Cohesive Support System from High School through College" will provide scholarships and support for five years to 30 low-income students with academic promise and who have demonstrated financial need to succeed in STEM disciplines at the University of New Hampshire (UNH). The significance of this project is that it will build a cohesive high school/college/industry pathway that bridges transition points and uses evidence-based approaches to improve educational equity. The Finishers Program will address the increasing local economic need for a STEM-educated workforce brought about by high-tech companies moving to New Hampshire.  High School students will be selected from low-income and disenfranchised backgrounds, some from STEAM Ahead, an innovative public high school/private industry college readiness program in Manchester, New Hampshire's largest city, and others from Dover, New Hampshire's fastest growing city who have not been exposed to STEAM Ahead. These high schools historically graduate at much lower rates than the average for the state; students will be supported to pursue bachelor's degrees in STEM fields. The University of New Hampshire will implement a novel support structure, the Finishers Program, that spans the divide between high school and college, with proactive assessment and mentoring, one-on-one academic advising, in-depth faculty interactions and support, and group workshops during the scholars' senior year of high school and throughout their college education. It is expected that these interventions will smooth the transition between high school and college, allow university staff and faculty to identify challenges unique to each student before arrival on campus, and develop the necessary supports.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate the extent to which the Finishers Program scholars make connections with communities and their impact on their persistence through a STEM degree. Students' academic outcomes and their non-cognitive skills development will also be longitudinally tracked and analyzed, with an initial emphasis on how self-valuation and a growth mind-set nurtured through the program increase persistence for this urban student population, controlling for their exposure to a college readiness program and other variables. The Finishers Program is also expected to have a positive impact on the student support system at the University of New Hampshire. The data on non-cognitive factors, taken as Finisher Program scholars interact with various supports and academic structures, will provide a broader understanding of what helps students from low-income, urban backgrounds be successful in acquiring an undergraduate STEM education. The knowledge will be regularly disseminated to help the public-school system better understand how partnerships with universities and industry can create a pipeline model that could help economically depressed areas if students are supported through college. Knowledge generated by the project will also be disseminated at several STEM education venues and publications.</AbstractNarration>
