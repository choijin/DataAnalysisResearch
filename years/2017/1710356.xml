<AbstractNarration>Astronomers would like to image habitable planets around other stars.  Turbulence in Earth's atmosphere is the main obstacle to achieving this goal.  Such turbulence blurs and confuses light from bright stars with their nearby, dim planets.  Adaptive optics can partially correct for turbulence.  However, even adaptive optics pushed to its limits (Extreme Adaptive Optics, ExAO) is still insufficient to deliver the required high-contrast images.  Mazin and collaborators will develop an innovative control algorithm that makes use of new, highly responsive detectors.  This approach will enable ExAO images to separate exoplanets from their parent stars.  The resulting algorithm will be tested and used at several observatories.  This technology may enable breakthrough advances in ground-based astronomy and allow the discovery of habitable worlds outside our solar system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is a continuation of Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (MKID) research and development that was supported by previous NSF awards (1308556 and1654105).  These previous awards supported the instrument development and deployment at Palomar Observatory.  This award will develop algorithms and methodology to use the instrument to increase contrast in Extreme Adaptive Optics (ExAO) images of exoplanets. Increasing contrast is the main technical challenge for imaging exoplanets with ExAO.  The greatest obstacle is short timescale atmospheric speckles that are uncorrected by the AO system.  This proposal will use the fast time response of the MKID detectors to remove speckles from images ex post facto using the photon arrival time statistics.  Direct detection and study of Earth-like exoplanets would realize a major goal of astronomy in the coming decade.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Direct Imaging is one of the most technically challenging techniques to study exoplanets, but holds immense promise for not just detecting but characterizing planets around the nearest stars. Ambitious instruments at the world's largest telescopes have been built to carry out this science: the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI), SPHERE at VLT, SCExAO at Subaru, the P1640 and Stellar Double Coronagraph (SDC) at Palomar, and MagAO-X at the Magellan Clay telescope.  All of these instruments are currently limited to planet-star detection contrast ratios of 1e-6 by a background of speckles from uncontrolled scattered and diffracted light. This is the ?speckle barrier? that has limited the yield of current instruments to a mere handful of young planets in wide orbits.  In order to make real progress, we must break through the speckle barrier. Much like the sound barrier, the speckle barrier is not a true limit but an obstacle for our current technology.   The work at University of Arizona (UofA) focused on analyzing a method for using images taken simultaneous by different cameras in an instrument, at high frame rates, to identify aberrations.  This information -- the location and brightness of speckles -- can then be used to remove the speckle.  This can either be done in the post-processing data analysis phase, or in real-time as part of a correction system.  In particular, if this correction can be applied in real-time it will dramatically improve sensitivity to exoplanets by reducing photon noise.  At the UofA a computer code was developed by a PhD student to simulate the propagation of light through a exoplanet imaging instrument at high frame rates.  This simulator can be used to analyze a new algorithm for identifying speckles.   This is the first step to developing the capability to deploy such algorithms on instruments such as MagAO-X and SCExAO.
