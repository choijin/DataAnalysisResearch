<AbstractNarration>Supporting and sustaining public science literacy and engagement are important goals of informal science education institutions worldwide. Although there is evidence that both science centers and natural history museums positively influence public science literacy and engagement, significant differences exist between these two types of institutions. This international workshop on Integration of Science Centers with Natural History Museums for Imparting Informal Education addresses this issue by convening key science center and natural history museum professionals from 9 countries in South and Southeast Asia, as well as the United States, to explore the strengths and limitations of the assets, philosophies and strategies of these institutions. Beyond the benefits science center and natural history museum professionals attending will receive, the effort will significantly contribute to the broader US and international conversation about the future of science centers and natural history museums, as well as other museum-like, science-rich informal education institutions, in these regions and beyond. In particular, supporting personal and cultural relevance has been a major focus of informal science education organizations globally, and the recommendations that emerge from the meeting will significantly contribute to this dialogue and help to make advances in the disciplinary field of informal science education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This international workshop, hosted in Malaysia and facilitated by researchers from the Institute for Learning Innovation, convenes 40 science center and natural history museum professionals to explore the affordances and constraints of science centers and natural history museum exhibitions, programs, outreach efforts, websites, etc. The conference is designed to examine the opportunities, challenges and barriers to integrating key design principles that blend the best of science centers and natural history museums, while guiding the creation of new forms of 21st century informal science education institutions. Additional goals explore how to make informal science education institutions in general more relevant to 21st century publics, both culturally and personally, as well as foster intra- and international collaborations between science center and natural history museum professionals. Toward these ends, all conference participants will commit to the completion of pre-conference assignments; active preparation and involvement at the meeting; and, assistance with the dissemination of project findings. The major deliverable will be a Whitepaper describing the outcomes of the meeting and the key design principles that leverage the effectiveness and relevance of each of these institutions. The Whitepaper will be produced in both hard copy and electronic form and more broadly disseminated throughout the natural history museum and science center fields in all participating countries. The electronic form will be hosted and available for download through the website of the Institute for Learning Innovation and the Center for Advancing Informal Science Education (CAISE) with links to all participating institutions. This project is supported jointly by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) and the Advances in Informal STEM Education (AISL) program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Leading science educators from 9 South and Southeastern Asian countries and the U.S. met for three days in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (October 4-6, 2017) in an effort to rethink and re-envision science education in the 21st Century.  The attendees of this U.S. National Science Foundation-funded international conference reaffirmed the G8-Science Academies Joint Statement (2011) that education in science must be targeted not only to future scientists, engineers and other specialists in government and industry, but also to the general public, including school-aged children and adults. The attendees at the October meeting further asserted that public science education should be relevant for all individuals.  Attendees drafted and unanimously approved the following policy statement:  Goals for a 21st Century Approach to Science Education Policy  Build awareness and interest in the importance of lifelong science learning and participation. Share examples of evidence-based practice and seek opportunities for collaboration and cooperation nationally and internationally. Leverage existing formal, informal/free-choice, business/industry and family/community assets and structures to support lifelong science learning and participation. Ensure personal, cultural and societal/global relevance by connecting science to people?s lives and providing equal access for all.   As outlined above, the group declared it imperative that all nations move towards a four-pronged approach to science education; one that equally engages each of four critical educational sectors or pillars &ndash; formal; informal/free-choice; business/industry; and, family/community. Each of the four sectors need to work together in order to create a seamless, integrated public education that ensures equitable access, relevant content and sustainable programs and activities. The attendees asserted that bringing science into people?s daily lives and helping them understand and value science is essential for simultaneously supporting human well-being, and protecting and restoring the natural world.  A major focus of the meeting was the increasingly critical role played by informal/free-choice science learning. The important contributions this key educational sector make are often under-appreciated and under-supported within national science education policy. The informal/free-choice science education community has demonstrated an ability to innovatively support the public?s learning in ways that are both relevant to their basic needs, as well as to the health of the planet. Attendees explored ways to better coordinate and support the actions of this vital sector in order to weave access to science learning throughout all of the learning spaces of societies and the activities of daily life.  Changing Realities of Science Education  Initiating new models for public science education in the twenty-first century requires addressing realities and challenges unlike those faced by the creators of the current, school-focused public education system. Today, public science education needs to be fully focused on meeting the lifelong science learning needs of all people, at all stages of life, wherever a person is and whenever such a need arises. For example, a twenty-first century system for lifelong public science learning must have the capacity to support the ever-changing nature of science, across every possible topic area and the ability to empower citizens attempting to address every type of science challenge, need or context.  The future public science education system will need to be first and foremost learner-centered which the primary goal of serving the real-life science learning needs, realities and motivations of all people 24-7, across an entire lifespan. By contrast, the current system overly privileges past science, those already advantaged and/or those believed to have the potential to one day become science professionals. A true, universally accessible public science learning system does not currently exist anywhere in the world, but pieces exist in every country. What also exists is a growing appreciation for what such a system needs to look like and how to create it. The key to creating such a system is thinking systemically, outside of the current educational box. Meeting attendees recognized that no single pathway exists to support this vision; each nation and community must forge their own new and systemic vision of lifelong public science learning.  Meeting Outcomes  As representatives of the global science education community, meeting participants urged governments, industry, funders, institutions of formal and informal education, members of health and civic organizations, and local communities, to come together to cultivate a world in which all people, young and old, have equitable opportunities to engage in meaningful science learning. Surveys administered roughly six and eighteen months after the meeting revealed that a majority of meeting participants, including at least one representative from each of the 10 participating countries, had implemented one or more of the meeting?s ideas and/or proposals. Impacts ranged from local changes in the everyday practices of how lifelong science learning is supported in their institution to national efforts to influence policy makers and funders to embrace a more distributed, synergistic, personalized and free-choice approach to science learning.  Evaluation also revealed numerous examples of on-going national and international collaboration amongst participants.
