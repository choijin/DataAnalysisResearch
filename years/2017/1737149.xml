<AbstractNarration>Autism stakeholders, including parents, people with autism, and educators, agree that community engagement is important for the ethical design of autism research. This project will analyze how involving members of stakeholder groups in autism research affects how researchers design their studies and present their research. This proposed study will examine what values and concepts related to research and disability are important to autism stakeholders and how community engagement with these values will impact research output.  Findings from this project could lead to increased inclusion and participation of people with disabilities in scientific research. It could contribute to improving public understanding and reception of that research. This project will aim to establish best practice guidelines for generating an ethical culture of autism research. It will train graduate students in qualitative research methods and research design ethics. The research outcomes will be of interest to patients, families of patients, health care providers, researchers and administrators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study investigates to what extent autism researchers include autism stakeholder groups in the design phase of their research, as well as inclusion's effects on research output. It will contribute to the sociological and ethical literature on autism research, STS studies of values and epistemological frameworks, and bioethics. The PIs will employ a sequential mixed methods research design, including a survey of U.S. autism researchers working on basic biomedical research, epidemiology, and services research to identify researchers who utilize community involvement approaches ranging from CBPR (Community Based Participatory Research) to advisory boards, as well as those with no interest in community engagement. Based on survey responses, researchers will be split into two groups, those who report having used any community engagement approaches in their research and those who did not. The survey will be followed by structured interviews to assess attitudes and beliefs (e.g., a social versus a medical model of disability or an orientation to autism across the lifespan rather than a childhood focus) related to autism research. Lastly, a textual analysis will be conducted of interviewed researchers' publications to assess whether researchers' commitment to community engagement in the design phase of research is associated with different research methods, frames of analysis, conclusions, or products.</AbstractNarration>
