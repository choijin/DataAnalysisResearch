<AbstractNarration>Abstract: A Workshop for Broadening Participation in the Economics Profession: Proposal Writing and Grant Management&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;African Americans are under-represented in the Economics profession relative to their population share in the U.S.  The participation rate of researchers from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in NSF funded research activities in economics is even much lower than African American representation in the Economics profession.  In an era of increasing diversity of the U.S. workforce, broadening participation in STEM research has become a necessity.  Part of this low participation rate can be attributed to lack of supply of quality proposals from HBCU researchers.  This proposed Workshop aims to bring researchers from HBCUs, NSF Program Directors, HBCU Administrators and NSF Awardees together to develop approaches to increase quality submission of grant applications from HBCUs.  The Workshop will provide a "hands on" experience in writing competitive research grant applications and managing awards should one win award. Expected outcomes of this Workshop include increased number of competitive proposals submitted to NSF from HBCUs, increased collaboration among HBCU researchers and among HBC and non-HBCU researchers, increased publications in refereed journals by HBCU economics faculty, and ultimately a strong research infrastructure and culture in HBCUs. Key aspects of the Workshop is the long term mentoring that will be provided for new researchers, as well as the collaboration across researchers that will develop. Involving HBCU Administrators will let them realize how time consuming research is and therefore convince them provide time release for their faculty to be able write competitive proposals.  The results of this Workshop will contribute to the development of a strong and diverse STEM scientific community in the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About 20 research-active HBCU economists from the Southeastern U.S., NSF grant awardees, NSF Program Directors from the Social Behavioral and Economics Directorate (SBE), and HBCU Administrators will be invited to this Workshop. Prior NSF awardee will be assigned as mentors to the HBCU faculty and NSF Program Officers will act as resource persons at the Workshop.  The focus of the Workshop will be on the practical aspects of grant writing and grant management.  The key to success of this workshop is the requirement that each participant comes in with a draft outline of a research project which s/he will work to refine at the workshop and continue to work on refining with his/her mentor after the Workshop and ultimately submit to the NSF for funding.  If successful, the efforts can be replicated not only in other regions but also in other disciplines with current mentees acting as mentors in future efforts.  To gauge the success of the Workshop, the PIs will collect data on the research productivity of participants before and after participation. For effective evaluation, the PIs will also collect information on a control group in order to be able evaluate the effectiveness or otherwise of the Workshop.  This Workshop will contribute to the development of a strong and diverse Economics profession in the U.S., thus contributing the U.S.' leadership in economic science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ People of color (in particular, African Americans and Latino/Hispanic Americans) are under-represented in the Economics profession relative to their population share in the U.S. The participation rate of researchers from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in NSF-funded research activities in economics is even much lower than African/Hispanic American representation in the Economics profession.    This workshop had four main goals:   Increase the number and quality of proposals submitted by research-active faculty in underrepresented groups, mainly at HBCUs in the southern United States. Enhance information networks, particularly with regard to grant applications and awards management, at universities seeking to boost grant activity. Engage university administrators such as Chairs, Deans and Provosts with the purpose of developing strategies for supporting faculty research, particularly at teaching-intensive institutions.  Improve relationships between NSF Program Officers (POs) and underrepresented researchers, potentially broadening the scope of topics in which the program invests.   Consistent with the above goals, ten faculty-mentees from underrepresented groups attended the workshop to receive advice on (a) potential proposal ideas; (b) the grant proposal, awards, and management process; and (c) general career advice. Seven faculty-mentors attended the workshop and mentees were assigned to these mentors based on fields of interest. Finally, six administrators attended the workshop and mainly participated in the general instructional sessions, conducted by the workshop organizers and four NSF Program Directors.    The agenda and main activities for the workshop are available at https://wbpep.weebly.com.  Overall, participants reported positive experiences from the workshop. Specifically:    Mentees indicated that they appreciated learning about funding opportunities that are specific to HBCUs.  Meeting the NSF Program Directors allowed mentees to feel more comfortable contacting NSF in the future to inquire about funding opportunities. Two mentees continued working with mentors after the workshop to develop proposals. Mentees planned to (a) establish a stronger relationship with the NSF (e.g. by reading "Dear Colleague Letters"); (b) participate in economics conferences; (c) seek more feedback from POs to improve their proposals; and (d) more frequently discuss their research ideas with senior and junior colleagues/researchers. At least one mentee submitted a proposal during the spring 2018 competition.   In conclusion, the workshop seems to have positively impacted mentees? aspirations, plans, and actions.  In the long term, more grant applications and awards to underrepresented faculty are more likely to impact underserved communities.  In addition, there is a greater opportunity for underrepresented students to get involved in research projects, thus leading to much needed diversity in the Economics profession as well as STEM disciplines more generally. An additional benefit of the workshop is that university administrators found a greater understanding of what it takes for their faculty to pursue grants funding and how beneficial these opportunities can be for their respective departments and universities.
