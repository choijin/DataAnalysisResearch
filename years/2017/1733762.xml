<AbstractNarration>Dr. Evan Peacock and Dr. Brenda Kirkland, Mississippi State University, along with Dr. Virginie Renson, University of Missouri, will undertake research to test a new method for tracing past human population movements and trade networks. Understanding ancient demographic trends and economic links is key for unraveling the history of any particular area. How interconnected were settlements in the past? Where were goods produced, and how did they flow from market to consumer? Did particular settlements gain prominence due to an ability to control the flow of goods? How do ancient population movements relate to the historically known distribution of Native American or other descendant groups? Interest in such topics has grown as new instruments for chemically analyzing artifacts have been developed. For example, archaeologists chemically analyze ancient pottery sherds using a variety of methods and try to match them to clay samples taken in the field, to determine where the pottery clay was originally obtained. While this approach has produced some exciting results, it is complicated by a number of factors. Many different clay beds can occur over a small area, a clay bed can be chemically homogenous over a very large area, or potters may have mixed different clays together when making pottery. Addressing this problem is necessary if the promise of ceramic sourcing for addressing questions of anthropological and historical import is to be more fully realized. The research will contribute to understanding the prehistory of United States Native Americans and serve to inform Americans on an important part of the country's past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An alternative to chemically sourcing pottery clay is to analyze other materials mixed with the clay by potters; such extra materials are called "temper." Beginning about AD 1000, crushed freshwater mussel shell was used as pottery temper over a huge expanse of eastern North America. As freshwater mussels grow, they build the chemical signature of the stream waters they inhabit into their shells. Shells from different drainages therefore are chemically distinct. By chemically comparing shells discarded as food waste with temper from pottery at different sites, archaeologists theoretically can pinpoint the precise stream, or even stream segment, where the pottery was made. Dr. Peacock and his colleagues will test this new method by analyzing shells and shell-tempered pottery recovered from several sites in the Yazoo Basin of Mississippi, a vast landscape drained by many different streams that connected the mid-continent with the Gulf of Mexico and provided ready travel routes along which pots or other artifacts may have been traded centuries ago. Analysis will be done using an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer, for which only small amounts of shell or shell temper are needed. The use of individual elements, such as isotopes of Strontium, to refine the method, also will be explored. As a particular archaeological test case, pottery previously identified as stylistically "exotic" and discarded shells from the Lake George site, a massive, ca. 1,000 year-old settlement in Yazoo County, Mississippi, will be analyzed. If successful, this method should be applicable to any place in the world where shell-tempered pottery was produced.</AbstractNarration>

Sherman</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Ancient pottery is found all around the world, having been made in some places for over ten thousand years. Archaeologists are interested in pottery because vessel shapes and decorations change over time, providing an important tool for dating sites. Pottery also was used for a variety of purposes, including cooking, storage, and trade in liquid and perishable materials. While scholars reconstruct ancient trade routes by chemically analyzing pottery clays, such efforts are complicated by a number of factors, such as different clays being mixed together when making a pot. Scientists therefore continue to seek new ways of determining where ceramic vessels were made.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One kind of pottery is shell-tempered. Temper refers to materials added to the clay, as is done with bone china. For shell-tempered pottery, artisans crushed the shells of clams, oysters, or other shellfish and mixed the small pieces of shells with clay. In eastern North America, pottery tempered with crushed freshwater mussel shell became common starting about one thousand years ago. This provides an opportunity to trace ancient trade routes using the chemical content of the shell temper particles.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Freshwater mussels live in rivers and streams and were an important food source for Native Americans for thousands of years. Mussels build their shells from calcium carbonate taken up from the water. In the process, they incorporate other elements into their shells. Because different streams drain different areas of bedrock and soils, water chemistry varies by stream. Shell chemistry thus provides a &ldquo;fingerprint&rdquo; that theoretically can be used to determine where shell-tempered pottery was made.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To test this idea, researchers from Mississippi State University and the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) obtained shells and pottery fragments from twelve different archaeological sites from the Yazoo Basin of western Mississippi and surrounding areas. These specimens were analyzed using a device called an <em>inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer</em>, a &ldquo;weighing scale&rdquo; for atoms and molecules.

Analysis of shells from the ca. 1,200-year-old Kinlock site, an ancient village now in an agricultural field in Sunflower County, Mississippi shows that shells from the plow zone are more chemically intact than shells deeper in the site, where agricultural residues perch against a clayey subsoil, creating a chemical &ldquo;bath&rdquo; that affects the shell specimens.
