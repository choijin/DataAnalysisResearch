<AbstractNarration>The IEEE Security &amp; Privacy Symposium is a top-tier venue for cybersecurity and privacy research, and has been for much of its 36-plus-year history. Student attendance at S&amp;P is an important part of graduate education in cybersecurity. The 2018 Symposium will consist of approximately 60 technical papers and  Systematization of Knowledge papers, which provide valuable background to students who are learning the literature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides travel support to encourage participation in this IEEE Symposium and its Student Program Committee by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience. Organizers encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As the flagship conference for computer security research, the Symposium was a great success and yet again provided a premiere venue for the exchange of ideas between the best security and privacy researchers, developers, and practitioners.  For many years, we have been using donations to help support travel costs for highly talented students who otherwise may not be able to participate in the Symposium. In particular this travel award is supporting two events: student attendance to the Student PC meeting in New York (in Google's offices in Manhattan), and student attendance to the main symposium and the associated workshops.  With this particular travel grant was able to support the travel expenses of 2 and 8 US-based students for the Student PC meetings for the 2018 and 2019 (respectively) IEEE S&amp;P in New York city, 17 US-based students to attend the 2018 IEEE S&amp;P conference and workshops and 11 US-based students to attend the 2019 IEEE S&amp;P conference and workshops.    Participation in symposia like this is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work in the field. The support requested in this proposal enabled the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy.  Identifying which students will be given travel support to attend the Student PC meeting and the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy was done by the Student PC chair and by the Student travel committee.  The advertised criteria for selecting awardees is the following:  Awards were determined by a committee of volunteers participating in the  organization of the Symposium and the Workshops, and chaired by the Student Travel Chairs. Preference will be given to students working on security and privacy, students who can show evidence of financial need to attend the symposium or workshops, students from institutions not traditionally represented at the conference, and students  from diverse backgrounds.  In order to ensure a diverse pool of awardees to the symposium, we will provide travel awards to at most one student per advisor, and at most two students from the same institution. In addition, we will not provide awards to students who have received a previous travel award from the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy in the last three years. These conditions, however, do not apply for workshop travel grants.  The amount of support provided to each student was on average $1200. This amount covered a portion of the student’s travel (economy airfare), lodging for up to three nights and conference registration.
