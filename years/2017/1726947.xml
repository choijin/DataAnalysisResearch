<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Programs. Professor Scott Reed from University of Colorado Denver-Downtown Campus and colleague Liliya Vugmeyster have acquired a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer with solid state capabilities. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance.  In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for studying the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the changes in interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is important to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, forensics and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students via independent student research and traditional academic coursework as well as researchers and master's students. The spectrometer is used by several programs that cater to underrepresented minority populations. Examples are Colorado Undergraduate Summer Program (CUSP), Graduate Experiences for Multicultural Students (GEMS), Building Research Achievement in Neuroscience (BRAiN), Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship, LabCoats, Research Initiative for Scientific Enhancement (RISE), Maximizing Access to Research Careers (MARC U-STAR), Student Cancer Research Fellowship and Summer Undergraduate Minority Mentoring in Translational Science (SUMMiT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NMR spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. It may impact research efforts on the preparation of photo-releasable lipid probes, studies of structure-function relationships of modified RNA, and exploration of near-infrared self-illuminating nanoparticles for in vivo optical imaging of tumors. The instrumentation is also used for studying structural mechanisms of calcium inhibited C2 domains, exploring the role of interfacial interactions in the survival of unfrozen water in Antartic soils, and studying the mechanistic nature of protein dynamics transitions. The spectrometer benefits investigations on the effects of lipid interactions on internal dynamics of amyloid-beta fibrils, on phase transitions in liquid-crystalline elastomers, and on applications of solid state 14-nitrogen and 17-oxygen NMR to natural organic matter.</AbstractNarration>
