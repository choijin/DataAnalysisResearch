<AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation award funds Student Travel Fellowships for US students attending SIGMOD 2017, the 2017 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data. The Student Fellowships helps cover the travel costs for US students, making it possible for them to attend the conference and discuss and disseminate their work. The conference also provides an opportunity for them to interact with future national and international scientific collaborators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SIGMOD conference has a dynamic and comprehensive program for publication, education, and interaction, including research papers, tutorials, panels, industrial papers, technical demonstrations, and undergraduate research papers. The program also includes workshops that demand dedicated coverage due to their relevance to the current data management research and development, industrial exhibits, and keynote talks by leaders in academia and industry.  All these activities provide a unique opportunity for students to share their knowledge, experience, and research work with internationally recognized researchers from both academia and industry.</AbstractNarration>

SIGMOD is a premier conference in Computer Science focusing on different aspects of databases and data management. This travel award was used to reimburse the airfare and lodging expenses of the students up to a certain amount. These students also received free registration supported by ACM SIGMOD. While choosing the awardees, special attention was given to female and other underrepresented groups &ndash; the 24 awardees included 10 female students and 1 Hispanic/Latino student. Out of the 24 awardees, 22 students had papers or participated in an event in the conference (the two main conferences SIGMOD and PODS, several co-located workshops, student research competition, programming contest, etc.); the remaining 2 students served as volunteers. Many of these students presented their papers in the conference. In addition, the students could attend the talks and tutorials in the conference, had networking opportunities with researchers from academia/industry and with other students from across the world, and could participate in various recruitment activities. There were also events like student research competition, new researcher symposium, and a programming contest. All these activities contributed to the professional development of the students supported by this award.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/30/2018<br>      Modified by: Sudeepa&nbsp;Roy</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
