<AbstractNarration>This proposal supports a workshop on U.S. and South Korean collaboration in the area of robotics, specifically humanoid robots that collaborate with people.  International collaboration is important for keeping U.S. researchers abreast of the latest technological developments around the world, which have impact on our quality of life, quality of work, and quality of education.  The workshop will be held in conjunction with the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), in Vancouver, Canada, September 2017.  The focus of the workshop is to keep abreast of latest developments in robotics research, communicate the benefits of the U.S. environment supporting leading edge innovation, and begin a ?match-making? process to connect U.S. and South Korean robotics researchers.  The goal is to develop a sustainable model for international collaboration, where the benefits exceed the added administrative burdens typical of such collaborations.  Innovative approaches both during and after the workshop will be employed in order to develop and nurture nascent research collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
