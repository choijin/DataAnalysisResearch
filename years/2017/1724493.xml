<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a novel approach towards producing high sensitivity, fast response, ultra-low power consumption, low cost, and highly thermal stable UV sensors. UV sensors have wide ranging markets from industrial, manufacturing, health, to consumer applications, and therefore have significant potential for societal and economic impact. The general public will benefit from the significant reduction in the capital and recurring cost of UV sensor technologies brought by the innovation. The technology has the potential to impact the UV sensor industry by providing lower power consumption, wider operation temperature ranges, and the potential for flexible device embodiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will enable customer discovery for a core technology that could potentially impact the ultraviolet (UV) sensor industry. Due to large surface-to-volume ratio and reduced dimensionality of the active area, Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanostructures have been shown to have high photon conductance, which leads to high sensitivity of the device performance. Utilizing the Schottky contact instead of conventional Ohmic contact in device fabrication, the sensitivity and response time of ZnO UV nanosensors have been greatly improved. In addition, the device can be deposited on silicon as well as flexible substrates. The characteristics of the ZnO UV nanosensor (i.e. performance metrics, system integration, packaging, form factors, etc.) will be aligned with current and future customer needs, while at the same time, a business model will be explored for this novel technology.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We have successfully developed ZnO UV nanosensors, which show ultra-sensitive, fast-response (~ 0.8 s), low-power consumption (operation voltage &lt; 1 V), low-cost, and can be deposited on flexible substrates. This project was to conduct customer discovery to better understand the desired features, form factors, costs/ROI, etc., to benchmark ZnO UV nanosensor and identify the potential markets.</p> <p>Two target markets have been focused on in this project. The first one is flame detectors/monitors. It is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6% between 2015 and 2020, and will reach $3.2 Billion by 2020. We have interviewed 80+ flame detector/monitor manufacturers, burner manufacturers, burner management manufacturers, sales representatives, distributors, and end users, such as: Texas Instruments, Emerson, Forney, Photonics, Det-Tronics, Spectrex, American Cancer Society, Sensor Electronic Technology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, GE Aviation, NextFelx, Parker Industrial Boiler, CleaverBrooks, Catapult, GDS Corporation, FireEye, et. al. There are several flame detector/monitor technologies currently available in the market such as single UV, single IR, dual IR/UV, IR3, and multi IR. The main advantages of UV flame detectors/monitors are: (1) respond to any type of flame; (2) response time could be down to millisecond (ms). The main disadvantages of UV flame detectors/monitors are: (1) false alarm, especially in outdoor applications due to the UV light in natural environment; (2) the high temperature stability is weak: the device only be functional with temperature up to 85 &deg;C, which limits the accuracy of detection in burners; (3) the device lifetime is about 1 year, which requires replacement every year, cost ~ $1k/each replacement. Also, there are two types of flame detectors/monitors in terms of UV sensing: wide bandgap semiconductors such as GaN and SiC, which the price is very low (down to ~ $10/device); the other type is the old technology vacuum tube and the device stability is very good. Based on the interviews and the specifics of our ZnO UV nanosensors, we have determined the first target market is flame detection/monitors, and the Business Model Canvas (BMC) of ZnO UV nanosensors for flame detection/monitoring is shown in Fig. 1.</p> <p>The second target market is wearable electronic devices which has UV monitoring function. We have conducted 30+ interviews covering wearable electronic device manufacturers, medical doctors, skin cancer experts, and consumers. The current market available UV pads for consumers are based on UV light induced color change, which are very inexpensive. However, UV pads are not accurate and can&rsquo;t record actual UV exposure. Also, majority of the consumers we interviewed prefer to use sunscreen or stay indoor when UV is strong. As a result, there is a great demand for UV monitoring with high sensitivity and accuracy. However, there are big challenges for this market such as regulatory issues, measurement issue, standards, and low price point. With the interview information as well as specifics of our ZnO UV nanosensors, the BMC for wearable electronic devices is shown in Fig. 2.</p> <p>Also, we have analyzed the multiple go-to-market (GTM) channels for flame detectors/monitors, as shown in Fig. 3. As a UV sensor manufacturer, we first purchase materials from suppliers such as Sigma Aldrich and semiconductor wafer/package companies.&nbsp; After we fabricate and test ZnO UV nanosensors, we will send the devices to Engineering Manufacture Services (EMS) such as Jabil and Foxconn to package the devices in order to meet the customer requirements. Next we will sell the packaged UV sensors to burner integrators such as Forney&rsquo;s Corporation, or to burner management system (BMS) manufacturers such as Honeywell. These companies will integrate our UV sensors to their commercial available systems and provide us with feedback. For the sales, we can go directly to our customers, or go through manufacturer representatives and distributors. Eventually, our UV sensors, as part of the commercial available flame detectors/monitors reach the end users including but not limited to burner users and oil/gas/chemical industry.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/28/2018<br>      Modified by: Zhong&nbsp;L&nbsp;Wang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1724493/1724493_10469458_1538145500126_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1724493/1724493_10469458_1538145500126_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1724493/1724493_10469458_1538145500126_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Business Model Canvas (BMC) of ZnO UV nanosensors for flame detection/monitoring.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Zhong Lin Wang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zhong&nbsp;L&nbsp;Wang</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1724493/1724493_10469458_1538145550184_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1724493/1724493_10469458_1538145550184_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1724493/1724493_10469458_1538145550184_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Business Model Canvas (BMC) of ZnO UV nanosensors for wearable electronic devices.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Zhong Lin Wang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zhong&nbsp;L&nbsp;Wang</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1724493/1724493_10469458_1538145599681_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1724493/1724493_10469458_1538145599681_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1724493/1724493_10469458_1538145599681_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Multiple go-to-market (GTM) channels of ZnO UV nanosensors for flame detector/monitor.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Zhong Lin Wang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zhong&nbsp;L&nbsp;Wang</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
