<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Programs. Professor David Vosburg from Harvey Mudd College and colleagues Adam Johnson and Katherine Van Heuvelen have acquired a console and probes to upgrade a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the study of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students via independent student research and traditional academic coursework. Students work on these projects year long and especially during the summer months. The spectrometer is also used by chemistry faculty and students at Mount San Antonio College as well as researchers at the local biotech company Synedgen which is a regular sponsor of undergraduate research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of an NMR console and probes is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as: (a) synthesizing natural products biomimetically, (b) preparing molecular cages via self-assembly, (c) exploring catalytic asymmetric hydroamination, (d) studying bio-inspired catalysts for dechlorination reactions, (e) using sensitizer-dependent injection into zinc oxide nanotube photoanodes for solar cells, (f) characterizing atmospheric secondary organic aerosols, (g) studying Claisen rearrangements of amide-acetals of substituted gamma- and delta-lactams, (h) preparing tunable nanocomposite gas separation membranes and (i) synthesizing natural polymer derivatives.</AbstractNarration>
