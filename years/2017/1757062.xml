<AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (RE) site in Physics at the University of Rochester.  The site supports twelve undergraduate students per year for ten weeks of summer research in topics including Physics, Astrophysics and Optics.  Many of the research projects in which students have participated are attracting growing interest from the scientific community. The faculty's research group's combination of enthusiasm and discipline motivates students and contributes to the quality of their research. Individual guidance and mentoring fosters each student's skill at navigating the world of science - giving talks, writing articles - and as well as his or her intellectual development as an independent researcher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the REU is to offer undergraduate students nationwide the opportunity to take part in Physics, Astrophysics and Optics including: particle/nuclear/cosmic ray physics, optics/quantum optics, condensed matter/biological physics, and plasma physics/astrophysics/geophysics. Each student works with a faculty adviser on a specific project within the context of the overall research focus of the group. The program includes a mini-course in Linux/Unix. REU students attend weekly presentations by University faculty, tours of University research facilities, and social outings and may also take part in the Department's summer outreach activities. The program concludes with a student symposium, at which each student speaks on his/her research project; students submit written abstracts and reports of their research experiences. Students are strongly encouraged to continue their projects toward publication and are eligible for additional support to present their results at national student and professional conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
