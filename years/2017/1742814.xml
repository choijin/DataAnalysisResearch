<AbstractNarration>The biological, physical and socials sciences are being overwhelmed by the large amounts of data: i) from new generations of instruments and sensors, with rapidly decreasing costs and rapidly increasing resolutions; ii) the creation of large scale instrumented environments; and iii) the use of high performance simulation that produces large datasets. Data Science is an emerging field that is developing to meet this challenge, which integrates domain knowledge from the relevant disciplines with statistics/mathematics and computer science/informatics. Translational data science is a new term that is being used for an emerging field that applies new data science principles, techniques and technologies to challenging scientific problems that hold the promise of having an important impact on human or societal welfare. The term is also used when data science principles, techniques and technologies are applied to problems in different domains in general, including,but not restricted to,science and engineering research.  The team will hold the first Workshop on Translational Data Science (TDS 17) in Chicago on June 26-27, 2017 as a first, important step to foster the creation of the discipline of translational data science. This workshop will bring together about 50 scientists from academia, industry, foundations, and federal funding agencies to discuss important issues, challenges and opportunities, including the scope of translational data science.  A key outcome from the workshop will be a white paper about translational data science.  Another key outcome will be planning for future workshops around translational data science and the beginning of the creation of Translational Data Science Community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The biological, physical and socials sciences are being overwhelmed by large amounts of data being produced new generations of scientific instruments, sensors, and simulations.  Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that integrates domain knowledge from relevant domains with statistics / mathematics and computer science / informatics to address, in part, the problems created by the large amounts of data now available to these fields.  Translational data science (TDS) is a new term that is being used for an emerging field that applies new data science principles, techniques and technologies to challenging research problems that hold the promise of having an important impact on human or societal welfare.  The term is also used when data science principles, techniques and technologies are applied to problems with the results that not only apply to the problem itself, but also improves our fundamental understanding of the relevant field.  Note that with this second definition data science principles, techniques, and technologies can also be applied to the field of data science itself.   The term is in part motivated by the term translational medicine for the biomedical research discipline whose aim is to expedite the discovery of new diagnostic tools and treatments by using a multi-disciplinary, collaborative, "bench-to-bedside" approach.  Broadly speaking, we see the discipline of translational data science as complementing "pure" data science whose goal is to develop new algorithms, methods and technologies for working with big data with a discipline whose goal is translate these data science advances to specific advances to one or more research disciplines or to one or more human or societal problems.  We held a workshop in Chicago on June 26-27, 2017 that was attended by approximately 38 researchers from academia, federal agencies, and industry to discuss the emerging field of Translational Data Science.  The workshop was organized into sessions and break out groups addressing the following topics:     What is translational data science? What are some success stories in translational data science? What are some models for translation that have proved successful? What are some research challenges, opportunities, and high priority areas in translational data science? How can we teach translational data science?                    Last Modified: 01/10/2018       Submitted by: Robert L Grossman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
