<AbstractNarration>This project is funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program in the NSF Chemistry Division. Dr. Gary Guillet of Georgia Southern University's Armstrong Campus investigates strategies to synthesize compounds containing three metal ions and two metal-metal bonds with the atoms and bonds arranged linearly. The study of metal-metal bonding is an area of intense research because of the unique properties of compounds that contain this type of bond. While there are many examples of compounds that contain two metal ions with a metal-metal bond between them, there is a dearth of compounds containing a larger number of metals with metal-metal bonding. Even more rare are compounds with metal-metal bonds that are linked in series. Dr. Guillet investigates the factors that affect the strength of the bonding, and the physical properties and reactivity of the compounds. This adds significantly to the understanding of metal-metal bonding within multi-metallic compounds and impacts fields such as molecular wire design. The student body of the Armstrong campus is diverse group and many students are minorities underrepresented in the chemical sciences. About 37% of the chemistry and biochemistry majors are first generation college students. In order to close the education gap in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, it is critical to expand access to research experiences for students. Institutional data clearly shows that students graduate faster if they participate in undergraduate research compared to their peers. With funding from this grant, Dr. Guillet is mentoring and promoting these students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dimetallic complexes of transition metals are abundant and thoroughly studied. However, extending these compounds by addition of a third metal forming linear, trimetallic, complexes is synthetically challenging and there is a dearth of these complexes. Most examples that exist of trimetallic complexes are supported using the ligand dipyridylamine. Novel trimetallic complexes are required to study the properties of these extended systems and new ligands are needed for this purpose. Dr. Guillet is investigating the synthesis of a novel ligand family designed to support trimetallic complexes of Fe, Co, and Ni. The physical properties of these complexes are being examined using multinuclear NMR, X-ray diffractometry, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and IR spectroscopy. Dr. Guillet is also investigating the reactivity using electrochemistry as well as synthetic redox reactions. Work on this project is expanding the understanding of ligand characteristics necessary to support trimetallic complexes and elucidate the characteristics of metal-metal communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
