<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be to improve the efficiency with which cellulosic ethanol can be produced. Cellulosic ethanol is produced from agricultural waste products, like corn stalks, switchgrass, and wheat straw, rather than from corn like traditional ethanol. It is then used largely as a fuel additive, though other industries use ethanol on smaller scales. Improving cellulosic ethanol production is part of the United States' Renewable Fuel Standards Goals set in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. These improvements are vital since the increased demand for ethanol from corn has contributed to rises in food prices.  In addition, cellulosic ethanol produces fewer greenhouse gases than corn ethanol production, and reduces pressure for water use and land change erosion. However, despite these advantages, the vast majority of ethanol produced in the US is from corn, simply because cellulosic ethanol is considerably more expensive to produce. The costs reductions from the process developed here will potentially be of considerable commercial value to existing cellulosic ethanol producers, as well as potentially to corn ethanol producers who may switch production methods if costs become comparable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project further develops a technology that stabilizes genomes of metabolically active yeast. A key step in cellulosic ethanol production, co-metabolism of five- and six-carbon sugars, can be achieved by yeast hybrids consisting of species that ferment one or the other carbon source. But yeast hybrids created by protoplast fusion are genetically unstable, being subject to rapid segregational loss of one or the other parental genome. Preliminary data indicate that genomic instability can be prevented by encapsulating hybrids in calcium alginate and can produce ethanol at near-theoretical yields for weeks on end. This technology has a wide variety of potential applications. It has already been used to study aging, and could be further used to improve plasmid retention in the production of diverse synthetic biology products, including insulin, anti-malarial drugs, and industrially important solvents and lubricants. Current research is focused on optimizing this method for cellulosic ethanol production, with plans in place to subsequently address these other markets.</AbstractNarration>

The first major outcome of this project was the completion of our customer discovery interviews. During the course of this NSF iCorps award, we conducted over 100 customer discovery interviews with experts in the ethanol industry in diverse locations such as Crescentino, Italy; Straubing, Germany; Thomaston, Georgia, USA; and Omaha, Nebraska, USA. During these interviews, we came to the realization that our product was a better fit for the conventional ethanol market as opposed to the cellulosic ethanol market. Our decision to pivot our research to focus more heavily on conventional ethanol was based on three main considerations: a) Relative market sizes. Nearly 17 billion gallons of ethanol was produced last year in the United States, but only about 3.3M of those gallons were cellulosic ethanol, b) Existing solutions available internationally. During interviews we conducted with cellulosic ethanol plants in Italy and Germany we became aware of technologies their plants are utilizing which are not yet available in the United States. These alternate technologies also allow for co-fermentation of 5- and 6-carbon sugars, and thus directly compete with our solution. These technologies will likely reach the US in less than 3 years, and c) Underlying value propositions with existing ethanol production methods. In conversations with conventional ethanol plant managers, we realized that our product had a value proposition for them that we had not previously recognized. Managers at conventional ethanol plants also have funds available to trial new products that are currently absent for cellulosic ethanol plants.</p> <p>The second major outcome of this project was the application of our research to conventional ethanol production, by testing how cell encapsulation affects yield. Specifically, over a period of 49 days we measured ethanol yield in fed-batch cultures that used one of four different encapsulation matrices. We compared our results to ethanol yield in planktonic cell culture, the fermentation method most widely used in current biorefineries (Figure 1). We found one encapsulation method that produced significantly more ethanol from the same amount of substrate than any existing alternative. That method produces up to 95% more ethanol, normalized to biomass, by limiting cellular reproduction in the fermentation step of production. Further, yeast cells using our method were thermotolerant and exhibited similar viability to cells in conventional planktonic culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Broader impacts </em>We expect this research to be of broad interest to society due to role ethanol plays as an alternative fuel. Ethanol is a readily available fuel source that can help relieve demand on gasoline via blending. Currently, all 2001 and newer vehicles, which comprise 97% of vehicles on the road, can safely use up to 15% ethanol blends (E15) [1]. Ethanol is preferable over gasoline because it can be renewably sourced from corn, has an increased octane rating, and emits 19-48% fewer greenhouse gases [2]. The advantages of ethanol are recognized to the degree that government mandates ensure that all gasoline in the United States is at least a 10% blend with ethanol.</p> <p>Our method allows ethanol producers to make up to 95% more ethanol per gram yeast from the same amount of corn by limiting cellular reproduction in the fermentation step of production. This drop-in technology will further reduce the price of bioethanol, increasing the likelihood that it will be blended at ever-higher rates with gasoline; indeed, year-round E15 blends were recently approved. This invention likewise has the potential to advance the United States? national strategic goals related to energy security. Thus, our method of ethanol production stands to offer significant benefits for the fuel industry through more economically-sustainable and environmentally-friendly methods of fuel production.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Intellectual Merit </em>Our method allows for more ethanol to be produced from the same amount of substrate by improving the fermentation step of this process. Specifically, this project offers a method of uncoupling reproduction from metabolism, which reduces biomass accumulation and allows for higher production yields of ethanol. The uncoupling of metabolism from reproduction has already been utilized to study aging in the yeast model, and could further be applied to help discover anti-aging compounds. This method further offers a mechanism for improving genetic stability. The enhanced genetic stability this method offers would be of interest to a range of other biotechnology products, since many commercially valuable compounds, like insulin, are produced on plasmids. These plasmids tend towards instability over time, a problem which our preliminary results show can be overcome by encapsulation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p class="EndNoteBibliography">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wojdyla, B. 2013; Available from: <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/hybrid-electric/a11687/four-things-to-know-about-e15-15096134/">http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/hybrid-electric/a11687/four-things-to-know-about-e15-15096134/</a>.</p> <p class="EndNoteBibliography">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Center, A.F.D., 2017.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/04/2019<br>      Modified by: Frank&nbsp;Rosenzweig</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743464/1743464_10490315_1556996282213_NSFOutcomesFigure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743464/1743464_10490315_1556996282213_NSFOutcomesFigure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Ethanologenesis in fed-batch yeast cultires"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743464/1743464_10490315_1556996282213_NSFOutcomesFigure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Ethanologenesis in fed-batch yeast cultires"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Ethanologenesis in encapsulated cells is consistently greater than in planktonic cells, regardless of matrix type</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jordan Gulli</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Frank&nbsp;Rosenzweig</div> <div class="imageTitle">Ethanologenesis in fed-batch yeast cultires</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
