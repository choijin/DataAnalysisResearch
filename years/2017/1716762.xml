<AbstractNarration>Most stars form in dense clusters, the largest of which contain many millions of stars.   Since star clusters can exist for many billions of years, they are believed to contain large numbers of compact objects, such as black holes and neutron stars that formed a long time ago as the remnants of dead massive stars.  This research program at Northwestern University will use state-of-the-art supercomputer simulations to study the formation and evolution of these compact objects in a variety of star cluster environments.  The main focus will be on the production of close binaries containing two black holes, which can eventually merge and produce potentially detectable bursts of gravitational waves.  The development of parallel computing techniques and new algorithms will have broad relevance and be of interest to scientists outside of physics and astronomy.  The astrophysics research will be student-oriented and senior students will help train new team members, including undergraduate students.  Education and public outreach activities are also planned that will take advantage of the facilities at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, and at Dearborn Observatory on the Northwestern University campus in Evanston. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address a number of key questions concerning the formation and dynamical evolution of compact objects (black holes and neutron stars) in dense star clusters. As they experience friction against the background of lighter stars, massive compact objects are expected to rapidly concentrate in the dense inner cores of clusters, where the rates of dynamical interactions are very high. These interactions can both produce binaries and tighten their orbits. In some cases, through successive mergers, perhaps helped by accretion of gas, an intermediate mass black hole could eventually be formed.   Many of the objects formed by these processes are potential multi-messenger sources.  The project will use a hybrid approach of combining Monte Carlo and N-body codes to optimize computing speed, accuracy and realism and overcome the dynamical range problem of simulating very large star clusters in which most of the interesting dynamics happens in a relatively small, high-density central region.   A library of more than an thousand new cluster models will be made publicly available at the conclusion of the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Most stars form in dense clusters, the largest of which can contain up to many millions of stars. The masses of stars born in these clusters cover a broad range and the most massive ones (with masses between roughly 10 and 100 times that of our Sun) evolve quickly, ending their lives in as little as a few million years and leaving behind black holes or neutron stars as remnants. The star clusters themselves, however, can continue to live for many billions of years, and indeed the globular clusters seen in all galaxies are thought to contain some of the oldest stars in the Universe. Therefore, many of the star clusters observed today can contain large numbers of black holes and neutron stars formed a long time ago. This investigation used state-of-the-art supercomputer simulations to obtain a better understanding of the formation and evolution of all compact stellar remnants in a variety of star cluster environments. In particular, results showed how dynamical interactions in dense star clusters can produce tight binaries containing two black holes, which eventually merge and produce bursts of gravitational radiation detectable by instruments like the NSF-funded LIGO detectors. Additionally, stellar dynamics can also produce binaries in which a neutron star accretes from an ordinary stellar companion; these can become bright X-ray sources and rapidly spinning pulsars. While all compact binaries are potentially detectable sources of gravitational waves, their electromagnetic counterparts potentially include a variety of X-ray and gamma-ray sources, also of great current interest, particularly in the new era of multimessenger astronomy, combining gravitational wave detection with traditional astronomical observations. The comprehensive theoretical models developed as part of this investigation will guide future work and will help astronomers interpret future observational datasets on such high energy phenomena.
