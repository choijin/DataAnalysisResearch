<AbstractNarration>This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Bilingual adults who were exposed to two languages in early childhood vary considerably in the ways in which they learned the two languages and the skill they have as adults to speak and read both languages. Despite the increasing presence of two languages in the US, there is little known about the consequences of variation in early bilingual experience for the minds and brains of adult speakers. With the support of the National Science Foundation, PI Atagi will conduct postdoctoral studies at the University of California, Riverside, a Hispanic Serving Institution that represents the diversity of language experience required to investigate this issue. The planned research examines bilingual college students with a wide range of language and literacy skills to understand how childhood language experiences and literacy shape language learning abilities, cognition, and brain structure. This project asks whether learning to read in both languages in childhood has consequences for later language learning abilities in adulthood and for the brain structures that have been shown to be affected by bilingualism. The growing number of heritage speakers in the US who grew up with a home language other than English makes understanding the significance of these early experiences a high priority for promoting the academic and economic success of a more diverse group of learners. The planned research also contributes to the training of a diverse group of language and cognitive neuroscientists by the inclusion of undergraduate research students, most of whom are themselves bilingual. By identifying how brain structure may vary for individuals who differ in their early language and literacy experiences, the project will also inform our understanding of how the brain adapts to experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adult brain is far more adaptive to new language learning than previously thought. Studies examining language processing show that learning a new language, even as an adult, is a dynamic process that changes the way the native language is processed. However, little is known about the long-term consequences of early language experiences for adult language learning and cognition, and even less is known about how different types of bilingual language experiences, such as literacy in two languages, affect adult learning and cognition. The proposed research exploits cognitive neuroscience methods to examine how early bilingual language experiences and literacy shape later adult language learning, cognition, and brain structure. This study examines and compares bilingual college students who are heritage speakers to early simultaneous bilinguals and English-monolinguals. Heritage speakers are a diverse group of bilinguals, who vary in the skill they have as adults to speak and read both languages. In the first year of the award, the planned research focuses on identifying the language and literacy experiences that have the greatest impact on later adult learning; thus, the planned research initially examines the behavioral consequences of early language and literacy by using a battery of language, literacy, and cognitive measures, as well as a new word learning task. In the second year of the award, a set of structural imaging studies will examine adult learners drawn from those groups and to determine the replicability of the initial findings. Findings from this research will begin to identify the aspects of early bilingual experience that may shape the mind and brain. Though bilingualism has been found to be associated with structural differences in the brain, particularly in cortical thickness, the structural correlates of bilingual literacy are yet unknown. Additionally, by examining literacy, a distinct type of language experience that exposes learners to more varied words and sentence structures than speech, this research begins to disentangle what cognitive and neural consequences early spoken language experience and literacy have for adult bilinguals. If literacy in two languages is found to benefit language learning and cognition in ways distinct from speaking two languages, it may suggest that literacy in both languages should be better supported in bilingual students.</AbstractNarration>
