<AbstractNarration>A fundamental challenge in engineering and science today is that systems contain tremendous numbers of interconnected components with complex interactions.  Examples include communication and sensor networks, high-dimensional medical images, or biological systems such as vast sets of interconnected spiking neurons responding to a large array of stimuli.  Graphical models provide a probabilistic framework for modeling such systems, and contemporary message-passing algorithms lead to computationally feasible operations by decomposing problems on larger systems into smaller ones.  This research develops a broader methodology and new algorithms to address larger classes of more complex nonlinear interconnected systems with potential for great technological impact.  For wider dissemination, this is coupled with educational initiatives including developing courses combining perspectives in signal processing, machine learning, and statistics in the context of modern applications.  An open-source code base will foster cross-disciplinary research in students, educators, and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research combines the power of high-dimensional graphical models with recent advances in random systems theory to tackle a much wider scope of problems than traditional message-passing or linear methods allow.  The investigator addresses the key gaps in scalable estimation and model inference for structured nonlinear systems and develops powerful general algorithms for solving core problems.  Four main objectives address  aspects of this broader goal: (i) systematic general methods for representing systems characterized by arbitrary interconnections of linear and nonlinear components; (ii) computationally scalable message-passing algorithms for estimation; (iii) rigorous quantification of high-dimensional performance; and (iv) validation of the methods on real data, including neurological system identification.  These research thrusts greatly expand the scope of statistical estimation techniques and provide a rigorous approach to large-scale signal processing problems underlying the big data technology of today.</AbstractNarration>

This project sought to develop the theory and methods for learning such complex systems from data.  A particular focus was on understanding cortical networks for sensory processing in the brainusing new neurological measurement technologiesincluding micro-electrocortiography (mu-ECoG) that can now measure large numbers of neurons in parallel.The research was coupled with educational initiatives including developing courses combining perspectives in signal processing, machine learning, and statistics in the context of modern applications.   One of the core tools for the project is graphical models which provide a powerfulprobabilistic framework for modeling networks of systems.  Message-passing algorithms can beapplied to graphical models that lead to computationally efficient learning algorithms by decomposing problems on larger systems into smaller ones.  The research in the projectled to several important advances in the theory and algorithms for these message passing methods.In particular, the work greatly extended the range of models for which message passing methodscould be applied including models with dynamics, feedback connections and multiple layers.The stability of the methods, which was one of the key difficulties of prior methods,was also significantly improved.  In addition, the work provided some of the strongestnew results in inference in multi-layer and deep networks in machine learning.  Deep networks have had tremendous success in modeling complex data such as images and text,but there have been few theoretical results to understand their performance.  The results in this project provide a possible framework for analyzing and optimizing these machine learning tools.  The project also demonstrated several successes in neurological modeling.  For example,we were able to show significant improvement in neural decoding of signals from the ratauditory cortex.   In addition the research, the work was also lead to significant material into a newmachine learning class at UCLA where neural data sets were added to lab exercises.Graduate students had opportunities for professional development from internships at leading companies and summer schools.  The project also contributed to a new conference,Cognitive Computational Neuroscience (CCN), that brings together researchers incognitive science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.
