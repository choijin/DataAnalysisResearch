<AbstractNarration>The Frontiers of Engineering (FOE) Symposia, organized by the National Academy of Engineering, provide emerging engineering leaders from academia, industry, and government laboratories the opportunity to share research insights to facilitate an interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge and research methodologies. The nature of emerging technologies and how they fit together to create products and processes that drive economic growth in an increasingly competitive environment have heightened the need for engineers to understand each other's disciplines and enhance the value in that interaction, particularly among those developing and using these new technologies. The symposia serve as a catalyst to spur engineering innovation and foster collaborative networks of researchers within the United States and between engineers from the United States and partnering countries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for four Frontiers of Engineering (FOE) symposia, to be held in 2017: The German-American Frontiers of Engineering (March 31-April 2, in Evendale, Ohio), China-America Frontiers of Engineering (June 22-24, in Shanghai), US Frontiers of Engineering (September 25-27, in East Hartford, Connecticut), and EU-US Frontiers of Engineering (November 16-18, in Davis, California). Each FOE symposium will focus on topical areas such as Energy Strategies to Power Our Future; Unraveling the Complexity of the Brain; Internet of Things; Managing Water Supply, Treatment, and Delivery in the 21st Century; Gene Editing and Applications; Advanced Manufacturing; and Synthetic Biology. Approximately 100 outstanding young engineers for the U.S. symposium and 30 from each country for the bilateral symposia will participate. Each two and one-half day symposium will include plenary sessions, technical tours, break-out sessions, and opportunities for developing collaborative research partnerships. Sessions will consist of presentations on cutting-edge research, innovations, and emerging research opportunities in engineering fields relevant to the symposium. FOE symposium papers, abstracts, presentation videos, and slides will be made available on the FOE website (www.naefrontiers.org ).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
