<AbstractNarration>What role do religious and ethnic community play in shaping social life in modern urban environments? This research project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, asks in what ways these identities are reshaped by the changing nature of cities themselves. Since the late nineteenth century, many researchers have assumed that urban environments are the antithesis of traditional life, dense worlds of money, markets, and diversity where individuals are atomized and rebuilt into crowds and class-based political movements. Left aside in these accounts is the continued role of urban religious infrastructures in shaping city life. With the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs projecting that urban environments will be home to over two-thirds of the global population by 2050, there is an urgent need for social scientists to reconsider how religious and ethnic forms of community are woven into urban environments, and what role they play in shaping where and how people live, socialize, and experience the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Byron Gray, under the supervision of Dr. Thomas Hansen of Stanford University, will explore what role community identities have in structuring property markets, intra-urban migration, and perceptions of urban space. This research project focuses on the 500-year-old Catholic community of Mumbai, India as a window into these dynamics. Predating the city's development from a Portuguese settlement into India's premier global city, the Mumbai Catholic community presents an ideal case study for examining the nexus between religion and the transformation of urban environments. Indeed, over the past 30 years, many members of this 600,000-strong population have abandoned their traditional neighborhoods in the south of the city for its expanding northern wards, a process that has reshaped Catholics' longstanding relationship with the city and one another. Using a combination of interviews, participant observation, archival work, and demographic mapping, this project will map out the legal and social means through which communities assert control over properties and neighborhoods in Mumbai, and the ritual and social practices through which such neighborhoods are made into meaningful community spaces. In addition to testing the hypothesis that religious and ethnic forms of community often act as key forces shaping property markets and the lived experience of urban residents, the project also aims to understand how community identities are themselves transformed when unsettled from existing spatial arrangements. The findings of this study will not only improve understandings of the social and political dynamics of the world's largest democracy, but also more broadly to urban planners and policymakers interested in the complicated nexus between community and changing urban environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Situated in Mumbai, India, this project uses that city’s Catholic community as a case study for examining how religion, ethnicity, and community shape urban life in South Asia’s largest metropolitan center and other cities in the region.  With over 500 years of accumulated history in the city, Mumbai’s Catholic population has undergone substantial transformations since the 1990s. Over the past three decades, the community’s traditional neighborhoods in the south of the city have shrunk precipitously, while their presence in the northern suburbs has exploded. This geographic shift has coincided with some of the most seismic transformations in Indian politics since Independence, including the rise of Hindu nationalism and the liberalization of the country’s economy. As Mumbai’s real estate market boomed, the city also began to fracture along ethnic and religious lines, with the infamous 1992-93 riots setting militant elements of Mumbai’s Hindu and Muslim communities against one another.  Set against this backdrop, the project set out to address four questions. (1) What has driven the Catholic migration from south to north Mumbai? (2) What social, institutional, and legal resources do Catholics use to defend and control property in such an environment? (3) How do people transform a neighborhood into a place where they have a sense of ownership and belonging? And finally, (4) how have Catholics reacted to increasing communal tensions and the rise of a political movement (i.e. Hindu nationalism) which has not infrequently been associated with anti-Christian rhetoric and violence?  Over the course of almost two years of fieldwork in the city, the researcher addressed these questions through a mixture of ethnographic techniques, including interviews and participant observation with members of the Catholic community, as well as the collection of historical and statistical data gleaned from materials published by Catholic organizations. Splitting his time between neighborhoods in the north and the south of the city, he sought to develop a picture of the dynamics at play in both old and new Catholic neighborhoods.   Based on the collected data, the researcher argues that understanding the contemporary concerns of Mumbai Catholics necessitates situating them within their long history in the city. Indeed, Mumbai’s Catholic population emerged out of conversion efforts undertaken by the Portuguese in the region in the 1600s&mdash;long before the area became a British possession and exploded into the subcontinent’s premier urban center in the mid-1800s. Thanks to the educational opportunities provided by the Church parish system, Mumbai Catholics were able to carve out a successful niche for themselves in middle-class salaried work.  In the 1990s, however, the community’s socio-economic and political position within the city was becoming increasingly tenuous. As India opened to foreign investment and liberalized its economy, real estate prices in Mumbai skyrocketed. At the same time, many Catholics found that salaried work was no longer a guarantee of stable middle-class status. Younger Catholics looking to purchase homes increasingly moved to the north of the city, while older residents weighed the option of cashing in on the increased value of their real estate in the south. Such decisions were aggravated by the fact that an increasing number of Muslims began to shift into Catholic neighborhoods to escape violence from Hindu neighbors elsewhere in the city.  Tensions with newly arrived Muslim residents have fractured Catholic political allegiances. Many Catholics continue to support the multicultural nationalism of the Indian Congress Party and remain concerned about anti-Christian sentiments within the Hindu right. However, an increasingly vocal segment of the community has thrown their support behind Hindu nationalist candidates, arguing the Congress Party has failed to look after their interests.  The researcher argues that where Catholics have succeeded in retaining control over property in south Mumbai, they have done so largely through the mechanism of exclusive housing societies formed in the early 1900s.
