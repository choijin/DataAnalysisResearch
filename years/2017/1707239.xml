<AbstractNarration>This workshop aims to advance knowledge about the causes, consequences, and potential solutions to severe political and societal polarization.  An important contribution is its focus on issues related to polarization in democracies around the world.  The topic is important, as highly-polarized societies pose potential threats to political and social stability.  Democracy is supposed to manage competing interests in a society in a peaceful manner, and provide opportunities for newly-emerging or previously-excluded sectors of the population to strive for and reach political power.  Today, however, a number of democracies are straining to include these new groups without succumbing to the negative consequences often associated with political and societal polarization. The workshop will bring together a diverse group of experts to investigate this question and to develop an interdisciplinary research network on the topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop brings together a number of scholars to examine cases of polarization in democratic governments. It does so by studying democracies cross-nationally, and that represent states with varying levels of political and economic development, as well as varying cleavages (i.e. class, ideology, religion, ethnicity, urban-rural, nationalist-cosmopolitan, elites - people).   This line of inquiry is important, as the conventional wisdom tends to portray established democratic systems as politically stable.  As recent events show, however, democratic systems are susceptible to destabilizing anti-democratic pressures.  These events are increasingly not limited to new democracies in the developing world, but are emerging in more established democracies in the developed west. States have increasingly become divided over issues of nationalism and globalism/integration which may increase such instability.  In the United States, political polarization is reflected in government gridlock, in other parts of the world such polarization can potentially lead to much more destabilizing outcomes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Workshop on Polarized Polities: Causes, Consequences and Solutions award funded an international workshop in Budapest, Hungary in March 2017 gathering a dozen scholars from around the world to discuss their initial draft articles and comparative findings of eleven case studies of severely polarized democracies.  The award also funded an APSA pre-conference in San Francisco in August 2017 bringing together social psychologists with political scientists studying polarization in the U.S. and in comparative politics to exchange ideas and approaches across disciplines and sub-disciplines.  The project resulted in two special journal issues guest-edited by the PI and one of the research collaborators:  Jennifer McCoy and Murat Somer, Guest Editors, Special Issue on Polarization and Democracy: A Janus-faced Relationship with Pernicious Consequences, American Behavioral Scientist, 62:1, January 2018.    Jennifer McCoy and Murat Somer, Guest Editors, Special Issue on Polarizing Polities: A Global Threat to Democracy, Annals of American Academy of Political and Social Sciences, Forthcoming January 2019.   The project is motivated by the observation that as political and societal polarization deepens, democracies are under stress around the world. It examines the complex relationship and causal direction between democracy and polarization and posits three theoretical possibilities: (1) polarization contributes to democratic backsliding and decay, (2) polarization results  from democratic crisis, and (3) polarization contributes to democratic deepening. We find that a common pattern and set of dynamics characterizes severe political and societal polarization in different contexts around the world, with pernicious consequences for democracy. Moving beyond the conventional conceptualization of polarization as ideological distance between political parties and candidates, we offer a conceptualization of polarization highlighting its inherently relational nature and its instrumental political use. Polarization simplifies the normal complexity of politics and social relations by aligning otherwise unrelated divisions in society along a single dimension, emasculating cross-cutting cleavages, and dividing society and politics into two separate, opposing, and unyielding blocs. People increasingly perceive and describe politics and society in terms of "Us" versus "Them."   We find that the politics and discourse of opposition and the social&ndash;psychological intergroup conflict dynamics produced by this alignment are a main source of the risks polarization generates for democracy.  The project posits a set of causal mechanisms linking polarization to harm to democracy: polarizing political discourse exacerbates existing cleavages and grievances, creating Us vs Them dynamics of intergroup conflict and rising affective polarization.  These patterns produce growing perceptions of threat from the "out-party" and thus tolerance for the erosion of democratic norms. In advanced cases of pernicious polarization,  those in government seek to retain power even at the expense of democracy, while those out of power seek to depose those in government even with undemocratic actions.   In the comparison of the eleven case studies from Bangladesh to Hungary to Turkey to Venezuela and the United States, we find that neither the existence of any particular underlying cleavage nor any particular institutional make-up explains the emergence of pernicious polarization.  Instead it arises when polarizing political entrepreneurs exploit existing grievances with Us vs Them discourse to mobilize voters for their own political ends, and opposing political elites reciprocate the polarizing tactics.   We further generate hypotheses toward a theory of the consequences of pernicious polarization for democracy, explaining its various outcomes as a function of polarization around ?formative rifts?; the relative capacity of opposing political blocs to mobilize voters versus having to rely on institutional mechanisms for executive constraint, such as courts and military; and the strategic and ideological aims of the polarizing actors. We conclude with reflections on how to combat pernicious polarization.  The project makes a theoretical contribution to the discipline in providing a new conceptualization of pernicious polarization, identifying the causal mechanisms transforming normal political polarization into pernicious polarization with negative consequences for democracy, and providing the first comparative analysis of dissimilar cases around the world to identify the common patterns.   The project makes a contribution to society in that the identification of the causal mechanisms of pernicious polarization and its consequences for democracy suggest strategies for political actors to prevent its occurrence and to depolarize once it is set in motion.
