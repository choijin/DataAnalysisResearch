<AbstractNarration>The NSF/CBMS series of Regional Research Conferences in the Mathematical Sciences is an ongoing project administered by the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS) and supported continuously by NSF for over 40 years. Each conference features a distinguished lecturer who delivers a sequence of ten lectures on a topic of important current research in one sharply focused area of the mathematical sciences. This award to the American Mathematical Society, with subcontract to CBMS, supports CBMS in its efforts to publicize conferences and administer the resulting publications, fostering greater dissemination of material related to cutting edge-topics and increasing the impact of the conferences in the community. Participation in the individual conferences is supported through separate NSF awards to host institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the NSF/CBMS conference series is to promote research in areas of the mathematical sciences that have recently seen significant new results and that hold promise for continued significant development. A conference achieves that purpose by having the principal lecturer, who is both a major researcher in the area of the conference and an excellent expositor, deliver ten lectures over a five-day period to the participants. The lectures typically cover the recent development of the field and chart possible new directions and open problems. Thus the format of the conferences is primarily educational, but at the research level. Approximately one-half of the participants at these conferences are graduate students and postdoctoral researchers; the conferences give them a good perspective on both the current research and interesting open problems in an important area of the mathematical sciences. The lecturer agrees to prepare a substantial expository monograph based upon his or her lectures. The resulting monograph reaches a broader audience and provides an introduction to readers who wish to begin research in the field. Moreover, the conferences provide host institutions an opportunity to enhance their local research activity.</AbstractNarration>
