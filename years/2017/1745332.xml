<AbstractNarration>This project supports a workshop to identify the scientific need for long-term atmospheric chemistry measurements, especially those relevant to gaining a better understanding of biosphere/atmosphere exchange of trace gases and aerosols. This workshop is in response to a recommendation from the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council in the 2016 report, "The Future of Atmospheric Chemistry Research: Remembering Yesterday, Understanding Today, Anticipating Tomorrow."  The recommendation in the report states,&lt;br/&gt;"NSF should take the lead in coordinating with other agencies to identify the scientific need for long-term measurements and to establish synergies with existing sites that could provide core support for long-term atmospheric chemistry measurements, including biosphere-atmosphere exchange of trace gases and aerosol particles."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together around 100 scientific leaders and scholars who have expertise in the physical, chemical and biological drivers of land-atmosphere exchange and the developers of both observational and modeling approaches that are used to investigate biosphere-atmosphere interactions.  The workshop will also enable an emerging community of early career scientists to meet, network, and exchange ideas with leaders in the field of atmospheric sciences.  The scientific focus areas include the following: (1) micrometeorology and flux measurements, (2) oxidants and reactivity, (3) biogenic secondary organic aerosol, (4) the role of nitrogen, (5) ecophysiological processes controlling bio-atmos exchange, (6) multiscale modeling: cells, canopies, regional, Earth system, (7) feedbacks between atmospheric chemistry and biogeochemistry, and (8) Earth system changes: atmospheric composition, climate, and land use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will take place in October or November of 2017 at the University of California at Irvine.</AbstractNarration>

The workshop participants described lessons learned and successes of long-term networks and discussed the need for long-term measurements of biosphere-atmosphere chemical interactions to address outstanding scientific questions.

The role of this network would be to facilitate data archiving and distribution, develop protocols, support existing sites, and prioritize needs for additional sites.  The workshop participants also identified key science questions that must be examined with long-term measurements of biosphere-atmosphere chemical exchange and interactions.
