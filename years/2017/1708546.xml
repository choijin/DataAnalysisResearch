<AbstractNarration>The Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division funds this research. Professor Nicole L. Snyder of Davidson College investigates a unique carbohydrate, a disaccharide known as trehalose.  This research provides a better understanding of the roles of trehalose and trehalose-based analogs in helping organisms survive environmental stresses such as extreme lack of moisture. The experiments use a combination of advanced synthetic and biochemical techniques to systematically study how the structure of trehalose and trehalose-based analogs influence their protective function. The undergraduate students supported by this work receive valuable training in advanced organic synthesis with an emphasis on carbohydrate chemistry, molecular spectroscopy, and biochemical and biophysical techniques that enhances their education and prepares them for a competitive workforce. In addition, this project supports the development of a new course on the emerging subject of Glycomics at Davidson College. An integral part of the project is also a dynamic outreach program that engages the wider community, including local teachers of the Charlotte Teachers Institute, in appreciating the broad role that carbohydrates play in life processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique properties of trehalose and its ability to preserve a wide array of biomolecules under extreme stress (e.g. desiccation, thermal stress, and oxidation) have captured the attention of scientists for over one hundred years. Recently, several novel trehalose-based oligosaccharides (TOS) with unique structures and preservation properties have been identified, but their specific role in molecular preservation is unknown. The fundamental research in this work uses a multifaceted, systematic approach that combines chemical synthesis, molecular spectroscopy and biochemistry to synthesize and analyze a series of novel trehalose-based oligosaccharides (TOS) and trehalose-based precision glycomacromolecules (TPG) to determine how the unique structure of these compounds correlates to their function. Chemical synthesis is used to provide control over the structure of each compound. Once synthesized, each compound is analyzed by NMR spectroscopy to provide detailed structural information. A combination of biophysical studies, including saturation transfer difference (STD)-NMR, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), is used to study the solution and solid state associations between TOS/TPG analogs and several proteins selected based on their various stabilities towards desiccation. Finally, enzyme kinetics studies measure the function of enzymes stabilized with TOS/TPG to ensure secondary structure integrity as well as function after desiccation. The results from this research may provide a first look at the factors that govern the structure-function relationships of TOS/TPG and how these unique compounds help organisms survive extreme environmental stress.</AbstractNarration>
