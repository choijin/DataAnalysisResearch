<AbstractNarration>This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase student motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by studying the outcomes of a new out-of-school program.  The project will examine whether early high school student participation in an out-of-school, place-based curriculum focusing on systems thinking can increase student interest in STEM fields, self-efficacy, and motivation to pursue STEM degrees or careers.  The proposed project includes three major components: (1) an introduction to systems thinking concepts and a simulation with system thinking modeling in a summer program, (2) an academic year follow-up continuation component, and (3) a spring, student-led Community Summit where students will present their capstone projects.  The project also provides for extensive professional development (PD) of the staff at participating sites.  The curriculum will feature project-based, hands-on use of computer assisted modeling and simulation tools combined with the presentation of student models to the community. The summer and after school curriculum is specifically designed to increase STEM engagement, efficacy, and course and major field choices among high school students from traditionally underrepresented groups. Participant activities will include student modeling experiences; simulation and role play with an interactive curriculum on climate science, a place-based project on a local concern; and a capstone presentation at a community summit. The technology will allow students to gain a deeper understanding of systems thinking and to make better decisions through hands-on exploration and learning in a risk-free experiment while learning how to use (and master) new software, increasing student STEM interest and career pursuits.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Few studies have sought to address the potential impact of systems thinking with low-income and first-generation college students, and fewer studies have sought understanding of its potential impact in increasing STEM interest and careers.  Research in systems thinking suggests that thinking critically and applying critical thinking skills to systems of personal and community interest has the potential to promote greater academic success, including comprehending algebraic concepts and developing problem solving skills. The technology-driven curriculum and associated professional development will be piloted, tested, and improved over three cycles of implementation at four TRIO Talent Search and Upward Bound college access program partner sites.  The research plan will compare outcome measures between students who participated in the project curriculum compared to students who did not. Research instruments will measure student motivation and interest with respect to their use and understanding of systems thinking, their comfort and open interest in STEM, and their identity and capacity to see themselves in a STEM career. Project research and resources will be widely disseminated in professional journals, conference presentations, professional development workshops, and  online distribution of the project curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
