<AbstractNarration>Paragraph 1&lt;br/&gt;Self-determining acts are autonomous acts for living a healthy life that can be practiced at the individual and community level in support of one's health and wellbeing.  Research shows that a lack of self-determination, either at the community level or the individual level, can negatively affect one's health and well-being, which includes educational and economic achievement, as well as the long-term sustainability of social and cultural systems.  This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant project collaborates with an Alaska Native community to explore how Tribal members and nontribal members use self-determination, either individually or as a group, to achieve sustainability and wellbeing.  A deeper understanding of the relationship between self-determination and wellbeing among Alaska Native peoples has the potential to provide insights into the health and wellbeing of other Indigenous Tribes and minority groups in the United States.  This information could be critical to national interests by informing better education, health, and economic policies leading to the health and wellbeing of all people in the nation. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Paragraph 2&lt;br/&gt;This project uses the method of ethnographic futures research to conduct interviews about the future as envisioned by community members in South Central Alaska. The interviewee talks about their optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely futures, ultimately explaining how to get to the most optimistic future.  Working with an Alaska Native community, focus groups and a community meeting will be conducted following the interviews to talk about the ideas identified in the interview optimistic scenarios and how to achieve those ideas. The analysis of this data has the potential to demonstrate what Tribal and nontribal members think the Tribe can do to improve sustainability and wellbeing, and how to achieve those goals. The data has the potential to inform others, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, by demonstrating how utilizing futures research can engage community members in self-determining acts through planning, and potentially making changes, for better outcomes in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The fields of Indigenous Studies, Sustainability Research, and Federal Indian Law are all impacted from this research project. In regards to my method, ethnographic futures research is an innovative way to explore an optimistic future with sustainability and wellbeing in Indigenous communities. It is a method that promotes wellbeing of the interviewees, allows for storytelling, and enables people to talk about the future as if it was a history instead of making projections. This method is a useful way to engage community residents in strategic planning in their communities in culturally appropriate ways in accordance with Indigenous Methodologies. The method begins with an in-depth exploration into the optimistic future. From there the interviewees briefly describe the pessimistic future they want to avoid. Identifying aspects of a pessimistic future helps demonstrate what is so important in the optimistic future and what pitfalls need to be avoided so that the community does not fall into the pessimistic future. The third part of the interview is the most likely future if things keep going on the way they are with nothing very pessimistic or optimistic. This future helps identify what sets the optimistic future apart from the most likely future.

Instead of just asking someone what sustainability and wellbeing mean, having them go into in-depth stories about the future paints a picture of what a sustainable community with wellbeing looks like. This method should be utilized in future work on sustainability and wellbeing as it helps people talk about the definitions in practical life applications. These words are also difficult to define and by allowing someone to tell a story about their community in the optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely futures people end up giving a full definition of sustainability in the community. I asked each interviewee first to define sustainability and then wellbeing.

The interviews and focus groups brought forth the importance of individual and community self-determination as well and these cannot be ignored or minimized. All three types of self-determination need to be considered when discussing how to move a community toward their optimistic future. Individuals bear responsibility to act and be engaged in their communities.
