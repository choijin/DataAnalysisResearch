<AbstractNarration>Fire is a natural ecological process, a land use tool, a destructive force, and an important source of trace gas and aerosol emissions to the atmosphere. Realistic models of fire activity and behavior are necessary for operational fire management, and to understand past and future changes in fire activity. Developing such models, however, requires taking into account vegetation cover, land use practices, fire management capacity, extreme weather, and climate variability, which represent a broad range of temporal and spatial scales. This meeting will provide a forum for researchers working across these scales to interact. The objectives are to summarize the state of the art in fire modeling and prediction, identify areas where significant progress can be made in the next 10 years, and to connect researchers with fire management practitioners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expectation is that decision makers will be provided with an understanding of how well fire can be predicted for the purposes of protecting life and property and maintaining healthy ecosystems, at present and in the future. For the purposes of this conference, decision makers range from operational fire managers needing to predict the behavior of a single wildfire, to health professionals needing to understand possible smoke impacts, to policy-level planners trying to understand how much fire there should be on the landscape. The broad impact of this conference will be to establish a baseline for these stakeholders to understand how well fire activity and its consequences can currently be quantitatively simulated and how this can be improved in the next 10 years.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Fire on the landscape is an important ecological process, a useful tool, and a destructive force; understanding and managing fire now and in the future requires models to predict if a fire will start, how it will spread, and what impact it will have.  With support from the NSF Prevention of and Resilience against Extreme Events program, Columbia University?s Initiative on Extreme Weather and Climate hosted the 2017 Conference on Fire Prediction Across Scales from October 23-25, 2017. The conference brought together leading scientists, fire managers and members of the private sector to discuss the state of the art in fire prediction. Conference attendees heard about the latest in fundamental fire science, from laboratory studies of flame behavior, theoretical studies of firebrand ?spotting? over miles, to supercomputer simulations of wildfires explosive enough to affect the weather.  Fire managers from US government agencies emphasized the importance of connecting predictive models of fire behavior to business needs, but also that their role often came down to "plain ?ol weather forecasting". To that end, speakers from leading US and European weather bureaus updated on the status of weather forecast skill over hours, days, and in some cases, weeks or months.  At longer timescales, leading ?paleofire? experts described how simulation models are used to understand the human and climatic drivers of changes in fire activity over century and millennia, gleaned from burn scars in trees and the charcoal layers in lake mud. Understanding these long-term changes provided the back drop for making predictions of fire in the future; scientists described efforts to predict future patterns in global fire activity, noting the difficulty in capturing simultaneous changes in climate, vegetation and human activity.
