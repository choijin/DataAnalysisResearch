<AbstractNarration>With a rapidly aging US population, smart healthcare technologies are critical to the well-being and quality of care among the elderly and disabled. Unfortunately, there are well-documented challenges in equipping students with the technical and professional competencies for developing user-centered solutions during the engineering innovation process. This project aims at initiating boundary-spanning research for enhancing empathic innovation abilities, which will support user-centeredness during the engineering design process. In this project, the research team will examine how undergraduate engineering students learn empathic innovation over time and how this learning is affected by the nature of community-based learning projects and curricula. The results will provide insights into effective teaching of empathic innovation at the undergraduate level. Guided by the research findings, teaching and learning techniques can be better designed to help students thrive and gain valuable STEM knowledge and skills. Through knowledge dissemination and community outreach, this research will impact multiple stakeholders and institutions. Ultimately, this research will help successfully prepare students for careers in an ever-evolving healthcare industry, which demands a workforce from one eighth of the U.S population, consumes nearly one fifth of the U.S. gross domestic product, and spends about $2.7 trillion annually. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific research questions for this project are (1) how do undergraduate engineering students' empathic design tendencies and abilities evolve during an engineering design project; and (2) to what extent, do undergraduate engineering students' empathic designs relate to their engineering innovation on various user-centered smart health engineering design projects. For this research study, the research team will apply a mixed-methods approach. The quantitative measures include individual empathic tendencies, innovative tendencies, empathic design abilities, and team-based innovation potential. Qualitative data collection involves surveys, real-time observations, and videotaping of design review sessions. The team will exploit a suite of statistical analysis methods, including structural equation modeling with latent variables in passive longitudinal designs. The qualitative analysis will employ thematic, content, and discourse analyses. The research team will work with community project partners and domain experts to design and evaluate individual and team-based performance evaluation tasks. This project will inform our understanding of an individual's tendencies in innovative behaviors in relationship to their empathic tendencies, examine how team-based innovation potential is related to empathic design abilities presented by each member of the team, and support current efforts in smart healthcare engineering by better equipping students with the ability to innovate.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Through this research initiation award, Kong (PI), Purzer (co-PI), Payne (co-PI), and two graduate research assistants have examined 1) how engineering students empathize with users and develop empathic abilities that have implications on their design innovation skills; 2) how they frame and reframe problems in the innovation process based on user input; and 3) how their innovative behaviors relate to empathic design tendencies in the context of biomedical engineering. The project team developed empathic innovation workshops and embedded them into existing biomedical engineering capstone courses. The team also developed a survey instrument designed to assess user-centered innovation potential among engineering students. In this project, data were collected using surveys, student project reports, ideation tasks, and observations. The workshops resulted in positive changes in students? emphatic tendencies. Our findings contribute to the literature on the critical role of innovation behaviors in relationship to empathic design tendencies in the context of biomedical engineering, as well as suggest instructional practices designed to promote empathy, agility, and creativity.</p> <p>This project has created opportunities for training and professional development at Purdue. First, with the help from the two co-PIs, PI Kong, familiarized himself with the engineering education literature on assessment of empathic tendencies, empathic design abilities, innovation tendencies. In addition, the PI and his biomedical engineering (BME) graduate student practiced outcome assessment on engineering education, including how to run ideation workshops, how to write IRB applications for social and behavioral science studies; and how to conduct data analyses for the assessment. Reciprocally, the PI and his graduate research assistant in BME helped other team members, including a graduate assistant at the Purdue School of Engineering Education (ENE), understand the challenges in outcome assessment and intervention implementation, as well as explore opportunities for the engineering design learning research in Purdue BME.</p> <p>This project gave the project team the opportunity to train two graduate students, one from BME and one from ENE. The BME graduate student familiarized herself with engineering education research on design and innovation, especially for development of next-generation BME workforce. Additionally, she gained experience on independently assessing innovation potential in large-scale cohort studies. The ENE graduate student, gained experience on statistical data analysis needed for learning outcome research. Both of them learned how to prepare scholarly publications and present research in international conference.</p> <p>This project led to the NSF acknowledged publication of one journal article, ?Measuring Empathy for Users in Engineering Design?, and three conference proceedings papers, ?Problem Reframing and Empathy Manifestation in the Innovation Process?, ?An Assessment Instrument for User-Centered Innovation Potential among Biomedical Engineers?, and ?Research Initiation: Enhancing the Learning Outcomes of Empathic Innovation in Biomedical Engineering Capstone Design?. Three presentations were given in ASEE2020. The first paper won the ASEE 2020 DEED Division Best Paper award.</p> <p>Through this project, the project team developed solid collaboration with Purdue BME instructors in junior and senior design courses. In addition, the PI fostered the collaboration with Dr. Justin Hess, a member of the advisory board.
