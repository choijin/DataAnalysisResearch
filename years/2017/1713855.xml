<AbstractNarration>Genes encode molecular tools in the form of RNA and protein. To use these tools to respond to signals and execute different behaviors, cells carefully control when, where and how much genes are turned on.  This is called 'gene regulation'. A major goal of synthetic biology is to engineer cells to perform specific useful tasks. To accomplish this goal, researchers must learn how gene regulation works well enough to predict and build genes that will be turned on in exactly the right place, at the right time and to the right level.  This project explores the idea that gene regulation is a multi-step cycle that is regulated at specific points, like driving a car.  A car contains many small interacting parts that have to act in a specific order to produce force and move, but to drive it, one only need to operate the ignition, the gas, the steering wheel and the brakes.  The investigators in the project are trying to identify which steps are regulated, and which molecules regulate them.  The work will contribute to development of new tools that will advance biomanufacturing, enable the design of new drugs to treat disease, and will provide new methods for enhancing crop yield, and other applications that will benefit from the ability to precisely control biology and biotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For decades, transcription research has been driven by a model that is conceptually simple: proteins bind to regulatory DNA at equilibrium to regulate recruitment of RNA polymerase (RNAP). This has led to a focus on cooperative and competitive physical interactions between transcription factors (TFs), cofactors and the basal transcriptional machinery, and underlies the search for the still hypothetical 'cis-regulatory code' of TF binding sites. This project challenges this dominant paradigm of transcriptional control by addressing how kinetic processes could combinatorially regulate transcription. Because promoters dictate rate limiting steps for transcription, we will measure the number of slow rates at multiple promoters using high resolution imaging, and test whether this rate spectrum is sensitive to cell type (Aim 1). TFs accelerate or retard different parts of this complex, dynamic cycle through their distinct biochemical activities. This project will use functional genomics and knock-down to characterize TF function at endogenous genes and at synthetic enhancers (Aim 2). The long-term goal is to predict and build synthetic gene regulatory systems that will both illuminate fundamental biology and perform useful functions, by performing quantitative experiments that are contextualized with theory based in biophysics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  During animal development, a single cell divides and becomes millions of different cells with distinct forms and functions. Every cell has similar DNA, but each cell expresses different genes at different times and to different levels; this process is called "gene expression" and is controlled by regulatory proteins called transcription factors that bind to DNA.  A key question in biology is how transcription factors work together to turn genes on; this knowledge is critical for understanding development and evolution, and for bioengineering circuits with new functions.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that together, transcription factors function like a team where each member has different expertise.  We built synthetic transcription factors where we could control the function and DNA binding precisely, and measured the impact that each one has on the dynamic process of gene expression using high-resolution imaging.  We then used mathematical models to decipher the functions each one performs. We found that the transcription factors we tested can perform different but partially overlapping functions.  The experimental and mathematical strategies that we developed in this proposal will be expanded in future work to test how a single transcription factor can perform multiple functions, testing a wider variety of transcription factors, and building gene regulatory circuits with predictable output. This project is a collaboration between two labs who study gene expression: the DePace lab at Harvard Medical School with expertise in Systems Biology and the Khalil lab at Boston University with expertise in Synthetic Biology and Bioengineering.  Both labs are committed to providing highly quality mentoring and interdisciplinary research training for the next generation of scientists, especially those from historically underrepresented groups in STEM, including women and minorities. The project has provided research training opportunities for multiple female graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and two female undergraduate students. One female undergraduate alumna of this project in the Khalil lab was awarded a prestigious Mitchell Scholarship after graduation and is now pursuing her PhD in Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School. The collaboration between the two labs also includes work with the Scientific Citizenship Initiative at Harvard Medical School (founded by DePace) to develop and deploy innovative curricula for scientists to explore the ethics and governance of emerging technology, through simulations and discussion of challenging real-world decisions.
