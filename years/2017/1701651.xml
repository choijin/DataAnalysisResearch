<AbstractNarration>The study of the abstract properties of numbers and their relations has appeared at an early stage in the history of every civilization, and reflection on the problems of number theory is consistently found at the root of most of the ideas that characterize contemporary life, from timekeeping, to the symmetry concepts of modern physics, to the logic of computers.  Numbers can be studied in two different ways that are nearly independent:  they can be used for measurement and they can be used to do arithmetic.  The interaction between these two properties has always been the basis of number theory.  The second half of the twentieth century saw the formulation of several ambitious research programs that aimed at obtaining a systematic understanding of these interactions by studying numbers and their relations with the help of symmetry.   The branch of mathematics concerned with their geometric symmetries is called arithmetic geometry; the branch concerned with their dynamical symmetries is called automorphic forms.  The Langlands program aims to unify these two branches by showing how each kind of symmetry encodes the other.  Contemporary theoretical physics has introduced the concept of higher order symmetries, based on new notions of space that themselves owe a great deal to earlier developments in number theory; more recently, higher order symmetries have been of increasing importance in the Langlands program.   This project explores the role of higher order symmetries in connection with several specific questions in the Langlands program, with the ultimate aim of contributing to the understanding of solutions of equations in whole numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a contribution to the arithmetic theory of automorphic forms, in the setting of the Langlands program, with special attention to the arithmetic of motives and their associated Galois representations, directly or by application of congruence methods.   The specific goals of the project are the study of the local Langlands parametrizations for general groups, using trace formula methods; the proof of Deligne's conjecture on special values of L-functions, especially tensor product L-functions; the verification of Venkatesh's conjecture on derived Hecke algebras for modular forms of weight 1, using an unexpected relation with p-adic L-functions; and the development of a character theory for mod p representations of p-adic groups.  The methods involved in the present project combine standard techniques from arithmetic geometry and automorphic forms, an approach to cohomological automorphic forms based on differential geometry and representation theory, categorical representation theory, as well as new methods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Every civilization has observed unexpected patterns in the relations among whole numbers.  For example, the hypotenuse of a right triangle with integer sides can have length 5 but not 7.  Number theory arose over time as the attempt to explain these patterns.  Although the kinds of patterns being studied have become incomparably more intricate since antiquity, the methods developed over the centuries to explain them and to predict new relations have been central in the evolution of mathematics and the physical sciences.  Representation theory, for example, a branch of mathematics that was initially motivated by the study of the symmetries of solutions of algebraic equations &mdash; in whole numbers &mdash; has long been indispensable in studying symmetry in chemistry and physics, and has recently become pervasive in understanding structures in computer science and statistics.  More recently, the Langlands program in the theory of automorphic forms grew out of the realization that the representation-theoretic structures developed in the study of quantum mechanics were inextricably linked to the symmetries of number theory, and that the methods introduced by Langlands provided the means to demonstrate the relations within number theory predicted by Grothendieck's hypothetical theory of motives, which postulates that whole numbers are governed by the possible geometric shapes underlying algebraic equations.   The Langlands program, together with Grothendieck's conjectures about motives, thus establish a dictionary that interprets the patterns of number theory in the language of symmetry and mathematical physics, and vice versa.  Signs that there are still more intricate relations between the two programs have been identified by Venkatesh and his collaborators, who have been formulating a series of overlapping conjectures explaining apparently insignificant structures in the theory of automorphic forms precisely in terms of underlying motivic structures, and by the field of geometric representation theory, which has expanded the Langlands program to incorporate new topological methods that form a point of contact with hypothetical quantum field theories. While no one expects a complete solution of these conjectures to be accessible in the near future, or even in the present century, they provide a framework that, directly or indirectly, serve to guide most current research in number theory.
