<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experiences in support of groups historically under-represented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity provides support for postbaccalaureate studies in STEM programs leading to the STEM doctoral degree. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Georgia (UGA) is the host site for the 2017-2019 Bridge to the Doctorate (B2D) program for the Peach State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PSLAMP) under the leadership of University of Georgia. This is the first post-baccalaureate program at the institution that supports a graduate student cohort of 12 underrepresented minority (URM) STEM Ph.D. students from LSAMP campuses across the nation. The BD Activity provides extensive training in specific STEM disciplines as well as professional development and guidance that promote peer mentoring and leadership in the scientific community. Students receive rigorous academic and research training experiences that support completion of the Ph.D. and the transition to a competitive career in academia and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the duration of the project and beyond, the BD program at UGA serves to increase the number and quality of students from underrepresented groups completing STEM Ph.D. degrees and entering the STEM workforce.  Formative and summative evaluation will occur with the summative evaluation including a comparison group to assess impact of the program interventions on student outcomes.  The evaluation question asks:  Are PSLAMP completers who participate in B2D more likely than PSLAMP completers who do not participate in B2D to complete doctoral degrees in STEM disciplines?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term impact of the BD activity is reflected in America's STEM workforce, both in academia and in industrial research and development. By nurturing future STEM leaders, the value added is seen in the visibility of underrepresented minorities in science and engineering, increasing representation and providing role models and motivation for the next generation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Peach State LSAMP?s Bridge to the Doctorate (B2D) program at the University of Georgia (UGA) was jointly managed by the Office of Institutional Diversity and the Graduate School. These two units have a history of collaboration on activities designed to enhance recruitment and retention of underrepresented graduate students. The contextual framework for the program was to facilitate both the academic and social integration of B2D fellows into the STEM research community of UGA. The program was built upon overlapping ?orbitals? of support, ranging from the discipline-specific mentoring provided by UGA?s graduate programs and major professors to peer support from fellow B2D members and other STEM graduate students.     The UGA LSAMP B2D program had three specific aims for the project:  Specific Aim 1: Recruit 12 LSAMP alumni to STEM graduate programs at UGA Specific Aim 2: Develop an ?orbital? model of support for B2D trainees Specific Aim 3: Ensure that 90% of B2D doctoral trainees have completed the doctorate within 7 years of their initial enrollment in the program.      Outcomes     UGA B2D did accomplish its aim of recruiting 12 LSAMP alumni to STEM graduate programs at UGA. Seven (7) of the B2D fellows were admitted into the program in 2017, and Five (5) were admitted into the program in 2018.     The orbital design is a well-established model of engagement.  The model facilitated both the academic and social integration of B2D fellows into the STEM research community of UGA.     Ten (10) of the 12 (83%) of the UGA LSAMP B2D Fellows successfully completed a master's degree or are in a Ph.D. program. Five (5) B2D Fellows are currently enrolled in Ph.D. programs. Three are Ph.D. candidates, and two will be taking qualifying/comprehensive exams within the next year. Two additional UGA B2D alumni have indicated that they plan to enroll in a Ph.D. program.     The project team learned a few lessons with the first 7 B2D fellows recruited in 2017. So the program managers were much better prepared to recruit LSAMP alumni who already had goals of completing a Ph.D.  As a result, four (4) of the five (5) B2D fellows recruited in the 2nd year of the project (2018) are enrolled in Ph.D. programs currently. They are progressing very well and already making significant contributions to their research and campus community.
