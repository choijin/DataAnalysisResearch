<AbstractNarration>Volcanic eruptions taking place along subduction zones (arcs) are commonly interpreted as triggered by the influx of new magma to their shallow storage systems. This project aims to explore the late-stage changes in temperature, pressure, water content, and composition of arc magmas on the "crystal cargo" they carry, by testing the premise that the textures and compositions of erupted materials preserve this chronology. Comparison of experimental and natural samples will shed light on magma chamber and transit processes occurring between magma mixing and eruption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two historical eruptions of Volcan Quizapu (Chilean Andes), one effusive and one explosive, have been characterized petrologically and geochemically in prior studies.  Evidence points to a magmatic system of predominantly dacite with single-episode, eruption-triggering influxes of andesitic magma.  The relative simplicity of these interactions makes Quizapu an ideal starting point for a targeted experimental study addressing questions related to magma mixing and ascent/eruption.  Key lines of inquiry include constraining resorption/de-stabilization kinetics of plagioclase and amphibole in response to perturbation, as these minerals preserve evidence of magma storage conditions prior to eruption. The goals of this investigation are to (1) establish pre-eruption environmental conditions of Quizapu dacite and andesite, (2) examine response times of key thermobarometers and hygrometers through a series of step-heating experiments, (3) explore the formation conditions of sieve-textured plagioclase, and (4) broadly examine crystal-scale responses to thermodynamic perturbations through high-resolution chemical analysis and diffusion modeling.  The results will have general implications for magma mixing processes among intermediate-composition arc magmas, not only because the recharge-triggered Quizapu events are typical of arc volcanoes, but also because the crystal-scale processes on which the study focuses (the influence of halogens on amphibole composition and stability, plagioclase dissolution kinetics upon heating, and formation of sieve-texture via several proposed mechanisms) are germane to a broad spectrum of magmatic settings.</AbstractNarration>

The Southern Andes (South of Santiago de Chile) are a classic setting where this type of magmatism has been studied for decades in the context of the role of the overlying crust. As crust thickens towards the North, the window into magmas derived from the underlying mantle becomes increasingly cryptic. Instead, magmatism is dominated by differentiated (more crustal-like) magmas that experienced overprinting through magma mixing, fractional crystallization, and assimilation.  Within the Southern Andes, the area around Quizapu volcano (major eruptions in 1846 and 1932) is of particular interest as is represents a key transitional area. South of Quizapu mantle-derived magmas are more likely to reach surface, while further North such magmas are basically absent. Around Quizapu differentiated magmas already dominate, however they co-exist with minor centers that among the most primitive (mantle-like) centers in this arc setting.  This project studied a subset of these mafic centers and in doing so we provide new constraints on how the more differentiated/evolved magma system underlying the large volcanoes are fed. Two centers were studied in detail: the Pleistocene volcano of Manantial Pelado and two monogenetic cinder cones, named Los Hornitos. In comparison to existing literature data from other volcanic centers in this transitional area, these two centers have erupted some of the most primitive magmas. While compositionally these centers are similar end-members, they show distinct behaviors of magma storage in the crust.  At Los Hornitos we studied olivine phenocrysts that have compositions in equilibrium with mantle peridotite (&gt;Fo90). Their internal zoning, volatile budget, and textural information all point towards rapid transit of the crust. These magmas with MgO contents &gt; 12 wt.% are potentially the only true mantle melts reaching the surface in this arc within a over 200 mile radius.

More importantly continuous primitive magma supply over about 50,000 years and quasi-continuous but slow transport of that magma to the surface allowed this system to retain is primitive character.  Thus, within 10-15 km we find contrasting subvolcanic magma system that reveal new insight on the heterogeneity of the crust and the regional architecture of arc settings.     The project connected an early career investigators with a mid-level career scientist.  At the University of Nevada, Reno and prior to the PI?s move at Columbia University a total of 2 graduate students were partially funded by this project and several other graduate and undergraduate students participated in some of the research activities. As part of this project PI Ruprecht organized a ten day, 18 person, five university, and five nationality encompassing workshop in the Chilean Andes to discuss magmatism in general, and magma mixing and ore formation in particular.
