<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to bring agility to the network infrastructure in data center networks.  While modern data centers leverage server virtualization to quickly and easily deploy applications, and storage systems that abstract away the hard drives and enable applications to access any data from any server at any time, the network infrastructure that protects and makes the network more efficient is still largely hardware appliances.  With cloud traffic expected to quadruple over the next several years (according to Cisco), a rapid growth in the number of devices (with the Internet of Things emerging), and an ever increasing complexity and scale of security threats, this project will provide data center operators with the agility to quickly and easily deploy infrastructure to keep up with these trends and threats.  In doing so, society will experience more reliable networked applications with reduced data breaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide technical validation for a new approach to network function virtualization, invented at the University of Colorado, Boulder, in which network functions are disaggregated into separate processing and state storage components.  Experiments in the lab have shown seamless scalability, disruptionless failure management, and processing rates in line with other software solutions.  The goal of this project is to run in a production environment (a data center with real traffic) to fully quantify the throughput, latency, scalability, resilience, and cost effectiveness when faced with production conditions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[At Stateless, we are building a product to enable Network Functions as a Service. The opportunity for Stateless? product is rooted in an emerging, fundamental shift in the way information technology (IT) infrastructures are designed. We are in the midst of a clear trend toward companies consuming their IT infrastructure, rather than building it. That is, rather than the traditional approach of building the compute, storage, and network infrastructure for the needed application(s), we are seeing these decoupled into a provider that builds a common underlying infrastructure and offers it out as a service to companies who can quickly deploy applications on top of it (consuming it).     Managing sophisticated network functions to be consumed as services is difficult and expensive with today?s available solutions which are deployed as physical (and more recently, virtual) appliances.  To overcome this, at the University of Colorado, Boulder, the founders of Stateless created a new architecture from the ground up, based on principles and technologies which have successfully enabled large web companies to create scalable and resilient applications.  The innovation was doing so in the challenging environment of processing network traffic.    The high-level goal of the SBIR Phase I project was to take technology out of the lab and into a production environment, specifically a data center located in Boulder, CO.  This project identified three key objectives, stability, reliability, and usability, which are important toward proving that this technology is capable of deployment in production networks, which are considered critical to a company?s operations.      For stability (i.e., does the product work under normal conditions), we designed the system with modular components with well-defined interfaces, and designed and enforced a testing practice which ensures components work individually, and together, under a variety of conditions.  For reliability (i.e., does the product continue to work under failures), we built out a complete architecture around the initial innovation based on industry adopted components for high reliability, and tested under adverse conditions.  For usability (i.e., does the product meet the needs of its users), we have interacted closely with the team at the data center where our system is deployed, and received positive feedback.  Further, we started engaging with a Tier 1 provider which saw the demonstration and was equally excited.
