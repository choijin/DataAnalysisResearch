<AbstractNarration>Post-9/11 wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have produced approximately 3 million U.S. veterans, a population expected to nearly double in the next three years. Between 780,000-900,000 of these veterans have sought medical care connected to their military service, and roughly 25% have a documented service-connected disability. Amid ongoing concerns about institutional inadequacies and the relentless problem of veteran suicide, public policy and popular attention have been turning to veteran's family members as a key resource to help those encumbered by service-connected debility. Care for these veterans is generally thought of as spread across two disparate yet occasionally overlapping spheres: medical institutions, such as the VA, and veteran families. Policy, legislation, and other efforts to support veterans are overwhelmingly targeted at these two spheres, and while much of the help injured veterans need is indeed provided by either clinicians or family members, among post-9/11 veterans 23% of those providing informal everyday care are friends and neighbors, a uniquely high percentage compared to previous generations of veterans and civilian populations alike. Current research offers a partial picture of the effects of caregiving in military and veteran families, and this has led to important policy initiatives such as Joining Forces and the VA family caregiver support program. However, virtually nothing is known about informal veteran caregiving beyond the family, and non-family caregivers are not supported by VA or other programs. Furthermore, the exclusive focus on family - particularly wives - as the source of informal care can lead to negative social and health outcomes including caregiver burnout for family caregivers and narrowed life options for veterans. While roughly 20% of Americans are disabled, and many disability communities have developed innovative models for sustaining long-term informal care outside of the family, injured veterans are not usually considered part of broader disability communities. As a CAREER project, the project implements a range of educational activities aimed at improving the public's understanding of disability and veterans issues. This includes a free public online course, and resources that will be available on a public website.To help create conversations and linkages between veteran and non-veteran disability communities, the project includes the creation of a free online disability studies course designed specifically for veterans, as well as a workshop that will bring together members from both veteran and non-veteran communities to discuss shared experiences and strategies and to create community caregiving resources which will be made publically available through an accessible website. The project also provides training for undergraduate and graduate students in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award, Dr. Zoe Wool of Rice University will explore the ways in which socialities of care for disabled veterans are improvised within, beyond, and against kinship and other existent infrastructures of care. This project combines long term ethnographic data collection, semi-structured interviews, and social network analysis to understand and map the full range of caregiving relationships that emerge around injured post-9/11 veterans. The research will be conducted in Houston, TX, and at an innovative new intentional community for injured veterans in New Orleans, LA. The project also aims to understand the way family and non-family caregiving relationships may interact with each other and may be shaped by caregiving--and expectations around family relationships, in similar or different ways. In addition, the project looks to non-veteran disability communities in California and New York, which each have a rich history of experiments in social arrangements of informal caregiving, including the relatively recent model of care collectives. In addition to understanding the kinds of relationships people count on for care, the project investigates the duration and temporality of these relationships, with a special focus on the ways various caregiving relationships are shaped by the need for improvisation that often accompanies life lived with chronic illness or impairment. The project will advance anthropological and broader social scientific theories of sociality, care, disability, and kinship. Bringing the worlds of injured veterans together with the worlds of broader disability communities practiced in developing alternative caregiving networks may lead to new ways of thinking about informal long-term care and the policies that support it, both for veterans, and for the millions of other disabled Americans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Key findings include:  Expectations and aspirations around caregiving in veteran worlds are strongly tied to gendered, heteronormative expectations about who veterans are and who caregivers should be. Yet many of the practices of caregiving that sustain and support veterans exceed these expectations. For example, today's veterans are more likely to receive care from friends and neighbors than from either parents or spouses. This is a departure from previous generations of veterans.     The vast majority of social and organizational supports for veteran caregivers are built to support and reproduce these gendered and heteronormative visions of care, and do not recognize or support the extant practices that exceed this vision.   The expertise of elders in queer disability community emphasized the value of having caregivers who are not primary partners or family members, while also seeing caregiving relationships as sources of possible community building and relationship making.   Disability community members also highlighted that complications around aligning kinship, care, and intimacy are likely to vary depending on the level of need and the kind of care work involved.   Many veterans in the project appreciated the expansive configurations of kinship, intimacy, and care that emerge from queer practices and that make room to name or otherwise recognize a range of 'significant otherness' beyond the narrow confines of husband and wife or the nuclear family.   Many veterans in the project also appreciated disability perspectives on chronicity and cure that are socially situated and offer alternatives to universalizing biomedical narratives of recovery. One example that veterans often found helpful was chronic illness patient-advocate Christine Miserandino's spoon theory.   Vanishingly few veterans were comfortable identifying as disabled or identifying with disability community.   Many of the struggles that injured veterans confront around configuring and accessing care are shaped by their status as veterans and specificities of military harm, while at the same time being shaped by much broader social structures. These broader social structures both inflect those military spaces and also undermine people's ability to configure and access care more generally. These structures include heteropatriarchy, ableism, racism, and the particular multiplicative force of anti-Black misogyny that race and gender studies scholar Dr. Moya Baily has termed misogynoir.   By the end of the funding period, the project resulted in:  4 peer reviewed journal articles  1 book chapter  10 talks    2 newsletters  The project also included the co-supervision and mentorship of four PhD students working on related issues, all of whom are also members of groups identified by the NSF as underrepresented in the field.  While the funding period has been truncated due to the PI's institutional relocation, the project will continue in a limited way beyond the end of the funding period. This will include the creation of a free online introduction to disability studies course that is geared specifically toward US veterans, as well as an academic book.
