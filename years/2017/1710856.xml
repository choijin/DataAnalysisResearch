<AbstractNarration>This project will attempt to combine relativistic quantum theory of nanoscale phenomena with the concepts of general relativity, a theory primarily designed to cover astrophysical phenomena. One of the aims is to study the consequences for relativistic geodesy, where one uses tiny frequency shifts in atomic transitions, as a function of the altitude of an atomic clock, in order to map out the Earth's surface. To accomplish this task, modern computer algorithms will be developed in concert with an improved understanding of quantum field theories to advance our quantitative understanding of quantum mechanical bound states of atoms. Only by combining quantum field theory with the notion of curved spacetime can our current understanding of the very large be reconciled with our current understanding of the very small. This project will continue and extend the PI's explorations of this synthesis of two world views. The supervision of graduate students and the completion of an extensive monograph on the subject matter will complement the research program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research planned for this project will cover theoretical physics research in various related fields, including extensions of the Dirac equation to curved space-time, pseudo-Hermitian extensions of Dirac theory, the use of highly powerful parallel computer algorithms for the calculation of atomic properties. Existing discrepancies between theory and experiment (the so-called muonic hydrogen/proton radius puzzle and the enhancement of internal pair creation in the decay of 8Be) will be analyzed theoretically, and higher-order corrections will be studied. The Dirac formalism will be augmented by a coupling of the bispinor to curved space-time, with special emphasis on consequences for relativistic geodesy. Finally, investigations on atom-surface contact interactions and non-contact friction effects will complement the research program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is often being said that physics, on the fundamental level,   offers only limited possibilities for breakthroughs or advances   that lift the science to an entirely new level. Within the NSF   project "Quantum Field Theory, Atomic Physics and General   Relativity" (NSF PHY-1710856), we have been trying to "do the   impossible". Progress can be reported on a number of subprojects.   (1.) Let us first consider a potentially observed novel particle,   an addition to the so-called Standard Model of Fundamental   Interactions, conceivably found at a relatively small rest-mass   energy of only 16.7 MeV (therefore tentatively called the "X17"   particle), in hitherto unconfirmed experiments in Hungary (at the   Nuclear Physics Laboratory of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences).   It is unclear at present if the new particle exists or if the   signal seen in the experiment is spurious.  However, if the   particle does exist, then, in atomic systems, as we were able to   show, the particle could be detected in high-precision   experiments on muonic atoms. The X17 would show up in small, but   important shifts of a frequency interval known as the hyperfine   splitting. All other atomic-physics effects caused by the   putative X17 particle would be too tiny to be observed under   realistic assumptions. We were able to show that the mass range   of 17 MeV (give or take) is a rather unfavorable mass range for   the generation of sizeable effects in atomic physics, because in   this case, the range of the effective potential generated by the   new particle is commensurate with the extent of the nuclear   charge distribution, and thus the effects of the X17 in atomic   systems are "hidden" (to a large extent) in the so-called   finite-size correction which describes the effect of the finite   nuclear charge distribution on the spectrum. The notable   exception is the hyperfine splitting in muonic systems, where the   "normal" orbiting particle (the electron) is replaced by its   heavy "cousin", the muon. (2.) The second sub-area where   substantial progress has been achieved, concerns the limits of   the predictive power of perturbation theory, as set forth by the   ever-increasing difficulties to evaluate large-order Feynman   graphs.  The famous American physicist Richard Feynman   discovered, in 1949, that certain perturbative processes in   quantum field theory can be interpreted in terms of graphical   structures, that describe, schematically, the travel paths and   the interactions of fundamental particles. All important   processes in modern quantum field theories are amenable to such   graphical representations. The higher the order of perturbation   theory, the higher is the so-called loop order at which the   calculations have to be performed.  The problem, though, is that,   as we go higher in perturbation theory, the computational   complexity increases dramatically, as the number of graphs grows   factorially (faster than any power) of the so-called loop order,   i.e., of the order of perturbation theory.  Using modern   quantum-field theoretical techniques, we were able to show that,   as the number of loops increases, the evaluation of the   higher-order corrections becomes easier, because one can map the   problem onto a different domain in the physical parameter space   of the coupling constant, solve the evaluation of the large-order   Feynman graphs using so-called instanton calculus in the unstable   domain, and then, transform back to the evaluation of the Feynman   graphs that one had initially desired. Specifically, we were able   to show that correlation functions in so-called phi-4 theories   with an internal symmetry group are amenable to a very accurate   large-order analysis, in which we also evaluated corrections to   the large-order asymptotics of the perturbative coefficients.   These compare favorably with perturbative calculations to the   seventh or eighth loop-order and can be used in order to   interpolate between the perturbative and nonperturbative domain   of a quantum field theory, thus overcoming the predictive limits   of perturbation theory.  This result is very important for the   understanding of precise quantum field theories like quantum   electrodynamics, on which modern atomic physics is based.  The   research has been described in an article published in the   magazine "Research Outreach".
