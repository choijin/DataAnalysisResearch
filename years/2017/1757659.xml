<AbstractNarration>This research experience for undergraduates (REU) site has a focus on security of cyber-physical systems such as self-driving cars, unmanned aerial vehicle systems, robots, smart electrical grid systems and internet of things devices that are among the most important devices to secure due to their real-world interaction with humans, other equipment and the environment. These devices are also critical to manufacturing efficiency and national competitiveness. This program provides student participants an opportunity to gain experience in developing and analyzing cyber-security-related software for such cyber-physical systems. Through this experience, students learn about the process of and techniques for conducting research in cybersecurity, cyber-physical systems and the computing disciplines in general. They also come to better understand their own capabilities and interest in pursuing research careers, refining and potentially changing their career and educational goals.  The project, thus, promotes the progress of science by allowing students to evaluate the pursuit of careers in research through immersive participation in a real-world research environment, and it advances national security and welfare through its focus on the area of cybersecurity. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The projects focusing on topics such as self-driving cars and robots excite student participants and provide the opportunity for hands on work with hardware, allowing students to see the effect of decisions they have made regarding software design and security. Sample projects involve 1) the design of secure coordination systems, intrusion, and malicious data detection, 2) issue prevention and detection, 3) data trustworthiness, 4) sensor data trust assessment, and 5) supervisory control and data acquisition system security, and reliability analytics. Through these, students gain exposure to multiple sub-disciplines related to these projects, allowing them to experience in multiple related areas. They also gain an appreciation for the importance of each sub-discipline as well as the opportunity to work on a large project from start to finish in conjunction with their cadre-mates. Participating students complete research projects, including software development, results analysis and technical write-ups.  They are mentored by North Dakota State University faculty through cadre-group, scheduled one-on-one and ad-hoc meetings.  They gain appreciation of the importance of quality assurance processes, particularly for ensuring software security and the safety of cyber-physical systems, and they learn about the software lifecycle and proper software development practices.  The projects are designed so that students, despite working on their own research goal and serving as the "lead scientist" on this goal, rely on other students for their success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
