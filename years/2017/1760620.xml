<AbstractNarration>Hurricane Harvey is the strongest hurricane to hit the Texas coast in decades and the resulting tidal surges, flooding and terrestrial runoff have had a severe impact on the coastal ocean. The effects on the phytoplankton, the first link in the food chain, may be unprecedented. To determine how the phytoplankton community will respond to such drastic changes in salinity, nutrient inputs, and potential toxins, immediate and continuous sampling is the only way to fully capture the effects and to identify when conditions return to "normal". An automated, continuous phytoplankton imaging instrument that is deployed on the Texas coast records images of the phytoplankton and permits calculation of the abundance of different species. Together with molecular information on the genes that have been "turned on", or expressed, outcomes of this project will help determine the responses of individual types of phytoplankton. Extreme storms are expected to increase in frequency with future climate change, so the responses identified now will be valuable in predicting how such events will affect these primary producers, which in turn support most of the food webs in marine ecosystems, in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High temporal resolution observations from the Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) have revealed that hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico cause drastic changes in the phytoplankton community structure.  The objectives of this RAPID project are: 1) to characterize the dynamics of the phytoplankton species in relation to the environmental variables along the Texas coast; 2) to assess the short and long-term changes in the phytoplankton community; and 3) to identify the strategies of the phytoplankton community for resource acquisition. To accomplish these objectives, this project will utilize IFCB time series to follow phytoplankton community structure during the recovery period from Hurricane Harvey. In addition, two RAPID response cruises (in late September and early October) to sample at 5 sites along a transect from Galveston to Port Aransas, TX. At each station, CTD profiles and water samples from surface and the chlorophyll maximum will be collected for nutrients, carbonate chemistry, and RNA sequencing for metatranscriptomic analysis. Metatranscriptomics can provide an indication of the metabolic strategies employed and functional relationships within the plankton community in response to changes in the environment. The advantage of a metatranscriptomic approach is that the entire molecular response to the environment is captured. So, while the response of phytoplankton to increased nutrient inputs from floodwater runoff is targeted, the responses to other environmental stresses (toxics, hypoxia, acidification) are also captured. Analyses of this time series using multivariate statistical techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), and network analysis, a powerful technique for identifying potential interactions among taxa, will provide insights on the environmental factors and metabolic responses structuring the community during the aftermath of the hurricane.</AbstractNarration>

This RAPID project focused on the response of the phytoplankton community along the Texas coast during the recovery period following Hurricane Harvey. In the aftermath of the hurricane, a freshwater plume from Galveston Bay, along with nutrients and potential toxins, extended down the Texas coast. Determining the impact of these drastic changes on the coastal phytoplankton community is important because phytoplankton are the first step in the food chain of this important fishing region.</p> <p>Two research cruises were conducted starting from Galveston Island extending south to Port Aransas, TX in the month following the hurricane. Timing of the cruises (Sept 23-26/ Sept 29-Oct1), a week apart, allowed examination of the state of the phytoplankton community and the shift in phytoplankton abundance, taxonomic diversity, and gene expression in response to the altered physical and chemical properties. The cruise results were put into context by comparing with ongoing phytoplankton time series data from two sites on the Texas coast, Port Aransas (since Sept 2007) and Surfside Beach (since May 2017). Additional samples collected at the Surfside time series site provided taxonomic and gene expression data for the phytoplankton community as the coastal environment recovered.</p> <p>Prevailing conditions along the Texas coast restricted the freshwater plume to the immediate coast. Observed salinities during the first cruise were considerably fresher than the average for this period, particularly the upcoast stations nearer Galveston Bay. By the second cruise leg, the freshwater had move farther downcoast, so at most stations, salinity decreased slightly, the surface mixed layer deepened and salinity at the southernmost station (S01) decreased from ~33 to ~26 (Fig. 1).</p> <p>To identify changes in the phytoplankton community as the freshwater moved down the coast, we used a novel imaging system, the Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB), which records pictures of all the microorganisms in a known volume of water. Dramatic shifts in community composition were noted between the two cruises that took place just 1 week apart. From these images, we found that the community shifted from a typically diatom-dominated system to one in which dinoflagellates were the dominant group among the phytoplankton. Results from high throughput sequence metabarcoding supported the increased relative abundance of dinoflagellates (Fig. 2). This is one of the first studies to compare data on phytoplankton abundance from the IFCB with taxonomic diversity estimates from metabarcoding. Surprisingly, up to 40 potential harmful algal bloom species were identified from the barcoding analysis.</p> <p>To assess the physiological responses of the phytoplankton community, a metatranscriptomics approach was taken. This provided an indication of the metabolic strategies employed and functional relationships within the plankton community in response to changes in the environment. The advantage of a metatranscriptomic approach is that the entire molecular response to the environment is captured. So, while the response of phytoplankton to increased nutrient inputs from floodwater runoff is targeted, the responses to other environmental stresses (toxics, hypoxia, acidification) can also be captured. The series of metatranscriptomic data from the cruises and additional Surfside samples indicated the diatoms <em>Chaetoceros</em>, <em>Thalassiosira</em>, and <em>Skeletonema</em> were initially stressed as evidenced by increased expression of HSP70 and peroxidase genes sampled ~2 weeks after the storm. Silicon transporter genes exhibited increased expression ~2 weeks after the storm for <em>Chaetoceros </em>while <em>Thalassiosira </em>had high expression ~1 month after the storm. In the dinoflagellates, peroxidase and HSP70 gene expression for <em>Karenia</em> increased over time with the highest expression observed during the second cruise, coinciding with dinoflagellate dominance in the community. While the community as a whole was impacted by the large input of freshwater into the system, expression profiles taken two months after the storm showed the plankton community appeared to have recovered.</p> <p>The combination of these multiple approaches permitted examination of the response of the coastal plankton community at a detail (genus or species-level) not possible otherwise.&nbsp; Immediate and continuous sampling is the only way to fully capture the effects of environmental disturbances and to identify when conditions return to "normal".</p> <p class="Pa4">This project has provided training and professional development opportunities for four undergraduate students, two graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher.
