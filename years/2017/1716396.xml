<AbstractNarration>When plant cells are challenged with DNA damage induced by environmental radiation or by pathogen infection, Replication Protein A (RPA) is a first responder in the cellular decision-making processes that promote cell survival and help maintain the integrity of the genome. Plants contain multiple RPA proteins, and these are thought to have specialized functions that allow the plant to respond to different sources of DNA damage. To address this idea, this project employs a multi-faceted approach, exploiting the genetic power of the model plant Arabidopsis and leveraging biochemical and protein chemistry methods. The results will illuminate a novel response in plants to the DNA damage from various assaults, including pathogen infection. The long-term outcome of the work could lead to development of plants with heightened disease resistance.  Educational goals include providing research training for undergraduate and graduate students and involving at-risk high school students in hands-on research. Students at all levels will engage in communicating scientific information to lay audiences, simultaneously enhancing their own learning and improving public appreciation of science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project objectives are to discover cellular mechanisms for repairing DNA double-strand breaks. DNA breaks can be induced by abiotic sources, such as UV or ionizing radiation, or by biotic sources, such as pathogen infection.  This research will explore the role of the important DNA-repair factor, RPA, which is hypothesized to be a key regulator of the cellular decisions involved in properly repairing DNA breaks in response to both abiotic and biotic sources. The main experimental objectives are to: 1) generate a model for RPA-dependent repair by examining how RPA responds to DNA breaks induced by radiation sources; 2) determine if RPA is required for repair of pathogen-induced DNA double-strand breaks, and 3) determine biochemical interactions and modifications of RPA in response to DNA damage. These data will be integrated into a holistic model of RPA functions to inform future functional analysis of cellular DNA repair in this and other systems.  The results have the potential to improve crop production in response to abiotic and biotic threats.</AbstractNarration>
