<AbstractNarration>Nanoscaled crystals are atomically-ordered microscopic particles that are approximately 100,000 smaller in diameter than a human hair.  At these dimensions, the nanoparticles take on interesting chemical and physical properties not seen in larger dimensioned particles.  The chemical synthesis of nanostructures is tricky, and the quality of the nanocrystal depends heavily on perfecting a good synthetic methodology, which is often specific to the chemical composition and morphology of the nanoparticle of interest.  Dr. Jonathan Owen of Columbia University is researching new methods to synthesize indium and zinc phosphides with novel synthesis reagents that provide greater flexibility, safety, and control of the nanocrystal properties.  To analyze their structural characteristics, Prof. Owen uses a novel and cutting edge technique called pair distribution function analysis of x-ray scattering. This approach allows Dr. Owen to select for conditions that lead to nanocrystals with greater purity and crystalline order.  This program is shedding light on how the syntheses take place mechanistically and results of the project readily transfer to synthesis of other nanoparticle compositions. Broader societal impacts of the research are the development of new materials with reduced toxicity, earth abundance, and improved performance in energy technologies from luminescent displays, to solid state lighting, and photovoltaics. Prof. Owen involves high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in this research project and maintains a quantum dot synthesis laboratory module for undergraduate courses that clearly illustrates the principles of quantum confinement and the mechanisms of crystal nucleation and growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The synthesis of III-V and II-V semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) has lagged behind that of the canonical II-VI QDs, which can be presently fabricated with outstanding monodispersity and bright photoluminescence.  While there are many fewer examples of III-V nanocrystals (NCs) in the literature, these "pnictides" represent a rapidly developing field.  Prof. Jonathan Owen of Columbia University is researching synthesis methods of metal pnictide nanoparticles by designing pnictogen precursors with tunable conversion reactivity.  Additional control is achieved by speeding the crystallization kinetics using high temperature compatible surfactants and crystallization catalysts to facilitate rapid and reversible bond formation. Methodology for the synthesis of III-V and II-V QDs, with an emphasis on phosphides and arsenides of zinc and indium, are the initial pnictide target compositions, but the information obtained is generally transferable to other pnitide materials. The broader impacts of this proposed research result from the development of new materials with reduced toxicity, earth abundance, and improved efficiencies in energy technologies with applications ranging from luminescent displays to solid state lighting and photovoltaics. Prof. Owen involves high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in this research project. He also works to bring an improved understanding of QD properties into the undergraduate laboratory in developing a QD synthesis lab module that clearly illustrates the principles of quantum confinement and the mechanisms of crystal nucleation and growth.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intellectual merit of this project rests in new methods of syntheisizing nanometer scale crystals of metal phoshide semiconductors and new mechanistic understanding of crystal growth. A novel class of synthesis reagents were developed to gain greater control over the crystal growth conditions. A collection of aminophosphine derivatives allowed the speed of metal phosphide formation to be adjusted over a wide range of rates. These kinetics adjust the concentration of solutes that accumulate during crystal growth.  The tunability enabled the study of crystal nucleation and crystal growth over a wide range of temperatures and provided greater ability to control the final crystal size over a wide range.  By adjusting the rate of the crystallization, synthesis conditions were identified where the crystal nucleation process could be studied in detail.  The nucleation kinetics were monitored across a wide range of temperature and reaction rates.  These studies demonstrated the novel finding that crystal nucleation can be a slow process that continues throughout the synthesis provided that the temperature is low.  At higher temperature, the nucleation process occurs in a much more rapid burst prior to growth. The temperature dependence of the nucleation duration is a novel observation that contradicts widely accepted models of colloidal crystal growth.   The broader scientific impacts of the research rest in a new model of crystal growth that explain the results above and emphasizes the rate limiting growth process, rather than the nucleation process, as the mechanism that dictates the crystal size. The work makes clear that colloidal crystals form with narrow distributions in the size because crystal growth kinetics slow as the crystal size increases. These findings concretely revise the canonical picture of colloidal crystal formation where a short burst of nucleation establishes a population of small crystals at early times.  These findings will allow scientists to more predictably and reliably control the synthesis of other inorganic semiconductor materials.  The broader impacts of the project also included educational outreach activities designed to expose undergraduates to research and to reach underserved communities in the New York City Area.  These efforts led to two undergraduate coauthors on publications supported by this work as well as a variety of educational outreach activities exposing the public to nanomaterials including: SciRise: Science club at ELLIS Preparatory Academy in the Bronx; The Rosedale Character Enrichment Club for Girls with the South Bronx Educational Foundation; Girls Science Day, with Women in Science at Columbia; March Materials Madness, PhD for a Day with the Initiative for Diversity in Engineering, and Late Night Science with the Columbia Neuroscience Outreach Club.
