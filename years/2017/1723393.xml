<AbstractNarration>Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite significant advances in structural materials, catastrophic beam-column joint failures in reinforced concrete (RC) buildings persist in being a problem during earthquakes. The behavior and failure mechanisms in RC joints have been extensively studied in the past and are well understood under simple (planar) loading conditions. Current practice tells us to increase the joint dimensions or the amount of reinforcing steel to enhance the capacity of the joints and prevent premature failure. However, this approach is definitely not sustainable. Additionally, as observed in recent earthquakes, this practice does not always prevent catastrophic failures in the joint region, leading to the conclusion that the behavior of joints under complex (multi-axial) loading conditions is still not well understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, high-performance fiber reinforced concrete (HPFRC) will be selectively used at the beam-column joints to improve the structural performance of buildings while keeping the additional costs at a minimum. Using experimental and computational methods, a comparative damage evaluation and life-cycle cost assessment of building with RC and HPFRC joints will be conducted. Analysis of joints is a difficult task because of the complex load transfer and the behavior of materials under multi-axial loading. Therefore, two multi-axial (6 degree-of-freedom) loading units will be used to impose realistic loading and boundary conditions on the joints, and a digital-image correlation system for non-contact deformation measurements (DIC) will be used to obtain full-field 3-D strain maps to study critical deformation states that lead to the initiation of damage as well as its progression until complete failure. These research activities are anticipated to yield critical new knowledge and understanding of the behavior of RC and R-HPFRC joints, and reliable computational tools to study the RC/reinforced-HPFRC material and joint behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Significance and Importance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed novel approach is expected to transform the design and construction of RC beam-column joints over the long-term. A direct benefit of this project to society is the improvement in public safety in response to earthquakes. An additional benefit is increased sustainability in the form of reduced direct and indirect economic losses and environmental impacts. The achievements in this project will be a large step in reaching the ultimate goal of resilient and sustainable civil infrastructures. The proposed joint concept also has broad applicability in other types of concrete construction, including offshore and nuclear structures. The data collected from these novel testing and measurement approaches will serve as benchmarks for the development of new theories for numerical modeling and engineering simulations, which could not be considered previously because of the lack of supporting experimental data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadening Participation Activities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Houston (UH) is a Hispanic-Serving Institution. The UH student body of nearly 40,000 students is one of the most diverse in the United States. Educational modules will be developed and introduced in three courses to influence the education of more than 100 students per year. Because of the inherent campus diversity, these educational initiatives will naturally reach a diverse audience. Graduate and undergraduate students will be recruited from underrepresented groups. In collaboration with a local high school with more than 90% underrepresented students, a field trip will be organized every year for 25 students to visit the UH campus and participate in hands-on training. In addition, one high school teacher will be recruited every summer to gain exposure to research activities and help develop a course module for high school physics courses. Through the developed education activities, high school teachers, high school students, and undergraduate and graduate students will have an opportunity to interact and learn from each other. The course modules will directly derive from the research findings and be implemented in high school and college level courses, thereby naturally integrating research and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has been funded through the Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering solicitation, which is part of the Broadening Participation in Engineering Program of the Engineering Education and Centers Division.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Special moment frames (SMF) are commonly used in low- and medium-rise buildings located in regions of high seismicity. Although prior earthquakes showed adequate performance of this seismic force resisting system in protecting buildings from collapse due to strong ground motions, formation of plastic hinges in the beams and columns, and shear cracks in the panel zone cause considerable damage to the beam-column joints. Recently, interest in using fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) has been growing to enhance energy absorption capacity and damage tolerance of beam-column joints and other components in reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. Prior research has mostly focused on the application of steel FRC (FRC) in 2-D beam-column joints. However, little is known about the performance of exterior beam-column joints that are usually subjected to more complex loading during an earthquake, involving bi-directional bending and torsion of the column. In addition to the loading, the geometry of the connection requires a more involved test setup (i.e., with an out-of-plane beam and proper boundary conditions). In this research, the use of engineered cementitious composites (ECC), a special type of high-performance fiber-reinforced cementitious composite (HPFRCC), in 3-D exterior beam-column joints is investigated both experimentally and numerically to improve building seismic performance. ECC, compared to conventional concrete, exhibits superior tensile ductility, energy absorption and shear resistance, in addition to improved bond performance with reinforcing steel (rebar). To better understand the performance of exterior beam-column joints under complex loading conditions, scaled 3-D specimens were constructed and tested under simulated seismic loads. To improve the performance of the joints, conventional RC was replaced with reinforced ECC (RECC) that extends from the panel zone to the adjoining beams and columns to cover the potential plastic hinge regions. Additionally, extensive computer simulations of full-scale building frames were conducted to quantify the collapse performance of buildings utilizing this concept and the results were used to develop seismic design factors for this new building type. The results suggest that the efficient use of ECC in the potential plastic hinge regions can improve the capacity and damage tolerance of beam-column joints under realistic seismic loading conditions, and they could lead to safer and more efficient buildings.</p> <p>Since the beginning of the project, one visiting scholar, one PhD student, one MS student, and five undergraduate students have participated in this project. These students gained knowledge on advanced concrete materials preparation, material characterization, multi-axial earthquake testing, finite element modeling and dynamic response of reinforced concrete buildings. Three of the undergraduate students (one from underrepresented groups) have won university level scholarships to participate in this research. These have been important outcomes of the project in terms of increasing the involvement of underrepresented students in engineering. This project has enabled the PI closely mentored these undergraduate students with regards to their academic activities. A partnership was established with a local high school in Houston (where the PI&rsquo;s former institution is located). More than 90% of the students are minorities and 75% of the students qualify for free or reduced lunch at this high school. Two field trips were organized to University of Houston (PI&rsquo;s former institution) campus. A total of 65 students and four teachers participated in these field trips. Eight-nine percent (58) of the students participating in the field trips were from underrepresented groups. During these trips both the high-school students and the teacher were made aware of the project activities and were conveyed other general information on civil and structural engineering. Further, hands-on activities were organized for these students in which they built Lego buildings and tested their designs on an educational shake table. According to post-assessment surveys given to the students at the end of the trips, 65% and 68%, respectively, of the students stated that their desire to learn more about engineering and their desire to continue on to the next level in their education increased after the field trip. 89%, 63% and 76%, respectively, of the students agreed or strongly agreed with the statements &ldquo;I am now more motivated to prepare myself to go to college&rdquo;, &ldquo;being an engineer can be exciting&rdquo; and &ldquo;knowing math and science is important for me to be successful in life&rdquo;. PI Gencturk has also prepared educational modules and a laboratory test on ECC which he implemented in his teaching of the undergraduate Mechanical Behavior of Materials course in Fall 2017. The students observed the differences in tensile properties of ECC with those of conventional concrete.</p> <p>This project has graduated one PhD and one MS student.
