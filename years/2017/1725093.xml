<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the Special Conference on Set-Theoretic Topology held at Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama, from Oct 20th to 22nd, 2017. The conference focuses on the advancement of research in topology and outreach in mathematics, with specific emphasis on set-theoretic topology. Set theory and general topology are fundamental mathematical disciplines, with common historical roots, and they serve as essential tools in many areas of mathematics. Set theoretic applications to topology have invigorated both fields since the proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis fifty years ago, and the synergy between them continues to invigorate the field of set-theoretic topology. Techniques developed to solve central questions in the field were instrumental in the development of the method of forcing, combinatorial set theory, and Ramsey theory. Set-theoretical techniques are also fundamental in recent work on the structure of non-separable Banach spaces and the study of rings of continuous functions and topological vector spaces. Quite naturally, set-theoretic topology also is close to logic and has much in common with finite combinatorics and theoretical computer science in its study of partial orders, Boolean algebra, and continuous lattices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will feature both three plenary talks and eighteen contributed research talks, as well as a session on open problems. This grant will be used to support travel for participants, especially for students, young researchers, women, and underrepresented groups.
