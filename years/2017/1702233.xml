<AbstractNarration>This project concerns the investigation of connections between algebra, algebraic geometry, and topology. Algebraic geometry studies properties of geometric objects that are invariant under transformations given by polynomial functions, while topology studies properties invariant under smooth, continuous deformations.  The goal is to gain a better understanding of the way that structures in algebraic geometry are reflected by structures in topology, using a blend of algebraic and topological methods.  The investigator aims to settle several important longstanding conjectures in this area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One part of the project is to find a cleaner proof of the recently-verified Bloch-Kato conjecture. A related part of the project is to understand how Voevodsky's slice filtration is related to algebraic cobordism and other motivic spectra and to verify several of the slice conjectures. The investigator will also study the relationship between the singularities of a variety, its K-theory, and its cdh-cohomology, using recently-developed cohomological techniques. Another part of this project is to relate the algebraic Witt group of a real surface to a recently-developed topological invariant, one that is easier to compute.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, three major goals were achieved. The most important was the completion of a book, proving a theorem that had been conjectured for over 30 years,  giving formulas that connect motivic cohomology and K-theory.  The proof was due to many people, spanning a couple of dozen papers, and our achievement was to consolidate and simplify the proof, making the results and tool more accessible.  A second achievement was the development of a theory of Hermiian K-theory for topologcal spaces with an involution, which is tightly bound to the corresponding theory for algebraic varieties,  The third achievement was to use Topological Data Analysis on an interval to establish the existence of a fixed-point  for certain differential equations.  This is the beginning of an analysis of the loss of information arising in the use of Topological Data Analysis.  In terms of Broader Achievements, my student Glen WIlson received his phD, studying the motivic homotopy groups of spheres, He is now a post-doc in Oslo, Norway.  I also gave a series of Introductory lectures in Buenos Aires (2018), and in Cambridge UK (2020). on algebraic K-theory, with muti-national audiences of young researchers; the Argentina lectures included a dozen US reearchers and about 25 students from South America, and the Cambridge lectures had audiences of over 100 students from Europe and Asia.
