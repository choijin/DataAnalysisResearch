<AbstractNarration>Coral diseases have increased significantly throughout the past 30 years. Climate change and other detrimental environment factors are likely to blame. Unhealthy coral reefs cannot support the fish and other life that make the reef a vibrant and diverse ecosystem.  Corals reefs in the Caribbean Sea are disease hotspots and many reefs have experienced population collapses due to outbreaks of disease. Importantly, coral species vary in their susceptible to disease, but the reasons behind this variation are unknown. This project will quantify coral susceptibility to disease by examining coral immunity using several novel approaches and experiments. Seven species of coral that differ in disease susceptibility, growth rates, growth form and reproductive strategies will be used. Immune responses of each species of coral will be measured by exposing the corals to bacterial immune stimulators. Susceptibility to white plague disease, a prevalent disease affecting many species of corals, will also be measured by exposing the corals to active white plague disease and calculating disease transmission rates. The immune response and disease transmission data for each coral species will be used to develop a predictive model to determine how different coral communities will respond to disease threats under climate change scenarios. This project will support graduate students at University of Texas, Arlington (Hispanic-serving Institution) and University of Virgin Islands (Historically Black University) and many undergraduate students at all three institutions (Mote Marine Laboratory). This research will be highlighted at outreach events at all three institutions which take place regularly and include Earth Day Texas in Dallas, TX, Mote's Living Reef Exhibit and Aquarium in Sarasota, FL and "Reef Fest" and Agricultural fairs in the U.S. Virgin Islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Environmental changes, such as ocean warming, have led to an increase in the prevalence of coral diseases, causing region-wide population collapses in some locations. However, not all coral species, or even populations within species, are affected by disease equally. Some species are host to many different types of diseases, but have limited mortality. Other species suffer significant disease-related mortality. How and why disease susceptibility differs among species and the effects of this differential susceptibility on reef community structure and composition are currently unknown. This project will use immune-challenge experiments that will quantify novel components of the innate immune system of corals, coupled with the application of a trait-based model, to fulfill three goals: 1) Determine variability of coral immune traits in seven common coral species found on Caribbean reefs, 2) Determine the variability in resistance to white plague disease transmission in the same coral species 3) Develop a predictive model of coral community assemblage that incorporates immune traits. Quantification of coral immunity will also incorporate unique approaches, such as combining full transcriptome sequencing with protein activity assays for a gene-to-phenotype analysis. Data will be mapped onto immune pathways for comprehensive pathway evaluation between coral species and these will serve as trait inputs into a "traitspace" model. These traits will provide continuous data within the model, which will create a probability density function (PDF) for the trait distributions of each species. These PDFs will then be used to determine the probability of species under different disease exposure scenarios. Model analyses will determine which traits influence community structure and characterize how disease exposure and the immune response will predict community assemblages through space and time. The completion and application of a trait-base model that incorporates extensive immunity parameters (none of which have been applied to trait models within coral ecosystems) is a distinct product from this project.</AbstractNarration>

While progress has been made to forecast disease outbreaks, we still lack a comparative understanding of the variation in disease susceptibility among coral species. This study compared the phenotypic and microbial responses of seven abundant Caribbean coral species after exposure to white plague disease, a widespread rapid tissue loss disease of corals. The seven coral species represented diverse life history traits, which affect their ecological function and ultimately shape Caribbean coral reef ecosystems. A spectrum of disease susceptibility was observed among the seven coral species tested with disease exposure, and the microbial response to disease corresponded with the phenotypic response. Microbial communities of control corals also showed significant differences among species, but these differences lessened with exposure to and onset of disease. Further analysis highlighted bacteria that may be driving the differences between interspecies and intraspecies disease resistance, including groups that have previously been identified as anti-bacterial or etiological candidates for antibacterial, etiological, or opportunistic properties, which may explain the observed phenotypic susceptibility. The project provides a framework for testing multi-species diseases that can help to identify disease resistant traits, including important components of the microbiome that may make certain corals more or less susceptible to disease.</p> <p>This project brought together students, staff, and researchers from three woman-led science laboratories, which resulted in an abundance of opportunities for cross-training and multi-level mentoring. Over the course of the project, one post-doctoral research associate from an under-represented minority (URM) background, and three female masters students and two female undergraduates (one from an URM background) were trained in field and laboratory-based methods dealing with coral disease transmission. One additional female masters student was provided the opportunity to cross-train in disease ecology and microbiology and bioinformatics through an exchange between the Brandt and Mydlarz laboratories.
