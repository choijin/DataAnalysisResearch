<AbstractNarration>This research project will produce a detailed portrait of the geopolitical orientations of the populations in nine countries across the post-Soviet regions of Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia.  The investigators will systematically explain the reasons for such orientations, including pro and anti-Russian and Western opinions, and they will assess the consistency of these orientations in the context of significant domestic political changes, regional economic disparities, sizable population movements and geopolitical shifts, and possible continuation or spreading of violent confrontations between Russian and Western-backed forces across the Eurasian region.  The project will contribute to understanding the political dynamics of successor states of the former Soviet Union as they negotiate imperial legacies, economic interdependence, and dynamic geopolitical competition and change in the region.  In contrast with standard international relations approaches, which tend to focus on elite politics within states and large state geopolitical competition over these states and contested separatist region, the project will focus on enhancing knowledge about the attitudes and beliefs of ordinary residents of these states.  The increased understanding of the geopolitical orientations of residents along Russia's borderland states will provide valuable new insights to inform the development and conduct of foreign policy in the U.S. and other states.  Project findings will help increase on-the-ground knowledge of domestic contexts of foreign-policy choices in regions at a time of polarization, suspicion, crisis, and uncertainty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholars, policy makers, and the public have increased interest in Russia's exercise of "soft power" (the expansion of its influence through persuasion and attraction rather than military or economic pressure) and other forms of power.  The reaction to these efforts by the populations in non-Russian regions of the former Soviet Union has not been comprehensively or intensively measured, however.  This project will examine how the geopolitical crisis that began with the Russian annexation of Crimea has reshaped the geopolitical outlook of the different populations in countries and disputed territories of the former Soviet Union that border Russia.  Critical to the future of the region is the relative attractiveness of Russian, the West, and other states to domestic populations.  The project will focus on the political attitudes and identifications of ordinary people, not state elites.  The investigators who are collaborating in the conduct of this project are political geographers and political scientists from the United States and the United Kingdom who are experts in post-Soviet affairs.  They will conduct a simultaneous set of public opinion surveys of nine independent states, four existing de facto republics in separatist regions, and two contested territories within Ukraine.  The investigators will examine select media outputs across the former Soviet Union and will conduct two waves of a large public opinion survey of 15,000 respondents to gauge and understand geopolitical attitudes and orientations.  They will employ a mixed-methods approach that combines the examination of cultural and news broadcasts in all the study sites and quantitative analysis of data from a two-wave survey panel.  This award is made under the auspices of the NSF Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences-Research Councils of the United Kingdom (SBE-RCUK) Lead Agency Agreement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
