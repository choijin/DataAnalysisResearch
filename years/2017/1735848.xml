<AbstractNarration>Science plays a critical role in informing the multi-trillion dollar investment needed to rebuild and modernize American infrastructure to better serve societal needs. This science policy research report will address the science-to-action gap for infrastructure by identifying how public investments can be better managed to produce information to inform the next generation of infrastructure design, construction and operation. This review will help guide science policy-makers on investments best suited to inform the rebuilding and expansion of modern, resilient, and sustainable infrastructure critical to support U.S. businesses, communities, and citizens in the 21st century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing upon pertinent and critical evidence on science and boundary organizations, and related practitioner expertise, this research utilizes innovative and robust methods to advance fundamental knowledge about the science-action-gap for infrastructure investment. The collaborative research team will identify evidence-based science policy ideas through a series of input gathering methods, including expert elicitation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Actionable science can play a critical role in informing how we approach the solution to the complex, highly uncertain, and often contested problems we face in the 21st century. However, there is a persistent and costly knowledge-to-action gap that hinders the production and application of relevant scientific knowledge for societal benefit. Drawing upon an emerging empirical literature that examines alternative approaches to science and science funding, this science policy research report offers a range of actions that science policy-makers and science funding program managers could take to help narrow the knowledge-to-action gap.   Science policy research suggests that the ways in which we currently fund and organize scientific research is insufficient to support solving 21st century problems including but not limited to challenges arising from rapid population growth and human migration, technological, societal, and economic disruption, and climate change. The collaborative research team, led by the Aspen Global Change Institute, undertook a compressive literature review across a wide range of literature on science policy, research evaluation, knowledge utilization, political science, engineering, and other disciplinary, multi-, and inter-disciplinary scholarship to advance fundamental knowledge about the knowledge-action-gap and to form the basis for science policy recommendations to bridge that gap. Three strategic areas of opportunity for science policy were identified: 1) Research investments in institutions that help to broker and bridge knowledge producers and users across the boundaries of science, policy, and practice; 2) Research investments in science that can further knowledge about and for transformation; 3) Changes to research investment institutions to enhance reporting and evaluation routines and adaptiveness to be more responsive and to enhance the likelihood of achieving greater societal benefits including narrowing the knowledge-action gap.
