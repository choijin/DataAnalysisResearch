<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation (NSF) Dear Colleague Letter NSF 17-092: Improving Undergraduate STEM Education in Hispanic Serving Institutions called for projects to support conferences that would identify the most critical challenges and opportunities regarding undergraduate science, technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) education at HSIs, and potential actionable solutions that fall within NSF's mission, policies, and practices. Laredo Community College (LCC), Texas A &amp; M International University (TAMIU), Texas A &amp; M University-Kingsville (TAMUK), and University of Texas Permian Basin (UTPB) responded to the call by proposing a conference to bring together key stakeholders in undergraduate STEM education at two and four-year public and private Texas HSI colleges and universities in order to inform the design of NSF's Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program. The rationale for the proposed HSI PROMISE: Providing Resources and Opportunities for Minorities in STEM Education conference is based on the great need as well as the great potential to generate new knowledge on effective programs and strategies to recruit, to retain, and to graduate Hispanics in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will be held in March 2018 in Laredo, Texas, through the Texas Hispanic Serving Institutions Consortium (TxHSIC), an organization which unites such entities.  The conference will convene faculty and administrators from over 83 public and private colleges, universities, community-based organizations and business entities. Media announcements and pre-conference meetings will secure at least 100 attendees from institutions in Texas and at least 100 virtual participants.  Sessions at the HSI PROMISE Conference will primarily focus on undergraduate STEM Education and will provide a networked conduit to provide input to NSF. However, to reap the broader benefit of this effort, students must be empowered to become leaders and partners in STEM innovation. The voices of students currently enrolled in STEM disciplines will be included through focus groups both live and via teleconference with MAES (Latinos in Engineering and Science) LCC and Texas chapters and TAMIU, TAMUK, and UTPB Noyce Scholars. As part of the assessment, the conference will include participation from researchers from the Center for Research and Policy in Education at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSAP). For broader national input and impact the 12 community colleges in the NSF funded, HRD#1450661 KickStarter project with Science Foundation Arizona have been invited to participate via teleconference. A major output of the conference will be a report which will include a list of potential actionable solutions that fall within NSF's mission, policies, and practices and a policy brief through Center for Research and Policy in Education at UTSA. A major outcome will be the continued collaboration of Texas HSIs to secure funding and the optimization of impact from NSF support.</AbstractNarration>

As part of the Intellectual Merit, the HSI PROMISE Conference Grant, held in March 2018 at Laredo College, generated new knowledge on the needs and successful programs and strategies to recruit, to retain, and to graduate Hispanics and other underrepresented groups in STEM. The PIs produced a report that was widely disseminated. The consultants produced a Policy Brief&nbsp;distributed at over 10 different venues.&nbsp;These included the second conference held in San Antonio, University of the Incarnate Word 5/2019, NYC HSI conference, HACU 2019, HSI Forum at Texas State University 9/20/2019, American Association for Hispanics in Higher Education 2019, and at the NSF HSI Project Director's Conference in November 2019. The Policy Brief "Realizing the PROMISE of Success for Latinx STEM Students (Rendon, Nora, Cabrales, Ray, December 2018) is available on the Texas Hispanic Serving Institutions Consortium's website. The information generated served as a springboard for discussions and grant applications submitted and awarded for 2019. Specifically in south Texas, a Texas A&amp;M University Kingsville NSF HSI grant will benefit many STEM students&nbsp;as they transition into STEM majors from high school and from 2-year colleges to universities.</p> <p>As part of the broader impact, the conferences brought together hundreds of administrators, faculty, and students from over 50 institutions in Texas, California, Arizona, and New Mexico. The first conference saw STEM student participation from Laredo College and counterparts via video conference from San Antonio, Texas,&nbsp;California, and Arizona. For the second conference, over 15 counterparts from New Mexico participated. Institutional representatives presented posters on successful strategies with students in STEM education. An NSF HSI Hub representative and an NSF HSI Program Officer also attended and this 2020 conference they will be present to provide an extensive technical grant writing assistance workshop to attendees. The NSF support provided the visibility to the Texas Hispanic Serving Institutions Consortium such that the University of Arizona, a newly designated HSI contacted the PI to find out how to organize a similar consortium for Arizona.</p> <p>The short and mid-term outcomes from the Logic Model were achieved. Time will tell if the gathering of input from stakeholders for the NSF results in economic, societal, and environmental outcomes from increased numbers of STEM graduates and professionals in Texas and
