<AbstractNarration>In plants and animals, past and present forms and functions are linked across time and space. This fundamental principle underlies the continuity of life on Earth. It also shapes contemporary adaptations. Yet, despite the importance of this principle, scientists know little about how current adaptations in animals are shaped by past functions, random events or current necessities. This research addresses this question directly, by studying a common bird species, the House Finch. Over the last century, House Finches have successfully colonized much of North America. As a result of their ongoing colonization, House Finches are now found in a wide range of habitats. They have evolved diverse, yet precise, beak shapes that enable them to thrive in new environments. Capitalizing on a unique network of long-term study populations that span diverse habitats and histories, the researchers will trace the origin of developmental mechanisms that produce such versatility. The key benefit of this work is that it allows us to decipher how a species history shapes and predicts its current adaptability and future survival. The highly visible nature of bird invasions helps ensure continuing public participation in this research. In addition, the researchers will take advantage of well-established local media contacts, and collaborations with a range of tribal, rural, and naturalist groups to engage public audiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For evolution to proceed, maintaining currently adaptive traits must not prevent innovation in the same traits. Although such a system must be in place for traits to evolve, its organizational principles are largely unknown. In this project, the researchers focus on a natural system where it is possible to directly observe how the past influences the development of new adaptations. As House Finch populations have expanded across North America, they have created a network of recently established populations that differ in the amount of time each population has been established in a new environment. These populations allow the researchers to simultaneously observe how complex beak architecture evolves to different habitats as it happens. Specifically, by exploring patterns in transcription and growth factors known to regulate beak development, the researchers can gain insight into how the past influences adaptive evolution. The contrast between the patterns observed in transcription and growth factors provides crucial insight into the mechanisms behind historical continuity of past and present functional forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
