<AbstractNarration>The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A request is made to fund Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment for the R/V Hugh R Sharp, a 146 foot Regional research vessel operated by the University of Delaware as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The R/V Hugh R Sharp is a state-of-the-art, coastal research vessel that is owned and operated by the University of Delaware. The vessel can carry fourteen to twenty scientists on cruises up to eighteen days in duration, and supports projects from all disciplines of oceanography. The vessel is a regional asset, serving researchers from many institutions throughout the mid-Atlantic. The vessel typically operates in the coastal waters from Long Island, New York, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as well as the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays. Projects occasionally require the vessel to work as far north as the Gulf of Maine, as far south as Florida, and as far offshore as Bermuda. In 2016, the R/V Hugh R Sharp completed 180 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 38 days or 21% of the sailing schedule. In 2017, R/V Hugh R Sharp is scheduled for 180 days with NSF days accounting for 18% (33 days) of the total sailing schedule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Dynamic Positioning (DP) System Upgrade $204,787</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award funded an upgrade to the Univeristy of Delaware R/V HUGH R SHARP?s Dynamic Positioning (DP) system.   The vessel is part of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) Academic Research Fleet.  One of the most sought after capabilities of the Research Vessel HUGH R SHARP (SHARP) is Dynamic Positioning (DP).  DP is a computerized navigation control system which allows the ship to maintain a precise position and orientation at sea during oceanographic sampling.  The system takes in information from sensors measuring wind, currents, ship position, ship heading, ship speed, and ship pitch and roll motion.  The information is processed as an environmental condition model and used to calculate the direction and amount of power to apply to the ship?s propulsion drives and thruster to keep the ship precisely over a programmed spot and pointing in the desired direction.  The existing system was approaching 15 years of service and was no longer supported.  The upgraded system enhances the SHARP's capability to provide precise statioin keeping and positioning during science operations.  Intellectual Merit:   The proposed equipment upgrade will help the SHARP better support scientific operations and data collection in the mid-Atlantic region.  The intellectual merit of these individual projects is determined by peer review at NSF.  The research must have the potential to advance or transform knowledge to be meritorious enough to warrant funding by NSF.  Research projects conducted at sea rely on the ship?s capabilities.  Without capable, reliable, science collection platforms, the research itself would not be possible, or the data collected would not be of the highest quality possible to achieve the advancement of knowledge desired.    All research requiring precise position and/or orientation capability funded for utilization of the SHARP will benefit from the upgrade of the DP system.  Reliability and redundancy of the ship?s systems enable the most safe and efficient execution of research at sea.   Broader Impacts:  The number of missions supported by the HUGH R SHARP typically exceeds twenty per year, with 175-195 days at sea.  Demand for DP capability is likely to increase in the future as remote and autonomous vehicles continue to be more widely used as sensor platforms to support research at sea.  The research the SHARP supports at sea is utilized to increase overall knowledge of the vast oceans and to address issues and potential benefits to society.  The SHARP is truly a shared-use science support facility.  Funding for science support equipment provides the research community with the most reliable, modern and capable platform possible.
