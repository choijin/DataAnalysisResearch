<AbstractNarration>The Workshop on "Valleytronic Materials, Applications, and Devices" will be held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA on 22-23 August, 2017. It will focus on a class of devices and will host leading Valleytronics researchers in the field whose expertise range from synthesis, characterizations, device development, theory and applications. The devices make use of the momentum state of charge carriers instead of, or in combination with, charge and/or spin and are expected to provide a new degree of freedom for information processing. The Workshop seeks financial support to allow extension of the conference to include student and postdoc attendees, a student poster session, a student/postdoc lunch and a Q&amp;A session, and a half day extension to the workshop to develop a draft of a whitepaper in the area of valleytronics. The meeting will be attended by graduate students as both an educational opportunity (similar to a 2-day short-course in Valleytronics) and as an opportunity to interact with senior researchers to whom they otherwise may not have access at larger symposia. A poster session is also planned for graduate students and postdocs to present their work related to the field.</AbstractNarration>
