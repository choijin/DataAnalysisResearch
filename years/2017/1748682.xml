<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 13-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum and the G8 countries Heads of Research Councils. The Belmont Forum is a high level group of the world's major and emerging funders of global environmental change research and international science councils.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. The G8 Heads of Research Councils developed a funding framework to support multilateral research projects that address global challenges in ways that are beyond the capacity of national or bilateral activities. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders.  This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working together in an inaugural call of the International Opportunities Fund, the Belmont Forum and G8HORCs have provided support for research projects that seek to deliver knowledge needed for action to mitigate and adapt to detrimental environmental change and extreme hazardous events that relate to either Freshwater Security or Coastal Vulnerability.  This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports research activities that will develop a versatile modeling framework that can be applied to evaluate the unique functioning, critical stressors, and vulnerability of the world?s deltas. Deltas are economically and environmentally important systems, sustaining a large portion of the world?s populations, economic activity, and ecosystems. These systems are deteriorating rapidly due to climate changes, catchment changes, and local exploitation and ecosystem degradation. This project will develop an evidence-based framework for global delta sustainability by (1) advancing delta sustainability science as critical coupled human-natural systems; (2) co-design, -develop, and -deliver an evidence-based sustainability framework for risk assessment and decision support; (3) build an international repository of integrated delta datasets; and (4) develop and implement a modeling and decision support framework in partnership with local stakeholders. Applicable from local to national levels, this framework will be applied to three case-studies in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna, Mekong, and Amazon deltas. This project will contribute toward effective regional delta management and governance by providing a mechanism to integrate social, economic, bio-physical, and ecosystem services components to assess delta vulnerability and guide sustainable management strategies and decisions across scales, in collaboration with experts and stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ DELTAS: Catalyzing Action Towards Sustainability of Deltaic Systems with an Integrated Modeling Framework for Risk Assessment  Deltas are bread baskets for large global areas, and are also complex, fragile social-ecological systems. The fragility of these systems and uncertainties around climate change impacts mean that unique ecosystems and millions of people are under threat. The DELTAS project tackled this complexity by working together across disciplines and with key local stakeholders in three major deltas: Amazon, Mekong, and Ganges-Brahmaputra to develop comprehensive risk assessment frameworks which incorporate environmental, physical and social indicators and are applicable to deltas globally. The DELTAS approach can be adopted for other vulnerable areas, including drylands, glaciers, and urban areas to analyze contemporary and future risks and explore scenarios for risk-reducing investments.  We present below three research domains built upon different arrangements of interdisciplinary collaborations.  Understanding deltas as biophysical systems: advancing quantitative delta classification   A rigorous mathematical framework for studying deltas using graph theory was developed wherein delta channel networks are represented as directed graphs, with junctions as nodes and channels as links, and it was shown that via simple algebraic operations on the ?adjacency matrix? (a sparse matrix that contains all information about network connectivity), several topologic and dynamic properties of deltas can be computed, as well as vulnerability maps constructed depicting the areas of the network where disturbances would most significantly affect the shoreline fluxes. This framework allowed the research team to develop a suite of metrics that capture the topologic and dynamic complexity of deltas. This TopoDynamic perspective of delta networks sets the foundation for quantitative and comparative classifications of deltas.  Understanding deltas as social-ecological systems: conceptualization and application  One of the focal areas of the project has involved the design of a problem-oriented conceptual framework to analyze deltas as coupled social-ecological systems. The two main components of the framework are: (a) defining boundaries and interdependencies and (b) defining and outlining the components of the collective action situation.  This framework has been used to give a new definition of the Amazon delta that combines biophysical, hydrological, and social-political dimensions. An application of the framework is on the modeling and analysis of socio-economic vulnerability to flooding in urban areas of the Amazon delta. The framework is also currently being used to help diagnose a growing collective-action problem related to the impacts of urban growth and pollution on small-scale fishing resources in the Amazon delta.  Understanding delta vulnerability through modeling and participatory approaches   Comparative assessment of relative risk to flooding for 48 deltas globally   The research team developed estimates of flood risk in terms of the expected loss caused by flood events. Risk is high in deltas where extreme flood events are more likely to occur (high hazards), where more people live in low-lying areas exposed to flooding (high exposure), and where social vulnerability to flooding is high and greater flood exposure is more likely to cause harm (high vulnerability). Empirically defined indicators were used to locate 48 global deltas within the risk space defined by these three components, supporting a comparative assessment of relative levels of risk. The indicator-based risk framework can be used effectively in large-scale inter-delta comparative studies, especially as a complement to higher-resolution studies at the local scale.  Global Delta Vulnerability Index (GDVI)   The GDVI aims to provide a social-ecological system (SES) centered assessment approach for delta vulnerability globally and includes: (1) a multi-hazard vulnerability assessment method encompassing social and ecosystem susceptibility, social adaptive and coping capacities as well as ecosystem robustness; (2) a set of multidimensional indicators developed from a combination of a detailed literature review and regional expert consultations and knowledge co-production workshops in focal deltas; and, (3) an ?indicator library? allowing for a flexible indicator selection depending on the environment and data availability. Regional expert consultations with stakeholder groups helped characterize sub-delta areas prone to different types of hazards and developed a list of vulnerability indicators relevant to both the social and ecological part of the SES.  Besides advancing scientific knowledge, the BF Deltas project team also played a leading role in raising international awareness of the importance and vulnerability of deltas worldwide that includes writing a collaborative article calling for an International Year of Deltas and creation of the ICSU Sustainable Deltas Initiative 2015.  Products of the project include: peer reviewed publications including synthesis and action papers (~75 with papers published in Science, Nature Climate Change, Nature Sustainability, PNAS, among others), 2 Special issues in scientific journals (Sustainability Science and Elementa: Deltas in the Anthropocene), and Science Brief on the Sustainable Development Goals.  Data sets and web-based modelling tools are open access and accessible via the project website: https://delta.umn.edu.  Public outreach activities include the video Minute Earth: Why Do Rivers Have Deltas? with 1.14 million views as of July 12, 2018, Science on a Sphere, and River Delta animation.
