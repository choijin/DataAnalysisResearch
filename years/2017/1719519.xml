<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program provides support projects to design, implement, and assess strategies that can lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. The project at North Carolina Central University seeks to produce the next generation of scientists who are creative problem solvers, self-directed learners, innovators, knowledge generators, and economic stimulators. The overall goal is to significantly increase the retention and graduation rate of underrepresented minority students at the University choosing career paths in STEM majors, graduate programs, and workforce.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The activities and strategies involve: implementing a proactive advising system; contributing to students' science identity development; launching problem-based learning pedagogy in undergraduate mathematics and science courses; and stimulating innovation and entrepreneurial thinking. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and what is learned through this project can serve as a model for other institutions. The project is informed by an on-going evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major aim of this one-year project was to pilot new initiatives that could enhance STEM teaching and learning and to expand infusing innovation and entrepreneurship experiences and training in the academic and professional development of students seeking to earn STEM degrees.  Intellectual Merit:  Drawing on lessons learned from previous work, this project takes a "holistic" approach to assure retention through multiple strategies including financial assistance, proactive advising, academic support services, mentoring, and enrichment. The activities piloted involved: (1) implementing a proactive advising system; (2) contributing to students? science identity development; (3) launching project-based learning (PBL) pedagogy in undergraduate mathematics and science courses; and (4) stimulating innovation and entrepreneurial thinking development.  A dedicated Academic Advisor and Adjunct Assistant professor led implementation of proactive advising of physics/engineering dual degree program students utilizing SuccessNavigator&reg;, Grades First&reg;, BANNER, one-on-one advising sessions, counseling services, and various other student support mechanisms.
