<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Delaware State University (DSU) aims to engage undergraduate students in energy-related interdisciplinary materials science projects in the context of a MakerLab. The project will provide materials chemistry training to chemistry undergraduate students, through annual internships and through undergraduate research projects. The intervention is centered on engaging students traditionally underrepresented and underserved in STEM with the focus of increasing recruitment, retention, graduation rates and job placement in STEM-related fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the project is to implement experiential learning activities in the undergraduate chemistry program by enhancing the integration of education and research in the unique framework of a MakerLab. The specific objectives are to 1) develop MakerLab starter kits towards guiding/facilitating hands-on learning in materials science relevant to energy applications, 2) implement MakerLab learning experiences by offering access to year-round mini-projects integrated as junior research in the undergraduate curriculum, 3) develop curricular enhancements to include lecture and laboratory modules in chemistry courses that apply to the dual offered courses (DSU and Early College High School at DSU) in the Department of Chemistry, 4) organize outreach activities targeted to engage general public awareness of new energy technologies, and 5) disseminate the results of the project by i) promoting adoption of educational materials by peer universities, ii) presenting results to the American Chemical Society Education division symposia, and iii) publishing outcomes of the interventions in peer-reviewed journals. The accomplishment of the project will enhance the institution's ability to create challenging instructional programs.</AbstractNarration>

The project aligns with the University's strategic goals in promoting high-quality education at DSU by exposing the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students to experiential learning toward increasing the recruitment, retention, and job placement or admission into the graduate program of students after the Bachelor of Science (BS) degree. &nbsp;</p> <p>The project team consisted of two Physics and Engineering (Dr. Gabriel Gwanmesia, Dr. Aristedes Marcano) and one Chemistry (Dr. Bizuneh Workie) faculty members. Throughout the grant, the team directly supervised ten (10) Physics and Engineering and eight (8) Chemistry, undergraduate students. The student participants consisted of ten (10) females (<em>seven African-Americans, one Hispanic, </em><em>two Asians</em>) and seven (7) males (<em>four African-Americans, one Hispanic, two Asians</em>). Although the main research areas were renewable energy and environmental sustainability, some students' projects were in the mentoring faculty's specialized fields. The students conducted focused research projects for eight to ten weeks in the summer, and many continued the work with the faculty mentors during the semester. The students received stipends from the Targeted Infusion grant, supplemented by funds from the DSU Renewable Energy Education Center (REEC) supported by Delmarva power in Delaware.</p> <p>The students presented the research results at the DSU <strong><em>Honors Day</em></strong> held yearly in the Spring semester and the <strong><em>Summer Research Symposium</em></strong> at the end of the summer, where undergraduate students supported by the Federally funded programs present their research results. The diverse programs promote a DSU unifying theme of excellence in research and educational experiences to advance its mission and strategic priorities. In the summer of 2020, the DSU vice president's office for research organized a<strong><em> Virtual Summer Research Symposium </em></strong>for the research presentations due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>We observed the students' communication efficiency to increase remarkably through the group practice in preparation for the posters' oral presentation. The students shared knowledge across disciplines, helping other group members to learn the individual projects' connections across the fields. By the end of each project period, the students could effectively describe the project procedure, results, and conclusion within the presentation's time. Most students were able to formulate new scientific questions developing from their research to advance the project.&nbsp;</p> <p>Four students undertook projects to satisfy the Capstone Stone course required for seniors by the Division of Physics, Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Sciences (PEMaCS), and the Biology and Chemistry departments. The students submit a research report to the appropriate department committee and give an oral presentation to the department in partial fulfillment of the BS degree requirements.</p> <p>We used the Targeted Infusion resources, supplemented by the characterization of thermoelectric materials, fuel cell generation of hydrogen, hydrogen use for energy generation, and photovoltaic plates' conversion efficiency materials of the REEC, to integrate aspects of the students' research projects into the <em>Introduction to Research</em> and <em>Theoretical and Experimental Research</em> courses in the Division of Physics, Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Sciences (PEMaCS). Similarly, we integrated the Targeted Infusion material into two chemistry courses (<em>Seminar in Chemistry</em>, <em>Electroanalytical Chemistry</em>). About sixty (60) students register in the PEMaCS and Chemistry courses yearly.</p> <p>We organized an ethics workshop in the summer to teach the trainees about the scientific enterprise's moral and ethical issues. The workshop emphasized the tremendous impact of misconduct on science and society that, although rare, can compromise the research integrity by eroding the public's trust in science and wasting tax-payers' resources. We reinforced the value of collaborative research involving the cooperation and coordination among scientists in different disciplines and institutions by instituting group research projects to teach trust, accountability, mutual respect, and fairness essential for the enterprise's success. Appropriate bibliographical citations and acknowledgments in the research abstracts, posters, and reports submitted for the capstone BS degree requirements reflect the ethics values acquired in the workshop.</p> <p>Seven trainees of the program have graduated with a BS degree and seek admission into the graduate school. Most students have continued to research with the PEMaCS and Chemistry faculty. The students help recruit other students into other DSU funded research training programs by sharing their experiences at various freshman university seminar meetings and indirectly by posting their posters along the department's hallways. More than sixty students have benefited through participation in laboratory projects in the four PEMaCS and Chemistry courses developed from the Targeted Infusion research materials.</p> <p>We published two peer-reviewed manuscripts from the project, with one under review. We also published two conference proceedings with acknowledgment of the Targeted Infusion funding. The undergraduate students are co-authors in the publications of the proceedings.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified:
