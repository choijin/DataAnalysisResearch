<AbstractNarration>Forum on Building Research and Education Capacity in Advance Computing, Communications, and Information Systems at HBCUs is designed to increase the research capacity in computer science at HBCUs. The work is in response to the Dear Colleague Letter issued by NSF (17-027) that suggests that HBCUs are an important component of the higher education infrastructure in the United States and the institutions and students would benefit from greater research capacity in critical STEM areas.  In the case of computer science, the Forum addresses the need to close the knowledge gap between CS departments at HBCUs and program officers in CISE directing the core research programs. In addition to closing the knowledge gap, QEM offers technical assistance specifically tailored to enable successful long term research capacity development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QEM offers a timely approach to addressing improvement of research capacity in computer science at HBCUs. Intentional technical assistance covers the range of necessary steps to increasing research success that include activities from tailored proposal development to innovative institutional collaboration. As the national focus on post-secondary CS education and institutional research capacity increases, the development of innovative means of strengthening the capacity of HBCUs is critical. The Forum is the beginning of an ongoing effort specifically between CISE and 25 CS departments at HBCUs to catalyze this work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In July, 2018, with NSF support, the Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network conducted a one-and-a-half-day outreach forum, and related follow-up activities, focused on broadening participation of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the National Science Foundation (NSF)?s Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) Directorate?s Core research programs.      The CISE forum was held at the Hilton Baltimore at BWI Airport, in Baltimore, MD. Thirty-seven (37) faculty/administrators from 18 HBCUs attended the CISE forum representing eight states and the District of Columbia. Prior to attending the forum, participants were asked to identify the CISE core research program/division that was best fit for their proposal ideas. QEM staff used this information to assign teams to small group break-out sessions that were led by consultants.      Forum plenary sessions featured presentations and discussion by NSF officers on overview of the Foundation and various CISE Core Research Programs as well as essentials of NSF proposal preparation. A range of topics was also discussed at the three panel discussions featuring program officers; industry partners; and STEM students.     At the conclusion of the July 2018 forum, participants were asked to complete a Forum Evaluation Questionnaire to rate the usefulness of the sessions. Thirty-five (35) of the 37 participants completed the end-of-forum questionnaire (95 percent response rate). On a scale of 1 to 5 (5=excellent and 1=poor), majority of the respondents rated the forum as "Very good or Excellent" in all five areas. Organization of the forum received the highest rating with an average score of 4.79; followed by overall rating of the forum 4.76; clarity of goals 4.75; usefulness of materials provided 4.63; and length of forum 4.51.     A search of NSF?s awards database revealed that a participant representing one of the institution at the July 2018 CISE Forum received an award totaling $298,783 in FY 2019.       The most valuable aspects of the forum as noted by a majority of respondents included: information provided by NSF program officers; panel discussions by program officers; opportunity to network with program officers and colleagues; small group break-out sessions; and importance of collaborating with other HBCUs.         ABOUT QEM NETWORK  The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network was established in 1990 as a non-profit organization in Washington, DC, dedicated to improving education for minorities throughout the nation. QEM works with minority and non-minority individuals, organizations, and institutions to help coordinate and energize efforts to improve the education of minorities, particularly in STEM.
