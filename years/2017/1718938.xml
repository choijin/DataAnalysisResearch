<AbstractNarration>The promise of molecular programming lies in its ability to not only process information autonomously, but to do so in a biochemical context in order to sense and actuate matter.   For its simplicity and its programmability, one attractive option for chemical information processing is built upon the DNA strand displacement (DSD) primitive, where a soup of rationally designed nucleotide sequences interact, react, and recombine over time in order to carry out sophisticated computation.  The focus of this proposal is the creation of a reconfigurable DSD architecture akin to a molecular breadboard. Its purpose is to "scale-up" what is possible with this technology and to "scale-out" its adoption to new contexts and new areas of study.  A small number of fast, robust and well-understood molecular components will be developed that compose seamlessly.  The necessary tools to facilitate rapid circuit design and characterization will also be developed.  The reconfigurable architecture will be designed to meet the challenges required in real-world applications ranging from point-of-care diagnostics to sensing and actuation within molecular systems. Due to its ease of use, we envision that this molecular breadboard will be an ideal vehicle to teach molecular programming and to facilitate wider adoption of DSD systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on a new leak reduction paradigm for DNA strand displacement systems, a new design for robust molecular computing gates will be developed, experimentally tested, and refined.  By perfecting a set of molecular components suitable for use in modular and reconfigurable circuits, this will result in a fixed set of dozens of high quality gates that can be arbitrarily wired-up in order to create bespoke molecular circuits.  A compiler will be developed that takes as input a circuit or logic function and provides as output the optimized set of biochemical "wires" necessary to activate the desired logic behavior.  If successful, it will be possible to create and execute fast, leakless and robust molecular circuits, for circuits 2×-10× larger than have been previously demonstrated and with completion times 10×-100× faster.  This increase in complexity creates an even greater need for design verification that will be addressed by the development of more efficient kinetic simulation software.   The breadboard promises to be robust enough for immediate use in applications, such as diagnostics and molecular imaging, and in new contexts such as paper-based devices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview: Molecular programming is a developing field that takes a compter science approach to the design and analysis of synthetic information-based molecular systems.  The promise of molecular programming lies in its ability to not only process information autonomously, but to do so in a biochemical context in order to sense and actuate matter.  Prominent successes include the formulation of models of computation based on chemical reaction networks and molecular self-assembly, analysis of the complexity of molecular-scale tasks such as information-processing and structure fabrication, and systematic compilation of abstract molecular programs into experimentally-demonstrable molecular systems using DNA nanotechnology.  However, the gap between the comparatively simple and fragile systems that can be synthesized today and the sophisticated and robust systems present in biological organisms is a stark reminder of the immaturity of of current capabilities to engineer information-based chemical systems.  Mastery of such systems will lead to profound progress in science, technology and industry, but will require an architecture that is fast, robust, and facilitates rational design.   For its simplicity and its programmability, one attractive option for chemical information processing is built upon the DNA strand displacement (DSD) primitive, where a soup of rationally designed nucleotide sequences interact, react, and recombine over time in order to carry out sophisticated computation.  Despite DNA strand displacement being one of the most promising technologies for biochemically compatible computation, it has been limited to proof-of-principle demonstrations of small systems. The large divide between the promise of this technology and its adoption can be explained by two impeding challenges: (i) Traditional DSD components implementing logic gate behavior are highly error-prone and result in slow overall circuit behavior. (ii) Constructing even a small DSD circuit is technically challenging, time-consuming and prone to common design pitfalls.   Outcomes and Intellectual Merit:  The  goal of this project was to build a reconfigurable DSD architecture akin to a molecular circuit breadboard, so as to "scale-up" what is possible with this technology and to "scale-out" its adoption to new contexts and new areas of study.  A standardized molecular motif for fast, robust DNA logic gates and wires was developed, with prototypes demonstrating computing speeds over 100x faster than previous methods, coupled with the ability to seamlessly compose components into successful circuits with 100x less effort than previous methods.  Furthermore, software tools to facilitate rapid circuit design and characterization, including a compiler that takes as input a circuit level specification, or logic function, and provides as output an optimized set of ready-made breadboard components that need only be mixed.
