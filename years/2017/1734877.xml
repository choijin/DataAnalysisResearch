<AbstractNarration>The Preparing Future Minority Faculty project at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University is a three-year project to develop and implement a networked improvement community (NIC) and address broadening the participation of underrepresented minorities holding faculty positions in engineering. There is a disproportionately small number of faculty members from underrepresented groups who hold positions in US colleges and universities, particularly in fields related to science, technology, engineering, and math. To meet this challenge, the project develops strategies, training materials, and a structured mentoring program to increase the capability of graduate students and postdoctoral research fellows who intend to become tenure track faculty members in engineering, engineering technology, and the sciences. Participation in the project will enable graduate students and postdoctoral research fellows to become more effective faculty members. An emphasis is placed on the development of participant's portfolio in the areas of teaching, research, and service well in advance of beginning their career.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The network improvement community brings together an alliance of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions, researchers, practitioners, industry partners, community stakeholders, school districts, and mentoring organizations. Working together the community will develop a model to comprehensively support the mentoring and training of underrepresented minorities to become effective faculty. The goals of the project are to: 1) implement an evidence-based comprehensive professional development model; 2) train graduate students in the core competency skills needed to effectively navigate the graduate and postdoctoral training process and to successfully achieve careers in the engineering professoriate; and 3) collaborate, promote, and plan activities to enhance and complement existing efforts of an alliance of HBCUs and MSIs to achieve the common goal of increasing the representation and preparation of underrepresented minorities in the professoriate. A quasi-experimental research design with matched groups will be used to the effectiveness of the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There is a disproportionate number of faculty members from underrepresented groups at US colleges and universities, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).  According to several federal agencies, including the National Science Foundation, there is reason to be concerned about students' generally low participation rates from groups underrepresented or underserved in STEM. These trends have profound implications for the American scientific and engineering workforce and powerful implications for the American STEM professoriate.  The Preparing Future Minority Faculty (PFMF) project was designed to increase the number of graduate students and postdoctoral research fellows from underrepresented groups that ultimately become leading professors in engineering, engineering technology, and the sciences. The PFMF project was a partnership between the College of Engineering, the College of Science and Technology, and the Graduate College at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NCA&amp;T).  Melton Consultants served as the external evaluator.  The PFMF project leveraged the existing partnerships of the Principal Investigators with the Verizon Innovative Learning while focusing on three main goals: 1) To implement an evidence-based, comprehensive professional development model that will transform the culture of graduate education and postdoctoral training at NCAT; 2) To train graduate students in the core competency skills needed to navigate the graduate and postdoctoral training process effectively and to achieve careers in the STEM professoriate successfully; and 3) To collaborate, promote, and plan activities that will enhance and complement existing efforts of alliance partners to achieve the common goal of increasing the representation and preparation of underrepresented minorities in the professoriate.   Intellectual Merit: The PFMF project utilized effective strategies, conducted monthly workshops and an annual symposium, developed training materials and instituted a structured mentoring program to increase the interests and capacity of graduate students and postdoctoral research fellows from underserved populations to become tenure-track faculty members at institutions of higher education in engineering, engineering technology, and the sciences. Products include a website (http://pfmf.ncat.edu)  and other valuable resources for increasing the number of minority faculty in STEM disciplines.  The website is a repository of products, including recordings of workshops and the annual symposium, sample future faculty electronic portfolios, information about the PFMF team, and PFMF project participant highlights. Through surveys and focus groups, we gathered data about what minority STEM Ph.D. students and postdoctoral research fellows perceive to be the most significant barriers standing in the way of their success in an academic career.  Broader Impact: The project developed a network improvement community consisting of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), and industry partners and created a model for broadening the participation of minorities in becoming effective STEM faculty.  Through numerous workshops held at NCA&amp;T and an annual symposium with virtual participation options, the PFMF project impacted approximately 100 students from various institutions.  These symposia and workshops included presentations on getting tenure at an R1 university, the role of grant writing in obtaining tenure, the harsh reality of the career outlook for Ph.
