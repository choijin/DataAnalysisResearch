<AbstractNarration>Half a billion humans live on river deltas, and many of these areas are now considered at risk as a result of increasing land subsidence, decreasing growth rate, and accelerating sea-level rise. Sinking land in these coastal areas greatly increases the threat from storm surge and flooding.  For example, Cyclone Nargis tracked across the Irrawaddy delta in Myanmar in 2008 resulting in over 138,000 fatalities, and heavy monsoon rains in this same area in 2015 displaced 200,000 people as a result of flooding in low lying areas. To understand and predict the future evolution of river deltas, it is necessary to know how sediment from the river is transported and delivered to the onshore and offshore regions of the delta, as this is the material from which deltas arise.  This project will provide an understanding of the Irrawaddy-Salween (I-S) delta in Myanmar, perhaps the Earth's last remaining major delta system for which we lack a complete picture.  Specifically, the project will examine the tectonic and oceanographic factors that control the delivery of sediment, and the present pattern and rates of delta growth.  This results of this study will inform the future development of a sensitive deltaic setting home to &gt;50 million people, and add to our general knowledge of deltas worldwide.  The project will also involve the mentoring and training of US undergraduate and graduate students, and will engage Myanmar scientists and students, providing opportunities for training and collaboration with US counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the estimated 600 Mt of river sediment carried by the I-S system annually is delivered to a wide continental shelf in the northern Andaman Sea that is influenced by strong tides, monsoon conditions, and periodic cyclones; however the fate of this material is unknown. Existing bathymetric data and sparse initial surveys hint at a mode of subaqueous delta development on the shelf which contrasts markedly from other previously studied major deltas. In particular, the shelf exhibits a dramatic bilateral (east-west) asymmetry of the surface morphology and sediment texture: a gently sloping sandy ramp off the eastern mouths of the Irrawaddy, and a muddy inner- to mid-shelf clinoform in the adjacent western Gulf of Martaban. Field- and modeling-based experiments will enable the research team to contrast the relative roles of oceanographic sorting, transport processes, and underlying tectonics in creating this unusual deltaic expression. Geophysical observations, coring and laboratory studies will detail the architecture and quantify the amounts, source, and distribution of Holocene and recent sediment accumulating on the shelf. To explore transport pathways of sediment from the fluvial source to depositional sinks, a numerical model will be used to account for the effects of river input, waves, tidal- and wind-driven currents on the dispersal of river sediment within the coastal ocean.  Model runs will represent conditions during the SE and NW monsoons, and during times of high discharge. The model will also be used to explore the potential for enhanced transport during large storms using representations of the cyclone-generated wave and wind field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ River deltas are considered the cradle of civilization as they have long been inhabited by humans because of their fertile lands, strategic locations, and extensive navigation and river transport networks.  Approximately half a billion humans currently live on deltas, and these areas are under increasing threat from frequent flooding and land subsidence related both to natural and human causes.

River deltas represent a major sink of sediment and organic matter delivered by rivers to the coastal ocean, and are therefore considered to be an important part of the global carbon cycle. Because of their great societal relevance, many of the largest deltas in the world have been studied extensively, however, very little was previously known about the delta created by the combined discharge of the Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy) and Thanlwin (Salween) rivers in Myanmar.  Together, these two rivers carry approximately 600 Mt of sediment toward the sea, which represents the third largest delta system in the world.     This project investigated the offshore region of the Ayeyarwady-Thanlwin delta through observations and modeling of recent sediment dispersal and accumulation on the Northern Andaman Sea continental shelf (Figure 1). An expedition was conducted in December 2017 to collect seabed and water column samples, and high-resolution seismic data.  Sediment accumulation rates are highest (up to 10 cm per year) in the mid-shelf region of the Martaban Depression, a basin that has formed on the eastern side of the North-South trending Sagaing fault.  Landward of the zone of highest accumulation, in the shallow Gulf of Martaban, the coastal waters are highly turbid, and the upper 1 m of seabed is frequently mixed to depths.  Frequent suspension of sediment in this area forms extensive fluid muds in the water column.

On the western side of the Sagaing fault, the "Mouths of the Ayeyarwady" represent a large promontory where the subaerial delta has advanced seaward some ~200 km during the past 7,000 years. The shelf area off the "Mouths of the Ayeyarwady" presently exhibits low sediment accumulation rates (~ 1 cm per year) and a relative coarse (sandy) texture.  The reduced accumulation and coarse texture in the western shelf region at the present time is attributed to frequent wave resuspension, and subsequent transport of finer river-derived sediment eastward (into the Martaban Depression).  A mud drape (accumulation rates &lt;1 cm per year) is present on the northwestern part of the delta, where some sediment likely escapes the shelf to the deeper Bay of Bengal. The mud drape is likely derived from a mixture of local rivers draining westward from the Indo-Burman range, and a contribution from the Ayeyarwady system delivered during the NE monsoon. Overall, the shelf offshore the Ayeyarwady and Thanlwin rivers is a subaqueous delta that has a complex structure that varies from east to west, with its features controlled by a combination of oceanographic and tectonic factors.     In addition to the specific findings described above, the discovery of extensive seabed resuspension in the Gulf of Martaban suggest that this area may represent a "geochemical reactor" where exposure of fluid muds to oxygen reduces the efficiency of carbon burial.  This has global implications because the Ayeyarwady-Thanlwin system represents the second largest river input of carbon to the world ocean.     This work is also critical for understanding a heavily-populated flood-prone area that represents the last major free-flowing river systems and delta in Asia, outside the Arctic.  This base line study will allow predictions of the impact of future planned dams for the Ayeyarwady system.     Beyond the intellectual impacts of our findings, broader impacts of this work include international outreach and capacity building in Myanmar, and training of US graduate students.  Six faculty and graduate students from Myanmar Universities visited our research facilities during spring, 2018.  In addition to training modules provided on campus, the researchers also participated in a multi-day field trip to explore the barrier island beaches of North Carolina. Additionally, an international workshop and training sessions were held in Myanmar during January, 2019.  The objective was to share project results with collaborators in Myanmar, and to provide capacity building seminars to Myanmar university faculty and students regarding research approaches used during the study.  A total of 4 US graduate students have completed or will soon complete graduate degrees as part of this program.
