<AbstractNarration>Cosmic rays are highly energetic sub-atomic particles from space that travel at velocities near the speed of light.  The origin of cosmic rays and their acceleration mechanisms are unknown, but they likely originate in extreme astrophysical phenomena both within and beyond our galaxy.  The Pierre Auger Observatory is the largest cosmic ray detector ever operated, with an instrumented area of more than 3000 square kilometers.  Built in Malargue, Argentina by an international collaboration, the Pierre Auger Observatory was designed to study the origin and interactions of the highest energy particles in the Universe.  This award supports scientists at the University of Chicago in their work with Auger.  The group will work on enhancements to the telescope systems as well as the scientific analysis of the data.  The group is also working on projects to cross-calibrate and integrate data from Auger with data from another cosmic ray observatory, the Telescope Array, in Utah. This award will support the University of Chicago group's involvement in the "Array of Things" project, an urban sensing program that will engage students and the general public in cosmic ray science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support hardware and data analyses efforts.  Hardware efforts include extending the duty cycle of the Auger Florescence Detectors to substantially increase the rate of high energy event data.  The group will conduct scientific analyses of the Auger data focused on studying the cosmic ray energy spectrum and anisotropy.  The group will expand the scientific collaboration between Auger and Telescope Array through cross-calibration of the energy scales and through joint full sky anisotropy analyses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The origin of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs, energies up to and above 1020 eV) is a long-standing mystery in Particle Astrophysics, prompting some fundamental questions:  -        Where do they come from?  -        What kind of particles are they?  -        How can they be accelerated to such high energies, 10 million times higher than those reached at the CERN Large Hadron Collider?  Answering these questions may radically change our understanding of the most extreme astrophysical objects in the universe, of the magnetic fields which permeate it, or of particle physics.  The tiny flux of these monster particles - less than one per km2 per century at the highest energy - motivated a large international collaboration of 18 countries to build in Argentina the world-largest cosmic ray detector, the Pierre Auger Observatory. Over its 3000 km2, particle showers produced by UHECRs are detected at ground by a sparse array of surface detectors (SD), and in the atmosphere by fluorescence detector (FD) telescopes sensitive to fluorescence light from nitrogen excited by the shower particles. Over the last decade the Observatory has detected hundreds of thousands of UHECRs, and advanced significantly our quest for their origin. A major outcome of this project is the precise measurement of the UHECRs flux as a function of energy, which shows a steep suppression at the highest energies, and several other features, still to be explained. Another major result is that the flux of UHECRs is not isotropic, namely they preferentially originate from some regions in the sky. These observations constitute an important  step forward in our understanding of these exceptional particles, and motivate further investigations with an upgraded Auger Observatory. Another relevant outcome has been the successful development of a low-cost FD telescope to complement existing UHECRs observatories and possibly be used in even larger experiments in the future.
