<AbstractNarration>This project analyzes the process that led to the national implementation of Residency Agreements among nations affiliated with Mercosur.  Mercosur is a regional trade agreement among developing countries in South America that is designed to resolve unauthorized migration in a manner that protects the rights of immigrants without compromising national security.  Beginning in 2002 nationals of the affiliated countries could relocate, obtain legal residency, and access civil, economic, cultural, and social rights.  By 2014, nine out of twelve South American countries had affiliated with Mercosur and included the Residency Agreements in their national migration policy.  The widespread adaptation of this policy suggests that policymakers had to build support for these agreements from government officials and migrant advocates within six countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. This project analyzes the process that led to the national implementation of the agreements in these six countries to identify the actors and factors that facilitated or hindered the agreement's adaptation as national legislation. This project expands our understanding of how regional migration policy can serve as a tool to reform national immigration law. This project will also identify new models and strategies for addressing unauthorized migration that can inform policymakers and advocates around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project analyzes the impact of Mercosur regionalism in the six countries that negotiated and first adapted the Residency Agreements. Using comparative historical methods, this project identifies the international forces, regional contexts, and the domestic legal, political, and economic factors that facilitated or hindered the passage of the Residency Agreements at the national level. It also identifies the key actors and the policy networks shaping this regional to national policy change. The Co-Principal Investigator conducted N=112 interviews, created a regional and national migration policy database, and compiled an economic growth and trade indicators database. Overall, this research bridges international migration and regionalism literatures and identifies new processes that reform immigration law. This project contributes to the theory by specifying how regional migration policy is a determinant of national immigration policy.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In the last 20 years, South American governments have responded to increases in undocumented immigration from neighboring countries by passing immigration policies that facilitate access to legalization and rights. Scholars argue that the Mercosur Residency Agreements (2002), which promote the legalization and rights of undocumented immigrants were pivotal to this liberal turn. Even though Mercosur cannot enforce its regional policy at the national level, scholars are puzzled as to how Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay adapted these agreements as national legislation by 2009. Using a structural power lens, this study explores how government and non-government actors leveraged organizational rules and practices of Mercosur and national political, legal, and political contexts to promote the Residency Agreements. Specifically, to analyze how Mercosur&rsquo;s regionalism and Residency Agreements were negotiated and reshaped national policy my research draws on 124 in-depth interviews with actors involved in migration policymaking in these six countries and original databases of immigration laws and economic, migration, and trade indicators from 1970-2015.

The Brazilian and Argentine delegates leveraged Mercosur&rsquo;s regular meetings to address Paraguay&rsquo;s opposition because their governing coalitions were committed to regional integration and to using immigration policy as an instrument to achieve this goal. Brazilian delegates responded by paying to improve the infrastructure of Paraguay&rsquo;s migration department and by building a policy network with immigrant rights advocates who reframed undocumented Brazilians as vulnerable, poor and landless.
