<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will address two societal needs. It will enable mass charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs) at minimal costs, and will enable the provisioning of ancillary services to help integrate renewable energy sources.  This is critical as electricity generation and transportation consume about 2/3 of all US energy and emit more than 1/2 of all US greenhouse gases. To drastically reduce greenhouse gases will therefore require mass adoption of electric vehicles and renewable generation.  CA has a mandate to have 1.5 million zero emission vehicles by 2025 and, currently, half of the nation's EVs are in CA. It has been estimated that the proposed technology can potentially save CA $144M annually in operating costs and $1.1B in capital cost when CA reaches its ambitious goal by 2025. By drastically decreasing the cost of mass EV charging, the proposed technology will also help reduce 5.5 million US tons of greenhouse gases annually in CA.  This project will therefore make an impact in both clean transportation and clean energy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop theory and algorithms for real-time distributed optimization and control of smart EV chargers. Multiple parties in the smart grid ecosystem, from electricity wholesale market operator, to utility companies, to aggregators, and individual parking facility operators, have their own individual objectives, and make local decisions based on local information, yet their decisions interact over the grid through power flows in intricate ways. The key to an efficient solution is a set of recent mathematical techniques to decompose the global problem into a set of subproblems, to be solved by individual parties, that communicate through local message exchanges. The core challenges this project will overcome pertain to optimization decomposition, scalability, stability, global optimality, and robustness.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[In 2014, the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab published a report that revealed the transportation sector contributed 33% of all carbon emissions in the US.  It drove home the message that burning fossil fuels to move people and cargos around would not be a sustainable practice in the long term due to the impact of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide on our environment.  Wide adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) can significantly reduce and even eliminate the emission of greenhouse gases.    One significant hurdles that EV adoption must overcome is the lack of accessible charging infrastructure similar to the network of gas stations for conventional cars.  Unlike a conventional gasoline car, today's technologies in battery storage and charging necessitates a long charging time.  The most economical and popular Level-2 charging technology will provide the energy for the average one-way commute of 25 miles in 90 minutes to three hours depending on the model of the EV. Thus, any location that offers charging needs to have many more charging ports than the number of dispensers a gas station typically would have.  Unfortunately, the cost of having large scale EV charging can be very high due to the upfront capital expenditure for installation as well as the amount of electrical capacity needed to support large scale charging.    Through our own research and commercialization effort, we have discovered key factors that contribute to the high cost of EV charging:    1. There is generally an optimal number of charging stations for a location due to the physical layout of the parking structure.  It is critical that one gets very close to this optimal number in order to minimize cost.    2. Adding additional electrical capacity for EV charging is often the most expensive component.  Therefore, the optimal use of the available electrical capacity is key to the economics of large scale EV charging.    Through our SBIR Phase I work, we have accumulated knowledge that helps us determine the number of optimal charging stations, and we have also established a theoretical framework and a formulation of an optimization problem to allocate available electricity to the largest number of EVs efficiently.  We have successfully demonstrated our technology at numerous production sites all with at least 25 EV charging stations, and some as high as 50+.    We are confident that there is a viable commercial path to building large scale EV charging infrastructure.  Our goal is to leverage our insights and expertise in control and optimization to make mass EV charging economical to make a societal impact.
