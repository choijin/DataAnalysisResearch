<AbstractNarration>Glaciation of atmospheric clouds by immersion freezing is an important atmospheric process, affecting the formation of precipitation and Earth?s energy budget. Currently, the climatic impact of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) is uncertain due to increasing evidence of their nucleation efficiency, diversity and abundance in the atmosphere. Recently, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) extracted from natural wood pulp has been identified as an efficient INP, which may add crucial importance to quantifying the role of primary non-proteinaceous biological INP in the troposphere. However, it is still uncertain if the ice-nucleating activity is specific to MCC structure or generally relevant to all plant structural materials. Answering those questions is the specific aim of the project. The fellow will travel to the National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) in Japan, which offers rigorous experimental capabilities, and will carry out in-depth characterization in ice-nucleating properties of cellulose-containing particles with Dr. Yutaka Tobo and Dr. Kumiko Goto-Azuma, who are the world-renowned scientists, to better estimate their effects on clouds and the global climate.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The fellow plans to investigate: 1) cloud seeding simulation by using nano-crystalline cellulose-containing plant fibrous particles and 2); regional and global climate change. The project is well conceived and organized to create new collaboration opportunities for NIPR to promote scientific immersion with West Texas A&amp;M University beyond existing collaboration (i.e., Arctic Challenge for Sustainability Project, www.arcs-pro.jp/en. A newly-developed Cryogenic Refrigerator Applied to Freezing Test (CRAFT) system and a variety of existing plant fiber samples at NIPR will support the fellow's work with assistance from NIPR faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Sumer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Immersion freezing is the process where a particle enters a water droplet and causes the water to freeze at temperatures higher than -38&deg;C (Koop et al., 2000). This is an important atmospheric process because it effects the formation of cloud and precipitation (Boucher et al., 2013). There is an abundance of non-proteinaceous and proteinaceous particles within the atmosphere. In particular, cellulose has been biannually measured and found to have a mass concentration greater than 1&micro;g per cubic meter (Hiranuma et al., 2015). Given atmospheric relevance, we decided to do laboratory experiments on several different cellulose samples all having varying lengths &ndash; anywhere between 100 nm to &gt; 1 &micro;m in length. I, Kimberly Cory, tested Nanocrystalline cellulose, Carboxymethylation (CM; Nippon Paper Industries) Cellulose nanofibers (gel and powder), and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO; Nippon Paper Industries) Cellulose nanofibers (short and standard) using the Cryogenic Refrigerator Applied Freezing Test at the National Institute of Polar Research (Tobo, 2016) under the guidance of Dr. Yutaka Tobo. At West Texas A&amp;M University, I tested Microcrystalline cellulose and Fibrous cellulose using a replicated apparatus under the guidance of Dr. Naruki Hiranuma. To conduct these experiments, we created solutions with set weight percent&rsquo;s (~0.1wt% and 0.05wt%) and then diluted them until the ice nucleation efficiency went down to -30&deg;C. By stopping at -30&deg;C, there is less likely of a chance of seeing residual artifacts effecting the overall frozen fraction at a low weight percent. We documented their rate of freezing by decreasing the temperature by 1K per minute and calculating how many of the droplets were frozen every half a degree until -40&deg;C. <strong>Figure 1</strong> indicates the freezing rate of all the samples at the original weight percent without any dilutions. It shows that three solutions froze at an overlapping temperature range (-11&deg;C to -17&deg;C) &ndash; CM cellulose nanofiber (gel) and both short and long TEMPO cellulose nanofibers &ndash; and all other froze between -17&deg;C to -23&deg;C. The background contribution from water indicates what the frozen fraction would be if there was any influence, but anything freezing at the water line is omitted due to the indication that there are no longer enough particles in the solution to influence the freezing rate. <strong>Figure 2 </strong>shows the mass density of freezing particles in the droplet (ice nucleating active density). These samples are a combined curve of the original solution as well as all dilution up till -30&deg;C. Between the four cellulose nanofibers, three of the samples (CM cellulose nanofibers and both TEMPO cellulose nanofibers) froze at the same order of magnitude at -25&deg;C, indicating that the number of particles in the water droplet had similar ice nucleation efficiency. The gel CM cellulose nanofibers froze two orders of magnitude high at -25&deg;C, which indicates that this sample has 100x more active sites per unit of mass than the others. For Nanocrystalline cellulose, it was more ice nucleation active than the Microcrystalline cellulose but had the same efficiency of the powder CM cellulose nanofibers. All this indicated that the research needs to look at a wider variety of biological aerosols but narrow the focus down to higher temperatures. Another piece to look at would be a decrease in weight percent for the initial solutions. Overall, the greater the amount of particles there are in the atmosphere, the higher the freezing onset temperature will be.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Boucher, O. et al. in <em>Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis</em> (eds Stocker, T.
