<AbstractNarration>Two artists--a photographer and a fine art printmaker--are collaborating with scientists to create an interdisciplinary art and education project titled, The Transparency of Ice and Deep Time in Antarctica. The project artists will embed with multiple science teams to facilitate learning about U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) ice-core research while simultaneously documenting science in action.  Portraits of scientists, visual documentation of their equipment, and the larger Antarctic landscape will act as artistic muses and the visual basis of their artworks. The resulting art will incorporate scientists' written descriptions of their work and polar experiences. The project's aim is to help elucidate for the public the USAP ice-coring and climate studies, which reveal ecological processes over long temporal and broad spatial scales. The artist'? printed artworks will be collated into a monumentally scaled limited edition artist book.  In addition, the artists' framed work will be widely disseminated through traditional fine art and other venues and form the foundation of original, art-based educational and outreach materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The artists will be based at McMurdo and from there make trips to several field camps to observe drilling and ice core recovery operations.  The project will include fine art photography (landscape, portrait, and documentary styles) and handmade prints (woodcuts) with the latter being created with a specialized printmaking press post fieldwork. Both project artists will print their artworks onto archival Washi papers that will ultimately constitute the pages of a large-scale artist book.  Annotations written by the field scientists will be incorporated in the artworks and exhibitions.  The artist books will be museum-grade, limited edition art objects.  Additionally, the artists will create exhibition materials (including framed artworks and scientists' writings) suitable for a broad array of venues including, but not limited to, art, children?s and science museums. While in Antarctica, the artists plan to conduct outreach activities (via Skype) with elementary and college-levels classrooms.  Upon return, they will develop STEAM-based (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics) lesson plans for elementary school students and a university-level seminar course. The resulting educational resources will reside on the project's online, educational website. This award is an Antarctic Artists and Writers project supported by NSF's Office of Polar Programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Overview of Time in Antarctica PI Todd Anderson and CoPI Ian van Coller (NSF Event # W-221-M Ice Core Time Capsules: The Art and Science of US Antarctic Glacier Research) visited Antarctica via McMurdo station in November 2019 (November 1-27).

All research was safely conducted, and proposed fieldwork goals for the project were met. To this end networks between the project PI and CoPI and their scientist counterparts are established and ongoing. The PI and CoPI are now self-funding longer-term collaborations with no less than 8 USAP/NSF scientists met while in Antarctica. Ice Core Time Capsules: The Art and Science of US Antarctic Glacier Research broader impact goals and intellectual merit attributes are multifaceted. The former involve the creation of physical artworks and educational materials as well as educational outreach activities.    Education Project PI, CoPI, and  Dr. John Higgins (USAP/NSF-supported scientist and now Ice Core Time Capsules project collaborator) conducted a two-day, free and open to the public virtual workshop entitled "Science and Art at the Bottom of the World" in the summer of 2020. This workshop was hosted by the Center for Science and Technology at Princeton University. Undergraduate, graduate, and high school students participated in the workshop.    Project PI Anderson comprehensively redesigned his academic program curriculum (7 courses total; undergraduate and graduate levels) so as to engage his Clemson University students with STEM and global learning that directly relate to this project. The project PI also secured a new laser engraver for his project-related artworks. The procurement of this  particular piece of equipment, which was externally funded (i.e., not funded by the NSF), was delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic until the late summer of 2020. With the aid of this machine Anderson is now creating artworks that embody the project’s stated intellectual merit goals that combine science and technology with the visual arts.    Exhibitions The PI and Co-PI have project art exhibitions scheduled at the Hockaday Museum of Art in Kalispell, Montana, (February-June 2021) and at the Overture Center for Arts in Madison, Wisconsin ( November 2021-January 2022). CoPI van Coller has exhibitions scheduled at Blue Sky Gallery in Portland Oregon (April 2021) and Brigham Young University: Idaho (September 2021) Additional exhibitions are currently being planned.   Artist Books CoPI van Coller has completed (July 2020)  a large-scale (21.5x16 inch) limited edition of 6 artist books titled Fracture. This book is comprised of aerial photographs made on flights between McMurdo Station, Lake Hoare and the Allan Hills. CoPI van Coller is currently working on another  large-scale (21.5x15 inch) limited edition of 8 artist books titled Winterquarters, photographs of the historic hut at Cape Evans, including an essay by Nevada Art Museum curator William L. Fox. Anticipated completion of this project is late Fall 2020. In addition, the PI and CoPI have begun work on a similar, limited edition, artist book about the research that was conducted by the Higgins team in the Allan Hills.
