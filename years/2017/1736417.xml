<AbstractNarration>Power grids are a critical infrastructure upon which society relies for effective operation of many other pursuits, including commerce, healthcare, transportation, etc. The list is quite long, as electricity use pervades almost every aspect of human activity. Thus, methods for improving the resilience and security of the energy infrastructure are of deep interest to society and have substantial potential impact on its proper functioning across a very broad front. The past decade has seen an increasing interest in the application of tools developed in the interdisciplinary field of complex network analysis to improve our understanding of power system behavior. Indeed, a power grid can be naturally described as a graph where nodes represent, e.g., transformers, substations or generators, and edges represent electrical connections. Methods of complex network analysis have provided new insights into the fundamental and intrinsic characteristics of power system vulnerability and the effectiveness of associated risk mitigation strategies. However, knowledge on the role of local network structures in functionality of power systems yet remains limited. The project develops a new methodology to enhance our understanding on a functional role of various local network features in unveiling hidden mechanisms behind vulnerability of real power systems and their dynamic response to malfunctions.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project contemplates a new approach to analysis of the local topological properties of power grids via network motifs, which are smaller recurrent patterns occurring in network structure. This methodology provides a basis for understanding linkages between higher-order network topologies and functionality of power grids. The proposed formulation presents a broad platform for the development both of new analytical methods for characterizing power system stability, vulnerability and resilience, and of algorithms for detecting faults, attacks and other anomalies in power grids. Furthermore, the project provides opportunities for strengthening our understanding of the role of motifs more generally in the study of network behavior that may be applied more broadly in a variety of cyber-physical settings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The next generation of power grids is expected to make much greater use of cyber infrastructure to improve the efficiency, security and reliability of the delivery of electric, as well as to accommodate greater integration of distributed energy resources, such as storage and renewable generation.   This project has developed several new analytical techniques for assessing the properties of power grids that will allow designers of future grids to understand how their designs can be improved to provide greater resilience to both natural disasters and to the actions of malicious agents, and to provide greater situational awareness in general of power grid behavior. Society relies very heavily on electric power, which is a vital resource supporting many societal functions, from healthcare to transportation.  Thus, the results of this study have considerable potential for improving a resource of great value to society.  In pursuing this work, we have made use of a variety of methods from the mathematical and statistical sciences, including techniques the analysis of graphs that describe networks, machine learning techniques for real-time grid topology inference, and information-theoretic tools for analyzing malicious attacks.  These methods are of broader interest to the scientific community involved in applying network science to other infrastructures, many of which can be modeled using similar mathematical techniques to those used here. Thus, this work also has potential to impact other scientific and technological fields.  Finally, this study has involved several early-career scholars (graduate students, postdoctoral scholars and early-career professionals), and their participation provided them with opportunities to improve their research and communications skills, and to build their professional networks among themselves and with senior visitors and other collaborators involved in this work. Thus, the study has also contributed to the future of the field through the development of human resources to assure that the field remains vital in the future.
