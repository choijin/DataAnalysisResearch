<AbstractNarration>The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program Recommendation &lt;br/&gt;The Program recommends an award of  $40,399 for the purchase of the following: &lt;br/&gt;Ashtech ADU800 $10,374&lt;br/&gt;Network Infrastructure Upgrade $5,400&lt;br/&gt;Niskin Bottle Refresh $24,625&lt;br/&gt;  $40,399</AbstractNarration>
