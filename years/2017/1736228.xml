<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the Conference on Enumerative Geometry, Mirror Symmetry, and Physics held at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois, from July 17-21, 2017. The topics of the conference lie at the core of twenty-first century research at the boundary between mathematics and physics.  Research at this boundary has led to exciting new insights and rapid progress in mathematics, while at the same time providing new tools and rigorous arguments to physics.  The conference provides a needed venue for dissemination of the most important recent results and a context for the exchange of ideas and the growth and development of new approaches and new projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will bring together leading experts from algebraic and differential geometry, string theory and supersymmetric field theories, and their connections to topology and representation theory, to explore physical contexts and mathematical problems in enumerative geometry, mirror symmetry, and related physics (including modularity phenomena, topological recursion, F-theory and nonperturbative phenomena). The conference will focus on these developments and future prospects in these areas. Additional information is available at the conference web site:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~nevins/EGMSP.html</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The award supported the attendance of participants in an international conference at the boundary between mathematics and physics, the "Conference on Enumerative Geometry, Mirror Symmetry, and Physics," held at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from July 17-21, 2017.  The conference brought together a distinguished international field of speakers with junior researchers, including many postdoctoral researchers and students, to describe the current state of enumerative geometry and its relations to physics, present new research ideas and results, discuss promising directions for future work, and train young researchers in state-of-the-art techniques.    Intellectual merit: the conference featured presentations from twenty-four speakers on a range of topics of leading interest in this exciting area.  It provided a needed venue for dissemination of important results and a context for the exchange of ideas and the growth and development of new approaches and new projects.   Broader Impacts: the conference specifically strove for substantial participation by junior researchers and members of under-represented groups, to broaden the base of training in this exciting research area and add to the richness of ideas and viewpoints.  The conference helped to educate junior and senior researchers on the latest recent developments, and foster relationships between mathematicians and physicists.  In light of the then-upcoming semester-long program at the NSF-supported Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley on ``Enumerative geometry beyond numbers," which took place in January to May 2018 (following the conference), the conference specifically and successfully aimed at initiating new conversations and collaborations that continued fruitfully at MSRI and, we expect, will continue in the future.
