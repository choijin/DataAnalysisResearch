<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the biological functions and assembly of germ cell nanoparticles. These are small molecular structures that may hold a key to unexplained fundamental aspect of germline, namely its unique ability to give rise to the next-generation individuals and therefore, ensure the continuity of life. Germ cells belong to a special class of cells that produce egg and sperm which unite to generate a completely new organism. Germ cell nanoparticles have been remarkably conserved across animal phyla indicating their crucial biological importance. In addition, this research may promote design of artificial nanoparticles with desired molecular characteristics thereby leading to technological breakthroughs. This project will involve undergraduate, graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar and will provide opportunities for training of future active participants in science and education fields. In addition, the research topics will be incorporated into genetics courses and a new cell biology laboratory module will be designed. This research will be described on the University National Public Radio providing a great platform to reach out to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to understand the principles of the functional assembly of germ cell molecular complexes composed of RNA and proteins required for germline development in diverse organisms. Components of these complexes include Tudor domain-containing proteins, Piwi proteins, small Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and enzymes of the glycolytic cluster. These complexes play a major role in the silencing of transposable elements, which otherwise might lead to harmful mutations. However, the mechanisms controlling their assembly remains a mystery. To address this gap, a combination of approaches--including genetics, biochemistry, as well as in vitro and in vivo experiments--will be used to test the roles of the component proteins in assembly of these germ cell particles in Drosophila.  Because these structures have been evolutionarily conserved, this research can serve as a paradigm for studying other large and dynamic ribonucleoprotein granules.  Moreover, the results have the potential to reveal new insights into how such nanoparticles function to preserve the integrity of the next generation genetic material.</AbstractNarration>
