<AbstractNarration>Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) at the University of California at San Diego will acquire an electron backscatter diffraction detector that will be coupled to a new Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope. The resulting, cutting-edge instrument will be housed at UC San Diego's Materials Research Center which provides full technical support and priority access for SIO researchers. The instrument is central to the PIs research into processes that couple deformation microstructures and geochemistry.  The additional capabilities will also benefit several other SIO geoscience researchers as well as be generally available to UCSD researchers.  It is expected to promote interdisciplinary collaborations among geoscientists and planetary scientists as well as benefitting materials scientist. The new instrument will also be the focus of a course that prepares students in the materials characterization that is essential for success in academia and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enable Scripps Institution of Oceanography to acquire EBSD (electron backscatter diffraction) instrumentation, which will be coupled with a brand new, state-of-the-art field emission SEM (scanning electron microscope). EBSD is an integral component of the PI's research on 1) the coupled geochemical and rheological evolution of lower crust and 2) understanding the pressure-temperature-time history of subduction zone crust and mantle. In addition, the EBSD will be utilized by several other SIO and UC San Diego researchers for applications ranging from NSF-funded studies of the surficial environment to planetary deep interiors. Courses on materials characterization will use the cutting edge instrument as a focal point for hands-on learning and important technical training and skill sets that prepare students to be competitive in academia and industry. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
