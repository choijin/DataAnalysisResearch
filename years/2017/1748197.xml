<AbstractNarration>The idea of sharing resources between institutions is not new and has been relatively successful in a few instances and largely unsuccessful in many cases. This proposal elaborates a plan to construct the Campus Compute Cooperative (CCC), a shared cyberinfrastructure as well as a social fabric; both computational resources and support staff expertise will be pooled and shared. The CCC will: i) connect and federate campus physical infrastructures; ii) use market-based mechanisms for resource allocation and quality of service to avoid the tragedy of the commons; iii) leverage InCommon and local identity management systems to provide integrated cross-institution authentication and access control of resources; iv) facilitate secure data and storage sharing between institutions and research labs; v) offer "cloud bursting" to member institutions; and, vi) provide paid-for, differentiated quality of service. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of on-demand, pay-per-use (cloud) resources on society has been huge. Making the most of limited resources is critical to the success of the nation's research enterprise. By rationally and securely sharing the limited computational and human resources available for research the CCC will both accelerate discovery and provide a research cyberinfrastructure with better cost/benefit.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of the project were: (1)  Recruit and build the CCC team; (2)  Develop a memorandum of understanding that will govern membership in the CCC and detail the roles and responsibilities of members, the economic model, and scheme for clearing persistent deficits and surpluses; (3)  Identify science cases and representative users; and (4) Recruitment of community data set holders. Each of these goals were achieved.   The major activity of this planning grant was to put together a team of institutions that were interested in participating in an resource trading cooperative and subsequently submit a proposal to the NSF to bootstrap funding for the cooperative. Putting together the team involved travel to CASC meetings and visits to the prospective institutions. By the summer of 2018 the team had been formed and proposal writing began and an interim report was submitted to the NSF.  A full proposal was submitted in December 2018.    The community began to think about trading resources to improve the availability of cycles for science. The idea of research sharing and trading was introduced to the community and had strong positive support.    As a result of talks on the CCC, the lead PI (Grimshaw) was approached by Lancium to transfer the technology. Lancium is using the CCC technology to deliver carbon free computing to industry and academia.          Last Modified: 12/15/2019       Submitted by: Shantenu Jha]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
