<AbstractNarration>The first detection of gravitational waves (GW) by the LIGO observatory was from the collision of two black holes (BH), which are considered a type of compact binary stars. This has opened up a new window in astronomy, enabling a deeper understanding of the physics of relativity through the study of merging BHs, the objects that bend space and time the most.  Since these interactions are so complicated, powerful computer simulations are needed to interpret the science.  A collaboration between research groups at the University of Mississippi and Pennsylvania State University will develop and run computer models to better understand the formation and development of compact binary star systems and to more effectively use the rich information from gravitational waves to probe these systems. A related effort is the development of methods to use GW in the future to study dark matter. The research team will also promote scientific literacy by providing astronomy lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on activities to school children and adult citizenry in economically disadvantaged communities in the state of Mississippi and the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will carry out two closely related projects to model the gravitational wave astrophysics of compact binary systems. The first project concerns the astrophysical information that can be extracted from the characteristic signature imposed on a gravitational wave signal due to the spin and the orbital precession of coalescing black hole binaries. The team will introduce spin dynamics into compact binary evolution models and track the evolution of BH binaries from formation through merger, including effects such as an initial supernova kick, mass transfer and spin-orbit coupling. An offshoot of this work is to investigate bounds on ultra-light bosonic dark matter though its possible GW signature. The second project will involve inferring compact binary population models from a catalog of gravitational wave observations. The team will put together a database of evolutionary models and work to distinguish between the predicted observables of the various models. Goals include understanding the distribution of BH masses, spins, and merger rates and the properties of the stochastic GW background. The principal investigators will mentor a graduate student and postdoctoral researcher and plan to organize two workshops on strong gravity and binary dynamics and to lecture at international graduate schools on work related to the proposal.</AbstractNarration>

Some highlights include: (1) studies of the gravitational-wave detection rates, mass distribution, spin magnitude, spin orientation, and natal kicks of black-hole binaries; (2) the exploration of the observational implications of second-generation black hole mergers, in particular in connection with the existence of "lower" and "upper" mass gaps; (3) investigations of neutron star properties (such as their maximum mass and tidal deformability) and proposals to distinguish low-mass black holes from neutron stars; (5) the development of various parametrized frameworks to study deviations from general relativity in gravitational-wave observations. The award provided partial financial support for 4 postdoctoral researchers (McManus, Julie and Helfer at JHU; Gupta at PSU) and 3 graduate students (Baibhav and Wong at JHU and Borhanian at PSU) at the two institutions.

Mentoring and Broader Impacts: Gupta et al recieved the Buchalter Cosmology Prize for their paper on QCD origin of LIGO black holes.  Berti and Sathyaprakash were both named Fellows of the APS and of the International Society of General Relativity and Gravitation (ISGRG). Sathyaprakash serves on the Executive Committe of ISGRG, is a member of the the Gravitational-Wave International Committee's 3G committee and chairs its Science Case Team charged with the development of the science for the next generation of gravitational wave detectors and he is one of the convenors of Snowmass topical group on Cosmic Probes of Fundamental Physics.

Intellectual Merit: LIGO's direct detection of gravitational waves is a milestone discovery. In addition to confirming the generation, propagation and interaction of gravitational waves with matter, LIGO has opened up a new window for discovering the most energetic and relativistic phenomena in the Universe. LIGO's sources are essentially Nature's most compact objects; their observation can help us investigate strong field gravity, as standard candles they are ideal for studying the dynamics of the Universe and, most importantly, they are of fundamental importance in exploring how compact object binaries form and evolve, and how the properties of their progenitors determine the fate of such systems. The very first LIGO event was from a pair of black holes so massive that they have been termed "heavy" black holes, to indicate a formation scenario that might have to be different from "ordinary" stellar evolution. Indeed, these detections have ushered in a new era in observational astronomy: they have raised questions about the demographics, environs and inferred merger rates of binary black holes. With the second and third observing runs as LIGO began to accumulate statistics on the population of binary coalescences, Johns Hopkins and Penn State exploited that information to explore the astrophysics of compact object binaries, their formation, evolution, and cosmological history. This collaborative research program funded by NSF has helped us understand evolutionary models of compact object binaries using the catalog of binary black holes detected by LIGO. More specifically, we were able to understand how the measured distributions of masses, spins and other properties of compact object mergers could be used to discriminate between distinct astrophysical models.

Such maps, in combination with Bayesian inference techniques, were used to gain a deeper understanding of the astrophysics of compact object binaries.  Broader Impacts:  Both Berti and Sathyaprakash have given popular talks at astronomical societies, written pedagogical reviews, lectured at international graduate schools and organized workshops targeting graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.
