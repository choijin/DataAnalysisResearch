<AbstractNarration>The project is in the field of algebraic geometry with some connections to string theory. Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics studying geometric objects defined by polynomial equations and related mathematical structures. Classically one associates with such geometric objects (called algebraic varieties) the set of algebraic functions on them which forms a commutative ring (i.e., functions can be added and multiplied). The PI studies much more sophisticated algebraic structures associated with algebraic varieties, such as A-infinity algebras and derived categories of sheaves. In an A-infinity algebra, in addition to taking product of two elements, one has higher operations of multiplying together n-tuples of elements. These structures appeared independently in a very different way in works of Fukaya. The research is partly motivated by the desire to match different constructions of A-infinity algebras. The PI also intends to apply A-infinity structures to solve some problems in algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will focus mostly on the following two topics: moduli spaces of A-infinity structures and moduli spaces related to algebraic curves. In the first part of the project the goal is to construct moduli spaces (i.e., parameter spaces) of A-infinity structures related to various moduli spaces of geometric objects (sometimes involving non-commutative geometry). In particular, the PI plans to construct moduli spaces of A-infinity algebras related to algebraic surfaces, double covers of non-commutative projective lines, noncommutative orders over curves, as well as moduli spaces of A-infinity modules related to birational transformations. The second part of the project is devoted to studying toric GIT picture for moduli spaces of curves with nonspecial divisors, as well as moduli spaces of curves with vector bundles on them and their non-commutative analogs. Also, the PI plans to study natural vector fields on the moduli spaces of curves with nonspecial divisors and use them to produce explicit rational functions on the moduli spaces of curves with no marked points.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Algebraic geometry is an area of mathematics studying geometric objects defined by polynomial equations in the n-space (called affine algebraic varieties), as well as more general geometric objects, called algebraic varieties, obtained from affine varieties by a certain gluing process. It is a classical idea that an affine variety is determined by a purely algebraic object, namely, the algebra of polynomial functions on this variety. The large part of the PI’s work revolves around the idea that more general algebraic varieties can sometimes be described adequately by an A-infinity algebra. The latter is an algebra-like structure that has, in addition to the product operation, higher operations with more than two inputs, that satisfy a generalization of the associative law. This approach in recording the geometric information algebraically has been shown to be useful in the context of Kontsevich’s homological mirror symmetry program.   Jointly with Yanki Lekili, the PI proved the homological mirror symmetry conjecture relating the Fukaya category of the complement to n+1 generic hyperplanes in the complex n-dimensional space, viewed as a symplectic manifold, to the derived category of coherent sheaves on the singular affine hypersurface, the union of coordinate hyperplanes in the n+1-dimensional space. The key feature of this work is constructing appropriate categorical resolutions for both categories, which are easier to describe and compare.   Another joint work with Lekili applies the relation between Fukaya categories of surfaces and certain class of algebras with monomial quadratic relations, called gentle algebras, to construct a new collection of easily computable invariants of gentle algebras. We prove that if these invariants for two gentle algebras coincide that these algebras are derived equivalent.   Another project related to mirror symmetry, joint with Weiqiang He, Yefeng Shen and Arkady Vaintrob, relates two different enumerative theories associated to a quasihomogeneous polynomial of special type, called invertible. One theory is the Saito-Givental theory of this polynomial, while another theory is the matrix factorization theory of the dual invertible polynomial, constructed earlier in a joint work of the PI with Vaintrob.    Jointly with Bumsig Kim, the PI developed a theory of Atiyah classes for matrix factorizations and used it to give a description of the categorical Chern character in this context.   In a joint project with Giovanni Felder and David Kazhdan, the PI studied some geometric problems arising in string theory. More precisely, we studied the question of regularity of the so called supermeasure on the moduli space of supercurves. We showed that the supermeasure is regular if genus is at most 11.   The PI has been advising two Ph.D. students and one postdoc who were working on problems related to the project. He also organized a two-week summer graduate school and was helping with the curriculum for a math circle for elementary school students.
