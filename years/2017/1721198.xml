<AbstractNarration>The proposed project will bring together researchers in a workshop to be held December 8-9, 2016 at the Hilton Hotel, San Francisco, CA. The Workshop will address research areas of a wide range of non-graphene 2D atomic layers such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), transition metal di-chalcogenides, tertiary compounds of carbo-nitrides and complex oxides, as well as their applications in various devices. It will allow scientific exchanges among leading scientists working on beyond graphene 2D materials and devices to help promote future collaborations and address common challenges. The Workshop is expected to play a key role in addressing in detail currently faced bottlenecks in 2D material and device research and identifying new directions for research.  The research discussed at the Workshop is expected to lead to technological breakthroughs and disruptive technologies that can have great societal impact in the future in many areas such as sensing, communications and health.</AbstractNarration>
