<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High-energy physicists explore the structure of matter by colliding elementary particles like protons and electrons.  In solids, currents--like those generated in a photovoltaic cell after illumination by sunlight--are usually carried by entities called "quasi-particles." When acted on by a force, quasi-particles behave like particles, but actually involve the co-ordinated motions of thousands to millions of atoms.   If an atom in a solid were scaled up to be the size of a person, then a quasi-particle would look something like "the wave" in a large, full stadium.  The PI's group has recently discovered a method to accelerate and collide quasi-particles about 1 trillion times per second (1 Terahertz).  The experimental signature of quasi-particle collisions is a rainbow-like spectrum of light that contains dozens of frequencies, or sidebands, that are equally spaced like the teeth on a comb.  Each sideband, carries information about the speed with which the quasiparticles have collided, and the quantum-mechanical properties of the solid through which they have been accelerated before colliding.  In this project, the PI's group will carefully analyze both the intensities and polarizations of the sidebands from a variety of electronic materials in order to elucidate the laws that govern the motion of quasiparticles and to search for new phases of strongly-driven matter.   Possible applications of the proposed research include faster and more energy efficient optical communications and internet, improved optical clocks that are necessary in the global positioning system, and the ability to rapidly and reversibly tune the properties of materials. This project will support the training of two Ph. D. students and several undergraduates, who will learn a variety of skills that are critical to preserving U. S. competitiveness in the high-technology sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses one of the grand challenges of 21st century science--how does quantum matter behave when it is driven very far from thermal equilibrium. The goals of this project are to take advantage of new opportunities in the study of strongly-driven matter to (1) develop a method of measuring the Berry curvature of bands in solids, which is critical to understanding the dynamics of quasiparticles;   (2)  elucidate the nature of quasiparticles in materials in which correlations between electrons are strong, like the parent compounds of high-Tc superconductors; and (3) search for new quantum-mechanical phases near the edges of materials that are driven by strong, time-periodic fields.   In order to reach these goals, this project will use the recent discovery of high-order sideband generation (HSG) by the PI's group.  Each of the materials of interest will be illuminated by a NIR laser while it is being driven by a strong THz-frequency electric field, and the intensities and polarizations of the resulting HSG spectra will be analyzed.  Experiments will be closely coupled with theory to reach the project goals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Semiconductors form the basis for much of modern technology, from computers to lasers to solar cells.  Many proposals for exciting future technologies, like the quantum computers that promise to vastly increase the power of information processors for some applications, will rely on understanding in unprecedented detail how electrical charges move deterministically through the periodically arranged atoms in a semiconductor crystal.  Such understanding has been held up by the fact that deterministic motion of charges in semiconductors is typically interrupted, or scattered, in less than one picosecond (one millionth of one millionth of a second) by collisions with sound waves, other charges, or imperfections in the crystal.  With funding from this award, a new method has been developed that overcomes the problem of  scattering, opening the door to the detailed understanding one needs for future technological breakthroughs.  The method is based on a phenomenon called high-order sideband generation  that was discovered by the Sherwin group in 2012 using a unique laser at UC Santa Barbara called a free-electron laser (FEL) that takes up a whole small building.  The UCSB FEL generates a beam of extremely powerful electric fields that oscillate with a frequency close to 1 Terahertz.  This is a trillion times a second, about 1000 times faster than the oscillation of the clocks in typical desktop computers.  While the powerful FEL beam driving a piece of semiconductor, a much weaker laser at near-infrared frequencies is directed at the same semiconductor, and creates pairs of negative and positive charges called electrons and holes.  The FEL beam is so strong that it rips the electron and hole apart from each other and then causes them to recollide before they can be scattered!  When they recollide, the electron hole pairs emit dozens of near-ir beams, each with its own distinct wavelength.  We call these new beams "sidebands." The frequency difference between neighboring sidebands is twice the frequency of the FEL.  Two major advances occurred in this proposal.  The first concerns the polarization of the sidebands.  The polarization of light is familiar to anyone who has donned a pair of polaroid sunglasses: they cut the glare from reflected sunlight because it is polarized differently than the light one wants to see.   Graduate students working on this project were surprised that the polarization of the sidebands was different than the polarization of the near-ir laser that created them.  A new apparatus was built to carefully and systematically record how the polarizations of sidebands depends on the polarization of the near ir laser.  At the same time, theoretical collaborators developed a theory that relates sideband polarization to the details of how electrons and holes move deterministically in semiconductors!  The Sherwin group hopes to use their discovery to help optimize semiconductors for many applications in classical and quantum information science.  The second major advance was the discovery of spectra containing more than 60 sidebands!  Since they are equally spaced in frequency, the spectrum looks like a comb, with each sideband being one tooth in the comb.  Frequency combs are used to make the world's most accurate atomic clocks.  U. S. patent 10,490,974 was based on this discovery, entitled "A self-referencing frequency comb based on high-order sideband generation." The patent outlines how one would make a frequency comb that is sufficiently wide to use in an optical clock in a light and compact package.
