<AbstractNarration>Design of future high-performance chips is hindered by severe temperature challenges. For example, existing cooling mechanisms cannot efficiently cool the extremely high power densities that are expected in exascale systems. Emerging cooling technologies, which may address these temperature challenges, are not easily accessible for experimentation to computer engineers. In fact, there is a substantial lag before a cooling technology becomes available for system design and optimization. Such lags cause design quality to be left on the table. To this end, this project proposes a software infrastructure that enables accurate modeling of cutting-edge cooling methods and that facilitates mutually customizing the computing and cooling systems to dramatically push system energy efficiency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed infrastructure is a system-level design automation tool that includes compact thermal models of emerging cooling methods (thermoelectric coolers, two-phase cooling with microchannels or nanopores, phase-change materials, and single-phase liquid cooling). The project plan includes (1) synthesizing novel device-level models into compact representations; (2) using measurements on prototypes for validation of the proposed models; and (3) developing automation tooling to co-design hybrid customized cooling subsystems together with a given computing system. The broader impact of the project will be to help advance computing beyond the limitations of Moore's Law by making efficient design of high-power-density systems possible. The proposed infrastructure will enable transformative research in design automation, computer architecture, and system design with emerging cooling technologies, particularly in the dimensions of performance, variability, energy, heterogeneity, and cross-layer design. The infrastructure will be released to the community as open source software. The interdisciplinary nature of the project creates ample opportunities for undergraduate projects and outreach programs for underrepresented groups and K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Over the last few decades, processor performance has grown tremendously following the down-scaling of transistors. High power densities that reach and surpass 1-2 KW/cm2 caused by the performance boost can occur in future high-performance chips and result in amplified localized hot spots. Existing cooling solutions such as forced air cooling via fans or traditional pin-fin heat sinks are often not sufficient to mitigate these high power densities efficiently and can lead to over/under-cooling, affecting system design cost and power.

The target emerging cooling technologies were as follows: (i) liquid cooling via microchannels, (ii) thermoelectric coolers (TEC), (iii) hybrid cooling of liquid cooling via microchannels and TEC, (iv) microchannel-based two-phase cooling, (v) two-phase vapor chambers (VCs) with micropillar wick evaporators, and (vi) two-phase VCs with hybrid wick evaporators. Commercial multi-physics simulators, such as COMSOL Multiphysics and ANSYS, are typically used to design and simulate the thermal models. However, these tools require significant effort to construct system-specific models. Such tools also incur long simulation times as well as large memory requirements. To build fast and accurate thermal models for the above emerging cooling technologies, we created compact thermal models (CTMs). For each cooling technology, we either derived the CTMs from corresponding finite element models or improved upon the modeling methodologies in recent work. All the cooling models have been validated against finite element models, prototypes, or CTMs that have been already validated. The modeling methodologies for building these CTMs can also be used to model other emerging cooling technologies in the future.
