<AbstractNarration>The Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) project uses two small telescopes to discover planets that move in front of their stars in their orbits.   The KELT Follow-Up Network (KFUN) is made up of astronomers who then follow these discoveries of planets with more observations of the planets.  The KELT Collaboration Meeting will bring together about 60 people from the KELT team, the KFUN scientists, and community astronomers interested in using KELT data.  These scientists will talk about how to use the KELT data we have now, and how to adapt the KFUN to support the NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) that is expected to launch within a year.  This conference will serve the national interest by promoting the progress of science when plans are discussed to make the best use of the existing KELT and KFUN data, and to develop the KFUN to serve the success of the future TESS satellite in the most productive way.  The conference will last three days and have talks mixed with group discussions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator requests support for a conference entitled KELT Collaboration Meeting.  The conference will assemble 55 to 65 Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) science team participants, KELT Follow-Up Network (KFUN) collaborators, and community astronomers interested in making use of the KELT data archive to confirm both KELT and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) transiting exoplanet candidates.  The KELT and KFUN efforts currently exist; the NASA TESS satellite is expected to launch within a year.  The participants will address the KELT exoplanet discoveries, the utility of KELT datasets for non-transit science, the development and expansion of the KFUN, and the transformation of KFUN from a primarily KELT-centered effort to a core element of TESS follow-up confirmation.  Between 35 to 45 participants will attend in person, with another 20 participants connecting by teleconference.  The conference is planned to last three days and will contain a series of individual talks interspersed with group discussions on selected topics.</AbstractNarration>

We held a three-day series of talks and discussions, covering the KELT project itself and also plans for the TESS mission.     Meeting Activities  The meeting occurred at Lehigh University June 14-16, 2017, with 22 separate talks.  The first two days focused on the KELT project, including KELT telescope operations, strategy, and data analysis, status of exoplanet discovery, and several non-exoplanet science projects.  Day 3 focused on the development of the KELT follow-up network (KFUN), an international collaboration of professional and citizen astronomers that confirm and characterize the KELT exoplanet discoveries.  We discussed how to convert KFUN operations for similar observations for the upcoming TESS mission.  We had 38 in-person participants at the workshop.  The majority of participants were KELT team members, most of them being undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs.  Several non-KELT members attended to learn about the project and there were 20 to 25 online participants.  We streamed the meeting online, which allowed the remote participants to watch, listen, and ask questions.   The NSF grant was crucial to holding the event.  The majority of the grant funding was used to pay for travel to Lehigh and meal costs at the meeting.  The grant paid for hotel costs for 26 of the participants, of which 22 were undergraduate students or graduate students.  It also paid for coffee and lunches during the day at the meeting site.  Being able to bring in meals and coffee allowed us to make the most use of the time available, without lost time walking to and from restaurants.  The grant also paid for travel to and from the meeting for seven of the participants.     Results and Legacy  The meeting was successful by all measures.  As a result of discussions at the meeting, we made progress on several exoplanet discoveries, including KELT-13b, KELT-19Ab, KELT-20b, and KELT-21b, all of which were published in the 6 months after the meeting.  Discussions at the meeting also informed In 8 additional papers based on KELT data since that time.  The TESS mission is scheduled to launch in April 2018, and will detect thousands of exoplanet candidates.  Most of the types of planets that KELT can detect will be much more detectable by TESS, and we discussed whether the KELT survey itself should continue in the era of TESS and also how to prepare the KELT Follow-Up Network (KFUN) team to do TESS follow-up.  We planned a proposal to the TESS Guest Investigator program to use KELT data to pre-cover TESS long period planets.  The proposal was accepted and funded by the TESS GI program for a total of $43,000.  We also planned three other proposals related to KELT to the TESS GI program which were not accepted.  However, the feedback we received will allow us to submit improved proposals to the second cycle of the program at the end of 2018.   KFUN is preparing to conduct observations for TESS in the coming year.  One of the leaders of the KELT project, Karen Collins, is now an astronomer at Harvard/CfA, and will be leading one of the teams for TESS followup within the TESS Follow-on Program (TFOP).  We have also expanded the KFUN team, so that it now includes over 93 separate partners.  The final legacy of the meeting is the archive of slides and talk videos from the meeting that are now available to the public on the KELT project website, along with materials from previous KELT workshops.                  We do not anticipate any further action on the grant, including cost extension requests, supplemental funding, or transfer of grant.
