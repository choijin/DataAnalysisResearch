<AbstractNarration>In many devices, including projection displays, laser weapons, and medical illuminators, it is required to accurately control light.  The fundamental question to be addressed by this research project in computational geometric optics is the efficient design of lenses and mirrors through provably convergent numerical methods. The goal of the project is to develop improved efficient and theoretically sound algorithms for a variety of illumination problems. The project involves training of graduate students through involvement in the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available tools for the design of refractors and reflectors are limited, and some are not backed up by a sound theory. Promising approaches consist in solving numerically the associated nonlinear partial differential equations of Monge-Ampere type and variational methods that solve the illumination problem as an equation in measures. Existing methods based on partial differential equations make ad hoc assumptions and do not address appropriately the unusual boundary conditions for these problems. On the other hand, most existing variational methods scale poorly with the size of the problem. This has created a need for improved efficient and robust numerical methods based on rigorous analysis to solve computational geometric optics problems. This project aims to:  (1) implement and analyze an efficient variational method, based on minimization diagrams, for computing solutions of a variety of illumination problems; (2) address the numerical resolution of the relevant partial differential equations with a provably convergent and efficient finite-difference method; and (3) solve the relevant nonlinear equations with mixed finite elements based on approximations by smooth functions. The project will also investigate the convergence properties of the different approaches. It is anticipated that the results of the project will identify which approach is the most efficient.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In many devices, including projection displays, laser weapons, and medical illuminators, it is required to accurately control light. The fundamental question  addressed by this research project in computational geometric optics is the efficient design of lenses and mirrors through provably convergent numerical methods based on the numerical resolution of the Monge-Ampere equation supplied with the second boundary condition.  A review paper in the notices of the American Mathematical Society laid out the point of view I took.   I obtained a provably convergent numerical method for solving the Monge-Ampere equation supplied with the second boundary condition. These results include existence and uniqueness of a solution to the discrete problem as well as convergence of the discretization. The convergence of a damped Newton's method for solving the resulting discrete equations was also obtained. The method I introduced is based on the notion of asymptotic cone and compared to the other provably convergent method (in the sense that all results of the above type have been obtained) which is based on power diagrams, a linear convergence rate is achieved for smooth solutions.   These results lay out the foundations necessary for extension to more general generated Jacobian equations.  I also obtained a new proof of the uniqueness of solutions to generated Jacobian equations which generalizes the known result for the standard Monge-Ampere equation in the sense that solutions are not required to have first derivatives Lipschitz continuous.   On the Dirichlet problem, the main tools needed to prove convergence of numerical methods to viscosity solutions on domains which are not assumed to be uniformly convex has been laid out in my paper on weak convergence of Monge-Ampere measures.  Two  students completed their Ph.d as part of this project, Eric Malitz and Jamal Adetola. Another one received partial training. The results of this investigation were disseminated through participation in seminars, conferences, publications and a dedicated website.
