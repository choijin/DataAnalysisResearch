<AbstractNarration>This conference award will provide partial support to the 2018 Microtechnologies for Medicine and Biology (MMB) Meeting in Monterey, California, on March 26-28, 2018.  This meeting will provide an outstanding opportunity for networking between young investigators, including trainees, and leaders in the field of microtechnologies.  The themes of the conference include: mechanobiology and biophysics; diagnostic and detection technologies; microphysiological models of living systems; bioassay development; and 3D printing and biomanufacturing. The structure of the conference, including a single room format and 90-second "flash" presentations by poster presenters to introduce their research, will provide a multidisciplinary perspective to all meeting attendees and update everyone on the latest developments within the field.  The conference attendees include stakeholders from the clinical and biomedical industry arenas, which allows for significant exchange of ideas in the furtherance of scientific advancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide financial support for four young investigators and four trainees to attend the international meeting.  Awardees will be selected based on a submitted, 2-page abstract and preference will be given to individuals from groups that are underrepresented in their science and engineering fields.  Over 50 percent of attendees have historically been trainees.  Substantial opportunities are provided for networking, including between young investigators/trainees and leaders in the field.  In addition, partial travel support will be provided to two female keynote speakers.  These individuals will be available for networking with and mentoring of the young investigators and trainees attending the meeting.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The mission of the international Microtechnologies in Medicine and Biology (MMB) conference is to advance the application of revolutionary microtechnologies to the fields of medicine and biological sciences by fostering interdisciplinary exchanges between biologists, medical researchers, chemists, physicists, and engineers. The ninth MMB conference, since its founding in 2000, was held in Monterey, California from March 26-28, 2018. The objective was to assist outstanding US-based young investigators and female keynote speakers to defray the costs of travel and registration to present their work at MMB&rsquo;18. A second objective was to promote a proven multidisciplinary forum for dissemination of the latest advances of microtechnology in biomedical engineering at all levels of training and a substrate for sharing of knowledge across interdisciplinary barriers by inviting stimulating speakers to present their work. The small conference setting promoted open discussion of new directions, ideas, and approaches in both research and education by diverse communities that would otherwise not interact in such a venue. With NSF support, the MMB conference was able to continue to support a young investigator session with talks given by Prof. Ian Wong (Brown University) and Prof. Yu Shrike Zhang (MIT) and supported two female keynote speakers, Prof. Mariana Kruithof-de Julio (Bern University) and Prof. Sara Nunes Vasconcelos (University of Toronto) to present at MMB&rsquo;18. In addition, we were also able to provide 4 poster awards to student presenters through NSF&rsquo;s support. Lab on a Chip, Analyst, and Integrative Biology also graciously offered book voucher prizes to our top poster presenters. From the feedback we received, attendees were uniformly impressed by the quality of science presented at the meeting and enjoyed the ample opportunity for networking with peers in a relaxing environment and a constructive manner.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/11/2018<br>      Modified by: Allen Po-Chih&nbsp;Liu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
