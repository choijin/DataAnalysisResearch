<AbstractNarration>An important question in the study of charitable organizations is what motivate people to contribute more?  This proposed research will use theory and experiments to investigate whether providing more information about the value of the proposed public good at the fundraising stage will encourage more donations.  The researchers will develop a theoretical model which predicts that providing more information to people who do not generally donate will encourage them to donate, while providing more information to those who normally donate decreases their donations.   The researchers will use new and sophisticated methods to test this theory. Early test results confirm the predictions of the theory.  The results of this research project are useful for formulating fundraising policies for charities---share more information with communities which would otherwise not donate.  The research results also provide guidance on how governments can generate support for providing public goods.  The research project also contributes to US global leadership in economics research by supporting graduate student research in economics and thus increases US?s research capital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will use theoretical and experimental methods to investigate the impact of providing more information about the value of a public good on voluntary cooperative giving. The research first develops a theoretical model to investigate the effects of providing information about the project's value on expected contributions. The model predicts that the generosity level of the population plays an important role in how agents respond to information; information has the potential to increase average contributions in less generous populations but may decrease it in more generous populations. The PIs will then use laboratory experiments to test this model as well as measure people?s willingness to pay for such information.  Preliminary experimental results confirm the theoretical predictions.  The results of the research project have important policy implications for how charities provide information on the outcomes of their activities to generate more donations.  It also provides guidance on how governments may generate support for the provision of public and merit goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

It consists of two distinct studies.</p> <p>The first study investigates theoretically and experimentally how information about the value of the public good affects its provision. This is an important question since survey evidence by Camber Collective suggests significant presence of uninformed donors, raising concerns that this lack of information has negatively impacted charitable giving. This study provides a rigorous framework to investigate the impact of more information provision.</p> <p>The first study finds that the impact of information about the value of the public good on donations crucially depends on the generosity level of the donor population. In particular, the theoretical model predicts that such information increases average contributions if the donor population is relatively less generous. This is because the average uninformed donation in a less generous group is low. While good news of high value for the public good encourages more giving, bad news has little to no impact. As a result, information is on average beneficial for giving. Just the opposite is true in a more generous population where the average uninformed donation is high. Providing information in this case hurts contributions on average since generous donors respond very little to good news of high value but reduce giving substantially in response to bad news of low value.</p> <p>The experimental data confirms the above predictions. Figure 1 (Figure 2) depicts the average contributions from the experimental sessions with less (more) generous donor groups. Both figures represent the average contributions of the ten rounds of the contribution game under low value, high value, and unknown value. Figure 1 confirms that less generous donors respond more to good news of high value and relatively little to bad news of low value. As a result, uninformed contributions are on average lower than informed contributions. Figure 2 illustrates the opposite dynamics for the more generous donors.</p> <p>The second study investigates how information about past contributions to competing public projects impacts giving and market efficiency. This is an important question as fundraising campaigns need to determine whether to reveal past contributions. Such information may help coordination on more valuable public good projects, but it may also give rise to adverse incentives for donors to free-ride on others' contributions. The goal of the study is to determine the relative importance of the coordination and the free-riding problem and understand under what conditions revealing information about past contributions improves market efficiency.</p> <p class="vert-spacing">The model and experimental design consider a setting with two competing projects (one being less costly but also less valuable) that require donors' coordination on one of the projects to fully cover its provision cost. In the absence of information about past contributions, donors face a significant coordination problem that may result in no provision or the provision of only the less valuable public good. Information about past contributions eliminates the coordination problem but it may give rise to a free-riding problem by earlier contributors who give nothing or very little to the less valuable public good and rely on the subsequent donors to provide the remaining funding. The theoretical model predicts that the coordination problem is more severe as the number of donors grows, while the free-riding problem is more severe when provision of the more efficient public good is associated with a small value gain compared to the additional average provision cost. Thus, the experimental design varies the average provision cost and the size of the donor population to study the impact of information.
