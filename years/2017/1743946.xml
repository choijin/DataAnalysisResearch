<AbstractNarration>Title: CHESS Workshop on Emerging Frontiers in Biology&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This workshop will identify most compelling and significant challenges in biology where x-ray synchrotron source would provide unique abilities to tackle with such challenges.  Biological sciences encompasses studies of systems from atomistic resolution to whole cells and organisms with processes covering a wide range of  time and length scales. Deeper understanding of biological processes requires development of complementary techniques to provide a multiscale interdisciplinary approach. This workshop is designed to develop broader outlook in the application of high-energy x-rays to challenging biological problems and to facilitate wider involvement in biological community in such studies.</AbstractNarration>
