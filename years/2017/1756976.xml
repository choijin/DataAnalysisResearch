<AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: RUI: Mechanisms regulating facultative migrations of the Pine Siskin&lt;br/&gt;Institutions: Loyola Marymount University, and a partnership with UC-Davis&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 03/13/2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Migratory behavior can be characterized by regular and predictable seasonal and directional movements, or the movements may be much less predictable with respect to both timing and direction. The less predictable movements, known as facultative migration, are much more difficult to study.  This project will investigate the drivers of facultative migration in a captive species of bird, the pine siskin (Spinus pinus). The goals of the project are to assess 1) What cue(s) trigger the development of a migratory stage; and 2) What endocrine hormones mediate the migratory response? Four cues (photoperiod, food availability, population density, and mate availability) and two hormones (corticosterone and testosterone) will be investigated. Understanding how animals respond to environmental variability is critical in today's changing climate. The project will train a post-graduate researcher at a primarily undergraduate institution, and will involve large numbers of undergraduates, including those from underrepresented groups.  The lead investigator is a beginning investigator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will systematically and comprehensively investigate the mechanisms underlying facultative migration, a suite of behaviors that are taxonomically widespread. It is the captive avian model organism that enables this research. Four different hypotheses will be investigated as part of the first goal of the project: (i) an increasing photoperiod stimulates facultative migration in the spring; (ii) declining food availability stimulates the development&amp;#8232;of migration; (iii) high local population density, prior to a decline in food availability, can trigger the transition to a migratory&amp;#8232; stage; and (iv) that a shortage of potential mates can stimulate migration around the time of breeding.  Two additional hypotheses will be investigated as part of the second goal: (i) increased circulating corticosterone levels stimulate &amp;#8232;the development of a migratory stage; and (ii) the transition to a migratory stage is stimulated&amp;#8232; by increased circulating testosterone levels. Experiments will include manipulating the environmental triggers and tracking behavioral and physiological responses, and direct manipulation of the endocrine hormones. The combined approaches will provide significant opportunities for research training at a primarily undergraduate institution.  The team will work with the Loyola Marymount University Center for Urban Resilience to develop and disseminate materials to be used in Los Angeles area schools.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Every year billions of animals around the world and across the animal kingdom undertake migrations. We typically think about migrations as regular and predictable movements that take animals to and from the same places each year, at the same times each year. But not all migrations are this predictable. Some migrations occur much less predictably with respect to timing and/or direction. These less predictable migrations, known as facultative migrations, have proven to be much more difficult to study. This project is among the first to systematically and comprehensively study facultative migration by investigating the drivers of facultative migration using a species of bird, the pine siskin, that exhibits aspects of migratory behavior in captivity. Specifically, this project addressed two key questions: (1) What environmental cues trigger facultative migration; and 2) What hormones coordinate the migratory response? This project has revealed roles for changes in day length and food availability, as well as the social environment, in the timing of facultative migration. We found that pine siskins have a relatively predictable spring migratory period that is stimulated by the lengthening days that occur at this time of year. In response to longer days, birds show physiological preparations for migration, such as depositing fat that can be used to fuel migratory flight. These preparations are followed by changes in behavior that indicate a readiness to migrate. We also found that declining food availability can trigger a migratory response, with birds showing migratory behavior but not physiological preparations for migration. Further, our work suggests a role for the social environment, that is neighboring birds, in fine-tuning the timing of migration. We investigated two hormones that may play a role in triggering migration: corticosterone and testosterone. We have found no evidence for a role of corticosterone in triggering a spring migratory state. But corticosterone may be important in the response to declining food availability. Our findings indicate that testosterone could play a role in the transition to a spring migratory state, but more work is needed to resolve this further. Overall, the findings from this project have advanced a more comprehensive understanding of migration. In particular, a major contribution of our work has been to advance a more nuanced understanding of variation in migratory behavior. This has included work to more carefully define different forms of migration and to highlight areas where further refinement of our understanding is needed. This project has also revealed that understanding the context in which a migration is occurring is essential to understanding the migratory response and the mechanisms involved. Our results indicate that even for a single species, the behavioral and physiological responses vary with context, as do the endocrine mechanisms involved in the response.
