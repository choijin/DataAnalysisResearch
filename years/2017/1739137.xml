<AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches - The objective of this research is to explore high-efficiency regenerative solar energy storage, by using photoelectrochemical redox reactions and advanced semiconductors. The approaches are to obtain key fabrication parameters of the doped highly active photocatalysts; to study photoelectrochemical stability, activity, and storage capacity and efficiency; to design and set up a photoelectrochemical continuous flow reactor and investigate continuous energy conversion efficiency and kinetics; and to conduct computational fluid dynamic simulation of the continuous reactor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit - The proposed multidisciplinary research will resolve the three major challenges that have hindered the development of efficient solar energy storage in the past, i.e., active and stable materials, high-capacity energy medium, and reversible conversion kinetics. This project strives to establish a methodology for the systematic design and effective integration of high-efficiency regenerative solar energy storage, as an alternative to H2 production from water splitting. It can provide new perspectives that would elevate our understanding of the photocatalytic mechanisms, allowing us to effectively predict the photo-electrochemical functionality and stability of potential systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts - Successful execution of the proposed research will have profound impacts on broad research areas such as solar power, renewable energy, energy storage &amp; generation, and many other sustainable and energy research fields. The proposed research will transform solar energy storage with better efficiency, improved storage capacity, and easy scale-up capability. Educational program will be integrated into the multidisciplinary research, aiming to shift the paradigm from lecture-based single-discipline teaching to student-centric multidisciplinary learning.</AbstractNarration>
