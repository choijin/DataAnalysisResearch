<AbstractNarration>An important part of understanding chemical cycling in the ocean is understanding the processes that deliver elements and nutrients to or remove them from the oceans. The atmosphere can be an important source of material from rain and from dust. In some parts of the oceans, input of elements such as iron from dust (and possibly rain) can play an important role in stimulating the growth of phytoplankton, the base of the marine food chain. This study will involve collection and analysis of a two-year time-series of filtered air samples from two locations in the subarctic North Pacific, aimed at understanding the inputs of metals to the ocean surface from Alaskan and Asian dust and from fossil fuel combustion. The dust time series observations and analyses proposed will provide insight that will aid the interpretation of observations from the 2018 U.S. GEOTRACES Pacific Meridional Transect expedition. This project will support a graduate student for two years and will be the basis of his or her Ph.D. research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will collect atmospheric dust samples from two land-based locations well suited to capture the flux to surface waters of the subarctic North Pacific. One is on the northern side of the Aleutian chain, and the second is an island to the northeast (Middleton Island), at the shelf break, in the northern Gulf of Alaska. Sampling will be carried out year round at Middleton Island using an automated sampling system, while high-volume sampling will be carried out for one month at each of the two locations during targeted known seasonal events. These will help infer and characterize inputs from Asian dust, known to occur primarily in the spring, and from Alaskan dust, known to occur primarily in the autumn. Samples from large events will be made available to the GEOTRACES research community for analyses. The HYSPLIT model will be used to simulate dust transport and deposition, for comparison to observations. Previous work documents substantial interannual variability in dust fluxes from Alaska and from Asia, and volcanic ash input is even more variable. Given the seasonality and interannual and spatial variability of the dust sources, and the short residence time of Fe and other trace elements and isotopes in surface waters, this history of deposition from dust and fossil fuel combustion, and its geochemical characterization, will help to distinguish the various inputs more comprehensively than is possible with a single research cruise.&amp;#8232;A variety of size fractions will be collected and analyzed to infer the particle size range that contains each of the metals. Analyses will be carried out on over twenty elements, including Fe, Al, the REE, the isotopes of Pb, Sr and Nd (the tracers that best distinguish the dust source end members), and metals including V and Ag to infer contributions from fossil fuel combustion. Activities in air of the natural radionuclides lead-210 and beryllium-7, and their depositional fluxes, will be determined to convert elemental concentrations in dust into flux estimates to surface waters. Experiments will evaluate the control of different organic ligands on the solubility of iron and other metals in surface seawater, the relative solubility of different size fractions, and the relative solubility of dust- versus fossil fuel-derived metals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
