<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in offering modular and reconfigurable mobile robotics solutions for deployment in environments that maybe unsafe for humans.  Modularity offers a unique opportunity to address needs in multiple markets with a single solution when coupled with a suite of specific attachment modules.  It is envisioned that the platform will first be adopted by law enforcement.  Other market that will be explored include defense applications, where there seems to be interest in throwable robots.  Robotic assistance for environmental management is another potential market area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on developments in small mobile robots for applications in search, rescue and reconnaissance.  This modular platform is designed to support efforts in the context of "robotics science of safety."  Novel aspects in design provide more advanced mobility characteristics than currently available platforms. The locomotion designs spawns new questions and opportunities for basic research in legged locomotion.  A modular form-factor makes this robot accessible to a larger audience, with an inexpensive baseline model that can be upgraded with sensor and hardware packages as needed by the customers.  Throwable, and miniature sized robots are currently an asset to operations involving reconnaissance, inspection and characterization in dangerous environments.  Driven by customer feedback, the features of this robot can carefully evolve to meet the needs of each customer segment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this project has been the product-market-fit between first responders and a recently developed innovative robotic technology for providing remote situational awareness and inspection capability in hazardous or otherwise unreachable environments. More specifically the underlying hypothesis stemmed from a value proposition: A modular robot platform for remote exploration of unsafe and unreachable spaces; enabling customers to safely capture video, sensor data and a wide range of other geospatial information.  By following this path from hypothesis to validation the end goal of this work has been to de-risk a viable business model for the commercialization of the related technology.  The primary mechanism for validating hypotheses was customer discovery, a process of conducting non-leading conversations (experiments) to uncover pain points for a potential customer. The lessons learned from each conversation are recorded and then rolled back into new hypotheses and re-tested. Throughout a focused deep dive into a single target market, various aspects including channels, key resources, key partners, among others are noted within a business model canvas. Throughout the funding cycle we visited the Mid-Atlantic Security Expo in Illinois and SHOT Show in Nevada with plans to visit several more shows in 2018. Finally, with enough customer feedback and validation a minimum viable product was made and is currently in the process of validation through a series of pilot tests.  We discovered that one of the key problems that SWAT teams face is the lack of real-time information during hostage situations.  The available money these teams have come from an annual cycle of grants, viewed more as an expendable pool of funds granted with relative certainty from town hall.  In this context,  improving safety can be translated as reducing civilian injury and less officer downtime due to injury or psychological impacts which can be associated with lawsuits and medical bills respectively.  Conferences/Trade shows were found to be the best way of reaching this customer segment, as well as of breaking into new police departments.  Key partnerships were identified by talking with existing robotics companies and SWAT team trainers.  Some of the notable features we have identified by developing and using a minimal viable product (MVP) for product validation include: interest of customers in reconfigurability, need for a depth perception module, and ability for stair climbing.  There are therefore many benefits that can be realized by the introduction of more safe practices into SWAT team operations.  In recent years there has been an increasingly negative impression of law enforcement officers. Introducing our technology may help improve this opinion by decreasing the number of accidents and human-to-human conflicts.   Improving public safety and the safety of SWAT team member is therefore a direct result, but there are also impacts related to the publics opinion of law enforcement.
