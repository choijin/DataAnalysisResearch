<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to investigate the fundamental mechanisms that are responsible for fatigue failure in shape memory alloys (SMAs), with a focus on deformation and phase transformation at the microstructural length scale. Low cycle fatigue, where the SMA undergoes a relatively low number of cycles at high stress amplitudes, and very high cycle fatigue, where the SMA undergoes a very high number of cycles at low stress amplitudes, will be studied. The solid-to-solid phase transformation that enables the unique properties of SMAs will be quantitatively characterized at the grain level, and linked to the mesoscopic response and macroscopic stress-strain behavior of these alloys. The resulting unique, quantitative information on phase transformations will be used to improve the accuracy of lifetime and performance predictions, as well as the optimal design, of these materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the links between microstructure and macroscopic behavior is a fundamental challenge in the design and use of materials. SMA components - for example, in military, aerospace, biomedical, and automotive applications - are being increasingly used under fatigue conditions, and a quantitative understanding of the effect of microstructure on their fatigue behavior is critically necessary. This project incorporates a number of educational efforts that are closely tied to the proposed research, including undergraduate summer internships, graduate student enrichment involving a collaborative effort with the Department of Mathematics at the University of Bristol, incorporation of research results into coursework, and dissemination of research findings through a public seminar series and television show.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research examined the fatigue and fracture of the shape memory alloy (SMA) Nitinol across length scales, connecting the microscopic length scale to the macroscale behavior. SMAs exhibit unique properties, such as superelasticity, which is the ability to elastically recover large strains, through a solid-to-solid phase transformation that involves the diffusion-less rearrangement of its atomic lattice. This phase transformation causes complex behaviors under repeated loading (fatigue) and in how these alloys eventually fail (fracture), which are critical to understand in order to improve the design of, and predictively model, their behavior. The results of this research have direct implications for the use of Nitinol in fatigue applications ranging from minimally-invasive biomedical devices to advanced aerospace components.  The effects of processing on the manner in which Nitinol sustains damage was examined. In commercially utilized superelastic Nitinol, it was found that certain material textures result in a lower accumulation of permanent deformation and a lower rate at which cracks grow under fatigue loading, with the tradeoff of slightly diminished superelastic range. Therefore, if the design constraints are amenable for lower superelastic strains and higher transformation stresses, then the highest tensile stresses should align with the "difficult-to-transform" direction of the material.   The properties of a new nanocrystalline Nitinol, with exceptionally stable superelastic properties for extended device lifetimes, was additionally investigated and resulted in the quantification of important relationships between crack behavior and alloy processing (grain size). The direct capture of crack tip strain measurements during reverse phase transformation behind a stable growing crack, and the direct capture of crack closure, were both achieved for the first time on the microscale. The dependence of fatigue crack growth rate was examined with respect to the grain size of this alloy.  This research also resulted in significant improvements in experimental capabilities, including two improvements to the widely used experimental technique of Digital Image Correlation (DIC), which is used to track full-field deformations. These improvements are easy to implement and result in significant error reductions in measured displacements.

The results from this research were widely shared though seminars, journal publications, and other means of communications. Several public talks and demonstrations were given to audiences with participants from five to ninety years old, detailing the fascinating behavior and abilities of this material. A comprehensive website was created to enable any interested person to learn about the DIC method, and is located online at digitalimagecorrelation.org.
