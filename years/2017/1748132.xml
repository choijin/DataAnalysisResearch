<AbstractNarration>This award continues the "Blue Skies Manufacturing Workshop" during North America's largest manufacturing conference - the co-located 2018 International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC) sponsored by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the 46th Annual North American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC) sponsored by the North American Manufacturing Research Institution of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers. This conference will take place from June 18-22, 2018 and is hosted by Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, Texas. This is the ideal venue for the workshop, which is designed to identify bold visions for the manufacturing sector more than ten years in the future, and to identify the required basic research needed to achieve that bold vision. These two leading conferences in the Manufacturing Engineering field act as global bridges between industries, government laboratories, and academic institutions. Blue Skies Activities will include: 1) Brief introductory presentations by Workshop organizers and others; 2) Presentations by 6-8 manufacturing thought leaders; 3) Interactions among workshop participants, NSF program directors, Manufacturing thought leaders, and staff of the interagency Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office. The speakers will be selected from one-page abstracts; their travel to the workshop will be supported by the award. A panel of judges will evaluate the presentations and decide upon a winner. The Society of Manufacturing Engineers continues to award the David Dornfeld Manufacturing Vision Award to the best presentation. The workshop, expected to be attended by at least 80 attendees of the conference, is intended to be the first instance of an annual event that will help articulate and develop a broad manufacturing vision, and to catalyze support for that vision. The vision will be a useful resource for policy makers, federal funding agencies, companies developing their own manufacturing strategies, university researchers, and others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The support will cover (1) the registration fees, and (2) the travel fees for the speakers and PIs. The call for abstracts is disseminated through the Society of Manufacturing Engineers and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers; the submitted applications go through a selection process by the conference committee. The highest rated applications will be invited to give full presentations. After the conference, a summary of the Blue Skies visions will be published as a North American Manufacturing Research Institute white paper.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to offer the second NSF Blue Sky Manufacturing Workshop which was held during the 2018 SME North American Manufacturing Research Conference / ASME Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (NAMRC/MSEC), June 18-22, 2018 in College Station, Texas. The workshop is intended to catalyze a future vision for US manufacturing, including areas for emphasis in future manufacturing research and education.   In total, 26 abstracts were received in the 2018 competition.  An 11-member selection committee reviewed the abstracts and selected seven finalists to make oral presentations on June 10, 2019.  The presentations were made in two sessions at the conference.  Both sessions were attended by about 70 people.  At the end of the two sessions, the selection committee selected one talk as the recipient of the 2018 SME Dornfeld Manufacturing Vision Award.   Information about the selection committee and competition finalists is available online at   https://www.sme.org/aboutsme/awards/blue-sky-competition/.  This website includes information about the selection committee, presentation finalists and award winners of all Blue Sky Competitions to date, including abstracts and presentations from past presentation finalists.  The purpose of this annual competition is to influence the future of manufacturing research and education in the United States through new visionary ideas of the future. Competitions to date have attracted more than 100 submissions in total and the presentations have been attended by approximately 300 people.  A key outcome is the opportunity of innovative thinkers to get their ideas in front of leaders in manufacturing research, who can foster the advancement of these new ideas into whole new areas of investigation through national workshops and networking.
