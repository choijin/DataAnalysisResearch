<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to plan and organize the 2017 NSF Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Principal Investigator (PI) Meeting. This meeting convenes all PIs of the National Science Foundation CPS Program for the fifth time since the program began. The PI Meeting is to take place on November 13-14, 2017 in Alexandria, Virginia. The PI meeting is an annual opportunity for NSF-sponsored CPS researchers, industry representatives, and Federal agencies' representatives to gather and review new CPS developments, identify new and emerging applications, and to discuss technology gaps and barriers. The program agenda is community-driven and includes presentations (oral and poster) from PIs, reports of past year program activities, and showcase/pitch new CPS innovations and results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The annual PI Meeting serves as the only opportunity where the CPS researcher community gathers to share their research, discuss new research opportunities and challenges, and explore new ideas and partnerships for future work. Furthermore, the PI meeting is also an opportunity for the academic research community to interact with industry entities and government agencies with vested interest in CPS research and development. The PI Meeting is a forum for sharing ideas across the CPS community. It has played a major role in growing the community across broad range of sectors and technologies, and performing outreach to others who have interest in learning about the program and participating as future proposers, transition partners, or future sponsors. The 2017 PI meeting will feature additional demonstrations to show the impact of CPS research.   Finally, we expect to conduct discussions across the community on considerations and ideas to inspire CPS 2.0, and future collaborations with the Industrial Internet Consortium which includes multiple organizations transitioning CPS research into practice.</AbstractNarration>
