<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the widespread nature of the problem of airborne Black (BC) and Brown (BrC) carbon particulates.  These are formed from combustion processes such as motor vehicles and ships, forest fires and biomass burning, as well as indoor cooking in developing countries.  BC and BrC are important components of atmospheric aerosols (small airborne solid and liquid particles) that affect air quality, visibility and climate.  The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 7 million premature deaths globally in 2012 were linked to air pollution, and black carbon-containing aerosols are often singled out as a major contributor due to their strong linkages to adverse health effects.  Accurate and robust monitoring of BC (and BrC) at a lower cost is necessary in urban and industrial areas throughout the United States and abroad to provide adequate temporal and spatial measurements that can be used to assess regional air quality models and estimate community exposure risks.  This information will then make it possible for local and regional government agencies to develop mitigation strategies that protect the health of their communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the problem of accurate and inexpensive Black Carbon (BC) measurements by developing a long-path photometer to quantify airborne BC and BrC particulates.  The most common commercially-available technique for BC and BrC requires collection of particulates on a filter. This filter introduces numerous artefacts requiring complicated corrections.  Other existing techniques are quite expensive and require significant expertise to operate.  The Black Carbon Photometer (BCP) to be developed here will not require pre-concentration on a filter, thus providing a direct, correction-free measurement.  It will be operationally simple and require little maintenance, similar to photometers routinely used in monitoring networks for gas phase species such as ozone.  The initial BCP will be low power, portable and is projected to cost less than currently available BC analyzers.  Thus, it should provide researchers in air quality and public health, as well as those in monitoring agencies, a practical and economical alternative to existing technologies.</AbstractNarration>

Light absorption and scattering by aerosols is one of the critical uncertainties in current climate modeling.  Black carbon aerosols are considered to be second only to CO2 as a driver of global climate change, and its reduction is thought to be the fastest and most effective way to reduce near-term global warming effects.  Furthermore, human exposure to black carbon particulates is linked to numerous adverse health effects worldwide (respiratory ailments such as asthma, cardiovascular disease and cancer).  The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 1 in 8 premature deaths globally can be linked to air pollution, and a large fraction of those deaths are related to aerosol exposure.  Therefore it is imperative to have a robust, inexpensive, accurate measure of black carbon aerosol to develop networks that quantify its spatial and temporal variability of concentration and emission sources.  This is especially important in developing countries and rapidly industrializing regions such as Asia where air quality is severely impacted.  There is an opportunity for expanding high-quality black carbon measurements at a substantially lower cost in order to provide important data needed by policymakers to formulate effective strategies aimed at reducing climate impacts, managing air quality and protecting public health.  In this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project we developed a new, simple, inexpensive, and rugged instrument, the Black Carbon Photometer, for measuring the extinction of atmospheric particles directly in the aerosol (gas + particles) phase.  This development represents a huge advance in black carbon measurement technology as compared to the method of aethalometry used for the past several decades, which requires pre-concentration of the particles on a filter tape.  The direct measurement of light extinction in the Black Carbon Photometer eliminates large uncertainties associated with light scattering within the filter medium, thereby providing more accurate measurements.

The Black Carbon Photometer is currently being launched as a product, with a scheduled launch date of December 1, 2018.  The principal markets being addressed include university and government scientists involved in aerosol research for climate studies as well as monitoring of black carbon in urban air for identifying and characterizing sources, evaluating health effects and monitoring the results of mitigation efforts.  In the Phase II project we will modify the Black Carbon Photometer to measure NO2 and NO in the same instrument using the same optical bench, and we will incorporate this BC/NO2/NO instrument into a compact, lamp-post-mounted package containing miniaturized instruments for measurement of ozone, CO and CO2.  The purpose of this new AQSync air monitoring package will be to serve as both a stand-alone air monitoring station, especially for developing countries, and as a calibration station for fleets of vehicles instrumented with sensors for high spatial and temporal resolution mapping of air pollutants at the street level.
