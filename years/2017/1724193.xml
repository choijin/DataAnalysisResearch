<AbstractNarration>This project funds continued operations and science investigations associated with the Low-Latitude Ionospheric Sensor Network (LISN). LISN is a distributed array of GPS receivers, magnetometers and ionosondes, that measure  ionospheric parameters in the low-latitude South American sector. The network is on the same continent and within the latitude belt of the Jicamarca observatory, that hosts a suite of thermosphere-ionosphere observing systems. The overarching science goal enabled by the LISN observatory is to understand the complex day-to-day variability and the extreme disturbances that occur in the South American low-latitude ionosphere nearly every day after sunset. These occurrences pose a prominent natural hazard to communication, navigation and high precision pointing systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projects outlined in this proposal will help to understand the onset of plasma structuring that takes place at low and mid latitudes and that affect communication and navigation systems. LISN real-time data are available to space weather forecasting enterprises that elect to avail themselves of it. LISN is an international collaboration that nurtures new technological expertise and graduate-level aeronomy courses in South American countries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Major  goals were severely cut back from the original proposal due to a  funding level of a mere 5% of the original request.  The dramatic  re-scoping was required to just support the installation of the VIPIR in Columbia.  Long delays in this task have pushed it's completion past the deadline of this award.     This grant supported the travel of a CU PhD student in Atmospheric Sciences to attend the CEDAR workshops.  Publication charges for papers related to this PhD were supported. Two  published papers demonstrate conclusively that man-made sources of  acoustic energy can propagate to the lower thermosphere and be detected  using the ionosphere.  This partially addresses the  thermosphere-ionosphere coupling objectives of the original grant. Effort was placed in the training of students and young scientists and engineers from the various countries.  These persons no have increased ability to understand the sophistication of the VIPIR instruments and the complexity of the resulting data, leading to improved ability to operate the instrument and analyze the data. A key outcome of this effort was the amplitude and phase calibration procedures which unfortunately revealed numerous receive channel anomalies in the VIPIR receivers.  These anomalies dominate the channel error budget, impairing phase based echolocation.   Hardware corrections have been developed, but remain unimplemented because they require additional travel to the field sites.
