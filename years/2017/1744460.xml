<AbstractNarration>The Sustainability Teams Empower and Amplify Membership in STEM (S-TEAMS), an NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilot project, will tackle the problem of persistent underrepresentation by low-income, minority, and women students in STEM disciplines and careers through transdisciplinary teamwork. As science is increasingly done in teams, collaborations bring diversity to research. Diverse interactions can support critical thinking, problem-solving, and is a priority among STEM disciplines. By exploring a set of individual contributors that can be effect change through collective impact, this project will explore alternative approaches to broadly enhance diversity in STEM, such as sense of community and perceived program benefit. The S-TEAMS project relies on the use of sustainability as the organizing frame for the deployment of learning communities (teams) that engage deeply with active learning. Studies on the issue of underrepresentation often cite a feeling of isolation and lack of academically supportive networks with other students like themselves as major reasons for a disinclination to pursue education and careers in STEM, even as the numbers of underrepresented groups are increasing in colleges and universities across the country. The growth of sustainability science provides an excellent opportunity to include students from underrepresented groups in supportive teams working together on problems that require expertise in multiple disciplines. Participating students will develop professional skills and strengthen STEM- and sustainability-specific skills through real-world experience in problem solving and team science. Ultimately this project is expected to help increase the number of qualified professionals in the field of sustainability and the number of minorities in the STEM professions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there is certainly a clear need to improve engagement and retention of underrepresented groups across the entire spectrum of STEM education - from K-12 through graduate education, and on through career choices - the explicit focus here is on the undergraduate piece of this critical issue. This approach to teamwork makes STEM socialization integral to the active learning process. Five-member transdisciplinary teams, from disciplines such as biology, chemistry, computer and information sciences, geography, geology, mathematics, physics, and sustainability science, will work together for ten weeks in summer 2018 on real-world projects with corporations, government organizations, and nongovernment organizations. Sustainability teams with low participation by underrepresented groups will be compared to those with high representation to gather insights regarding individual and collective engagement, productivity, and ongoing interest in STEM. Such insights will be used to scale up the effort through partnership with New Jersey Higher Education Partnership for Sustainability (NJHEPS).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project showed how an innovative internship model (the Green Teams program of Montclair State University, upon which the project's Sustainability Teams were modeled) gave undergraduates who were new to the science and technology arena vitally important tools for broadening their education and career options, by lessening social isolation and providing supportive networks. We recruited 30 interns from 15 universities who were awarded stipends and given rigorous training. They were then invited by diverse partner organizations (Earth Friendly Products, Hydrogen House, Jersey City,&nbsp;NJ TRANSIT, Stryker,&nbsp;and SUEZ) to work for 10 weeks in five-person transdisciplinary teams to address major environmental challenges identified by their hosts. Of the chosen interns, 18 were female and 22 were from groups underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering or Math (i.e. minorities and women). Following comprehensive training in subjects like Basic Sustainability Science, Systems Thinking, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, and Data Analytics, the interns collaborated on high-quality real-world sustainability solutions for their hosts. Examples included analyzing greenhouse gas emissions, remediating algal blooms, and quantifying and reducing hazardous materials. They also completed community service projects like invasive plant species pulls, which doubled as bonding experiences; and they wrote comprehensive reports on their solutions to present before large stakeholder audiences, thus honing skills like writing and public speaking, alongside their scientific skills. This all helped bridge the gap between academia and real-world science and technology opportunities by introducing participating undergraduates to corporate and community leaders who welcomed their intellectual input, provided career advice and, for some, represented role models they may never have had before. The project's evaluation showed that interns felt valued within their teams and by their hosts, which led some to alter their majors, embracing science and technology in ways they had not considered prior to the internship experience. Research showed that while this was the first internship for most students, those students who had parents with careers in science and technology tended to see more value in science training and experiences than those without parents in the field. Additionally, older students and those more advanced in their college programs had more positive attitudes toward sustainability after participating in the program than younger, less experienced students.&nbsp;</p> <p>For a growing collaborative network, we also conducted workshops showing how to improve diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Finally, we promoted the project at numerous local, regional, and national meetings and conferences of interested academic, corporate, nonprofit, and governmental entities in New Jersey and beyond, in collaboration with the New Jersey Higher Education Partnership for Sustainability. Ultimately, the project scaled up from two universities in 2016 (when the Green Teams were launched) to 26 when the Sustainability Teams finished their work in 2019. Most schools were in New Jersey, but we also had a growing influx of out-of-state applicants.</p> <p>The project's impacts were felt not only by participating interns, but also by the public/private entities hosting them, and the larger audiences reached during recruiting and presentation events. These audiences were shown the potential good of a diverse well-trained workforce capable of creating high-quality sustainability solutions from a wide variety of viewpoints. Many of the project's growing stakeholder networks expressed the desire to continue striving toward more diverse and inclusive work scenarios. Participating interns are also making an impact as they enter graduate and professional degree programs at some of the most competitive universities, including Boston University, Georgia Institute of Technology, and The New School. Finally, the importance of diversity and inclusion in the science and technology arenas was made manifest not just to project stakeholders, but also in the interns' wider academic and social circles. This improves general scientific literacy, as participating undergraduates discuss the real-world applications of their internships with family, friends, fellow students, colleagues, and new transdisciplinary networks growing out of the project. As such work expands, it contributes to the aspired shift toward diversity and inclusion in higher education, and science and technology. Such ongoing conversations surrounding the world's enormous sustainability challenges, which include near-universal climate impacts, are raising general awareness about how these challenges arise, what can be done about them, and how urgent is the need to have diverse cohorts of motivated individuals prepared to address them.&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin-top: 0in;
