<AbstractNarration>Life on earth exhibits a dazzling array of patterns. These range from internal patterns, like the repetition of vertebrae in the spinal cord, to external patterns like the stripes of black pigment on a zebra. Pigmentation has become a powerful model for exploring the origins and genetic mechanisms behind these types of patterns. For example, new information about insect development has been learned by studying the colorful eyespots in butterflies. In plants, the mechanisms of pigment production have been well-studied, but surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms of complex patterns of pigmentation. Filling this knowledge gap is the goal of this research. This project will study two species of monkeyflower; each has flowers with strikingly different color patterns. What's more, when the two species are mated together, new intricate and complex color patterns emerge. Since these new pigmentation patterns are seen only when different species are mated together, it suggests that interactions between their genomes give rise to the new patterns. Exploring how such interactions between different genomes can produce unexpected new traits is a primary focus of this research. One master's student, six undergraduates, and six high school students will be recruited to carry out this work. These students will be exposed to high-impact learning opportunities as they are immersed in hands-on scientific research.  At least two of the high school students will be selected from a high school that specifically serves disadvantaged youth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pigmentation patterns in the hybrids of Mimulus cupreus x M. luteus var. variegatus are too intricate to quantify using standard approaches. Instead, a new digital image analysis pipeline is being developed. This approach will be useful for analyzing spatial patterning in monkeyflowers and in other taxa. The researchers will use this new method to identify and quantify elements of floral color pattern in a phenotypically diverse F2 hybrid population. Next-generation sequencing will be used to map the genomic regions responsible for the observed variation in flower patterns. Because M. cupreus and M. l. variegatus also differ in yellow carotenoid pigmentation, the same phenotypic and genetic datasets will be used to identify the genetic basis of divergent carotenoid production, which is an important but under-studied component of plant physiology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
