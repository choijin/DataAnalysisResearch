<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in its potential to develop a new mechanism for painlessly terminating atrial fibrillation.  Cardiac arrhythmia is one of the leading causes of death and debilitation.  A common means of terminating harmful rhythms is delivering a shock via an external or implantable defibrillator.  The pain from the shock is the number one concern for patients with implantable defibrillators, and because of the pain, an implantable option is not practical for atrial fibrillation.  The high-risk, high-reward research to be conducted under this project will significantly advance the field of defibrillation therapy and aims to lead to the introduction of a new class of implantable medical device technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project seeks to develop and evaluate an implantable device that achieves non-destructive temporary conduction delay in cardiac tissues for the painless termination, and potentially prevention, of life threatening arrhythmias.  Cardiac arrhythmias are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. More than 1,000 Americans die each day from sudden cardiac arrest.  The team intends to initially target the development of a device to achieve rapid and painless termination of life threatening arrhythmias to treat atrial fibrillation. The successful development of the proposed device has the potential to benefit millions of patients.  Additionally, by virtue of its painless modulation of arrhythmogenesis, the proposed device may well also terminate incipient arrhythmias.  The phase II project will develop and evaluate a prototype system.  It is anticipated that the project will result in a new implantable medical device that painlessly terminates atrial fibrillation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  In our Phase I SBIR grant, we demonstrated that cooling the oblique sinus effectively terminates Atrial Fibrillation in a canine model.  Our Phase II research built on this finding and sought to test other locations, device sizes and geometries, and advance our thermal and electrical understanding of prototype devices to prepare for human work and commercialization of this technology.  The three key objectives accomplished during Phase II:  Specify, develop and build a sealed prototype epicardial cooling device, built with an integral heat management system, capable of cooling approximately 3 CM2 of atrial tissue for 30 seconds. Conduct animal studies to identify optimal regions of therapeutic cooling to maximize AF-terminating effects observed in the oblique sinus.  Additional sites including Vein of Marshall and transverse sinus will be subjected to experimentation during range finding experiments to evaluate cooling module geometries and locations affecting AF termination. Perform thermal modeling and simulations incorporating performance results from objective #1 and objective #2 to develop full specification and design parameters for a fully implantable device in anticipation of human surgical studies in the next phase of development.   Research Summary  We have accomplished all of our major objectives specified in our proposal.   We initially used a sealed prototype epicardial cooling device as described previously in various sizes and shapes to cool atrial tissue as specified in objective #1. To achieve this within the funding parameters, we continued to use the chiller device to allow rapid iteration of these prototypes and innovate as we conducted our range finding experiments.  Over the past two years, we have conducted 20 canine animal experiments.  In the course of these experiments, we have evaluated three different geometries - square, hinged and finger-shaped or cylindrical devices.  We have also evaluated multiple sized devices 1" square and 1" hinged devices, 3/4" square and 3/4" hinged and 1/2" devices.  We have also tested and evaluated these devices in multiple regions to confirm that our initial hypothesis that the Oblique Sinus was the most efficacious location.  The results demonstrated our ability to use a smaller device - a 1/2" square - with similar efficacy as the larger 1" device used in Phase I of this research.  This is significant as we look to build a smaller device commercially with significantly reduced power and heat dissipation requirements.  While the animal studies were ongoing, we also conducted significant research into the electrical and thermal properties of the technology.  We first conducted thermal modeling to quantify the thermal requirements of a device and determine the thermal waste heat that must be dissipated.  This testing assessed waste heat generated by a commercially procured 1" x 1" Peltier device operated at 15 volts for 30 and 60 seconds in a water filled custom built calorimeter.  This test demonstrated a potential maximal heat dissipation requirement of 659 Joules at 30 seconds and 1321 Joules at 60 seconds.   Additionally, the data gathered from this testing enabled proper selection of a proprietary phase change material to use in the final prototyping and testing of devices built under objective #3. A phase change material has the property to absorb significant heat during melting while holding its temperature relatively constant. Therefore, the phase change material can be used as a temporal heat sink for the warm side of the peltier device while activated in the body.  The evaluation of these devices and animal work has enabled us to specify, develop and build a prototype of a sealed device that uses Peltier technology to cool.  In the final months of the grant, we built 4 sealed devices - two 1" x 1" and two 1/2" x 1/2" devices with integrated heat management systems to more closely mimic a potential commercial design.  These devices were tested and evaluated using modeling and simulation to characterize electrical performance and requirements and confirm thermal performance.  These devices demonstrated the ability to cool to therapeutic temperatures of 15C or below, use an integral heat management system to effectively absorb heat generated by the hot side of the peltier, and use an amount of energy that suggests commercial feasibility.     Significance  This grant has demonstrated that we are able to effectively terminate AF using cold therapy in animals in multiple locations with various device geometries.  Smaller devices work at least as well  (1/2" square v 1" square) as larger devices.  All three locations were efficacous, but oblique sinus has advantages in access and stability.  The final testing of thermal and electrical performance of the devices shows that cooling to theraputic temperatures using a Peltier device can be achieved, while also dissipating the waste heat generated for operating periods of 30 to 60 seconds.  Based on this research we are ready to advance into human testing.       Last Modified: 08/06/2020       Submitted by: Jeff Rynbrandt]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
