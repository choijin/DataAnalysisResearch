<AbstractNarration>This project is funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation. Drs. Charles Henry and Andrew Warnock of Colorado State University collaborate to develop new electrode materials made from common carbon sources. These new electrodes may improve the performance of a variety of electrochemical systems ranging from sensors to batteries.  While this research seeks specifically to develop sensing related aspects of the electrode materials, this research applies directly to all carbon electrochemical systems where fast speeds, high conductivity ,and low cost are needed. Significant gains could also be made in low cost materials for batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors and other energy storage/generation devices.&lt;br/&gt;From a student training perspective, the project provides an excellent training opportunity for students to work at the interface between materials chemistry, electroanalytical chemistry, microfluidics, and device engineering.  Fundamental studies of the resulting electrode behavior and characteristics are performed, enabling the development of rationale design principles. The effort may provide new materials for sensors and batteries used in testing and monitoring human and environmental health. As part of this project, hands-on science kits for K-12 students are created and distributed broadly to Colorado schools as well as economically disadvantaged students in Wyoming and South Dakota. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on developing a new type of composite carbon electrode made from a graphite/thermoplastic mixture referred to as thermoplastic electrodes (TPEs). TPEs have very good electrochemical behavior. While the basic electrode properties have been characterized, it is not understood why TPEs perform so much better than traditional glassy carbon and screen printed carbon (SPC) electrodes. The scientific hypothesis is that the graphite in these electrodes contain a high density of defect and edge sites as well as possible oxygen moieties that give rise to the exceptional performance. By fully characterizing this material, it may be possible to understand key properties leading to the superior performance. The applicability to advanced sensing applications may also be demonstrated. In addition to the research activities, Professor Henry collaborates with Dr. Warnock of the College of Natural Sciences Center for Education Outreach (CNS-CEO) at Colorado State University, to create hands-on science kits using a combination of the electrode materials and paper-based microfluidic devices. The CNS-CEO is a K-12 outreach activity that hosts regular visits for high school students to expose them to STEM activities as well as sending out hands-on kits to schools in economically disadvantaged environments in Wyoming and South Dakota.</AbstractNarration>
