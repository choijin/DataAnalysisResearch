<AbstractNarration>1745941 (Phelan)/1746081 (Hu). This workshop will address the science and engineering research questions motivated by designing and operating buildings for both energy efficiency as well as for the health of the occupants. A diversity of researchers from both the buildings and the public health R&amp;D communities will be brought together to determine optimal approaches for integrating health and energy efficiency to promote the development of new human-centered design paradigms and building technologies. Other participating federal agencies include the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the US Department of Energy (DOE). The industry partners include the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and the American Institute of Architects (AIA). The workshop will leverage a two-year DOE project that created a vision for buildings in 100 years, and the ongoing "Health in Buildings Roundtable" organized by NIH and CDC. The workshop will be hosted by NIH at the Natcher Conference Center in Bethesda, MD, in July, 2018.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. population spends perhaps 87% of their time inside buildings, and consequently it is reasonable to assume that building environments have a correspondingly large impact on occupant health. At the same time, the construction and operation of buildings has a large environmental impact: globally, buildings are responsible for approximately one third of primary energy consumption, and one third of greenhouse gas emissions. In the USA, building energy costs in 2016 were ~$408B annually, while annual healthcare costs were ~$3.2T in 2015. Additionally, potential worker productivity gains from improved indoor environments have been estimated at up to ~$230B (in 2016 dollars). Clearly, improving building sustainability while at the same time improving health outcomes would have significant economic impacts. Furthermore, by bringing together researchers from the typically separate fields of sustainable buildings and public health, the organizers are targeting to influence the education of future researchers by broadening their perspectives to consider these diverse but interrelated fields.</AbstractNarration>

Clearly, improving building sustainability while at the same time improving health outcomes would have significant economic impacts.  However, researchers and practitioners in these two distinct fields, sustainable or "green" buildings, and public health, generally do not have the opportunity to interact with one another professionally in the context of a workshop.  Therefore, in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) the 2018 Health in Buildings Roundtable (HiBR) workshop was organized July 19 - 20 under the title "Health in Buildings for Today and Tomorrow:  Making Connections." The meeting was held at the Natcher Conference Center on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.  The first two pages of the conference brochure are provided in the attached graphics.  The specific outcomes of the workshop included both fundamental intellectual advances as well as broader impacts.  Approximately 25 participants were supported through the collaborative NSF award to Arizona State University and the University of Maryland to attend the workshop.  These participants included graduate students, post-docs, junior faculty, and representatives from the private sector including the Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens and the International Well Building Institute.  The supported attendees either presented research posters or participated in one of the oral discussions during the workshop. Most of these participants would not have been able to attend without NSF support.  A new NIH group called the HiBR Scholars Program (https://hibr.nih.gov/scholars) was formed for the purpose of maintaining connections, especially among the younger researchers, to continue the momentum initiated by the workshop.  With regards to fundamental research advances, after the workshop concluded we solicitated manuscript submissions for a special issue of the journal Building and Environment entitled "Sustainable, Healthy Buildings and Communities."  The purpose of this special issue is to document these interdisciplinary research efforts, and to inspire more efforts in the future that treat issues at the intersection between the sustainable built environment and public health. That process is continuing, and provided a sufficient number of manuscripts are received this special issue should appear by the end of 2019.
