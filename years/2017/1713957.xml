<AbstractNarration>Salt marshes are important wetlands that perform essential ecosystem functions. They limit coastal erosion, mitigate storm effects, and are important buffer system between coastal and terrestrial ecosystems. These environments are also responsible for removing harmful greenhouse gases from the atmosphere including nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. This project will aid in the restoration of a salt marsh environment located in Shanghai, China. The study will be conducted under the guidance of Dr. Xuechu Chen, an expert in ecological engineering. Dr. Chen has advanced the field in wetland restoration through his publication contributions and commitment to international communications and collaborations. The goal of the study is to enhance the natural chemical processes of salt marsh environments in an effort to remove harmful greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study seeks to investigate the effects of biochar addition on salt marsh restoration. Biochar is a soil enhancer that is often used to improve soil quality and can be a mechanism to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Biochar is expected to aid in nitrous oxide removal by enhancing the denitrification process through organic carbon additions. It has the potential to enhance plant growth and slows the return of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, facilitating carbon sequestration. The study site, Bihaijinsha, is located within northern Hangzhou Wan Bay, Fengxian District, Shanghai. It is a restored salt marsh about 6000m2 that underwent sediment addition as part of the restoration process. Biochar will be added to designated plots within the study area. Through the use of a gas analyzer, the greenhouse gases fluxes of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide will be monitored from these plots. It is expected that gas fluxes will decrease over time and plant growth will increase. The restoration technique proposed in this project will help restore the biogeochemical processes within a salt marsh environment, promoting essential ecosystem services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>
