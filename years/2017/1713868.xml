<AbstractNarration>The prospect of harnessing quantum mechanical systems to process information promises spectacular applications. These include encrypted communication with fundamentally new levels of security, computing machines that will outperform existing supercomputers, and improved measurement devices that will probe new physical realms. The "quantum advantage" at the heart of these revolutionary technologies arises from exploiting entanglement and other nonlocal properties that are easy to define but difficult to analyze. This project will study quantum entanglement in order to design useful applications for a future with quantum computers and quantum communication networks. In addition to achieving scientific progress through new results, a major project component is scientific development of undergraduate students through participation in real research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will implement a systematic framework studying local unitary and permutational symmetries to probe multiparticle quantum entanglement and to develop applications for quantum protocols. Methodology will utilize the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras, including representation theory and Schur-Weyl duality. Achievements will contribute novel techniques, theoretical results, and applications in areas of mainstream Quantum Information Science.</AbstractNarration>

Today, all of these devices exist, and their development is a major undertaking of industry and academia. While much of the quantum technology story is about engineering, the underpinnings are provided by fundamental investigation in physics, mathematics, and computer science. The project supported by this grant has worked to build structures of understanding in the theory of quantum information science. Specifically, we have studied the entanglement of multiparticle quantum systems that lies at the heart of much of the workings of quantum devices.  Entanglement is a resource for computation, communication, and measurement protocols.

Results from the work funded by this grant establish basic entanglement properties of this rich class of generalized hypergraph states.   A key aspect of the projects supported by this grant is the preparation of future scientists. Undergraduate students worked as research assistants in summer sessions.
