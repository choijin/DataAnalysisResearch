<AbstractNarration>Title: Student Travel Support for the PPoPP 2018, CGO 2018, and HPCA 2018 Symposia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support student travel to three co-located conferences: the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP 2018), the International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO 2018), and the International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2018). The conferences are being held in Vienna, Austria during February 24-28, 2018. These conferences are top-ranked in the fields of parallel programming, compilers, and computer architecture. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include fostering the next generation of researchers in these research areas, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. In particular, students have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and to interact with senior researchers in their areas of expertise. The student selection process takes into account both merit and financial need, and requires support letters written by academic advisors. A strong emphasis is put on supporting women and underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ ACCOMPLISHMENTS  The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO 2018), The International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2018), and the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP 2018) were jointly and successfully held February 24-28, 2018 in Vienna, Austria.  The symposia had jointly applied for and were awarded NSF Grant CCF-1750088in the amount of $30,000.00 to partially reimburse the travel expenses of students who participated in the symposia. The Principal Investigator for the grant was Ronald Mak, who was the Student Travel Chair for CGO 2018, the Student Travel Co-Chair for HPCA 2018, and the Student Travel Chair for PPoPP 2018. He teaches in the Department of Computer Engineering and the Department of Computer Science at San Jos&eacute; State University in San Jos&eacute;, CA, a campus of the California State University system. The SJSU Research Foundation administered the grant funds without overhead, and all the funds were divided evenly among the three symposia.   These symposia are leaders in their respective fields, and each traditionally has had high rates of student attendance and participation. Co-location in Vienna offered unique opportunities for U.S. students to interact with international students, senior researchers, and developers in these fields. Such interactions improved mutual understanding and created opportunities for future collaborations.  All the students supported by this grant attended U.S. universities when they applied, and they flew on U.S.-flagged carriers. Each student submitted a cover letter stating his or her reason for attending one of the symposia, a resume, a description of his or her research interests, and a letter from the student's advisor that confirmed the student's eligibility and recommended that the student attend the symposium.  The selection process by the symposia organizing committees considered each applicant?s level of participation (paper author and presenter, poster session, or organizer), how closely the student's research interests matched areas covered by the respective symposium, and the advisor's endorsement of the student's potential for research.     IMPACT  At the symposia, students attended workshops and talks given by both industry and academia. Many of the presenters were students, and students also participated in poster sessions. There were numerous informal meetings during breaks.  The symposia made a coordinated effort to encourage women and underrepresented minorities to attend and thereby be eligible for travel support by this grant. The symposia sponsored diverse speakers? panels that included women engineers and entrepreneurs.  The symposia?s joint program is linked at http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/hpca-cgo-ppopp-cc/program.html  (The International Conference on Compiler Construction, CC 2018, was also jointly held, but it was not a party to this grant.)  Student opinions of the symposia were overwhelmingly positive. They reported that they gained valuable insights and contacts to further their research, and they were highly appreciative that the NSF helped to enable them to attend.
