<AbstractNarration>With the goal of stimulating innovation, federal funding agencies and universities have invested in interdisciplinary research, using various mechanisms, including: targetted funding opportunities; re-organization of physical work spaces; establishment of topic specific, disciplinary spanning research centers; faculty cluster hires; interdisciplinary fellowship programs; and graduate training programs like IGERT.  This research synthesizes the literature to assess which mechanisms have been most effective and under what circumstances. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interdisciplinarity is a timely and nationally important science policy topic, but there are always limits to funding, and those who make and implement policy need to know how best to achieve returns on their investments. The research identifies the mechanisms and policies that have been most successful and thus made the most effective use of R&amp;D funding.  The policy report comprehensively reviews the scholarship and attends closely to the reliability and robustness of the studies reviewed.   It begins by comparing the various definitions and measures of interdisciplinary research that have been proposed, and moves toward assessing the impact of interdisciplinary research and valued outcomes like scientific productivity and innovation.  The policy report provides policy prescriptions based on evidence in the scientific research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Infrastructure for Interdisciplinarity   Problem  Much ado has been made of interdisciplinary research (IDR) and its purported and empirically documented benefits. Science policy makers likely want to know the wide variety of mechanisms that have been used to facilitate IDR, including: (1) the establishment of research centers; (2) interdisciplinary graduate training; (3) research funding; (4) team collaboration.  Based on a systematic review of the literature, this policy brief assesses which of these has been most effective.  The report aims to answer the questions: What policy might federal agencies pursue to increase interdisciplinarity and hence make more effective use of R&amp;D funding?      Suggested Policy Changes  Recommendation 1: Continue to support infrastructure initiatives like research &amp; synthesis centers Recommendation 2: Approach interdisciplinary graduate education via programs like the NSF Research Traineeship program (NRT) with care by: - clarifying the type of integration intended - making challenges apparent - developing standard ways to evaluate training programs - training faculty about value of IDR - developing clusters of training programs at the same institution - beginning with strong disciplinary foundations Recommendation 3: Support university efforts to offer seed grants to scholars from different disciplines who hope to jointly develop a research proposal. Recommendation 4: Fund scholars? efforts generously (in terms of both money and time) so they can make new interdisciplinary connections and overcome challenges associated with IDR.  This may entail funding individuals rather than specific projects, and/or broadening the scope of fundable research so that IDR is not confined to a few specific (if timely) issues. Recommendation 5: Funding agencies can encourage interdisciplinary research by: working with professional associations to encourage cross-disciplinary interaction; being explicit about expectations for interdisciplinary work, and encouraging interdisciplinary team formation at the same university.    Potential Impacts of these Changes  If recommendations are implemented, the rate of IDR should increase, and thereby possibly fostering innovative and transformative research.
