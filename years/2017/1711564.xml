<AbstractNarration>This is an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology, under the program Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellow, Christopher Thawley, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow is being mentored by Jason Kolbe and Bryan Dewsbury at the University of Rhode Island. The fellow's research addresses the impacts of artificial light at night (ALAN) on free-living animals. ALAN has become an important, novel feature of the environment wherever humans live and work, sometimes exceeds natural levels of sunlight, and can affect stress, reproduction, health, and survival of organisms. The fellow is using field and laboratory experiments to investigate the impacts of ALAN on anoles, a type of lizard that lives in natural and urban areas subject to ALAN. Anoles are an excellent model system for this project because previous work has characterized their sleep behavior, ecology, and physiology. The fellow is receiving training in mentoring, inclusive teaching practices, physiological and ecological techniques, and building outreach and research programs. Furthermore, the fellow is mentoring students from underrepresented groups (URM students) in professional development and research, and expanding a citizen science project linked to the ALAN study system, which serves K-12 URM students. The fellow is collaborating with local teachers to design complementary materials for the project and interacting with students to provide experiences to fill gaps in science education that often disproportionately impact URM students.  This training and experience will support the fellow in developing an integrative and interdisciplinary approach to evolutionary ecology and an inclusive approach to mentoring and teaching that will allow him to support the future participation and success of science students from a diversity of backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research integrates studies of the impacts of ALAN on anoles in real-world, field conditions with lab studies designed to reveal the physiological mechanisms that drive these impacts. Thus, the fellow is quantifying the direct impacts of ALAN on hormones that control stress and daily rhythms, as well as effects on immune function, physical performance, and reproductive timing. In addition, project explores how these mechanisms may impact survival, reproduction, and fitness of anoles and other organisms in the real world, and how organisms may adapt to ALAN. This research will provide insights into how evolutionarily novel, human-induced forms of global change impact organisms and how these organisms respond to that change.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The fellow's research addressed the topic of artificial light at night (ALAN), a novel aspect of human-induced environmental change, and its impacts on free-living animals, with a focus on anoles, a type of lizard common in both urban and natural environments. Following the spread of human use of electricity over the past 150 years, ALAN has become a key feature of the environment wherever humans live and work, and reaches its highest intensity in areas around and in cities. Human-produced light at night can greatly exceed natural light levels and can affect stress, reproduction, health, and survival in organisms including humans. However, we still know little about how ALAN affects a diversity of organisms exposed to this relatively new human impact. The fellow used field and laboratory experiments to investigate the impacts of ALAN on anoles, lizards which live in natural habitats and urban areas subject to ALAN. Anoles are an excellent model system for effects of ALAN because previous work has characterized their sleep behavior, ecology, and physiology. The fellow's work has shown that anoles exposed to ALAN can experience higher growth and do not have higher levels of a stress response hormone, corticosterone. Female anoles exposed to ALAN begin laying eggs earlier in the spring and laid more eggs without appearing to suffer any reduction in egg quality. These results suggest that anoles may be able to use ALAN in cities to increase their growth and reproduction and may be one reason why anoles, and potentially other organisms, can live successfully in cities. Other work shows that anole use of ALAN sources for foraging in the Caribbean may be more widespread than initially thought, and foraging at ALAN sources may occur in early morning hours, not just early night (after sunet), when most observations of this activity have been made. Additional outcomes of the fellow's work include: publications coauthored with citizen scientists who submitted novel observations of anole ecology to iNaturalist, including as part of the Lizards on the Loose citizen science project (see below); research showing effects of urbanization on anoles, including increased body size and parasitism; research showing how female anoles living in cities change investment in reproduction from spring to fall. Results were communicated via publications, presentations at research conferences, and fellow-authored blogposts. &nbsp;</p> <p>The broader impacts of this project focused on broadening participation in biology by students from underrepresented racial minorities (URMs). The fellow supported URM students at the University of Rhode Island by mentoring students in the Science and Engineering Fellows program and providing authentic field and lab research experiences and science communication training to program fellows. The fellow also supported students in the Seeds of Success program, an affinity group for students from populations historically underrepresented in STEM fields focused on peer-mentoring. &nbsp;The fellow also expanded the Lizards on the Loose citizen science project which serves primarily 6-12 URM students to include online data submission via iNaturalist, resulting in &gt;6,000 observations in two years. The fellow also received training and experience that support the fellow in developing an inclusive approach to mentoring and teaching that will allow him to support the future participation and success of science students from a diversity of backgrounds.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/24/2019<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;J&nbsp;Thawley</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1711564/1711564_10494623_1577022660826_CThawley_PRFB4_AnoleUsingALAN--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1711564/1711564_10494623_1577022660826_CThawley_PRFB4_AnoleUsingALAN--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Anole using an artificial light source in Miami"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1711564/1711564_10494623_1577022660826_CThawley_PRFB4_AnoleUsingALAN--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Anole using an artificial light source in Miami"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Anoles can be exposed to artificial light at night (ALAN) when foraging for insects attracted to light sources.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Chris Thawley</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christopher&nbsp;J&nbsp;Thawley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Anole using an artificial light source in Miami</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1711564/1711564_10494623_1577018277745_CThawley_PRFB1_LizardsontheLoose--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1711564/1711564_10494623_1577018277745_CThawley_PRFB1_LizardsontheLoose--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Lizards on the Loose Teacher Training"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1711564/1711564_10494623_1577018277745_CThawley_PRFB1_LizardsontheLoose--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Lizards on the Loose Teacher Training"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Chris Thawley and James Stroud train high school teachers and students to conduct anole observations and upload data to iNaturalist at a Lizards on the Loose training event at the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alex Belisario</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christopher&nbsp;J&nbsp;Thawley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Lizards on the Loose Teacher Training</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1711564/1711564_10494623_1577019880118_CThawley_PRFB3_ScientistSkype--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1711564/1711564_10494623_1577019880118_CThawley_PRFB3_ScientistSkype--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Skype a Scientist Visit as Part of Lizards on the Loose"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1711564/1711564_10494623_1577019880118_CThawley_PRFB3_ScientistSkype--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Skype a Scientist Visit as Part of Lizards on the Loose"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Chris Thawley videoconferences with students at a Miami area school to discuss their project and answer questions about being a scientist as part of the Lizards on the Loose Fairchild Challenge.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Chris Thawley</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christopher&nbsp;J&nbsp;Thawley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Skype a Scientist Visit as Part of Lizards on the Loose</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1711564/1711564_10494623_1577018146048_CThawley_PRFB2_LizardsontheLoose--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1711564/1711564_10494623_1577018146048_CThawley_PRFB2_LizardsontheLoose--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Lizards on the Loose Identification Training"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1711564/1711564_10494623_1577018146048_CThawley_PRFB2_LizardsontheLoose--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Lizards on the Loose Identification Training"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Chris Thawley and James Stroud work with high school students and teachers at a Lizards on the Loose training event at the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden to teach basic anole identification skills.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alex Belisario</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christopher&nbsp;J&nbsp;Thawley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Lizards on the Loose Identification Training</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
