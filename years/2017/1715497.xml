<AbstractNarration>This conference targets to contribute to defining the direction of engineered resource recovery from wastewater and sewage streams. The conference will provide a technical, economic and practical framework for implementation of resource recovery and identify current and future systems, processes and endpoints for resource recovery. This framework is a significant re-orientation compared to the removal paradigm practiced widely without heed to the benefits of appropriately designed and implemented resource recovery.  The conference will expose researchers to the needs and developments from across the globe on topics related to resource recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wastewater contains valuable resources such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Whereas untreated wastewater threatens human health, ecosystems, biodiversity, food security and the sustainability of water resources, the carbon present in the wastewater can be recovered to generate energy while nitrogen and phosphorus recovery can supplement nutrient demand for agriculture. There are a number of innovative approaches and technologies for energy neutral, or even energy positive, nutrient removal and recovery. The drivers for resource and energy recovery include decreased energy demand and carbon emissions, marketable commodities, and improved efficiency at reduced cost.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Today, as a society, we live in a resource constrained world, while facing global, interlinked challenges associated with lack of quality water, energy and food.  To meet many of these global challenges of the future in a sustainable fashion, wastewater must be acknowledged as a renewable resource for water, energy, nutrients and other materials. The current practice of wastewater treatment, which focuses on using energy and chemicals to remove constituents, must change to the new paradigm focused towards what can be recovered, especially since population growth is depleting resources.  As the water sector looks to face the new challenges with innovative solutions that protect the environmental, public health, and global sustainability, minimizing use of resources and maximizing the recovery of resources from wastewater is destined to become the focal point.  Whereas untreated wastewater threatens human health, ecosystems, biodiversity, food security and the sustainability of water resources, the carbon present in the wastewater can be recovered to generate energy while nitrogen and phosphorus recovery can supplement nutrient demand for agriculture.  However, prior to the widespread implementation of resource recovery (whether in developed or developing settings), a proper framework (technical, economical and practical) and appropriate technologies need to be identified.  This conference is expected to significantly help towards this effort.  From a scientific perspective, this conference surpassed its expectations in being able to broadly  define the direction of engineered resource recovery from wastewater and sewage streams, provide a technical, economic and practical framework for implementation of resource recovery and identify current and future systems, processes and endpoints for resource recovery.  As such, this was a significant and watershed re-orientation compared to the removal paradigm practiced widely in the developed world and disturbingly applied in the developing world without heed to the benefits of appropriately designed and implemented resource recovery.  This conference featured global leaders as well as emerging researchers and exposed US researchers to the needs and developments from across the globe on topics related to resource recovery, thereby laying the pathway for them to potentially pursue and lead this field.
