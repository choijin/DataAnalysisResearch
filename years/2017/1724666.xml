<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to provide travel support for students to attend the IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing to be held in May 29-31, 2017 in Hong Kong. The conference includes papers on many technologies that are fundamental to the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) program and the smart systems aspect of the Partnership For Innovation: Broadening Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) program, including smart and connected communities, pervasive computing, and social computing. This project will fund 20 students to attend the conference, and a selection committee and process will be used to choose from potential invitees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will organize a PhD Forum for students and will provide important networking opportunities for the students. The attendance and participation in conference activities including the PhD Forum and student sessions will have strong impact on the education of the next generation of pervasive computing and cyber-physical system experts.</AbstractNarration>
