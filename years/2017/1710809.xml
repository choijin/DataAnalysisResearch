<AbstractNarration>The changing magnetic field of the Sun causes powerful disturbances that affect orbiting satellites and life on Earth.  Studying these magnetic-driven events on the Sun with ground-based telescopes requires wide-field image stability from Adaptive Optics (AO).  AO is an important tool for solar astronomy because dynamic events on the Sun can cover a one arc-minute field of view simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AO is a method to correct telescope images for the distortion of light caused by its travel from outer space through the turbulent atmosphere.  As a result of a previous award (AST-1407597), Goode and collaborators demonstrated such image correction for the first time in a wide-field with a solar telescope. Results were unveiled in a video display at the American Astronomical Society meeting in January 2017.  The broad objectives outlined here are consistent with the Adaptive Optics roadmap, a community-developed white paper.  This strategy document specifically called for further MCAO development work beyond these initial proof-of-concept experiments and quantitative performance analysis.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds upon prior research by implementing a turbulence profilometer -- a device to measure atmospheric turbulence throughout the observing season.  Gathering such data will optimize future observations.  This project will also implement another deformable mirror and a faster real-time control computer to enable 1-1.5 kHz operation. Developing this technology will enable critical observations to improve our understanding of the Sun and gain insights into the origins of potentially catastrophic space weather.  This experimental technique will be essential to perfect for the upcoming Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Adaptive optics (AO) is the enabling technology for large ground-based telescopes. The three generations of adaptive optics at Big Bear have all been built under NSF support over the last two decades.  The latest generation, Multi-Conjugate AO (MCAO), corrects a wide field has enjoyed real success in BBSO.  Its first and on-going successes in BBSO represent a first in daytime ground-based astronomy.  From NSF-ATI support, the appended figures compare contemporaneous second (single deformable mirror (DM)) and third (MCAO) generation AO.  The trebling of the field of view is essential for studies of solar dynamics in which explosive events can be seen to seemingly appear everywhere at once over a wide field.  Nighttime MCAO uses natural and laser guide stars, but for daytime AO the ubiquitous solar granules are used as guide regions ('stars').  The BBSO MCAO system called Clear uses nine guide 'stars' and three DMs with each of the three DMs correcting a different layer of the  terrestrial atmosphere providing a continuous, rapid correction from the ground to more than 10 km above the observatory, which is already 2 km above sea level.  Clear is the only operating MCAO system at a solar observatory.     In the Clear MCAO project, we did lab experiments in which the layers of atmospheric turbulence were mimicked by a hot plate in front of each DM and the target was an image of the solar granular surface.  Lab MCAO was successful, but early on-sky experiments failed.  The problem was the turbulence was not confined to discreet layers, but rather seemed to be continuous so we narrowed the field for DMs so as to increase the depth of field each covered, which made it continuous from the ground up.  This setup worked.  In detail, the three DMs were conjugated to the ground, 3 km and 7 km with a corrected field of 35 arcseconds compared to an isoplanatic patch of about 10 arcseconds for single DM AO under good seeing.     Clear first light was memorable because we could see on the monitors in real-time a correction the like of which we had never seen.  The appended images  have no post-facto corrections, they are as we saw them in real-time and the improvement was stunning, which was a unique experience.  Usually one collects data all day and takes it home and analyzes it for some time until something of value is learned, but with MCAO first light, it was clear, apparent and obvious that it worked the instant it was turned on, which was an event never to be forgotten by those in the BBSO telescope control room.     Under NSF-ATI support, Clear was brought on-line as a regular (called facility), reliable instrument at BBSO.  Even under difficult atmospheric conditions (called 'poor seeing') it operates, even if the correction is then only marginally better than single DM AO.
