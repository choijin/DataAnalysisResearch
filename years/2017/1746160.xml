<AbstractNarration>Broadly defined, the subtropics extend from the poleward side of the rainy equatorial belt to the midlatitude region of the westerly winds, and are generally characterized by subsidence and dry conditions.  Yet the subtropics are also home to the world's monsoon systems, including the Asian, West African, and North and South American monsoons, and are thus characterized during the monsoon seasons by strong east-west contrasts between regions of heavy rainfall and neighboring drylands.  Given the substantial portion of the world's population inhabiting the subtropics, it is of interest to understand how the strong hydrologic contrast between monsoon regions and drylands will change in response to changes in global mean temperature.  Climate model projections of 21st century climate change generally suggest that such contrasts will intensify, but there is little quantitative agreement from one model to another on the magnitude of the intensification.  And while several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the intensification, a generally accepted theory for the behavior is still lacking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines changes in the subtropical hydrological contrasts by considering changes in the zonally asymmetric component of the subtropical atmospheric circulation, including the asymmetric vertical mass flux which is upward over monsoon regions and downward over the drylands.  This approach differs from previously work which emphasizes the zonal-mean circulation (e.g. the widening of the Hadley cell and the subtropical belts) and explanations in terms of energetics, atmospheric stability, and increased moisture content.  It is based on preliminary work using a simpled idealized climate model in which ocean heat flux covergence is imposed over a patch of the subtropics to induce locally warmer sea surface temperatures and enhanced precipitation, which further induces subsidence and dry conditions to the west.  Based on the results of these experiments, three hypotheses are posed: 1) The increase in tropopause height that occurs as global mean climate warms enhances the vertical mass flux in stationary circulations, thereby increasing zoanl asymmetries in precipiation; 2) zonal sea surface temperature gradients decreases as global mean climate warms, weakening stationary circulations and the hydrological contrasts they induce; and 3) the mechanism in hypothesis 2 applies over land, only with surface air equivalent potential temperature playing the role of sea surface temperature, so that the land surface water budget plays a role.  The research agenda consists of an examination of the seasonal cycle and interannual variability of subtropical asymmetric circulations in present-day climate from observations and simulations, followed by an examination of future climate simulations from an archive of climate models, all guided by the results of the simple idealized model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the work come from the substantial portion of the world's population inhabiting the subtropics and the potential impacts of hydrological cycle change on agriculture, water resources, and other necessities of life.  The development of a robust theoretical and conceptual understanding of hydrological cycle change would have significant benefit for improving confidence in model projections of future climate change and for guiding future model development.  The project also supports and trains a postdoctoral research associate and a graduate student, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.  The project also supports education and outreach to local high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Earth's climate is often described as having a very wet equator and  dry subtropical regions that contain most of the planet's deserts.  This  overall picture omits many variations, or asymmetries, in longitude,  which are produced by continental-scale atmospheric circulations that  dominate regional climate and that create alternating wet and dry  regions at a particular latitude.  For example, South Asia receives  abundant rainfall during July while the Sahara desert, at the same  latitude further west, is dry; the North American monsoon and the  subtropical eastern Pacific are another wet-dry pair.  The project  advanced understanding of the atmospheric circulations that control set  these east-west asymmetries in surface hydrology in Earth's  low-latitudes, providing new theories and analyses of the modern-day  seasonal cycle of precipitation and of changes that are projected to  occur throughout the next century.  One outcome of this project  was a new theoretical framework that relates precipitation changes at a  given location to inputs of energy to earth's atmosphere anywhere on the  globe.  This was used to show how changes in ocean evaporation during  El Nino events cause an east-west shift in Earth's most prominent rain  band during January, which lies in the South Pacific.  This theory  extends previous work that related such precipitation shifts to energy  inputs, but only did so when those quantities were averaged over all  longitudes.  The second major outcome of this project was the finding  that the atmospheric circulations that set east-west asymmetries in  subtropical precipitation are expected to strengthen as a planet's  temperature goes from cold to warm, then weaken as the planet warms  further to become hot.  The project showed that this non-monotonic  change in circulation strength could be explained for an idealized  planet as a competition between the effects of the atmosphere's  deepening with warming, and the weakening of east-west contrasts in  ocean surface temperatures.  These competing effects were shown to  operate in  a collection of about 40 simulations of future climate  produced by global climate models.  The third major outcome of this  project was an exploration of how mountain ranges produce east-west  asymmetries in low-latitude rainfall.  Mountains create waves in the  atmosphere (called Rossby and gravity waves), which this project showed  can alter precipitation thousands of kilometers away from the  mountains.  That remote influence on rainfall was found to be  particularly strong during northern hemisphere winter in Asia and the  Pacific.  The project also showed that low-latitude mountain ranges help  to create "autumn monsoons," a previously unrecognized climate regime  comprising regions on the east coasts of nearly all continents that  receive their peak rainfall in late autumn and early winter, instead of  during a summer rainy season that typifies most low-latitude land.    The  project trained four postdoctoral scientists, a graduate student, and  an undergraduate student.  As part of the project, the Principal  Investigator gave multiple presentations each year to scientists working  on regional hydrology in the Americas, Asia, and Africa; project staff  also presented their work at scientific conferences.  One of the project  postdoctoral scientists and the Principal Investigator taught high  school students from New Haven, Connecticut who were participating in a  summer science enrichment program.
