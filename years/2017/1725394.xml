<AbstractNarration>An established United States workforce need and critical challenge is to recruit and train students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Because mathematics is a fundamental part of all STEM disciplines, success of undergraduate students in mathematics is a crucial ingredient in addressing this challenge. This "TPSE Math Chairs+1 Conference #2" project, with leadership team from the Transforming Post-Secondary Education in Mathematics (TPSE Math) group, will organize and convene a conference primarily of mathematical sciences department chairs and other academic leaders from a diverse set of institutions of higher education from across the country. This is the second conference of this nature with the first having been held in October, 2016 (NSF 1651738). Workshop topics will include several key questions and issues to be addressed to catalyze improved teaching, learning, retention, and overall student success in undergraduate mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although recent education research has provided the STEM education community with indications and suggestions for various directions for change to improve undergraduate teaching and student learning, this community as a whole has not always been quick to foster such changes. Among the purposes of the workshop will be to encourage more collaboration among members of the mathematics community, help department chairs develop capacities to catalyze change in their own departments, and serve as a vehicle for chairs with common interests to work together for change after the conference, especially in areas of developing more diverse and modern curricula for mathematics majors and non-mathematics majors alike. To help guide the discussion and conference outcomes, the conference organizers with input from participants plan to address a wide range of questions and determine research needed to address them. The questions and categories include: (1) What do the various STEM disciplines want for their students who take mathematics? What mathematical training do other disciplines want for their majors? Is this training appropriate for careers in those disciplines? (2) What kinds of mathematical sciences training do employers want? Do employers in fact know what mathematics training can be most useful for their employees? (3) &lt;br/&gt;What are the levels of career satisfaction experienced by students who have - and have not - taken particular mathematics courses or pathways? (4) What menu of mathematics training best supports basic numeracy (general quantitative and reasoning skills) for citizens in today's society? and (5) Why are the current post-secondary pathways variations of algebra and calculus unsatisfactory? What should replace them? The conference also will showcase extant models, resources, and research results, and participants will be asked to suggest how they can be adopted, adapted, disseminated, scaled up, and evaluated, and to recommend what additional research is needed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Transforming Post-Secondary Education in Mathematics, or TPSE Math, was initiated in 2013 to offer coordination and shared leadership to new and ongoing reform efforts in the mathematics community.  TPSE Math?s formation was prompted by challenging issues of long standing, including inequities of opportunity for students from disadvantaged backgrounds; low student retention and completion rates; rapid growth in numbers of students without increases in staff; demand by students for curriculum pathways more relevant to careers; and a desire for broader preparation of graduate students who enter non-academic careers.   With the help of a consultant and members of the math community, including professional math organizations, TPSE Math has sought to respond to these opportunities through four strategic priorities:  1. In lower-division curricula, create multiple pathways that offer choices that better fit students? interests, improve completion rates, and raise academic success;  2. In upper-division curricula, offer more diverse and flexible pathways with greater relevance to modern careers;  3. For all undergraduates, evaluate and promote new teaching and learning technologies and methods;  4. For graduate students, broaden training so as to equip them for more diverse careers in teaching, industry, business, and government.  Funding from the National Science Foundation was used to support the second of two "Chairs Plus One" conferences. Members of TPSE?s Mathematics Advisory Group (MAG), consisting of 35 math department chairs and professors, gathered in Hyattsville, Maryland in March 2017 to serve as panelists, discussion leaders and moderators. In these leadership roles, the MAG members gained added authority, experience, and visibility as TPSE partners.  A parallel study of graduate student education, Revitalizing Graduate STEM Education for the 21st Century, is being conducted by the National Academies, and two leaders of that study attended the March meeting: Alan Leshner, study chair and CEO Emeritus of the AAAS, and Layne Scherer, a Program Officer with the Board on Higher Education and Workforce at the National Academies. Also participating were Michael Vogelius, Director of NSF?s Division of Mathematical Sciences, and Dean Evasius, Director of NSF?s Division of Graduate Education, who introduced the workshop sessions.  As at the previous meeting, each MAG member was accompanied by a "plus one": a dean, provost, other administrator, or faculty member from his or her institution. This diversity of participants enhanced the meeting?s perspective and allowed more sharing of experiences, and increased the likelihood of ongoing conversations about the issues at participants? colleges and universities.  In three sessions held over a day and a half, each divided into plenary and breakout or workshop segments, participants focused on challenges related to Upper-Division Pathways, Broadening Graduate Education, and New Teaching Strategies.  The meeting as a whole produced at least four important outcomes:  1. Participants agreed that broad change is most likely when people form partnerships and act in community. This meeting, like earlier ones, showcased models and exemplars already created around the country, and participants were asked to suggest how they can be disseminated, scaled up, and evaluated.  2. Meetings such as this one encourage more collaboration among members of the mathematics community, where reforms traditionally have been uneven and lacking coherence.  3. Participants expressed broad agreement that the time is now ripe for developing more diverse curricula for math majors and non-majors alike. Many of us now believe that the "pure math" pathway of rigorous proofs and a theoretical framework continues to be appropriate for some but not all students. As new interdisciplinary courses add more relevance to the traditional rigor of mathematics, many of us believe that they will broaden the discipline?s usefulness and appeal.  4. Department chairs have demonstrated a willingness for greater involvement with TPSE Math: to introduce new projects and to scale up existing projects; to design RFPs aimed at building new programs or evaluating existing ones; to collaborate with other departments and institutions; and volunteer their feedback to TPSE.  A core conviction driving the efforts of TPSE Math is that society needs graduates with greater quantitative and analytical abilities. Blocking needed change, however, is a thorny and persistent question: How can we achieve this outcome when so many of us experience mathematics as a barrier rather than a gateway? It is TPSE?s view that more interesting and diverse mathematics pathways will heighten student interest and raise the level of academic and career achievement.  "Our North Star," concluded one TPSE member, "is curricular modernization &ndash; to narrow the gap between today?s mathematics and the mathematics students study in college."
