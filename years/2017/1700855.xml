<AbstractNarration>Drought has been increasing in frequency and severity worldwide for the last 60 years, and the increase is expected to continue over the next several decades. Extreme drought events are already taking their toll on trees and other woody plants all over the world, leading to widespread forest mortality. As greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise on a global scale, the importance of forests increases, as trees can take up carbon dioxide and store it for centuries in the form of wood. However, the death of trees during drought reduces how much can be taken up and increases the amount of carbon dioxide released back into the air when dead trees decompose.  This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant will provide funds to evaluate which kinds of plants are more susceptible to drought, and the mechanisms that determine plants? vulnerability to extreme drought events. This research has the potential to reveal characteristics that make woody plants more or less tolerant to drought and may increase the ability to predict species? responses to extreme drought events. The results will inform local land managers and policy-makers on which tree species are more tolerant to drought and therefore improve plans for restoration and management of forests in the face of increasing drought severity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use novel methods to determine the resistance of woody plants to extreme drought using plant anatomical features and physiological measurements. The major cause of tree mortality from drought is embolism accumulation in the water-conducting pipes of plants that obstruct proper water movement from the soil up to the leaves. The researchers will study which anatomical traits make plants more susceptible to embolisms. This work will be conducted in both dry and wet temperate and tropical forests to provide information on how plants growing under different rainfall environments respond to drought. The project will include workshops with public primary school teachers in rural Northwestern Costa Rica, which is an area with a history of extreme droughts that have resulted in widespread forest mortality. These workshops will enhance Costa Rican primary school curriculum through active learning of how plants obtain and use water and the impact of drought on native forests.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merit Outcomes:&nbsp;</strong>This project used a novel method to determine the resistance of woody plants to extreme drought using plant anatomy and relating these data to how plants respond to drought. The researchers studied bubble accumulation in the water-conducting pipes (xylem) of plants that obstruct proper water movement from the soil up to the leaves and lead to plant death (Fig. 1). The researchers also studied xylem anatomical characteristics that potentially make plants more resistant to these bubbles (Fig. 2). The research was conducted in a very dry temperate forest in Tasmania, Australia and in a dry&nbsp;and a&nbsp;wet forest in Panama to get a better idea of how plants growing under different rainfall environments respond to drought. One outcome was that this research showed that among the eight studied Australian species two species were more susceptible to drought than the other six species and that both leaves and stems were equally susceptible to drought. With changes in rainfall patterns and increased drought, this could lead to the more drought-resistant species becoming more abundant and the more vulnerable species experiencing greater mortality in this particular Tasmanian forest. A second outcome was that the researchers found a relationship between xylem anatomy and the resistance to bubbles spreading among the plant xylem; indicating that indeed, this particular anatomical characteristic of the xylem can make a species more or less resistant to drought. A final outcome from this study was that the species in the dry forest in Panama had the xylem anatomical characteristic associated with greater drought resistance than the wet forest species, further confirming the relationship between this particular xylem anatomical trait and drought resistance.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Broader Impacts Outcomes:</strong>&nbsp;The broader impacts outcome of this project was that the researchers designed and lead two workshops with Costa Rican schoolteachers to incorporate active learning of plant water relation material into the Costa Rican K-12 curriculum. The researchers conducted two workshops during the summer of 2017 and a total of 78 local schoolteachers attended these workshops. In these workshops, which were developed in Spanish, the participants explored techniques to actively teach students how water moves through plants and how plants respond to dissection and extream drought events (Fig. 3).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/17/2019<br>      Modified by: Christina&nbsp;M&nbsp;Smith</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1700855/1700855_10478138_1568046976538_Figure1.EmbolizingstemsCallitrisE.pulchellaMicranthium--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1700855/1700855_10478138_1568046976538_Figure1.EmbolizingstemsCallitrisE.pulchellaMicranthium--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1700855/1700855_10478138_1568046976538_Figure1.EmbolizingstemsCallitrisE.pulchellaMicranthium--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The progression of accumulation (colored area) of bubbles in the xylem of three Australian species as the branches dried.
