<AbstractNarration>Dinosaurs and mammals have many similarities, including warm-bloodedness, a global distribution, and diverse body forms and lifestyles. This project will explore the ways in which these two animal groups became diverse and widespread across the globe. The results of this analysis will yield insights into why different animal groups dominate the world's ecosystems and adapt to a large variety of lifestyles. The fellow will measure Mesozoic dinosaur and mammal fossils and calculate muscle lever arms, an indicator of general movement capability. These data will be used to model the rates and patterns of lever arm change over time and test for associations with environmental change. The fellow will visit the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing to work with Dr. Xu Xing, one of the leading experts on vertebrate paleontology, and collect data from Chinese dinosaur and mammal species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The origins of biological innovations, such as terrestrial colonization and powered flight, are pivotal events in vertebrate evolution, and are often coupled with changes in locomotor morphology. Yet, little is known about how the rate of such changes are due to trait-environment interactions. The overall objective of this project is to quantify the rate of locomotor change in Mesozoic mammals and dinosaurs. The fellow hypothesizes that high rates coincide with shifts in physiology and the environment. Dinosaur locomotion has remarkable parallels with mammal locomotion and thus provides a natural experiment for investigating how trait-environment interactions influence biological innovation. We will collect morphological data on the locomotor lever-arms from Mesozoic mammal and dinosaur fore- and hind-limbs. The simplicity of these parameters allows rate shifts to be modeled across clades that would be undetectable using species-specific models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and China's Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The evolution of locomotion is often associated with biological innovations, such as upright posture and powered flight. However, the rate and mode of locomotor evolution are not well studied. The<em> overall objective</em> of this project was to quantify the evolutionary dynamics of locomotion in Mesozoic dinosaurs. We hypothesized that high rates of locomotor evolution will coincide with shifts in physiological constraints. By understanding what dictates locomotor evolution, we can begin to determine how biological innovations evolve. I measured the locomotor lever arms of Mesozoic dinosaur fore-limbs and hind-limbs from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology.

These specimens are invaluable because of their completeness and represent species absent endemic to China. These lever arm measurements reflect the general ability of the limbs&rsquo; musculoskeletal system to retract with either more range of motion or more torque. Given that these lever arms only require a preserved skeleton, we can estimate the locomotor ability of many extinct species and model how locomotion evolved over time. We used these measurements to test for different models of evolution, which allowed us to address the following questions:</p> <ol> <li>Was the rate of locomotor evolution homogenous over time or did it vary among groups of species?</li> <li>Do high rates of locomotor evolution correspond to changes in physiological constraint, like posture?</li> <li>Does locomotion evolve gradually or in a punctuated fashion?</li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>A total of 60 dinosaur species were used in our study. Measurements were analyzed as a gear ratio (log<sub>10</sub> lever-out/lever-in). A gear ratio has two components: a lever-out, effectively the postural length of the leg, and a lever-in or the distance to the retractor muscle&rsquo;s insertion point. We accounted for differences in joint angles by assigning a range of possible values to each species. One extreme assumed 90-degree angles between each joint and the other used joint angles obtained from the literature&mdash;based on joint sensitivity analyses for each major dinosaur group. The data were log<sub>10</sub> transformed to meet assumptions of normality and the program BayesTraits was used to test evolutionary models. We tested a variable rate model, which allows the rate of evolution to vary, against a single rate model for the dinosaur fore- and hind-limb gear ratios. We found compelling evidence favoring a variable rate model over a single rate model with a log Bayes factor of 8.6 for the fore-limb and 17 for the hind-limb, where values over 2 indicate positive evidence. The variable rate model revealed an order-of-magnitude acceleration in the evolutionary rate of the fore-limb gear ratio in theropods (mostly bipedal and carnivorous dinosaurs, like <em>T. rex</em>) and an acceleration in the evolutionary rate of the hind-limb gear ratio in maniraptorans (small, feathered dinosaurs most closely related to birds, like <em>Velociraptor</em>). The rate shift in the fore-limbs of theropods indicates a freedom from a physiological constraint associated with quadrupedalism and might demonstrate an evolutionary mechanism for the great fore-limb diversity in theropod dinosaurs (Figure 1). The latter shift is driven by an anatomical change where femoral retraction shifts to the dominant use by a different muscle, one that is detached from the tail, which was a necessary adaptation for the evolution of flight.
