<AbstractNarration>The University of Northern Iowa proposes a Planning Grant to develop a research-practitioner partnership (RPP) to facilitate  computer science (CS) teacher professional development (PD) across Iowa.  There has been substantial discipline-wide work done recently to develop curriculum and standards for high school CS.  Knowledge exists regarding PD for in-service teachers, communities of practice, principles for broadening participation, and RPPs, but there are plenty of opportunities to expand experience and expertise in these areas in combination with each other.  The proposed RPP for Iowa includes university personnel to supply content, curriculum design experts and researchers, Iowa Area Education Agenices (AEA) personnel for localization and ongoing support, and school districts with knowledge practitioners. It is an ideal partnership to design and test a network for providing computer science PD and ongoing support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The partnership will start by piloting a PD network for high school CS teachers in one of nine AEAs in Iowa.  Identified in-service teachers will complete three courses over two summers and the intervening school year: an introduction to programming, a CS methods course, and a big ideas course.  Instruction will be designed using the Iowa Professional Development Model.  During the PD, participants will become familiar with engagement practices and the culturally responsive computing practices through modelling and explicit instruction.  Furthermore, district personnel in the participants' school districts will attend a workshop on understanding biases and broadening participation in order to set a more positive school environment.  Upon completion of the PD, participants will be well-prepared to teach a high-quality introduction to programming course or an AP CS Principles course.  The proposers have already recruited four districts for inclusion in the partnership and expect to increase that number to 20 over the course of the award. Upon completion of the project, having gathered substantial assessment data, the proposers will be ready to expand this program to allow for participants from school districts and AEAs covering the entire state of Iowa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Computer Science Education program at the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) received a grant under the title "The Development of a Statewide Network for Teacher Preparation in Computer Science."  This grant funded the creation of a Research Practitioner Partnership (RPP) that worked on the completion of three primary goals.  Those goals, and the activities meeting those goals, are outlined below.    Goal #1 - Create professional development that will allow in-service teachers with little or no background in computer science to become competent teachers of computer science.    Funding from this grant paid for the design and implementation of five computer science courses for an audience of educators.  These courses consist of:   Fundamentals of Programming   Foundational Concepts of Computer Science   Teaching and Learning Programming   Data Structures and Algorithms   Methods of Computer Science      These courses were designed to align with ISTE standards for CS teacher preparation and CSTA standards for K-12 CS Education.      These five courses were approved by the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners as evidence of qualification for State of Iowa teaching endorsements #278 (5-12 Computer Science) and #279 (CTE Information Technology).    These courses were piloted with a fully funded cohort of in-service teachers between June, 2018 and July, 2020.  From that cohort 27 teachers, most of whom were completely new to computer science, completed all five courses and earned their CS endorsement.      Based on lessons learned and RPP feedback, the five courses were adjusted and were offered to a partially funded second cohort of teachers.  Between June, 2019 and May, 2021 an additional 12 teachers completed coursework to earn their endorsement.    Goal #2 - To establish a scalable structure for providing professional development to teachers in Iowa.    While we recognize the need for high-quality, online education (something made even more evident with the Covid-19 outbreak) our program is built on the premise that teachers benefit, both short-term and long-term, from face-to-face interaction with faculty and peers.  [A belief supported in participant feedback].  As such, our grant work frequently focussed on the ways to best deliver required content in a manner that met the needs of teachers and their schedules but was also scalable as the program grows.      Coursework was offered through a combination of pre-recorded videos, live online lessons and  small group work, and face-to-face meetups.  While the meetups with cohort 1 were mostly conducted on campus, meetups with cohort 2 were conducted through collaboration with Heartland AEA in Des Moines, Iowa (~100 miles from campus).  In particular we studied how our program could be modified so that "regional" meetups could be conducted by local CS faculty and/or AEA staff facilitators.      While most coursework for cohort 2 was taught after the course pilot with cohort 1, we were able to test the delivery of a singular course to two different and geographically divergent cohorts when we taught the Foundational Concepts course in the summer of 2019.  Lessons learned from this experience  have shown us how we can expand the program to offer a single course simultaneously to multiple regional cohorts.    Goal #3 - To work with school districts so that enrollment and success rates in their computer science classes match overall school enrollment and success rates with respect to the inclusion of individuals from various underrepresented groups.     A major element of our course design was a repeated discussion on the need for diversity in the field of CS.  Inclusive design is an explicit topic in two of the five courses, and inclusive practices are prominently modeled in all five of the courses.  This includes practices promoted by NCWIT and the use of (and frequent discussions about) "Grading for Equity."    Additionally, in the fall of 2018 we partnered with Central Rivers AEA and the NCWIT Counselors 4 CS program to offer a single day workshop for administrators and counselors involved with cohort one.  The goal of this workshop was to make sure that district personnel understood the needs and techniques for inclusive practices when talking about computer science to students.    Unfortunately, the outbreak of Covid-19 caused significant challenges to work on this goal. The move to online learning happened right when most of the newly qualified teacher participants started to recruit and/or offer their first CS courses. Thus, we were unable to effectively check on effects concerning underrepresented groups of students.               Last Modified: 07/07/2021       Submitted by: J. Ben Schafer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
