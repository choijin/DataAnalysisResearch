<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description&lt;br/&gt;A major goal of modern cell biology is to understand how organisms develop complex functional tissues using genetic information.  In muscle, contractile fibers composed of repeating structural units shorten and produce force to power a wide variety of functions, such as locomotion, feeding, and reproduction.  To understand how muscle fiber assembly occurs, newly-developed genome editing techniques and advanced light microscopes will be employed to observe fiber components within an intact, developing round worm.  This collaboration between the University of South Alabama and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Biotechnology (NIBIB) of the National Institutes of Health will enable intensive knowledge transfer between the institutions and provide immersive research training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students.  Our observations and measurements will not only reveal how specific muscle proteins assemble into contractile fibers during development, but will also lead to a better understanding of how muscles heal after injury, adapt to altered mechanical environments, and respond to disease-causing mutations and aging. This fellowship will allow participation of both the PI and a graduate student, and has the potnetial to allow the PI to develop a sustainable research program that would raise the instiution?s visibility in this cutting-edge field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;Striated muscle contractile fibers (myofibrils) form by the self-assembly of thin and thick filament arrays that are precisely integrated into a series of repeating functional units (sarcomeres) to produce force.  Sarcomeric components remain surprisingly dynamic after myofibril assembly, which enable muscles to structurally reorganize in response to external signals such as mechanical load and stretch.  In this project, we will use state-of-the-art techniques available at the NIBIB to observe striated muscle organization and dynamics within intact, developing roundworms (Caenorhabditis elegans) with unprecedented resolution and precision.  A novel bicistronic tagging and truncations (BiTTs) genome editing tool will be used to produce fluorescent reporters with minimal impact on gene expression, and will create specific, fluorescently-tagged protein fragments that strategically disrupt myofibril assembly and organization.  Using low-dose, high-speed, super-resolution microscopy, we will rapidly collect 3D images of developing C. elegans embryos to quantify how endogenous proteins accumulate and change within specific sarcomeric structures during myofibril assembly in a variety of muscle types while minimizing phototoxicity and ensuring normal development and behavior of the organism.  This research is designed to examine complex, important questions such as: How are thin and thick filaments connected and organized into functional myofibrils?  How do thin and thick filaments elongate during sarcomere growth?  And, how are new sarcomeres added during muscle cell elongation?  Because of the conserved structural, functional, and compositional similarities among striated muscles within different animals, our findings will provide important insight into how diverse muscle types develop, how muscles repair and adapt sarcomeres after injury or growth, and how muscle fibers malfunction during disease or aging.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During animal development, muscle cells assemble contractile fibers (myofibrils) composed of actin filaments and myosin motors that interact concertedly to shorten and lengthen.  This project used transgenic strains of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) to understand how myofibrils assemble into contractile machines during normal development.  To visualize myofibril assembly, the Littlefield Lab used CRISPR gene editing to tag specific myofibril proteins with fluorescent proteins (e.g. green fluorescent protein, GFP).  The Littlefield Lab imaged these transgenic C. elegans strains using state-of-the-art optical microscopes developed within Dr. Hari Shroff’s High Resolution Optical Imaging (HROI) Lab at the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) at the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD).  Specifically, to collect 3-D time series of multiple tagged components assemble into myofibrils, we gently illuminated developing worms using a dual-inverted single-plane illumination microscope (diSPIM).  To observe where the tagged components are located within fully assembled myofibrils, we collected super-resolution, 3-D time series using an instant structured illumination microscope (iSIM).  Further, to understand how muscle cells organize their myofibrils during assembly, the Littlefield Lab used gene editing to modify ttn-1, the C. elegans homolog of titin, which behaves as a spring-like component in vertebrate myofibrils.

The combination of the CRISPR gene edited strains and advanced imaging enabled the Littlefield Lab to collect unique, pristine datasets that show when different muscle types make specific myofibril components during development and follows the entire growth of myofibrils from their initial assembly until hatching at the end of embryogenesis. In addition, the super-resolution image datasets of intact, mature myofibrils show the arrangement of different components in living worms during different stages of contraction and relaxation.   This project established an ongoing collaboration between the Littlefield Lab at the University of South Alabama (USA; Mobile, AL) with the Shroff Lab at NIBIB (Bethesda, MD) that has expanded to include additional projects using transgenic C. elegans strains.  Through this collaboration, the Dr. Littlefield has gained experience with diSPIM and iSIM: which includes preparing samples, operating and maintaining the equipment, and analyzing the image datasets.  This expertise has made USA more competitive for acquiring a diSPIM microscope through the imaging core facility at the USA College of Medicine.  To provide the ability to visualize these image datasets at the home institution, the Littlefield Lab purchased a high-performance computer workstation for microscope image analysis.  This workstation has enabled multiple undergraduate and graduate students at USA to learn about diSPIM and iSIM and work with the datasets to generate quantitative data.  In addition, this project provided the opportunity for two under-represented minority graduate students at USA to work at the NIBIB and gain expertise in preparing, maintaining, and using the diSPIM and iSIM.  The datasets they collected and are analyzing have become central components to their master’s projects.  The datasets have enabled them to compete effectively for state fellowships.  They have also have had the opportunity to present their preliminary analysis of their data at national and regional meetings.  Overall, the experience they acquired by spending 3-months at the vibrant NIH campus has been life-changing for both students.  As a result of this project, both graduate students are expect to generate at least one peer-reviewed publication which will include analysis of the datasets collected from this project.
