<AbstractNarration>This award is to assist approximately 15 US-based graduate students to attend the 15th USENIX and ACM SIGOPS Conference on File and Storage Technologies (FAST 2017) in Santa Clara, CA.  Participation in FAST 2017 and similar conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience. It provides students with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers, and exposes students to leading work and practical industry practices in this important area of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Past grant recipients have gone on to run their own research labs and organize conferences including FAST, and the long term merits of this program's impact on storage research is well established.</AbstractNarration>
