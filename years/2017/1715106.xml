<AbstractNarration>This is an expedition objective research proposal that will use samples from IODP exp. 340 to the Lesser Antilles. This proposal seeks to examine the effect of tephra deposition and diagenesis on sediment chemistry, pore fluids, and ocean chemistry. The specific hypothesis is that tephra sedimentation and diagenesis promotes burial of organic carbon. It does this by consuming oxidizers that would otherwise degrade organic carbon and/or binding carbon to metals.  The PI proposes to analyze major and trace elements and Sr isotopes, for all samples and pore waters. The PI also proposes to analyze organic C, carbonate, carbon isotopes, reactive Fe and Al for sediments and pore water solids. The work has the potential to provide an important constraint on the oceanic carbon cycle.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit   Sediment derived from volcanic eruptions can impact chemical and biological processes within the ocean. For example, volcanic ash may fertilize the surface ocean leading to higher biological production. Volcanic material within marine sediments can also foster conditions that promote the burial of carbon. This project was built upon a number of ideas related to the interactions between sediment derived from volcanic activity and the marine carbon cycle, with a focus on processes that occur within marine sediments.  Samples were collected during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 340 from study sites that lie along and to the west of the Lesser Antilles volcanic arc region within the Grenada Basin, a region where volcanic activity provides significant material to the seafloor.  In addition to containing significant quantities of volcanic debris, sediments in this region are also characterized as being rich in biologically derived calcium carbonate.  Our results suggest that the chemical reactions within these marine sediments reflect a competition between volcanic material decomposition and calcium carbonate dissolution or precipitation. In particular, some locations or sediment intervals show chemical signatures that reflect reactions with volcanic material whereas other locations or sediment intervals show that carbonate processes dominate sediment chemistry.  In addition to these processes, volcanic material may have higher iron and manganese concentrations relative to non-volcanic material. The chemical changes that this sediment undergoes thus have the potential to play an important role in the distribution of iron and manganese as well as other associated elements. Indeed, our data suggest that organic carbon concentrations within marine sediments may be influenced by the presence of iron and, more specifically, manganese that could be derived from volcanic sediment at some locations. The relationship between the presence of these reactive metals and organic carbon appears to be most notable in samples that are particularly rich in volcanic material.   The key interpretations of our data are that (1) carbonate precipitation and dissolution reactions are important processes occurring within these sediments, (2) reactive iron and manganese may influence carbon preservation within these marine sediments, and (3) there are specific organic geochemical signatures that reflect carbon preservation associated with sediment layers that are rich in volcanic material.   Broader Impacts  This project was part of an international collaborative effort with scientists at NOC and the University of Plymouth (UK).  This collaboration provided additional expertise and capacity to the project and served to strengthen the ties among institutions.  This project also benefited from additional collaborations with scientists at Oregon State University.  This project formed the MS thesis research for a University of Akron graduate student.  An Oregon State University undergraduate student worked with us on some of the isotope analyses and another former Oregon State undergraduate student/technical staff who had worked on the immediate post-expedition phase of this research was a coauthor on the data report that resulted from this research.  One research associate (technical staff) from the University of Akron was also involved with the project as was a technical staff person from Oregon State University.
