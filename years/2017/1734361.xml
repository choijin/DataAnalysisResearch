<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to provide robots with the social intelligence to be aware of the mutual&lt;br/&gt;dependency between their movements and the movements of humans around them. To this&lt;br/&gt;end, the work will focus on (1) improving the way robots reason about spatial behavior, and (2)&lt;br/&gt;developing navigation methods that lead to understandable and appropriate motion patterns in&lt;br/&gt;social environments. This project will build upon prior work in robot perception and social&lt;br/&gt;behavior in crowds and groups. This work will impact the future use of robots in many application domains, &lt;br/&gt;especially for those where people untrained in robotics are present (e.g., delivery robots, guide robots, etc.). &lt;br/&gt;Almost all robots that move near people will need to behave appropriately, so it is necessary to discover&lt;br/&gt;socially intelligent navigation techniques, thereby increasing human acceptance and market&lt;br/&gt;success. The team will also continue established and successful efforts in fostering diversity,&lt;br/&gt;integrating education with research, disseminating new knowledge to the general public,&lt;br/&gt;industry stakeholders, and other researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior work has identified the importance of human-aware navigation, and has developed&lt;br/&gt;methods to incorporate the social norms that govern human physical space into aspects of robot&lt;br/&gt;path planning. Building on this foundational work, the team will address three main social&lt;br/&gt;intelligence tasks: (1) enabling robots to reason jointly about nearby human spatial behavior and&lt;br/&gt;their own, (2) enabling robots to communicate their intentions as they navigate so that their&lt;br/&gt;motion is understandable by nearby humans, and (3) giving robots the ability to decide when it is&lt;br/&gt;acceptable to violate pre-established social conventions. Research in these areas is&lt;br/&gt;incomplete since most efforts do not include awareness or reasoning about mutual dependency.&lt;br/&gt;This makes it difficult for a robot to reason intelligently on how to alter crowd motions in a&lt;br/&gt;socially appropriate manner. Methods discovered by the team will also support the case where&lt;br/&gt;multiple robots must mix with multiple humans.</AbstractNarration>
