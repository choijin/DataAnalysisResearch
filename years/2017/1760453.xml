<AbstractNarration>RAPID: The Changing Nature of "Calls" for Help with Hurricane Harvey: 9-1-1 and Social Media&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hurricane Harvey is the first big-data disaster where social media "calls" for help appear to have supplanted the overloaded 9-1-1 call systems; social media provided a visible, dialogic link to help. But this form of help-seeking behavior on public social media is relatively new. This project (1) captures the voices of hurricane victims and emergency response workers (both governmental and volunteer) (2) uses captured data to characterize the language present in actual social media calls for help, and (3) applies a big-data approach to a new emergency situation to assess that situation's calls for help. This project paves the way for new ways of thinking about how first-responders can utilize social media alongside traditional 9-1-1 when dispatching in future emergencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current practice in the crisis informatics literature is to mine social-media data during the disaster/aftermath around disaster-related keywords. However, such data collection pulls in everything--from solicitations for donations, to news stories--and it is challenging to filter signal from noise in such broad data sets. It is important to identify common threads in the language disaster victims use in their public "calls for help" to allow emergency managers to rapidly pinpoint these needs across varied communication channels and save lives. The approach in this project is unique because the combinatorial method isolates the signal of conversations by disaster victims on social media by understanding the specific keywords disaster victims use when requesting help. Using field interviews and surveys with Harvey and Irma victims, emergency response organizations, and organizations like the Texas/Cajun Navy--volunteer groups who organized their efforts through social media--the project will characterize what was posted, where calls for help were posted, and how these requests generated responses. The interview protocol will elicit examples of interviewees' social media posts to help develop ontologies of this content. In combination with historical data across several platforms (YouTube, Twitter, Reddit and Facebook) that will be purchased, the second phase of this project will match precise search queries (narrowed using boolean operators). The search mechanism will be driven by victims' social media behaviors and language specific to their experience of Harvey and Irma, rather than catchall hashtags and search terms. These types of victim-driven ontologies developed around specific experiences of a disaster are seriously lacking and understudied.</AbstractNarration>

This research examined how people affected by the flooding, resulting from Hurricane Harvey and Irma, used private and public social media to issue requests for help. We examined these practices in two phases.

The project as a whole combined social science research with computer machine learning methods to develop new ways of thinking about data in disasters.      Intellectual Merit       The results from this project advance the frontiers of knowledge within and across fields the following ways.  First, we identified how rescuees used their mobile and social media so their calls for help were answered. We developed a model that explains how people make rescue decisions through a process that is socially constructed.  Specifically, some people post images of their disaster situation, and trusted others convince them to evacuate or seek help.  Once images are posted, they can be shared, amplified, and used as persuasion tools in efforts to save lives.  Second, we developed an archetype of behind-the-scene and physical-rescue volunteers who used mobile and social media in novel ways to rescue others. Third, we demonstrated that people had three key reasons to bypass 9-1-1 and post their calls for help on social media. (1) They could not get through to 9-1-1. (2) They heard 9-1-1 could not be reached so they did not try. (3) They felt that others needed more help, so they did not contact 9-1-1 to keep the phone lines open for those in serious need.              Once we captured private social media images that reflected real calls for help, we used a series of machine learning studies to understand image attribute classification. These studies advance knowledge by identifying a process to create a supervised machine learning model that was more accurate than human coders at classifying who posted the images: rescuers or rescuees.  Second, we used a small human-coded data set to train our unsupervised machine learning models to successfully classify publicly posted images according to their urgency, relevancy, and damage.  What makes these findings meaningful is that past research often focused on text-based analyses, and our findings suggest that computer-vision-derived attributes offer promising results when the data is image-based rather than text.          Broader Impacts  By answering the question ?Can a machine identify features in an image as well as a human?? in crisis-related data, we contribute to computer science and computer engineering by providing evidence that high-signal data is useful in and of itself to computer vision. Furthermore, we find that private social media data contains much less noise than public social media data, and the private data can yield much higher classification successes than public social media data.  Our qualitative findings contribute to disaster sociology, geography, communication, and engineering disciplines like civil engineering.  Understanding the human side of disasters is increasingly important considering that engineering and social science disciplines are regularly teaming to produce more comprehensive results from studies of technology. The developed models articulate how disaster decision making often is socially constructed, and thus social media helps to make situations visible and facilitates the rescue process.   This project has broad impact on society because almost all people experience some type of natural disaster during their lifetime.  Furthermore, social media is being used prolifically by people of diverse backgrounds. The computer models we developed have potential application as an alternative or supplement to emergency response systems, highlighting groups or individuals who are potential rescuers or who are in need of rescuing.  The human behavior and communication models developed offer a more complete understanding around issues of using 9-1-1 for emergencies, as well as demonstrate the role that mobile and social media will continue playing during disaster situations around the globe.   Finally, this project has supported opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student research in communication, computer science and computer engineering.  Our team?s outputs offer clear examples of how disaster-related innovations require interdisciplinary research.
