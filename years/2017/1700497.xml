<AbstractNarration>Front Range Community College (FRCC) will use evidence-based, inquiry-based teaching strategies to attract local high school and community college students to jobs in biotechnology, and equip them with the skills to succeed in the industry. Despite a robust industry, Colorado faces a severe shortage of skilled biotechnology technicians, mostly due to the lack of career awareness and training of local students. Career exploration activities will allow students to explore career paths in biotechnology and increase their awareness of and interest in pursuing biotechnician careers. FRCC STEM students will serve as near-peer mentors to facilitate student learning in the classroom and promote self-efficacy in career exploration. This project will make an important contribution to the development of a skilled workforce, which is essential for the continual growth and prosperity of the Colorado biotechnology industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FRCC will develop the biotechnology educational pipeline in Colorado by increasing students' exposure to and engagement in biotechnology careers. Inquiry-based molecular biology labs will be developed and implemented in local high schools and in high-enrollment science courses at FRCC. These materials will be adapted and developed to equip students with the foundational knowledge and skills in demand by the industry for entry-level biotechnology jobs. Partnerships with local industry will ensure the workforce relevancy of the inquiry curriculum and will provide engaging career exploration opportunities to attract students into biotechnology careers. This project will generate valuable instructional materials, which can be adopted by the science education community and will be shared with the ATE community. A long term goal is to reduce the regional educational achievement gap, and to increase local participation in Colorado's bioscience workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The biotech industry in Colorado is a vital part of the stateâ€™s economy, with employment growth surpassing the national average. As biotech companies in Colorado grows, there is insufficient local biotech workforce to meet the job demands, thus resulting in the "Colorado Paradox" in which most of the biotech jobs are filled by out of state workers.  The insufficient biotech workforce in Colorado is mostly due to inadequate biotech education in schools and community colleges.  Without a robust biotech curriculum, students are not interested in biotech careers and they are unaware of biotech career opportunities in the area, which then leads to a severe shortage in the skilled biotechnical workforce.  Therefore, the major goal of this small ATE project is to build a local biotech workforce by improving biotech education and career awareness in high schools and community colleges.  Our team has successfully addressed the two intellectual merits proposed in this project.  First, we have developed two inquiry-based biotech labs that contain relevant biotech core skills. We then implemented these labs in high enrollment introductory biology classes at our college and local high schools to increase studentsâ€™ interests and awareness of biotech careers.  Furthermore, these labs were complemented with career exploration activities to expose and recruit students to biotech career paths.  So far, over 800 students have participated in the labs and activities.  As a result, many of the students have made a significant gain in their interest and awareness of the biotech career.  Our project has also successfully addressed the second intellectual merit in which we have enhanced studentsâ€™ biotech learning with near-peer teaching assistants in high school and community college classrooms. Almost all students reported the teaching assistants were essential in engaging and improving their learning of the biotech lab materials in the classrooms.  The outcomes of the activities from this project indicated that the biotech inquiry labs were well received by both students and teachers.  Therefore, our project has broadly impacted biotech education through the materials and techniques developed, and the professional development activities for instructors have improved teaching practice in science labs.  In fact, one of the biotech labs will be permanently incorporated into the lab curriculum of the general biology class at our college.  The knowledge gained and disseminated through the implementation of this project has provided guidelines for best practices in developing bioscience-focused partnerships between community colleges, high schools, and the local industry.   In conclusion, our project has successfully increased the awareness and interest of students and faculty in Colorado biotech career opportunities.
