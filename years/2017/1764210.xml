<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the conference "Recent developments in noncommutative algebra and related areas", which will be held March 17-19, 2018 at the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington. The purpose of the conference is to survey recent developments and to chart new paths for further progress on several topics of active current interest in noncommutative algebra, with broad connections to other subjects such as combinatorics, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will bring together researchers who work in noncommutative algebra and related areas, namely, algebraic geometry, representation theory and topology. The focus of the conference will be new research directions of several important topics such as noncommutative algebraic geometry, Hopf algebras and quantum groups, noncommutative invariant theory, higher category theory, and algebraic aspects of mathematical physics. Special effort will be made to bring together a group of junior researchers, women and underrepresented minorities, who are currently working in different directions, and to engage them in interdisciplinary activity through collaboration. More information can be found at the conference website: https://sites.math.washington.edu/~zhang/SeattleRDncAR2018/index.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The conference ``Recent Developments in Noncommutative Algebra'', held at the University of Washington in March of 2017, provided&nbsp;an opportunity for both young and established researchers in&nbsp;noncommutative algebra, mathematical physics and derived&nbsp;noncommutative algebraic geometry to come together and share their&nbsp;most recent work.
