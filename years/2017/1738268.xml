<AbstractNarration>The 2017 IEEE North American School for Information Theory will be held at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, from June 7-9, 2017. This Project provides support for the expenses of school participants from the United States, including graduate students and postdocs. These participants will benefit from attending the school, learning from senior colleagues, presenting their own research in poster sessions, and expanding their network contacts within the community, but who lack funds and would not be able to attend without travel support. The student selection criteria emphasize ethnic diversity, gender equality, and geographic diversity, to ensure broad participation in the workshop.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The project supported the travel of students at US institutions to the 2017 North American School of Information Theory. The School is an annual educational event initiated in 2008 by the IEEE Information Theory Society.  The 2017 North American School of Information Theory was held from June 6 to June 9 2017 in the Technology Square Research Building at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The event provided many avenues for interactions between students and guest lecturers.        Students had the opportunity to follow lectures by four distinguished lecturers, each of about two hours and a half.
