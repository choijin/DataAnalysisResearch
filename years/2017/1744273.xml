<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed exploratory work is aimed at merging FerroElectret Nanogenerator (FENG) and smart materials in micrometer-sized-based devices. This is expected to establish new performance theoretical limits in the operation of micro-electro-mechanical and optical systems; and to enable unprecedented functionality. The research plan is focusing on the transition of nanogenerator technologies from device development to system implementation, enabling integration in wearable electronics. The project will complete three Major Research&lt;br/&gt;Tasks that cover device optimization, system integration, and validation. The overall scientific broader impact of this work is to generate knowledge that will be of significance to researchers and developers in the fields of large-scale integration of wearable and portable systems. The societal broader impact is found in the development of an energy harvesting technology that could pave the road towards self-powering portable/wearable electronics from human motion reducing the need of non renewable energy sources.&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;The PI's research group introduced the FENG as a promising device for harvesting energy from human motion, and demonstrated major progress in performance from the integration of single wall CNT films with vanadium dioxide (VO2)-based devices.&lt;br/&gt;In this early exploratory research, the PI proposes to study the feasibility of merging these two breakthroughs into micrometer-sized devices to allow for self-powering capabilities and enable touch-activated programming of electrical, mechanical, and optical states. The intellectual merit of the proposed work is found in the combination of FENG and VO2-based microdevices to enable self-powered programmable microdevices that can be integrated in wearable electronics. The potential main contributions of this exploratory research are the maturing of nanogenerator technologies capable of harvesting energy from human motion; and the development of a design platform for the integration of FENG with micrometer devices. Despite the significant progress on nanogenerators, there are still hurdles in the path towards their individual optimization and full integration with microdevices, and even more for the development of self-powered wearable electronics. The most significant obstacles that prevent the further advancement of the technology include: (i) device dynamics and frequency performance, (ii) matching impedance with power storage units, and (iii) power modulation. All these three obstacles will be addressed in the proposed exploratory research.</AbstractNarration>
