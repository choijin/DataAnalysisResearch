<AbstractNarration>The current technology gaps of laboratory-scale reaction systems have limited the commercial availability of: 1) automated microreactor platforms that deliver first principles kinetics, 2) automated microreactor platforms for catalyst activity screening, 3) online analytics that capture real-time concentration-response profiles, and 4) computational data analytics able to analyze, report, and recommend.  Process development and reaction engineers could potentially implement such reaction systems to expedite their laborious research and development activities.  The research project aims at closing these technology gaps in laboratory-scale catalyst screening and characterization to broadly accelerate materials development and polymer commercialization timelines.  The study of artificially intelligent, autonomous microreactors (microAIRs) is proposed to address the technical challenges that currently limit the next-generation needs in catalyst discovery research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The governing hypothesis for the study is that microAIRs engineered with online analytics can accelerate, improve accuracy, and minimize the energy and environmental impacts during the iterative discovery of a next-generation olefin catalyst system.  Successful testing of this hypothesis will address the principal need to combine real-time, multiphase microfluidics tracking and feedback algorithms with a non-invasive analytical method that can directly measure a reaction parameter.  The ability of a reactor system to decipher phase behaviors, analyze the reaction progress, decide which catalyst is the most active, and identify accurate kinetic expressions are tremendous challenges that microAIRs can solve in order to more efficiently screen catalyst and discover kinetics. Opportunities exist to i) improve the accuracy of process kinetics, ii) establish input/output responses that fully fingerprint a catalyst in a business portfolio, and iii) improve the presentation of real-time analytics and accelerated decision making in catalyst discovery.  Review of the state-of-the-art reveals that current technical challenges for laboratory-scale, homogeneous polyolefin catalytic systems include: 1) combinatorial challenge to fully fingerprint catalyst performance, 2) evaluation of large commercial libraries of catalyst systems, 3) engineering for control of chemical transport challenges in flow, 4) sensing with adaptive response to catalyst activity, 5) on-chip analytics coupled with unique reactor/mixer designs in flow, and 6) real-time data analysis with adaptive experimental design and execution.  The proposed research, if successful, will broadly impact polymers manufacturing, and it will also introduce novel laboratory techniques for the discovery of new science. The project will also involve curriculum development activities and outreach to the community through NYU's incubator program.</AbstractNarration>

This project led to the discovery of new methodologies for the study of metallocene catalytic polymerizations.&nbsp; This class of chemical reactions plays a major role in the world's economy, energy, and our environment.&nbsp; First, we discovered that artificial neural networks trained by infrared thermography are a useful laboratory method for controlling the temperature of microfluidic devices.&nbsp; Next, we trained neural networks using published kinetics of a model zirconocene-catalyzed olefin polymerization, enabling the prediction of the synthesized polymer's properties and the reverse prediction of missing kinetic parameters in the literature.&nbsp; Building on those discoveries, we designed a semi-automated microreactor system to quickly narrow in on the catalyst's activity for different temperatures and zirconocene-catalyst, activator, and monomer concentrations.&nbsp; Our study exemplified the power of experiments and computations working together synchronously to generate information faster and with better accuracy than conventional techniques.&nbsp; In another study, we designed a portable reactor laboratory-in-a-box to catalogue the activator's chemistry, which in turn revealed that machine-assisted microreactors can reduce chemical waste by orders of magnitude and much faster than traditional polymerization laboratories while consuming significantly less energy.&nbsp; Finally, our work discovered that unsupervised machine learning methods, such as natural language processing algorithms, may be used with word embeddings in literature abstracts to guide polymerization research more efficiently than conventional search engines.&nbsp; Our findings infer that artificial intelligence, both supervised and unsupervised methods, can play a new role in the discovery of exothermic catalytic polymerizations.</p> <p>Our study also generated unique broader impacts on education and society.&nbsp; The knowledge reported in our NSF products could be applied by industry to reduce polymerization research and development times from years-to-months, with less chemical waste generated and energy consumed, and to help make chemical processes safer for exothermic catalytic polymerizations that are notoriously complex and difficult to control.&nbsp; Better informed executive decisions could be made faster in the production of ubiquitous materials such as plastics, or for the design and production of more environmentally benign plastics.&nbsp; The funding has also had a positive impact on education by introducing new concepts into undergraduate and graduate chemical engineering courses taught by the principal investigator.&nbsp; One doctoral student, five undergraduate students, and one K-12 student were provided opportunities to complete computer science and chemical engineering research in this project.&nbsp; The project advanced the way the PI's laboratory collects, analyzes, and archives large amounts of research data, and how high-performance computing can work synchronously with automated laboratory experiments.&nbsp; This includes the use of digital twins with automated experiments for the validation of AI methods.&nbsp; A remote learning platform was also created with a secure digital interface in which K-12 students could execute experimental/digital protocols, thereby enhancing their education and awareness of polymer science and engineering.&nbsp; The project's results have been disseminated worldwide through one doctoral dissertation, one undergraduate thesis, seven journal publications (and one in preparation), eleven conference presentations, thirteen invited academic seminars, one invited industry seminars, and one U.S. Patent Application.&nbsp; Improvement in public knowledge of the research has been accomplished.&nbsp; NYU Tandon Marketing and Communications have broadcast multiple news stories/press releases on the project, in addition to news stories worldwide.&nbsp; The PI's laboratory also maintains a website and Twitter account (@HartmanLab) where news stories and journal publications of the results were posted on the world-wide-web/social media.&nbsp; Finally, the research results were presented in the NYU Tandon School of Engineering Research Expo where members of the Brooklyn community had the opportunity to learn about the project and its societal importance.</p> <!--   @font-face  {font-family:"Cambria Math";
