<AbstractNarration>Broad and diverse adoption of data science educational programming by institutions of higher education in the United States is essential to the future of scientific and economic progress. By developing data science programs and integrating data science into curricula, U.S. institutions can ensure that graduates are better prepared for the research and industry needs of the twenty-first century. While there are significant programs in data science under development at research-oriented institutions of higher education, progress in program development at primarily undergraduate, teaching-focused, and minority-serving institutions is lagging and underrepresented in the national conversation. Consequently, there is an emerging "Data Divide" between the different types of institutions of higher education, which would be detrimental both to science and to the future workforce needs of the nation. This workshop will identify the unique challenges faced by primarily undergraduate, teaching-focused, and minority-serving institutions in developing data science educational programs. Topics to be addressed include instructor training, infrastructure needs, existing and potential resources, and expertise gaps that have a disproportionate impact on program development at such institutions. The workshop will also stimulate discussions about the necessary resources and the available opportunities for supporting efforts in the development of data science programs at these types of institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data Science education is an essential component in the continued competitiveness of the United States on the international stage. The outcomes of this workshop will help the community move one step closer to ensuring that data science education is broadly accessible to a very broad cross-section of the student population across the nation. The workshop is an important step towards ensuring that diverse student populations across the U.S. are able to receive education in data science education regardless of their location, gender, ethnicity, financial need, or other demographics that may currently limit opportunities for advancement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Negotiating the Digital and Data Divide in Higher Education     This award allowed for significant community work in identifying the unique challenges and opportunities for data science program development at primarily undergraduate, teaching-focused, and minority-serving institutions. Particularly, the focus was on the emergence of a digital and data divide, between different types of institutions of higher education, that will be detrimental to science and the future data-enabled workforce needs of the nation.      Intellectual Merit The PI hosted, The Keeping Data Science Broad: Bridging the Digital Divide initiative engaging over 60 institutions from data science programs across the nation, either traditional or alternative, and from a range of institution types, including primarily teaching-focused institutions such as community-colleges, minority-led and minority-serving institutions, liberal arts colleges, tribal colleges, universities, as well as industry partners to provide a platform for these missing voices in data science education.  The initiative included an in-person workshop, a 6-month community survey, and three targeted virtual events to understand and address questions about how to best prepare institutions to teach the data science students of 2025.  The events covered Data Science in the Traditional Context, Alternative Avenues for Data Science Education, Negotiating the Digital and Data Divide, and The Big Picture for a Data Science Education Network. Outcomes were published in a full report entitled  Keeping Data Science Broad: Negotiating the Digital and Data Divide Among Higher-Education Institutions, with over 15 co-authors who shepherded ideas from the twenty-nine white papers, produced by participants during the two-day workshop, into a detailed report on the representative challenges and opportunities within each institution type. The report outlined 8 Linked Challenge-Vision Areas as well as the Top 10 asks from the community.  Outcomes were presented and used as a primary source for the larger National Academy of Science?s study on: Envisioning the Undergraduate Data Science Discipline. Input from the series was presented by the PI to the National Academies Study board and incorporated into their comprehensive report on envisioning undergraduate data science education. Also, the Linked Challenge-Vision Areas led to the development of new programs, including The South Big Data Hub?s DataUp Program, which has provided data science pedagogy development to faculty teams from over 11 institutions, as well as trained over 30 faculty and indirectly 400+ students to date. Finally, selected original participants were contacted, two years after the initial initiative ended,  to further explore initiative impact through case studies. The goal was to assess where participants are now and how data science has grown and/or impacted their institutions.  Case studies were produced through professional interviews with participants and were published on the South Big Data Hub?s website.  Interviews and case studies were produced for Florida A&amp;M University (Tallahassee, FL), Old Dominion University (Norfolk, VA), Jackson State University (Jackson, MS), and the University of Puerto Rico (R?o Piedras, PR).     Broader Impacts While significant data science educational programming is under development at research-oriented institutions of higher education, progress in program development at primarily undergraduate, teaching-focused, and minority-serving institutions is lagging and underrepresented in the national conversation.  Through this award, unique challenges and opportunities were identified which has sparked the broad adoption of data science educational programming by diverse institutions of higher education in the United States. By developing data science programs and integrating data science into curricula, U.S. institutions can ensure that their graduates are prepared for the research and industry needs of the twenty-first century.
