<AbstractNarration>This is a project developing quantitative results in probability theory, analytic number theory, and connections between the two fields.  Probabilistic reasoning has played an important role in several recent breakthroughs in number theory, including the solution of Paul Erd√∂s' minimum modulus problem for covering systems, which had been open since the 1950s.  One aspect of this project refines the analysis to study the related odd covering problem.  Techniques used in analytic number theory can be employed to study models in statistical physics that are governed by Markov chains.  Often these techniques give rigorous proofs of phenomena observed in computer models, and sometimes the rigorous analysis uncovers errors from model predictions that result from a limited model size.  The project aims to extend recent strong estimates on the spectral expansion of the shape of cubic fields to similar spectral estimates for the shapes of quartic and quintic fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The solution of the minimum modulus problem combines the method of moments with techniques from probabilistic combinatorics, including the Lovasz local lemma and the use of pseudo-random measures.  In developing quantitative results regarding covering systems, this project will apply structural decomposition techniques currently in use in additive combinatorics.  Oscillatory integrals, the method of stationary phase, and van der Corput's method are used frequently in analytic number theory to obtain sharp estimates.  These techniques are often useful also in the asymptotic analysis of the mixing time of Markov chains, and will be employed in continued work on analysis of the two-dimensional abelian sandpile model and a new local limit theorem on nilpotent groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The asymptotic study of discrete structures and physical systems has played an increasingly important role in modern mathematics.  This NSF Project developed several recent trends in mathematical analysis making breakthroughs in discrete probability and number theory, and developed connections between the two fields.     The famous mathematician Paul Erd&#337;s left a list of his favorite open problems and offered monetary prizes for them.  While the PI was a post-doctoral scholar he solved an elementary number theory problem for which Erd&#337;s had offered $1000, which, at the time, tied a theorem of Szemer?di for the richest problem ever solved.  The solution combined a device from dependent probability, the Lov?sz Local Lemma, with techniques from multiplicative number theory and several other combinatorial techniques.  The paper won the MAA?s 2017 David P. Robbins Prize in Algebra, Combinatorics and Discrete Math. The NSF project developed this solution further by introducing techniques from statistical physics and using a computer program to search for better quantitative bounds. Part of the intellectual merit of the project was the diversity of modern analytic techniques used.     Since the work of Sato and Shintani in the 70s, and further developed by Wright-Yukie, Bhargava, Taniguchi and Thorne, prehomogeneous vector spaces have played an important role in the study of low degree number fields and arithmetic statistics.  This is a major frontier in current number theory research, and was part of the work culminating in Bhargava?s Fields Medal.  In part of the NSF project, the PI created a new arithmetic object by adding a twisting automorphic form to the original zeta function of a prehomogeneous vector space introduced by Sato and Shintani.  This construction already has added deep analytic information regarding the behavior of number fields that result from adjoining the roots of degree 3 and 4 integer polynomials to the integers.  This area of research exploits the large amounts of symmetry present in a prehomogeneous vector space due to the acting algebraic group.  This symmetry results in deep analytic estimates and combines methods from a variety of disciplines, including representation theory, complex analysis, and combinatorial group theory.  The work has been supplemented with calculations in computer algebra systems such as Magma and Mathematica.     In a third area of the project, the PI used his expertise in harmonic analysis to study several topics involving probability and groups.  Central limit theorems describe the tendency of many phenomena, like student test scores, to have a distribution which can be fitted to a bell curve.  A local limit theorem describes the probability of an outcome on a finer scale, for instance the probability of being dealt 13 red cards when a deck of 52 cards is dealt into two piles.  In a paper with Diaconis, the PI proved a new local limit theorem, resolving a conjecture of Breuillard which had been open for ten years.  As part of the NSF project the PI obtained a very general local limit theorem treating connected nilpotent Lie groups, which contained and extended the existing work in the area. In a separate work, together with Jerison and Levine the PI used a local limit theorem and a variety of other techniques from the theory of random walk on a group to resolve problems regarding the abelian sandpile model which had been open since the late 80s and mid 90s. This project was extended in a summer research project with a strong undergraduate student, developing Python code to obtain related numerical constants, and generalizing and resolving further open problems from the earlier project.      During the project the PI created and co-organized a new analysis seminar at Stony Brook, and was involved in research projects with local high school and undergraduate students.  He also assisted in running the local Math Circle for high school students interested in problem solving.
