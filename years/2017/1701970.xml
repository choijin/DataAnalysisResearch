<AbstractNarration>Archaea are microorganisms that are known to play critical roles in carbon and nitrogen cycling, but little is known about the diversity and evolution of the group. Woesearchaeota, is a poorly known group of Archaea that is commonly found in freshwater wetlands but can also be found in diverse ecosystems globally. As with most members of Archaea, there are no cultured representatives to study in the laboratory, and few available genomes sequences to help infer function. This research will employ environmental DNA sequencing methods and associated computational approaches to generate multiple novel Woesearchaeota genomes from a freshwater wetland. Analysis of these genomes will advance knowledge of the functional potential of this group globally. This work will provide new insights into the role of Archaea in regulating biogeochemical processes. One graduate student will be trained in molecular systematics and undergraduates will receive hands-on research experience on the fundamentals of scientific computing and bioinformatics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will produce novel whole-genome sequences and inferences about the metabolic potential for the recently described archaeal group, Woesearchaeota. To-date only a handful of Woesearchaeota genomes and partial genomes have been reconstructed. A high-resolution census of Archaea in a freshwater wetland has revealed that Woesearchaeota at this site are phylogenetically diverse, and comprise two ecologically differentiated ecotypes with niches defined by site geochemistry. The hypothesis that observed niche preferences can be explained by genomic variation will be tested by targeted reconstruction of multiple Woesearchaeota genomes. Researchers will also test the hypotheses that local evolutionary diversifications have resulted in a small core genome, and that the high phylogenetic diversity observed within this phylum is mirrored by high levels of inferred functional diversity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Archaea are microorganisms that play critical roles in many environments, but we know comparatively little about this domain of life, relative to bacteria.  Part of this knowledge gap is due to the fact that most archaea, like bacteria, are difficult to grow and study in the lab.  Fortunately, in recent years, the ability to sequence DNA directly from the environment - from dirt, water, human skin swabs, etc. - eliminates the need for a laboratory culturing step.  This approach of directly sequencing DNA from the environment has produced a deluge of new archaeal genomes which have made even five-year-old views of the tree of life obsolete.  This project has impacted the field of microbiology by greatly expanding the genomic sampling for several types of archaea.   Archaea are crucial microorganisms inhabiting soils of methane-producing freshwater wetlands, and are responsible for all biologically produced methane.  However, for the vast majority of archaea in these systems, we know little about their ecological role.  To further our knowledge of these archaea, this project used high-throughput DNA sequencing of DNA extracted directly from freshwater wetland soils and waters sampled from Old Woman Creek National Estuarine Research Reserve, Ohio.  After sequencing approximately 1.6x1012 DNA bases from 7 samples, we used computational approaches to reconstruct 527 novel partial archaeal genomes from the wetland.  Many of these genomes are from parts of the tree of life where we have few genomic representatives, and thus very little knowledge of genomic diversity and ecosystem role.  By computationally predicting and analyzing the genes present in these novel genomes, we now have a  better understanding of how these microbes might transform carbon and other elements, both in this wetland and globally.  This project directly supported the dissertation research of a PhD student.   This project also included a multi-session workshop that introduced undergraduate students to the basics of scientific computing and microbial ecology data analysis, by using the DNA sequencing data and scientific questions generated by the research.  Undergraduate students learned to use high-performance scientific computing infrastructure, and learned the basics of genome analysis using state-of-the-field tools.  The workshop was primarily developed and led by the PhD student.  Two of these undergraduate students (neither with prior research experience) have continued with bioinformatics research in the Principal Investigator?s laboratory, and the curriculum developed for the workshop will continue to be used in future years beyond the project end date to continue to expose undergraduates to computational biology, and to recruit a diverse workforce into training and research careers in computational biology.
