<AbstractNarration>This SBIR phase I project will provide a unique computational capability to additive manufacturing (AM) designers, engineers, and technicians for making better decisions with regards to metal 3D printing. Through AM, one can fabricate complex parts that were previously impossible to manufacture. Perfecting an AM process is however non-trivial, entailing time-consuming and expensive shop-floor experimentation. For example, fabricating a typical hand-sized component on a metal AM machine can take several hours to complete, costing thousands of dollars. Consequently, there is significant interest today to replace experiments with computer simulation. But AM simulations today require massively parallel computer clusters, such as those available only at national labs. This has largely deterred industrial progress and innovation. The proposed research has the potential to yield an algorithmically  advanced AM simulation program that can run on standard desktop workstations without loss of accuracy. An environmental impact of this SBIR proposal is that by promoting virtual simulation of AM, the amount of wasted material will be minimized. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research lies at the intersection of computational mechanics, and manufacturing. It proposes to develop a novel computational approach to additive manufacturing simulation that bypasses the memory bottleneck observed in traditional finite element analysis (FEA). By using a voxel representation where all elements are congruent (i.e. possess a rigid transformation symmetry) and have identical material properties, the memory requirements can be reduced dramatically and thereby speed up the simulation by orders of magnitude compared to traditional FEA software. Similar approach has been successfully demonstrated for problems in structural mechanics and topology optimization. The proposal aims to extend the approach to in-process AM simulation where G-code will be used to identify elements in a heat affected zone for laser and electron beam based processes, and the congruent elements will be identified for each phase in the process to reduce simulation time.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit  The intellectual outcome of this study is that "by reducing computer memory usage, it is possible to carry out significantly faster computer simulation, specifically thermal analysis of additive manufacturing process". The primary field of impact is in additive manufacturing simulation. However, this opens to new opportunities for simulating other forms of manufacturing as well.     Inferring and implementing such limited-memory methods, was one of the major outcomes of this grant. In the process, we uncovered an extension of a preconditioning method, namely, deflation that can now be applied to complex non-linear phenomena. Furthermore, through the proposed research, we were able to simulate at a speed that has not been demonstrated before.     Intellectually, we now have a better understanding on the additive manufacturing thermal process, and its relationship to part quality. It will help the simulation technology advance at a faster pace. Fast computer simulation will reduce the need for experimental verification and associated costs.       Broader Impact:  The broader outcome of this study was in the professional development of two software engineers on the importance of computer simulation in additive manufacturing.  Interaction with potential customers also provided a context for the technology. The tool has been embedded within a finite element framework, and is currently being further developed towards commercialization.
