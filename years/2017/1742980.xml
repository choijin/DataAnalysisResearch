<AbstractNarration>Biology has undergone a major data revolution with the exponential explosion of data information and the technological leaps in computing power that make these data widely available. Numerous reports have indicated that data-enriched undergraduate classrooms have significant benefits for improving students' understanding of science concepts, scientific reasoning, and the scientific process. Developing data skills allows students to participate as scientists, succeed in increasingly data-focused careers, and become well-informed citizens and consumers. With recent efforts to curate, archive and disseminate research data and the development of new tools that make data more accessible to the education community, it is now demonstrable that faculty can successfully bring data and authentic research into the classroom and achieve their learning objectives. The time is right to accelerate this effort and to contribute to the national dialogue on what it means and what it takes to implement data in the classroom. The professional societies leading this effort are well-positioned to expand and enhance awareness of available resources and foster collaborations and opportunities among their members and networks. The conference will elevate attention of the conference theme in undergraduate biology education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ecological Society of America, Botanical Society of America, Society for the Study of Evolution and Society for Economic Botany, collectively known as the Life Discovery Partners, are organizing the 4th Life Discovery - Doing Science biology education conference (LDC) on the theme: Â Data: Discover, Investigate, Inform.  The conference will facilitate discovery of multiple types of data including environmental, geospatial, specimens, genomic, visual, audio, and other numeric data. To investigate data, strategies and approaches to scaffold student experiences and explore innovative data visualizations will be highlighted in order to unfold the stories of life on earth at various temporal and spatial scales. The LDC will offer presentations and discussions around the type, quantity, and quality of data needed to inform decision-making and the data skills to be introduced at various stages of learning. This proposal will support travel and participation of faculty from community colleges, minority serving institutions, primarily undergraduate institutions, and high school teachers to ensure that they will be informed and have access to such data resources for teaching.</AbstractNarration>

Doing Science biology education conference (LDC) held Oct 19-21, 2017 at the University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK and two faculty mentoring networks in Spring 2019 and Spring 2020.  The goals of the project were to promote data literacy in undergraduate and high school biology education and contribute to a national dialogue on how authentic research data can be used in the classroom. This project specifically aims to bring key underrepresented groups into this national dialogue, especially faculty from community colleges, minority-serving institutions, primarily undergraduate institutions and minority faculty from any institution.  Eighty-five participants from 28 states attended the 2017 Life Discovery ? Doing Science Education conference on the theme: Data: Discover, Investigate, Inform. The conference is a partnership of the Ecological Society of America, Botanical Society of America and the Society for the Study of Evolution.  NSF funds supported 34 attendees. Including peer mentors, 28 faculty were involved in the 2019 and 2020 Faculty Mentoring Networks.  The objectives of the project are to:  clarify learning outcomes related to using data in the classroom highlight classroom ready datasets and approaches in a variety of educational settings; and foster a network of support for faculty innovation and professional development.   We published an article based on the discussions at the LDC: The growing importance of data literacy in life science education https://doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.1195  The LDC also hosted the launch workshop of the RCN-UBE incubator, Designing an Infrastructure and Sustainable Learning Community for Integrating Data-Centric Teaching Resources in Undergraduate Biology Education, Award # 1730122, was held in conjunction with the conference. As a result of this collaboration, incubator participants were able to attend the conference, facilitating exchange of ideas among incubator and conference attendees.  The faculty mentoring networks were organized in collaboration with the Quantitative Undergraduate Biology Education and Synthesis (QUBES) project.  They provided participants with new insight in building scaffolding to teach undergraduate students build quantitative skills and to use authentic, messy data. They efficiently and effectively reached faculty in the field of ecology who are often isolated in their own institutions and who need applications specific to the discipline.   The network provided a space for faculty to ask and receive feedback specific to the discipline, and their specific instructional setting.    The two faculty mentoring networks generated 26 adaptations which are publicly available on the ESA's EcoEd Digital Library and the QUBES sites for those interested in ideas on how to create data-rich classrooms.  As result of the Spring 2020 FMN and its attention on inclusive pedagogy for the first time in ESA, we have compiled a list of resources that are useful for any discipline. The modules that faculty adapted with an inclusive pedagogy lens are also publicly available to faculty from any discipline seeking ideas on ways to be attentive to their students? multiple learning contexts.  The faculty mentoring networks provided just-in-time teaching support and most participants were able to implement these ideas. Participants were more confident about finding resources on quantitative teaching and inclusive pedagogy and now have a network of faculty they can turn to for support in a collaborative spirit.
