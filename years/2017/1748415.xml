<AbstractNarration>This proposal is for travel support for students at the Conference on The Foundations of Nanoscience meeting (FNANO), Snowbird, Utah from April 16-19, 2018. FNANO was established by the International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation, and Engineering in 2004 as a venue for the wide range of researchers interested in various aspects of self-assembly as it relates to nanoscience and nanotechnology. The meeting features 12 tracks covering recent work in different types of self-assembled architectures and devices, at scales ranging from nano-scale to meso-scale. Methodologies include both experimental as well as theoretical approaches.  The conference spans traditional disciplines including chemistry, biochemistry, physics, computer science, mathematics, and various engineering disciplines. The emphasis is on basic, rather than applied research.  Last year's meeting attracted 189 registered participants.  The 15th Conference on Foundations of Nanoscience in 2018 will have a mixture of invited talks by distinguished nanoscientists as well as contributed posters and open discussion periods to enhance attendee interaction with the goal of creating vibrant intellectual community in the area of self-assembly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for travel support for students at the Conference on Foundations of Nanoscience in 2018. The travel support will be open and evenly divided among all students (undergrad, grad and Postdoc) giving accepted posters or talks. This project, for travel support for students at the Conference, will provide a substantial multidisciplinary impact to nanoscience, biochemistry and chemistry, which will profit from the introduction of key methodologies derived from mainstream computer science, such as mathematical modeling, software engineering, algorithms and modular design methodologies.</AbstractNarration>
