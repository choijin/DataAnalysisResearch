<AbstractNarration>The pace of scientific discovery is often dictated by the development of new tools and techniques that bring into focus previously imperceptible aspects of the matter under investigation. In the study of the brain, the development of new labeling methods, such as the Golgi stain in the 1870s or genetic expression of fluorescent proteins in the 1990s, continues to revolutionize our ability to better understand the organization of the brain and study how networks in the brain function to support behavior, learning and memory. The aim of this research is to identify and develop a novel set of genetic tools that allow brain researchers to label and manipulate brain circuits with increasing sophistication. In this project, expertise of virologists and neuroscientists is paired in order to design new, cutting-edge approaches for studying and manipulating brain circuits. These novel tools provide important methods for mapping the intricate connections between nerve cells that support learning and behavior. To facilitate broad adoption of the new, virus-based approaches, the tools generated through this research are made freely available to the scientific community, and on-line resources are constructed to help the research community search and request all the tools and protocols developed under this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Viruses have evolved over millions of years to evade detection and thrive in vertebrate hosts. Building on the evolutionary diversity of vertebrate viruses, this research examines the use of several, previously untested, viral species for neuroscience research. This innovative, high-risk project establishes a unique research partnership between virologists and neuroscientists, in order to identify new viral vectors for labeling and expressing molecular tools in large populations of neurons. The broader impacts of this proposal are many-fold. First, this research leads to the development of new viral tools for labeling and genetically manipulating neurons in diverse animal models. Second, by studying a diverse set of viruses in both birds and rodents, this research leads to a better understanding of virus-host interactions and how they can and should be considered when selecting and designing viral tools for neuroscience research. This research therefore provides valuable new information and tools for neuroscientists and virologists. Third, all genetic and viral tools generated through this research are made freely available to the research community. Fourth, an on-line resource describing results of all tested viruses is being generated in order to help guide other research labs when selecting and testing new viral tools.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Brain circuits are built of highly diverse and polarized cells called neurons. Neurons of multiple types intermingle within the same brain regions. They selectively connect to specific other neurons distributed nearby and, in some instances, also up to several feet away to form complex neuronal circuits. These connections permit the flow of information throughout the brain and underlie behavior and cognition. A significant roadblock in understanding the brain is the lack of safe and effective tools for tracing, labeling and controlling connected brain circuits. Thus, we sought to develop a new tool to trace how neurons wire together sequentially, and to selectively control the activity of neurons within those circuits. An individual neuron in the brain may project to several thousand downstream neurons. We developed a new viral system based on a live attenuated vaccine of yellow fever virus -- YFV-17D that labels interconnected brain circuits. We found that replication-deficient YFV-17D mutants can be reconstituted in the brain, leading to efficient viral spread from one neuron to its downstream partner neurons. Further modifications to our viral system allowed control of viral spread to only one connection (from the starting neurons to only their immediate downstream partners) or across multiple sequential connections within a circuit. We found that transient replication of the virus allows permanent genetic modifications to the circuits we are labeling without causing toxicity to the circuits. Having demonstrated the use of this new viral system in the brain, we then engineered variants to allow the scientific community to integrate this viral system with other fluorescent markers, biological sensors or channels that permit control of neuronal activity. In sum, this research has identified a versatile and safe novel viral system for mapping and functionally controlling neuronal circuits.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/19/2021<br>      Modified by: Todd&nbsp;Roberts</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
