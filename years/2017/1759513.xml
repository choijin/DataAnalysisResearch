<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial funding for the international conference "Nonlinear Waves" to be held at Brown University, May 14-18, 2018. Nonlinear wave equations provide a mathematical description for a broad range of natural phenomena. The purpose of the conference is to bring together leading experts in a wide variety of areas connected to nonlinear waves, from kinetic equations, to water wave theory, to classical nonlinear dispersive waves. This conference will be especially beneficial for junior researchers who will be able to interact with the world leaders in the field. The conference will provide an opportunity for students and junior researchers, including those from underrepresented in mathematics groups (women, minorities), to get abreast with the latest achievements&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference has two goals: (i) to survey recent exciting new developments in various domains pertaining to conservative evolution partial differential equations, with a particular emphasis on communicating the results and methods from one domain to other mathematical domains which are closely related but different, (ii) to identify and highlight promising future research directions in nonlinear waves. A wide array of mathematicians at different levels of their career are expected to attend this conference. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference website is: https://www.math.brown.edu/~benoit.pausader/nwconference</AbstractNarration>
