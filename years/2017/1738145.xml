<AbstractNarration>Social responsibility is the way a career can positively impact society. It is one of the core ideals of all branches of the military and why many students choose to study engineering. The goal of this research is to determine the relationship between the principle of social responsibility in military service and veterans' pursuit of engineering degrees.  Several programs exist to help veterans transition from service to civilian life, including support for higher education. Many veterans enter engineering degree programs; however, the dropout/dismissal rate of these students is significantly higher than other engineering students nationally. Unfortunately, research is lacking on how to understand and improve graduation rates of veteran students in engineering.  Results of this study will allow researchers to design interventions for improving the number of veteran engineering student graduates nationwide. The veteran student population brings unique backgrounds and experiences that contribute to the national initiative of developing a diverse, globally competitive engineering workforce. Broader impacts of this research include: (1) diversifying pathways through engineering, (2) increasing veteran student success in engineering, (3) engaging a wide range of veteran participants, and (4) integrating mentoring between engineering and education faculty to build a foundation for future collaboration on engineering education proposals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project asks and answers the research question: What is the role of social responsibility in reducing veteran student attrition in engineering? The research approach is to create a survey using the Dillman Tailored Design method to identify social responsibility attitudes in veteran and first-year engineering students. An External Advisory Board comprised of veterans with engineering backgrounds is involved as an external expert review panel to provide baseline validity for the survey items. The results of the survey as well as interviews of faculty and a veteran student focus group are used to determine if concepts of social responsibility positively influence veteran student retention. The survey, based on an existing model to measure social responsibility in veteran students, is a novel approach to understanding veteran student attrition. The PIs expect the results of the survey to provide a framework and justification for other research questions and/or projects related to veteran student retention in engineering. Determining veteran student motivation in higher education is a fundamental advancement in veteran student retention across all colleges. Furthermore, as social responsibility is a motivator for underrepresented students, the PIs expect these research findings to directly impact student graduation rates across engineering with the potential to even further diversify pathways to engineering degrees. The PIs plan to disseminate research findings to engineering educators and military constituents through national engineering/veteran conferences, workshops, peer-reviewed publications, and magazines.</AbstractNarration>
