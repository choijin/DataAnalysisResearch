<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2017 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Kenneth B. Ascher is "Moduli and Arithmetic of Higher Dimensional Varieties." The host institution for the fellowship is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the sponsoring scientist is Davesh Maulik.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Algebraic geometry studies geometric objects, known as varieties, which arise from polynomial equations. One of the guiding questions in this field is to classify these geometric objects, by means of forming a "compact moduli space". With this in mind, the main goals of this project were two-fold:  (1) to explicitly study compact moduli spaces of elliptic surfaces (a class of geometric objects which are of wide interest not just within mathematics, but also in other fields such as physics), and understand their birational geometry.  (2) to use tools from birational geometry to study the arithmetic of higher dimensional (i.e. dimension at least two) algebraic varieties.  WIth this in mind, the results in these directions were as follows:  (1) the PI wrote 3 new papers on moduli spaces of elliptic surfaces, and prepared and revised 2 papers for publication. These papers have answered specific questions raised in this proposal, and have paved the way for many new projects and research areas which are currently being studied by the PI and his collaborators.   (2) the PI wrote 2 papers using tools from birational geometry to understand questions related to the distribution of rational and integral points on higher dimensional varieties. One of these papers answers one of the main questions raised in this proposal.   In addition, the PI has several projects still in progress related to these two main goals that began under the duration of this award. The PI also started several projects with his collaborators on K-moduli of higher dimensional algebraic varieties, which resulted in 2 papers being finished during this project funding period.  The PI has been an active member of the mathematical community during this project funding period. In addition to giving several research lectures and organizing conferences/workshops, the PI has mentored undergraduates as part of an REU program (resulting in a publication), given a series of lectures for a mini-course (which resulted in a book chapter aimed at graduate students and beginning researchers in algebraic &amp; arithmetic geometry), and has been a participant in high school math outreach programs.
