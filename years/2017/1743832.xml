<AbstractNarration>This award would use off-the-shelf cell phone technology just recently made available on the market to construct a single frequency GPS array of sensors that would be applied to study the ionospheric effects of the solar eclipse happening on 21 August 2017.  This event would provide the opportunity to study the ionospheric response to a well-characterized modification of the solar influx. The path of total obscuration crosses the central continental United States and deployment of the networked instrumentation to Tennessee is planned for the proposed measurements. The proposed project would deploy a regional network of dual-frequency and single-frequency Global Navigation Satelite System (GNSS) receivers with the goal of monitoring total electron content (TEC), ionospheric drifts, and signal scintillation effects induced by the eclipse. The proposed project lays the foundation for the use of consumer smartphones to augment the current GNSS-TEC receiver network to produce a greatly enhanced space weather monitoring capability. The August eclipse provides an outstanding opportunity for a proof-of-concept data capture. The project will partially sponsor one full-time Ph.D. student with the eventual objective of making this his Ph.D. project, and this project will employ six undergraduates for the proposed observing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TEC estimation from single-frequency GNSS measurements requires resolving carrier-phase ambiguity problem and mitigating the higher uncertainty introduced by using code delay in the TEC estimation process. Clusters of such receivers, analyzed collaboratively with surrounding dual frequency receivers, will enable a value-added enhancement standard TEC maps. Moreover, the phase information from the single frequency receivers allows the tracking of irregularity drifts (through a correlation analysis), and also the tracking of incidents of signal scintillation. This data fusion approach will be evaluated experimentally in the proposed investigation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A total solar eclipse traversed the continental United States on August 21, 2017. Within the eclipse shadow (the umbra) direct solar radiation was blocked across all wavelengths.   At extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths, this effect eliminated the radiation that ionizes the atmosphere above 100 km altitude, thus creating a moving ?ionospheric hole?.   At longer wavelengths (visible and infrared), the eclipse produced a cool spot in the atmosphere.   It has been predicted that this temperature gradient should launch waves into the atmosphere, much like dropping a pebble into water.   These waves should become imprinted on the ionospheric plasma as they propagate outward and upward.             Effects on the neutral atmosphere are difficult to observe directly.   But ionized gases (plasmas) interact strongly with radio waves, enabling their properties to be observed by a variety of remote sensing techniques.   In this study, we used a large network of GPS receivers to investigate atmospheric effects related to the eclipse.   GPS signals are slowed down by the ionosphere. Thus, knowledge of their timing can be used to calculated the integrated plasma density between the satellite (at 20,000 km altitude) and the ground. Measurements from a distributed network of GPS receivers can then be used to create spatial maps of the ionosphere.          Our study focused on a permanent network of reference receivers in Missouri, which we augmented with inexpensive experimental receivers, similar to the receiver in consumer smartphones.   Our findings were unexpected and provocative.   Large scale density fluctuations were observed in the ionosphere, but these were discovered to be due to variations in radiation intensity across the sun (i.e., sunspots), which were progressively masked as the moon moved across  the solar disk.  Small scale waves were also observed, but these were found to be produced by tropospheric weather patterns (thunderstorms) near the eclipse track, and not caused by the eclipse.   These results contradict published results by other research groups.             Last Modified: 10/13/2018       Submitted by: Joshua Semeter]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
