<AbstractNarration>Traditionally, many of our critical systems have been developed with security as a reactive add-on, rather than a by default design. As a result, existing security mechanisms are often fragmented, hard to configure or verify, which makes it difficult to defend against various cyber attacks. This project will build the "holy grail" for enterprise/cloud/data-center security management with software-defined infrastructure (SDI): a unified framework for security and management of disparate resources, ranging from processes to storage to networking. Cloud computing is now an essential part of our national cyberinfrastructure; the proposed work will lower the total cost of ownership for clouds - further unlocking economic and environmental benefits - as well as improving the security of today's clouds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes S2OS (SDI-defined Security Operating System), which abstracts security capabilities and primitives at both the host Operating System (OS) and network levels and offers an easy-to-use and programmable security model for monitoring and dynamically securing applications. This project will explore new techniques to transparently compose software into a unified enterprise, even if the individual pieces were never explicitly designed to inter-operate, similar in a way a traditional operating system managing various hardware resources for upper-layer user applications. Further, this project will contribute new ways to leverage global information for making effective local security management decisions. Finally, this project enables new innovations in programming dynamic, host-network coordinated, and intelligent security applications to protect the entire infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will make significant contributions to how enterprise, data centers and cloud computing are securely built and managed. The project's PIs will engage in educational and outreach activities to train the next generation talent. In particular, the PIs plan to integrate the interdisciplinary research ideas into courses spanning networking, systems and security. The project will also actively encourage participation from underrepresented groups and transfer technology to industry partners.</AbstractNarration>
