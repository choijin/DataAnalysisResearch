<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the four-day "Objective Bayes 2017 Workshop" held at the University of Texas at Austin, TX on December 10-13, 2017. The workshop will consist of one day of tutorials for graduate students and new researchers, three days of scientific sessions, and a poster session, all centering on major recent developments in statistical inference methods that can be used automatically, that is, methodology that does not require subjective input other than a stylized probabilistic description of how the data arises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Objective Bayes workshop ("O'Bayes") is one of the longest running and preeminent meetings in Bayesian statistics, addressing a wide range of topics including robust, default Bayesian analysis, reproducibility, variable selection, big data, and nonparametric Bayesian methods.  Objective Bayes methods encompass research in very diverse areas, from biostatistics, to machine learning, asymptotics, spatial inference, and computation. The workshop will serve to foster interaction of researchers in these diverse areas with an aim of initiating novel ideas and research directions.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported participants for the "Objective Bayes 2017" workshop, December 10-13, 2017, at UT Austin, TX.  The workshop consisted of one day of tutorials for graduate students and new researchers, 3 days of scientific sessions, and two poster sessions, all centering on major recent developments in objective Bayesian methodology. Using the NSF award we could offer partial support for 20 junior participants, including 11 students, 5 postdocs and 4 young researchers. The 20 awards were selected from 29 eligible applicants. Awardees presented their work in either invited talks or discussions, or in posters in two prominent poster sessions.  This was the 12th meeting of one of the longest running and preeminent meetings in Bayesian statistics, following earlier meetings held in West Lafayette, IN, USA, 1996; Valencia, Spain, 1998; Ixtapa, Mexico, 2000; Granada, Spain, 2002; Aussois, France, 2003; Branson, MO, USA, 2005; Roma, Italy, 2007; Philadelphia, PA, USA, 2009; Shanghai, China, 2011; Durham, NC, USA 2013; and Valencia, Spain 2015. The scientific committee did an excellent job in setting up a very interesting program.  The first day was devoted to tutorials on Objective Priors, Bayesian Asymptotics, Model Choice. Multiple Testing, Causal Inference and the project "O'Bayes wiki".  In the next three days participants could listen to high-level talks on a variety of topics, followed by invited discussions and questions from the floor. Many talks were outright brilliant, innovative and far-reaching.  Posters were also generally of very good quality, held on two separate evenings together with a reception.  We briefly summarize some of the interesting talks and presentations, to give a flavor of the breath of topics.  Gonzalo Garcia-Donato introduced a wiki on objective, reference, vague, neutral priors ("wikiprevia"), that was suggested at a previous O'Bayes meeting in Valencia.  It aims at classifying recommended priors in most of the classical models, along with discussion panels, and it should soon get an official launch, when contributors will be welcome to include articles in a wiki principle.  In a brilliant talk, Peter Gruenwald discussed the notion of safe Bayes or powered-down likelihoods to handle some degree of misspecification, with a further twist of introducing an impossible value "0" that captures missing mass. Another interesting talk was Cristiano Villa?s approach to constructing prior weights in model comparison from a principled and decision-theoretic perspective.  Laura Ventura gave a talk on using for ABC various scores or estimating equations as summary statistics, rather than the corresponding M-estimators, which offers the appealing feature of reducing computation while being asymptotically equivalent. Veronika Rockova presented recent work on concentration rates for regression tree methods, including a rigorous analysis of these methods. She showed that the spike and slab priors plus BART ("spike and tree") achieve sparsity and optimal concentration, in an oracle sense. The talk included a side note on assembling partition trees towards creating a new form of BART.  Nick Polson, along with Peter McCullach, proposed an intriguing notion of sparse Bayes factors, which corresponds to the limit of a Bayes factor when the prior probability of the null goes to zero.  In summary, a good number of outstanding talks maintained a high level of scientific excitement and kept the audience engaged. One interesting observation is that the general theme of the OBayes conferences has shifted from more traditional themes of objective prior constructions and principles to  broader questions of robust and default methods, with increasing overlaps with nonparametric Bayesian methods and machine learning.   Out of a total of around 140 participants an estimated more than 50% were first time O'Bayes participants.   In part thanks to the support from the NSF award a good number of junior researchers were among the first time O'Bayes participants.
