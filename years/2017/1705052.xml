<AbstractNarration>CBET - 1705052 - PI:  Theis, Thomas L.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is in partial support of the Fifth Symposium on Industrial Ecology for Young Professionals (SIEYP V). SIEYP V is organized by the Student Community Board of the International Society for Industrial Ecology (ISIE), and focuses on communication and networking among young professionals (graduate students and post-doctoral researchers). The main goal of the symposium is to provide an opportunity for young professionals who perform research in industrial ecology (IE) to present and discuss their novel research ideas and experiences, receive constructive feedback, and network with senior professionals in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of SIEYP V is "Communicating your research to a broader audience." To move the scientific discussion beyond the academic realm, and make a difference in the real world, there is a need to engage a broader public. SIEYP V focuses on developing communication skills, in order to better deliver scientific findings to different group targets: peers, policy makers, industrialists, and the general public. SIEYP V will be held in conjunction with the joint conference of ISIE and the International Symposium on Sustainable Systems and Technology (ISSST) to be held in Chicago in June, 2017. The theme of ISIE/ISSST 2017 is "Science in Support of Sustainable and Resilient Communities" and will bring together engineers, environmental and social scientists, industry representatives, and policy and decision makers from the public and private sectors to discuss how their findings can be used to advance the development of more sustainable and resilient societies. Attending both SIEYP V and ISIE/ISSST 2017 provides an excellent opportunity for young IE professionals to present their ideas to the international community, be updated on the latest scientific findings, and establish a network of researchers for future collaborations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Introduction The 9th biennial conference of the International Society for Industrial Ecology and 25th meeting of the International Symposium for Sustainable Systems and Technology (ISIE-ISSST) were held jointly for the first time on the campus of the University of Illinois at Chicago June 25-29, 2017. The focus of conference, "Science in Support for Sustainable and Resilient Communities," created an ideal opportunity for complementary, forward-looking workshops and debates about the importance of the efficacy of communication. During the associated Symposium on Industrial Ecology for Young Professionals (SIEYP) held on June 24-25, 2017, participants&mdash;including students, postdoctoral researchers, and others&mdash;received professional training, tips, and recommendations on how effectively sharing scientific findings with a broad and diverse audience.    The main goal of SIEYP was to provide training for young professionals who perform research in industrial ecology to refine their communication skills in order to engage a broader audience. The symposium included presentations and discussions on communication techniques, experiences, and constructive feedback, and provided opportunities for networking with senior professionals in the field. Outcomes       There were 100 students who participated in the SIEYP activities described above. Outcomes include:   The number of IE conferences is limited and young researchers have few opportunities to present their research, or cannot attend without receiving financial support for their travel expenses. SIEYP V, dedicated to students and young researchers, provided an opportunity for meeting, interacting, receiving training, as well as creating the appropriate informal environment for meeting senior researchers and industrial professionals in the field of IE.   The symposium was the first opportunity for approximately 30 new members to meet their peers in the field and introduce themselves, their work, and their visions.   The 2017 SIEYP was unique inasmuch as it was the first to hire professional trainers to offer a tailored teaching event for student and young professionals, as well as shifting the meeting prior to the main ISIE conference, thus creating more opportunities to get to know our peers throughout the main conference.   "Elevator" pitches were practiced and honed by all students and early career researchers. Such an exercise illustrated the difficulties encountered when trying to make ones research undertsandable to lay persons, and forced students to distill the major contributions of their research to the field.   The student-led poster session and "lightning talks", part of the main ISIE-ISSST meeting, was for many attendees their first experience presenting their work to a wide audience of other profesionals.   Other data and satisfaction results are included in the project final report.           The 9th biennial conference of the International Society for Industrial Ecology and 25th meeting of the International Symposium for Sustainable Systems and Technology (ISIE-ISSST) were held jointly for the first time on the campus of the University of Illinois at Chicago June 25-29, 2017.
