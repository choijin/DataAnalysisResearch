<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Virginia State University seeks to expand, adapt and study a cross-disciplinary academic intervention aimed at incoming freshmen that have indicated an interest in STEM with the goal of improving retention and persistence in STEM majors. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and a strong plan for formative and summative evaluation is part of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the implementation of the interventions, the Phenomenological Variable of the Ecological Systems Theory (PVEST) developmental model will be tested for validity.  A variety of personal factors that influence academic behavior will be studied in African American students in order to strengthen the factors that are most associated with successful academic performance.  The project will support 1) formation of successful academic habits, 2) academic identity formation, 3) mitigation of self-handicapping through emotion regulation, and 4) expanding the brand of Virginia State University to include high academic achievement as a key part of the college experience.  Both the intervention and the results of the study of the developmental model should be useful in developing models that support freshman integration into STEM majors at other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This research has been informing a national conversation about solutions for race-related educational disparity in the United States. The conversation started around standardized testing. Recently the Educational Testing Service (ETS), providers of the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) and originators of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), convened the third in a series of meetings aimed at examining the impact of standardized testing, particularly on African American students. There was a general acknowledgement among the participants that while the quality of education differs drastically by zipcode in the United States, the meaning given to standardized test scores is applied uniformly. The interpretation of the standardized test score by school administrators, policy makers, college admission officers and the general public has resulted in an unintended consequence of school and community rankings.  Some school districts are desiginated as "destination" districts with a higher percentage of high school graduates attending college. While others, most often serving students of color, are described in other ways.    There are many reasons why students from various zip codes will perform differently on the same test. One, little studied but important factor is motivation and whether an individual believes that a high score will benefit them in some tangible way.  Over the last five years, our research has shown that motivation is just one component  in an constellation of affective factors  (such as Grit, self-efficacy, self-confidence and academic identity) that impact student success. Findings from our studies have shown that an intervention targeting affective factors resulted in increased persistence in STEM, higher grades and higher graduation rates in five successive cohorts of STEM majors at an HBCU.  Thus, our findings indicated that a focus on affective factors was more effective than providing remediation or tutoring for college freshmen.   As a result of this work, the researchers have not only been asked to contribute to the conversation at ETS but to also help inform interventions at other HBCU's through a proposed HBCU-UP Center at Morehouse College. In addition, several NSF EAGER proposals are in progress that will examine the ways that affective factors can be measured; how attention to affective factors can be implemented, with fidelity, in disparate academic interventions and if training in affective factors related to academic success can be provided in grades K-12.

Dr. Spencer has been recognized by the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Sciences for her lifetime work of seeking to include the experiences of marginalized people within a psycholoogical view of human development.     The research supported by this award has allowed Dr. Spencer's work to not just be recognized but utilized to change the educational outcomes for students of color in the United States.
