<AbstractNarration>The broader/commercial impact of this I-Corps project is a miniaturized, on-demand pharmaceutical manufacturing platform that is scalable and efficient to deploy, highly automated, and fast on product release. The project's aim is to reduce manufacturing and inventory cost and in turn overcome drug shortages. Broadly speaking, the current global pharmaceutical industry is prone to supply chain disruptions, drug shortages, and drug price hikes. One major contributing factor are legacy factories and processes which are limited to intermittent and slow production. Moreover, the outdated infrastructure has weaknesses in terms of product yield and environmental impact. Given the pressure of meeting demand for clinical trial supplies, uncertainties over approvals, and other resource constraints, drug development activities have often only been a series of process scale-ups with less emphasis on innovating on the next-gen manufacturing processes, which can be fundamentally better in all aspects in the long term. Consequently, this project is a significant push towards a more flexible, economical, greener, and, ultimately, more sustainable drug manufacturing infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project explores the commercial potential of a microfluidic-based, continuous-flow pharmaceutical manufacturing device. It represents a paradigm shift from conventional, labor-intensive, batch drug manufacturing processes. Microfluidics (MFDs) are fabricated microchannels which are up to a thousand times smaller than a conventional batch reactor for the same throughput. In turn, MFDs offer up to a thousand times increase in the surface area to volume ratio, allowing for extremely rapid heat and mass transfer and a suite of other advantages; Since the process is continuous, the system can be spatially integrated with state-of-the-art analytical sensors and computer-based controllers, by which the product quality can be assured not only by process design, but also by advanced process control. From a synthesis and purification perspective, MFDs allow for precise handling of previously inaccessible, but highly efficient, pressurized, and often exothermic pathways. This results in greener and safer processes with higher throughput and less waste. On the formulation side, MFDs provide homogeneous crystallization environments, leading to monodisperse crystal size distributions, which leads to superior reproducibility in key product quality such as shape and size.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The key outcomes of this project can be summarized in the form of a breakdown of our BMC. In particular, we narrowed down our value propositions to very specific set of customers and stakeholders and quantify them. These are:  Potential Customers/Stakeholders:   Wholesalers (W)  Contract manufacturers (CM)  Innovators (I)  Retail pharmacists (RP)  Hospital pharmacists (HP)  Pharmacy benefit managers (PBM), and  Insurance provider (IP)   Value Propositions:  Increase pharmaceutical supply chain security for a rare drug substance or product from 1 to 2 suppliers (W/I/CM/HP/RP), Reduce product lead time from months to weeks (W/I/CM/HP/RP), Reduce inventory by ~50% (I/CM), Reduce preparation time for regulatory audit by ~75% (I/CM), Reduce post-processing analysis by ~50% (I), Faster process development by ~50% (I), and Increase safety by reducing footprint by ~50% (I),   Key Activities (W/CM/I/RP/HP):  Develop processes for a targetted specialty medicine Implement quality control in new tech Implement good-manufacturing-protocol (GMP) in new tech   Customer Relationships (W/CM/I/RP/HP):  Get customers: Exhibit at conference and trade shows, personal contacts Keep customers: Build on new technological features to impove upon the most important value propositions, i.e. (1) and (2) Grow customers: Manufacture new specialty medicines, contract manufacturing   Channels:  Direct to a wholesaler (W) Direct to specialty pharmacies (RP/HP)   Key Partners (W/CM/I/RP/HP):  FDA (Emerging Technology Group) Accelerators &amp; Incubators Hardware contract manufacturers Conference organizer   Revenue Streams:  Direct sales to wholesalers ($ per doses delivered) (W) Direct sales to specialty pharmacies ($ per doses delivered) (RP/HP) Financial contract per manufacturing campaign (CM/I)   We have not acquired sufficient insights to expand on the Cost Structure part of our BMC.  At the end of 6 weeks, we believed we still had a product-market fit and continued our work on:  interviewing more stakeholders in another customer segment, namely the Innovators further developing our technology in-house according to what we now know what the either the Innovator and the Wholesaler wants evaluating other avenues for customer adoption, in the form of a non-profit and low-profit liability company, to create impact on the current pharmaceutical ecosystem using the developed technology.   Beyond this project, we will continue our work in following specific manners:  Continue with interviewing potential customers and stakeholders within the pharmaceutical space,   Continue with interviewing potential customers and stakeholders within the educational space,   Populate a new BMC accounting for the new customer segments           Last Modified: 02/26/2019       Submitted by: Zoltan Nagy]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
