<AbstractNarration>Research relies on access to carefully archived data, and critical tools, including visualizations, analytic models,and computer code.   The Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) program has reached a juncture in the production of research output.  This project builds a central repository where the products from SciSIP's publicly funded research are available to be accessed, appreciated and augmented.  Promoting the generation and availability of publicly funded data and research tools is a key way to accomplish the mission of the SciSIP program, which is to produce and provide high quality, policy-relevant research to policymakers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal builds a platform that publicizes SciSIP research and makes data, tools and code available for download.  The objective is to facilitate scholarly exchanges between SciSIP award recipients and foster intellectual exchange among funded researchers of the SciSIP program and policy practitioners.</AbstractNarration>
