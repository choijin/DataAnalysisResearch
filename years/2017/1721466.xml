<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will use shape-morphing electroactive polymers (EAPs), also known as synthetic muscle, to provide for a streamlined and very life-like way of configuring motion, which doesn't require motors, pulleys, gears, or cables like traditional mechanical based motion.  The power to operate these EAPs is easily provided by electric input, including using off the shelf commercially available batteries.  In addition to the focus of this proposal on adjustable liners, these EAPs could mend the gap between form and function for life-like prostheses.  As impact attenuating and sensing materials, these EAPs could be developed to offer solutions for protective equipment and provide life-like motion and control for robotics.  This proposal is focused on transforming the standard of care for people who have lost limbs or were born without fully developed limbs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project promises to transform the standard of care for people who have lost limbs or were born without fully developed limbs.  Amputees using mechanically driven prostheses often experience increasing pain, as well as risk of skin breakdown and severe infections, even over the course of daily use, due to normal anatomical changes in the limb that are not accommodated by the static, rigid socket of their prosthetic device. Typically, most amputees' residual limbs shrink over the course of any given day, much like peoples' foot size changes from morning to evening.  This proposed work aims to resolve the inadequacies of current prosthetic socket fit by using flexible pads of EAP based synthetic muscle, built into prosthetic liners, to automatically respond to changes in patient anatomy and ensure a continuously proper socket fit throughout the day.  With the additional ability to sense pressure, these EAPs can also serve as a diagnostic tool to prevent skin breakdown. The prosthetic device and human should move as one, effortlessly and naturally.  This proposal will develop self-adjusting prosthetic liners that responds to residual limb changes, maintaining a comfortable dynamic perfect fit throughout the day, to allow the patient to easily and comfortably engage in an active lifestyle.</AbstractNarration>

These liners are usually worn with prosthetic cotton socks for volume adjustments. &nbsp;A gap often forms between the liner and the hard socket shell of the prosthetic device as the residual limb shrinks over the day (typical case), which the amputee addresses by adding more layers of socks between the liner and the hard shell. &nbsp;The skin of the human leg does not have many nerves, so even amputees without health complications often do not notice a poor fit until there is a problem.&nbsp; For a diabetic patient with sensory loss (neuropathy), this problem is exacerbated. &nbsp;If the amputee fails to notice that the fit is becoming too loose or too tight, significant tissue damage can occur.&nbsp; This overall project, Phase I followed by Phase II, aims to resolve the inadequacies of current prosthetic socket fit by using flexible pads of Ras Labs&rsquo; EAPs built into prosthetic liners to automatically respond to changes in an amputee&rsquo;s anatomy and ensure a continuously perfect socket fit without the need for direct action or surveillance by the amputee customer.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ras Labs makes Synthetic Muscle&trade;, which is a class of EAP based materials and actuators that contract and expand at low voltage, sense pressure, and attenuate impact. &nbsp;These unique EAPs expand and contract in response to low voltage, and are durable, withstanding 3,000,000 cycles of variable mechanical pressure.&nbsp; Ras Labs&rsquo; core EAP technology sounds complex, but in actual use will be very user friendly.&nbsp; The EAP pads in the adjustable liner will contract overnight for ease of donning in the morning.&nbsp; During the day, the EAP pads in strategic locations within the liner will then expand to their neutral state at 0 V, maintaining proper fit, or driven through further expansion of the EAP pads as needed with a simple switch connected to a small battery pack.&nbsp; The batteries will then recharge overnight during the contraction cycle and are expected to last all the next day during the return to neutral state or to a further expanded state.&nbsp; By integrating these EAP based pad systems into existing prosthetic liners, health care costs will be reduced by decreasing the number of infections and new sockets made for amputees.&nbsp; In addition to the completed specific aims, further research characterizing the EAPs&rsquo; sensing capabilities was performed.&nbsp; In addition to shape-morphing, Ras Labs&rsquo; EAPs also intrinsically sense pressure. &nbsp;Embedded sensing in the EAP pad design will allow for volumetric adjustments to occur, automatically, by the shape-morphing EAP pads serving dual use as sensors to monitor pressure in the prosthetic socket for unprecedented continual perfect fit. &nbsp;EAP sensing in the prosthetic liner will be enormously helpful.&nbsp; Once pain occurs, tissue damage has already begun.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ras Labs&rsquo; robust, patented EAPs are the first in prosthetics to actively expand and contract at low voltages. &nbsp;This research and development promises to transform the standard of care for amputees and people born without fully developed limbs.&nbsp; These EAPs will also potentially provide robots with muscle-like motion and tactile feedback for controlled grip though fingertip-like EAP based sensors in robotic grippers and end effectors.&nbsp; Ras Labs&rsquo; EAPs can sense and shape-morph to improve prosthetics, advance robotic grip control, increase the comfort and reduce the cost of ear protection, and monitor pressure and impact. &nbsp;This research and development led to publications, presentations, and patent applications. &nbsp;The principal investigator, already a published author and global leader in EAPs, has another book contract with publisher Springer on electroactivity in polymeric materials. &nbsp;This National Science Foundation Phase I Award for the Adjustable Prosthetic Liners Using Contractile Polymers Project was extremely interdisciplinary and advanced Ras Labs' shape-morphing sensing EAP technology, providing insights to potential applications of these novel EAPs in the fields of chemistry, robots and safe cobots (collaborative robots), physics, electrical and mechanical engineering, and the emerging field of electroactive polymers and actuators.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/20/2018<br>      Modified by: Lenore&nbsp;Rasmussen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721466/1721466_10500705_1532121102318_IMG_1089--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721466/1721466_10500705_1532121102318_IMG_1089--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Ras Labs' EAP pad systems in prototype prosthetic liner"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721466/1721466_10500705_1532121102318_IMG_1089--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Ras Labs' EAP pad systems in prototype prosthetic liner"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Ras Labs' EAP pad systems in strategic locations of the final Phase I prototype liner</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ras Labs</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Lenore&nbsp;Rasmussen</div> <div class="imageTitle">Ras Labs' EAP pad systems in prototype prosthetic liner</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721466/1721466_10500705_1532120921816_ScanLRbook--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721466/1721466_10500705_1532120921816_ScanLRbook--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Electroactivity in Polymeric Materials"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721466/1721466_10500705_1532120921816_ScanLRbook--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Electroactivity in Polymeric Materials"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">L.
