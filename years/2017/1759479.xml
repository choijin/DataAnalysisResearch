<AbstractNarration>This research is for data collection, quality control, archive and preliminary analysis of data collected during Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.  Hurricane Harvey was the first major hurricane landfall in the United States since 2005 and is one of the very few Category 4 hurricane landfalls in the modern weather radar era.  The researchers plan to use the unprecedented observations from these hurricanes to address questions related to how hurricane dynamics impact wind and rainfall during landfall.  The research has direct relevance to improving public safety by providing data to forecasters, emergency managers and engineers.  The grant is in response to the NSF Dear Colleague Letter on Hurricane Harvey research (NSF 17-128).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will begin quality control, archiving and initial analysis of Hurricane Harvey data and to deploy the dual-polarimetric SMART-R radar and additional surface instrumentation to the landfall of Hurricane Irma.  The focus of the research from Harvey and Irma will be on the role of Vortex Rossby Waves (VRWs) and spiral rainbands.  The research team will address four topics:  1) Collect observations to address the coupling between the boundary layer and circulations aloft during hurricane landfall, 2) Determine the contribution of vortex Rossby wave-driven rain bands to rainfall during landfall, 3) Provide additional observations to examine the role of inward propagating asymmetries on the development and evolution of meso- and miso-scale vortices in the inner eyewall region of landfalling hurricanes, and 4) Collect observations needed to document the environment of outer rainbands to improve forecasts of tornadic storms within landfalling tropical cyclones.</AbstractNarration>

This project supported deployment of the University of Oklahoma Shared Mobile Atmospheric Research and Teaching (SMART) radar during the landfall of hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

The SMART radar observations were combined with the Corpus Christi, TX National Weather Service radar to produce near-surface wind fields every 5 minutes for an 8 hour period over a roughly 60 mile by 60 mile area near Corpus Christi, TX during the time of Harvey's landfall.  This is the first time that wind retrievals over such a large area for such a long time have been constructed using ground-based Doppler radars during the landfall of a major hurricane.  The grid spacing in the analysis domain is about 0.5 mile by 0.5 mile.     The radar winds were projected to the surface and validated against a network of anemometers, yielding close agreement. The analysis showed Harvey was, at most, a Category 3 (sustained winds between 50-58 m s-1) strength storm at landfall. Additionally, perturbations along the inner edge of the eyewall, similar to the parent circulation of tornadic storms, led to the strongest flow observed near the surface and contributed to the most significant wind damage associated with Harvey's landfall.     An overview of the Harvey landfall experiment was published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society in 2019.  Results of the wind analysis supported by this grant were published in the Geophysical Research Letters in 2019.  Finally, the raw data, the quality controlled data, and the wind retrievals were published in the Geophysical Data Journal in 2019 and archived at Zenodo (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.3232957).  These data will contribute to further wind engineering analysis of Harvey?s damage and will contribute to refining and validating computer models of hurricanes at landfall.  Through a partnership with AT&amp;T and The Weather Channel, the data were shared in near real-time with the Office of Federal Coordinator in Meteorology and made available to numerous federal agencies.  The results of this research were presented at the National Hurricane Center during summer 2019.   This grants supported one PhD graduate student, two undergraduate students, a Data Scientist, and the Principle Investigator.  It also provided support for the maintenance and deployment of the C-band dual-polarimetric mobile SMART radar.  Collaborations supported, in part, by this grant include scientists from the National Severe Storms Laboratory, the National Hurricane Center, the National Hurricane Research Division, Purdue University, Texas Tech University, and the University of Florida-Gainesville.
