<AbstractNarration>This project will support an educational symposium on "Community College and University Partnerships as Catalysts for Promoting Materials Science Education" at the 2017 Materials Research Society Conference. This symposium will be held concurrently with technical sessions and will provide an overview of materials science education as a function of current partnerships among community colleges, secondary schools, universities, professional societies and businesses. The event will also promote discussions among materials scientists and engineers, teachers, faculty and administrators representing secondary and higher education institutions. The symposium will focus on partnership strategies and best practices currently in use to motivate and provide guidance for current and future materials scientists and engineers. Through these discussions, attendees will gain insight into the integration of partnership elements such as funding, human and equipment resources, institutional commitments, teacher and faculty interactions, and development of academic pathways to build student interest. At the conclusion, a closing session will be held to summarize strategies, recommendations and outline a series of meetings to discuss next steps for those who have an interest in moving forward with exploring partnerships.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The symposium committee extended invitations to MRS members and representatives from the United States, Austria, Ireland and Greece to discuss the roles of partnerships and collaborations relating to the incorporation of materials science education at the university lower division institutions and secondary educational institutions.  Symposium speakers represented faculty, administrators, graduate students and representatives from industry.  Topics included model partnerships, the role of funding agencies, state legislatures, human and equipment resources, institutional commitments, teacher and faculty interactions, and development of academic and career transitions for students as they build upon their interests in materials science, and transition from the community college to four-year programs and into the workforce.   Presenters, to differing degrees, addressed the "how and why" of effective and innovative partnerships and provided regional, national and international perspectives on:  1.      The "disruptive factors", merits and the challenges incurred in forming and stewardship of materials education partnerships and programs  2.      The interrelationship among academic track and technician track programs  3.      The ideas, significant events, mutual benefits, and cross-institutional perceptions that served as the pre-cursors for the creating partnerships and comments on stewardship of the institutional and teacher/faculty partnerships  4.      Best practices developed and used to promote materials education across the K-16 educational continuum.      The symposium was opened by the lead symposium organizing committee member, Bart Sheinberg, who acknowledged MRS staff members and funding provided to support the invited speakers by the National Science Foundation (DUE 1748262), JEOL USA, private donations and the Materials Research Society. Members of the symposium organizing committee:    &middot;         Ashok Agrawal, American Society for Engineering Education (Washington DC)  &middot;         Eva Campo, National Science Foundation (Alexandria, VA)  &middot;         Anique Olivier-Mason, Brandeis University (Waltham/Boston, MA)  &middot;         Bartlett Sheinberg, Houston Community College (TX) and,  &middot;         Barbara Washburn, Springfield Technical Community College (MA)      The Symposium concluded with remarks from Sheinberg and members of the symposium committee.    &middot;         Thanks to MRS and each of the funders who provided support to invited speakers and community college faculty and members of the symposium committee  &middot;         Materials science is no longer a topic of interest only to upper division students. It is an important field of study for motivating students, teachers, and faculty, across the educational spectrum and generating academic and technical career pathways  &middot;         Partnerships among federal and state agencies, state legislatures, educational institutions, organizations and business &amp; industry provide a broad array of financial and equipment resources available to "drive" student completion across these pathways and into careers  &middot;         Sheinberg, in collaboration with the other symposium team members and representatives from the Materials Research Society, will consider possible "next steps" for further discussion of symposium topics through a future webinar or meeting.
