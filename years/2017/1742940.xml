<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the 2017 Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar on "Soft Condensed Matter Physics: In and out of equilibrium". The award is jointly funded by the CMP and CMMT programs in the Division of Materials Research. This Gordon Research Conference will bring together leading scientists from a variety of fields in a collegial atmosphere that supports open discussion to discuss issues at the cutting edge of soft matter physics. This meeting will focus on two topics at the forefront of Soft Condensed Matter Physics: the mechanisms lead to self organization of materials though both thermal and athermal processes. Many The conference will focus on recent advances in the design of colloidal and liquid crystalline materials. An equally important goal is to illustrate growing connections between soft matter physics and related interdisciplinary fields, including those of biology, mathematical topology, fluid dynamics, nanotechnology and material science. In addition, this conference will be preceded by a Gordon Research Seminar that provides a unique opportunity for young researchers to share in the GRC experience and build informal networks with their peers.</AbstractNarration>
