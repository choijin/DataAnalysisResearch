<AbstractNarration>Scientific research in all disciplines funded by the National Science Foundation is producing increasing volumes of data, requiring correspondingly increased resources for data storage and analysis. At the same time, requirements for public access to data collected using federal funds are creating greater demands for data repositories. Emerging research themes require access to an increasing variety of data types. These trends, along with associated shifts in expectations, are creating new challenges for the data repository&lt;br/&gt;community in an increasingly uncertain funding environment.  This workshop will provide an opportunity for data repository leaders to: 1) enhance their knowledge of sustainability planning, 2) exchange information about how they currently address sustainability, and 3) learn tools and skills to enhance the sustainability of their data collections. The process guide, a key product of the workshop, will promote discussion and consideration of sustainability issues and will serve as a resource for the data repository community as a whole.</AbstractNarration>
