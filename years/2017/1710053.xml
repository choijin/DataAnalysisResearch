<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical:&lt;br/&gt;The work under this award will reveal the fundamental principles of sequence and structure for pH-triggered and pH-insensitive peptides that cause macromolecule-sized destabilization of membranes, allowing passage of macromolecules at very low concentrations. This basic knowledge is currently lacking, and is a roadblock in the design of membrane-active peptides with broad applicability. The basic knowledge that will be gained through this work will be a significant advancement in the field of membrane-active peptides. The activity that will be studied here with this award, macromolecular-sized pore formation, has not been explored thus far and its fundamental principles and mechanism of actions are unknown. Yet, it has many potential applications in biotechnology and medicine. Success in this work may enable the rational design and preparation of membrane active peptides for drug delivery and biosensing, as well as for cancer therapies, anti-viral and anti-bacterial treatments, and in agriculture for the controlled and effective release of insecticides and fungicides at very low doses.  The proposed research and outreach activities will promote interest in science, exchange of knowledge, and create synergistic interactions between students and researchers at different levels in different disciplines.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to characterize peptides that enable macromolecules to bypass the barrier of the plasma membrane. This collaborative effort by three investigators, an engineer, a physicist and a biochemist, will delineate the sequence-structure-function relationships of two families of peptides that form large macromolecule-sized pores in bilayers at low concentrations, one of which is triggered to act only at pH less than 6.0. While such behavior is extremely rare, or perhaps non-existent in nature, the investigators have discovered, by high-throughput screening, peptides with these properties. By comparing the sequences, functions and structures of these peptides, they will uncover the fundamental principles behind the unique activity of these families. The researchers will characterize the macromolecular permeabilization by pH-insensitive and pH sensitive pore formers by performing circular dichroism, fluorescence, and atomic force microscopy measurements.  They will learn how the physical properties of the lipid bilayer affect the function of the two classes of peptides, and will test specific mechanistic hypotheses with sequence variations. The work will provide many research and outreach opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students, launching many new careers in science. This award by the Biomaterials Program of the Division of Materials Research in the Directorate for Physical and Mathematical Sciences (the managing program), is co-funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ OUTCOMES  The three labs involved in this work have continued to work cooperatively and productively with regular Skype meetings and planning sessions. Here the work done in the Wimley lab at Tulane University will be discussed. Two directions have been pursued in the Wimley laboratory.  1)  PhD Student Leisheng Sun has studied the mechanism of macrolittin permeabilization of lipid vesicles to macromolecules, and especially the dependence of macromolecular poration on lipid composition and membrane properties. Leisheng’s results are described in more detail; in Key Outcomes, below. His work has been published in one manuscript in PNAS (middle author) and he is writing two first author manuscripts describing recent results.  2) Phd student Eric Wu  has been engineering the pH sensitive pHD peptides for macromolecular poration activity under novel conditions. Based on a hypothesis generated by Sarah Kim at Johns Hopkins, Eric Wu has been lipidating the PhD peptides  on their N- and C-termini using linear C6, C12 and C18 acyl chains as well as cholesterol. N-terminal lipidation is by succinamidyl ester reaction, and C-terminal acylation is by disulfide bond formation with a C-terminal cysteine.  Eric’s results are described in Key Outcomes below. Eric has published one paper (co-first author) and has a revised first author paper under review in the Journal of Physical Chemistry B.  Eric has also been measuring the activity of the pHD peptides in biological membranes with an emphasis on endosomal membranes.  All the students worked at the interface of  materials science,  chemistry, and biology, studying the activity of membrane active peptides in model systems and in cells. They were trained in state-of-the-art peptides chemistry techniques and characterization techniques such as spectroscopy and microscopy.  They students had multiple opportunities to present their research at their home institutions and at national meetings such as the Biophysical Society Annual meeting. Typically, the students presented posters as first authors or gave oral presentations. They interacted with  other scientists and exchanged ideas with their peers, thus advancing their networking and career opportunities.  The careers of Eric Wu and Leisheng Sun at Tulane are developing as expected.  Eric has published two papers and is approaching the preliminary oral exam stage of his PhD studies.  Leisheng has published one paper and is writing a second one;  he will  have his prelim exams next year.       Last Modified: 01/25/2021       Submitted by: William C Wimley]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
