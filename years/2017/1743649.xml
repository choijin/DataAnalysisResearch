<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the creation of a platform technology with a rapidly deployable, motorized arm that can be used wherever rapid, precise positioning of objects is required.  There are many potential medical, commercial, industrial, and consumer applications for the technology.  In the industrial sector there are needs to position and hold for assembly, soldering, gluing, welding, or metrology.  The device can also support needs for mechanical assistance during disassembly and re-assembly in maintenance operations.  Consumer applications include holding tablets, books, or laptops and adjustable workbench arms.  Medical applications include surgical retraction and surgical device or tool holding, including laparoscopic instruments.  The first target application in development is an abdominal surgical retraction system that can be deployed and/or adjusted within seconds.  A rapidly deployable retractor reduces operating room and anesthesia times.  Further, since the retractor arm is disposable, the risk of infection is reduced, and the need for cleaning, sterilization, and maintenance is eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team has developed a device that consists of a motorized base with an attached flexible arm that can be locked into place and/or adjusted in seconds at the push and release of a button.  Various grippers can be attached to the end of the arm to firmly and steadily grasp or support an object at any orientation.  The speed and flexibility of these devices provide advantages over slower, manually operated fixtures, especially when working in and around complex geometries or fragile environments.  The intellectual property consists of a unique joint surface that permits the mechanical arm to be made much longer and stronger than competing systems.  A first generation system that operates as a surgical retractor was built and demonstrated before surgeons in mock scenario in a hospital operating room.  It was shown to be capable of providing adequate retraction force for abdominal surgeries.</AbstractNarration>
