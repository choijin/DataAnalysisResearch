<AbstractNarration>The Office of Polar Programs has been funding substantial scientific activities at Summit Station, Greenland (72°N 38°W, 3250 meters above sea level), for over twenty years. Summit is the only high-elevation, free-tropospheric, inland environmental observatory in the Arctic which is currently manned throughout the year. Understanding the current and developing Arctic science questions and how research conducted at Summit Station can address those questions plays an important role in determining science program priorities and operational plans for Summit Station. Goals for this 1.5-day workshop include; A) elucidating the current state of Summit Station measurements, B) illustrating the current uses of the data, C) defining the utility of the year-round data that is collected in the context of Arctic science, and D) determining the variability of wintertime parameters and the accuracy to which they must be monitored for scientific analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be held at NSF and bring together various stakeholders and potential scientific users of data collected at Summit Station, as well as broader Arctic Scientists, to consider Summit Station?s future role in Arctic research.  The intellectual merit of the proposal will be realized in defining the important science questions that can be addressed by research at Summit Station and defining the measurements and accuracies needed for year-round measurements to answer those questions. Broader impacts will be realized through the workshop report on the current state and applications of Summit Station data that will include community-based recommendations on future science goals and measurements for Summit Station.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The Summit Station Science Summit was held March 28-29, 2017 in Arlington, VA to update scientific vision and direction for Summit.  A multidisciplinary group of about 30 scientists, including remote participants, reviewed science activities at Summit, defined future scientific research questions and goals, and made community-based recommendations on science-enabling future scenarios and governance.      The group emphasized that Summit?s high latitude, high altitude site that lacks local influences, serves as a flagship for process-based scientific discovery ranging from questions about the outer reaches of space to the bedrock below the Greenland ice sheet and all points in between. Additionally, the group emphasized that Summit remains the only site on the Greenland ice sheet with a long enough history of climatologic, atmospheric and glaciological measurements to understand, model, and place current changes in a broader context.  Consensus encouraged funding agencies to recognize the vital importance of the climate-length records collected at Summit to a broad swath of the scientific research and modeling communities and encouraged governance practices be established to make Summit a protected site, similar in stature to the Long Term Ecological Research Sites, with a core set of community measurements.  These measurements, including temperature, accumulation, cloud properties, aerosol concentrations and others, would directly benefit society by documenting current Arctic climate and by providing constraints on global predictions of sea level rise.   It was determined that Summit is scientifically powerful because it leverages a suite of scientific measurements, co-located over time and at one point in space, allowing researchers to go beyond their own study and put their research into the larger climate perspective.   A full report from the meeting can be found here (http://www.geosummit.org/?p=699) and News article in the American Geophysical Union?s EOS here (https://eos.org/meeting-reports/envisioning-and-sustaining-science-at-summit-station-greenland).
