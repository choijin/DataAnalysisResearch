<AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative conference proposal from the four comprehensive universities in the state of Georgia: Georgia Southern University, Kennesaw State University, University of West Georgia, and Valdosta State University. The goal of the conference workshop proposal is to bring these four institutions together to discuss, plan, and implement changes to improve undergraduate STEM education across the state. This conference will focus on four strands: gateway courses, faculty teaching and learning, education research, and undergraduate research. These four topics are critical to the success of students and their faculties at these institutions. A theme of the meeting is to establish collaboration and partnerships among the faculties of these institutions, so that they can share best practices, initiate change, and study the impact of change on recruitment, retention, and graduation rates. By focusing the efforts of these four institutions with guidance from the University System of Georgia, the workshop outcomes may reach a broad spectrum of STEM faculty (and thereby students) across the state, to address the low persistence of students who begin as STEM majors in college. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the workshop conference will establish plans to improve undergraduate STEM education and to increase research opportunities at these institutions for undergraduate students. Participants will plan how to evaluate the effectiveness of these efforts, particularly in increasing the persistence of STEM majors to graduation. Focusing on all four of Georgia's comprehensive universities is unique in the sense that these institutions aspire to balance research, teaching, and service expectations to a greater degree than research and liberal arts institutions. There is widespread agreement that the comprehensive universities in Georgia should be working jointly to improve our undergraduate STEM retention, progression, and graduation and this conference workshop will serve to initiate this joint work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A two-day symposium was held in Savannah, GA on March 20-21, 2019 with representation from all four comprehensive universitites (Valdosta State University, Georgia Southern University, Kennesaw State University, and the University of West Georgia) within the University System of Georgia. This conference provided opportunities for faculty, department chairs, deans, members of Academic Affairs, and campus Centers for Teaching Excellence to engage in meaningful dialogue across disciplines and institutions concerning undergraduate STEM student admission, retention, and completion.  At the end of the symposium, it was evident that the event was very successful based on the summaries provided by representatives from each institution present. The following are significant outcomes/understandings from the project.  A greater understanding of each institution was realized. It became clear that each is doing positive, though sometimes very different, activities to address the issues of recruiting, retaining, and graduating STEM students. Faculty recognize the issues and are proactive in trying many different things in the classroom. However, the activities are uncoordinated, relatively unknown by their direct supervisors (department chairs), and effectiveness data are generally not collected. Therefore, it is not possible to definitely determine what might be having a positive impact on student achievement. There is a general resistance to using the Centers for Teaching Excellence on each campus for a wide variety of reasons. It is considered that these Centers should take the lead in training, leading, and supporting faculty in research-based teaching and classroom activities and student support rather than faculty be dictated to make changes by the administration. Undergraduate research, experiential learning, active classrooms, and the use of learning assistants were universally identified as effective techniques to engage and support students, yet their implementation across STEM fields within each university was "hit or miss" at best. Recent annual budget reductions have caused most faculty to be assigned heavy teaching and advising loads. These added responsibilities curtail the desire to try new things in the classroom because of the time it takes to employ a new teaching strategy. There is little incentive for faculty to change current classroom activities since innovation and creativity are not part of annual reviews or tenure and promotion criteria.  STEM department chairs are hesitant to formally ask faculty to modify their teaching activities due to their understanding of faculty academic freedom.   Finally, there was overwhelming agreement that the symposium was successful. The open channel of communication and the sharing of ideas could only help the challenges each institution faces. Comprehensive universities are caught between high research expectations and the demand to demonstrate effective teaching within student populations that are increasingly first generation college attendees. These challenges are unique to the comprehensives and so continued collaboration and sharing of ideas in the future was strongly encouraged. In fact, based on the overall success of the symposium, it was suggested that future meetings would even be more effective if they were entirely discipline specific. The attendees endorsed the idea of having, for example, a symposium centered on mathematics one year, another on biology, etc. Assembling a critical mass of subjhect specific faculty and administrators would be more productive for the targeted group.
