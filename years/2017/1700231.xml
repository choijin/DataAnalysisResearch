<AbstractNarration>The proposal requests funding to help defray the expenses of U.S. participants in the conference "Hilbert Function Spaces 2017" that will be held at a facility of the University of Milan in Gargnano, Italy from May 29 - June 2, 2017. Additional information is available on the conference website https://events.unibo.it/hfs2017&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the conference will be on Operator Theory, Function Theory, and Harmonic Analysis and their applications. These topics in pure mathematics are important, for example, in optimization, engineering, quantum physics, and signal theory. It is important that the next generation of U.S. researchers be informed of the state-of-the art and future of this field. This award will enable the participation of graduate students, junior researchers, underrepresented groups and other U.S. based researchers without support to participate in this meeting. This program will have significant impact in the field of function spaces and the future careers of junior investigators.</AbstractNarration>
