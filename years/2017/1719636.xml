<AbstractNarration>This project will support attendance of young faculty, under-represented minority scientists, PUI faculty, along with graduate students and post-docs at the 2017 Organellar Channels and Transporters conference to be held in West Dover, Vermont, July 30-Aug 4, 2017. The meeting will consist of short talks, poster sessions, communal dining, and conversations that will provide ample opportunity for sharing latest research results and for exploring collaborative possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organellar channels and transporters play essential roles in both the function of individual intracellular compartments and also how the activities of these compartments are coordinated and integrated into cellular function.  The Broader Impacts of this work involves both the importance of the topic to a range of organisms including both plants and animals, as well as the training of new scientist to pursue research in these emerging fields.  Sessions will be developed to provide opportunities for young researchers to present their work. The primary purposes of this conference are to promote discussion between scientists with common professional interests, including those from non-research-intensive colleges and universities, to foster the exchange of ideas from advanced aspects of their field, and to enable scientific collaborations to evolve in new directions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2nd Gordon Research Conference on Organellar Channels and transporters was dedicated to ion channels and transporters of intracellular membranes, including mitochondria, endosomes, lysosomes, vacuoles, endoplasmic reticulum, nuclei, peroxisomes and chloroplasts, in both animals and plants.  This new GRC series represents the only conference solely dedicated to multidisciplinary studies of intracellular membrane transport proteins from plants and animals.  It came at an exciting time of this fast-developing field, which is attracting an expanding group of scientists interested in organelle membrane biology.  This dedicated conference provided a unquie opportunity for animal and plant scientists working on different organelles to share data and ideas to help addressing current challenges of organelle biology, foster collaborations, and identify new ways to treat common and and rare diseases based on better understanding of mechanisms of ion/metabolite transport in various organelles.  Topics of the conference included molecular identification, biophysical characterization, structure, physiological relevance, regulation, discovery of interaction partners, targeting and pharmacology.  A special session focused on how dysfunctional ion/metabolite transport in organelles leads to common and rare human diseases, and how the activity of organellar channels/transporters can be manipulated to treat them. A session was dedicated to emerging methodologies employed to unravel organellar ion fluxes with novel probes and another to the roles of channels/transporters in cross-talks between different organelles.  Each session included slots for speakers (especially for early career investigators) selected from abstracts as well as late-breaking research.  Poster session further enriched and stimulated interactions between participants and research communities.          Last Modified: 10/02/2017       Submitted by: Michael X Zhu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
