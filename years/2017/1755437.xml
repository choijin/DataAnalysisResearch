<AbstractNarration>In an era when leaders from the White House to Silicon Valley tech giants portray engineering as critical to America's competitiveness - and are calling upon universities to graduate a bigger, broader group of engineers - institutions of higher education struggle to align strategies and actions with achievement of these outcomes. The research is quite clear about the value of diversity to innovation and invention. The wellsprings of creativity do not flow from a single tap. Rather, they lie in the different perspectives, backgrounds and talents that individuals bring to a team. However, despite decades of efforts and millions of dollars in federal funding, the needle has barely moved in terms of the percentages of women and underrepresented minority students (African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans) earning engineering degrees. In 2016, women earned 19.9 percent of engineering bachelor's degrees awarded in the U.S. A decade earlier, the proportion was 19.3 percent. Hispanic students earned 10.7% of engineering degrees. Over the same period, the proportion of engineering bachelor's degrees earned by African Americans fell to 4 percent from 5 percent. Key to increasing the number and percentage of degrees awarded to underrepresented students is to dramatically increase the completion rates of these groups.  The National Society of Black Engineers is convening a conference for 100 Deans of ABET-accredited engineering schools for the purpose of sharing research on the most effective institutional interventions, core strategies, and critical concepts in retaining and graduating underrepresented minorities in engineering bachelor's degree programs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Symposium for Engineering School Deans to Increase the Retention of Women and Underrepresented Minority Students will address barriers to retention by bringing the wealth of research findings that are currently available to the academic leaders of university engineering department, i.e., those who are in the strongest position to move change forward in increasing retention. NSBE compiled a systematic synthesis of research available on successful retention strategies for underrepresented students into a white paper, Paving the Way: Institutional Interventions for Academic Excellence and Success in Engineering (Reid, Ross, &amp; Yates, 2015). The researchers interviewed university administrators with experience in successfully graduating underrepresented minority (URM) students in engineering and reviewed research studies about the interventions. Based on this prodigious body of knowledge, NSBE identified a list of interventions that have proven to facilitate the success of underrepresented students in engineering. The Plenary and breakout sessions will be organized around successful interventions and concepts that are necessary to inform these interventions:  1) Institution or Department Level Interventions: institutional leadership engagement; climate; and faculty development; 2) Core Strategies:  summer bridge programs, scholar cohort programs; collaborative learning environments; early alert systems; and facilitated study groups; 3) Critical Concepts: self-efficacy; and identity. Session presenters and keynote speakers will be invited from the universities that have implemented successful programs in the topic areas.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The<em> URM (Underrepresented Minority) Student Success Symposium, cohosted by </em>the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), the National Association of Multicultural Engineering Program Advocates (NAMEPA), and the American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) from June 22-24, 2018 for Deans and Diversity Administrators of ABET-accredited engineering schools, operationalized the wealth of research findings about effective practices in URM student retention to representatives of 38 university engineering departments, i.e., those who are in the strongest position to move change forward in increasing retention. Attendees heard presentations from institutions that lead the nation in developing new strategies and programs or expanding current programs on self-efficacy and engineering identity, early alert systems, living and learning communities, summer bridge programs, institutional leadership, faculty development, campus climate, scholar cohorts, and facilitated study groups. They gained specific research-based tools identified in the <em>NSBE Student Retention Toolkit</em> to inform ongoing improvement efforts.</p> <p>From surveys administered before, during and after the Symposium, NSBE now has data about current retention programs at the participating institutions. Participants have shared learnings from the Symposium with work groups or faculty since returning to their home institutions. Survey data also indicates that participants would like to see more Deans and other high-level university leaders engaged in understanding what programs and activities are necessary to significantly increase URM retention and completion rates in engineering.&nbsp;</p> <p>One of the critical engagement strategies for retention is implementing actionable steps to gain support from institutional leadership and other allies to lead engineering diversity efforts. When engaged, institutional decision-makers are more likely to commit resources to programs that result in success for underrepresented students.<em> </em>Moreover, research studies have shown that institutional change often involves a distributed leadership or network model, including middle-managers (department chairs), faculty, directors and managers of student affairs, as well as other champions across campus (Kezar et al.,2008; Rudhumbu, 2015; Bryman, 2007). Therefore, a key outcome of the conference is the dissemination of research-based information about retention strategies to Deans and middle managers who could become champions for change in their university engineering departments.&nbsp;</p> <p>Another key outcome is that the Symposium served as an informal ?pilot? and model for future activities of NSBE and the 50k Coalition to increase URM student retention. The 50k Coalition is a Collective Impact collaborative led by the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES), the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), and the Society of Women Engineers (SWE). &nbsp;The Coalition plans to build on the foundational work of its NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch pilot (DDLP #1649355) to deploy proven strategies for increasing the numbers of URM and women engineering graduates: Targeted recruitment and admissions; integrated first-year program experiences (IFYE) which incorporates the retention strategies identified in the <em>NSBE Student Retention Toolkit</em>; engineering society engagement; and capacity building of Multicultural and Women in Engineering Programs. One of the Coalition?s two working groups, the Undergraduate Student Support and Retention Action Network Group will funnel the learnings of the <em>Toolkit</em> and the findings from the Symposium evaluation into its future discussions and activities. The 50k Coalition?s strategic plan includes producing research-based white papers and/or conference proceedings, toolkits, strategy reports and briefs which will be disseminated across the stakeholder community of university engineering programs, professional societies, and member corporations, and thereby scaling up the impact of these systems-change efforts nationwide.</p> <p>Bryman, A.
