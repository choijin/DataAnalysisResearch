<AbstractNarration>Shale gas deposits contain enormous quantities of natural gas.  Transporting low density natural gas from remote shale deposit locations to its point of use is often uneconomical, so this "stranded gas" may be flared or burned for energy recovery on site, circumventing the need for transport.  Increasing the accessibility of this domestic energy supply would decrease fuel prices, increase energy security, and reduce the environmental footprint of this resource.  One strategy is to extract the larger fuel molecules from natural gas, and compress them into an easily transportable dense liquid.  The majority of natural gas is methane, though, which requires high energy to compress into liquid form. Thus, a promising alternative strategy is the chemical conversion of gaseous methane into liquid methanol. However, this chemical conversion is extremely difficult using known methods, and the remote location of the shale deposits relative to chemical manufacturing facilities increases the challenge.  This research project seeks to develop novel electrochemical catalysts that will more efficiently, effectively, and economically convert stranded gaseous methane into liquid methanol.  Such methods are compatible with small-scale, modular, manufacturing units that are deployable to remote locations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project rationalizes the use of surface orientation and adatom decoration of electrocatalysts to promote electrocatalytic oxidation of methane to methanol. The use of high-index facets of metallic catalysts and the role of mobile oxygen interstitials on oxide supports is being explored. The potential for higher-index planes to lower the activation barrier for methane adsorption and partial oxidation is being examined using Ni (310) and Ni (760). In-situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy coupled with impedance spectroscopy is being used to probe the role of surface facets, nonstoichiometry, and adsorption sites in the activated chemisorption and transformation of methane to adsorbed hydrogen and adsorbed methyl. Given the recalcitrance of methane as a chemical reactant, successful demonstration of this process would increase the economic feasibility of using stranded methane and reduce the environmental impact of a vast domestic energy supply.  The research project also involves training both graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The electrochemical conversion of methane to alconol is of particular interest because it is capable of stabilizing the desirable intermediates and reducing the activation barriers of the charge transfer reaction by proper selection of electrocatalysts and operating potentials to obtain desirable products.  It is known that under the same conditions, electrochemical reactions are generally faster than the corresponding chemical reactions and therefore a significant effect on the slow reactions, such as the partial oxidation methane can be expected.  Moreover, the electrochemical oxidation has the potential to directly convert methane to methanol at ambient conditions, which enables a potential cost-effective process.      Inspired by the advances in the heterogeneous catalysis for methane conversion, we have synthesized a series of capsule-like oxide catalysts to enhance methane electro-oxidation activity at room temperature. To the best of our knowledge, this hybrid is a new electrocatalyst for the selective electrochemical oxidation of methane to produce propanol (1-propanol and 2-propanol). Comparative experimental investigation illustrates the strong synergistic effect between CuOx and ZrO2, unique catalytic structure and electron transfer pathway are responsible for accelerating electrochemical activity. Density function theory (DFT) calculations reveal an obvious charge redistribution after the ZrO2 anchored on the Cu2O(111), which enhances the CH4 dissociation and forms a quick electron transfer network. Consequently, the ZrO2:CuOx manifests higher  activity than most of the recently reported catalysts. High levels of 1-propanol and 2-propanol as the main alcohol products were collected after 18 hours, with a production efficiency &gt; 56%. Hence, the study reported herein may encourage research on the design of other new high-activity and robust binary metal oxides.
