<AbstractNarration>The ACCEYSS (Association of Collaborative Communities Equipping Youth for STEM Success) Network and Model project, an NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilot, at Texas State University is forming a university-community partnership between interdisciplinary researchers (ACCEYSS research team), faith leaders and other community partners to implement an innovative model that prepares underrepresented and underserved youth to pursue undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees. The inaugural ACCEYSS network will include Texas State University, San Marcos Consolidated Independent School District, San Marcos Youth Service Bureau, City of San Marcos-Office of the City Manager, Hays County Youth Initiative, the Calaboose African American History Museum, and several local faith-based organizations.  Many historic advancements have been made through the efforts and activities of faith and community leaders uniquely poised to motivate and galvanize community-based action. A collaboration among these academic institutions, social/cultural organizations, and faith partners to work with the families and youth of underrepresented/underserved populations will be an essential asset for generating new perspectives and ideas for improving STEM academic and career outcomes related to broadening participation in the scientific enterprise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During this launch pilot, the ACCEYSS research team and network will collaborate to design and develop the ACCEYSS model as a culturally-relevant, blended-learning strategy that integrates online and in-person STEM enrichment activities (e.g., summer institute, afterschool clubs) that are aligned with the Science and Engineering Practices and Disciplinary Core Ideas Dimensions of the K-12 Next Generation Science Education Standards. The collective impact framework will be used to build diverse capacity, leverage asset-based community development, and sustain mutually reinforcing non-exclusive policies and practices for STEM diversity and inclusion. Additionally, in this launch pilot, a multifaceted design-based research approach will be utilized to support middle and high school students' interest in and pursuit of STEM studies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ACCEYSS (Association of Collaborative Communities Equipping Youth for STEM Success) Network and Model project at Texas State University, an NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilot, concluded with the following outcomes impacting informal and formal K-16 STEM education research.  Builds      upon the current body of knowledge and generates new knowledge about      minority STEM majors' successful K-16 STEM      educational trajectories and educational experiences. Followed      a collective impact approach to build the capacity of a      backbone organization that has the potential to sustain a      university-community partnership of faith-based and community leaders. Followed      an asset-based community development approach to generate new knowledge about existing university and community assets      or resources to equip historically underrepresented and underserved youth      for undergraduate STEM education. Developed      a focus group interview protocol for Faith and Community Leaders in the ACCEYSS Network. Developed      a focus group interview protocol for STEM faculty at an HSI. Tested      and validated the ACCEYSS STEM Majors survey, which includes a Two-Factor      17-item questionnaire, with evidence of producing      reliable (r = 0.779) and valid results, to survey successful      biology and STEM majors? perceptions about potential factors that      influenced their decisions to enroll and remain enrolled. Extended      the Counter-Life Herstory/History Interview Protocol (Ashford, 2016; Ashford-Hanserd, 2020) while conducting interviews with      Black and Hispanic STEM majors at an HSI. Developed      an innovative, culturally-relevant, evidence-based, informal K-12 STEM      intervention framework to help faith-based and      nonprofit organizations engage and equip minority and underserved youth to      pursue and persist in postsecondary STEM education. The ACCEYSS Model Pilot      results provide some evidence of statistical significance and that the      posttest scores are higher than the pretest scores.  Launched      the virtual ACCEYSS Faith and Community Leadership Summit that focuses on recruiting new partners to bridge the STEM equity gap in      underserved communities.   While the findings of this study are preliminary in nature, they provide some insight into the ACCEYSS Network and Model's potential to engage more minority and underserved youth in K-12 STEM education and thus positively influence the number of Black and Hispanic students who ultimately succeed in K-16 STEM education and beyond.
