<AbstractNarration>The Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium (USTARS 2017) will take place March 31-April 2, 2017 at Amherst College, in Amherst, Massachusetts. The symposium will highlight research being conducted by underrepresented students in the areas of algebra and topology. Most speakers will give thirty-minute research talks in parallel sessions. Graduate students will give at least three-quarters of these presentations. Two distinguished graduate students and one invited faculty member will be chosen to give one-hour presentations. A poster session featuring invited undergraduates, a panel discussion, and a professional development session are also planned. USTARS exposes participants to the research and activities of underrepresented mathematicians, encouraging a more collaborative mathematics community. Participants are also given the opportunity to meet and network with students and faculty members who will later become collaborators and colleagues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this unique meeting, attendees are exposed to a great variety of current research, ideas, and results in their areas of study and beyond. The topics of the presentations will vary over a wide range of areas in algebra and topology. There will be parallel sessions focused on combinatorics, number theory, commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, associative algebras, nonassociative rings and algebras, group theory and generalizations, topological groups and Lie groups, general topology, algebraic topology, and manifolds and cell complexes. Further details may be found on the conference website at http://www.ustars.org.</AbstractNarration>

Thanks to continued NSF support, the conference was able to provide full travel support to all graduate and undergraduate student presenters, and partial travel support to general participants     Both conferences featured professional development panels where participants were invited to ask for advice on how to apply to graduate schools, find jobs, give great presentations, and become active in research opportunities.  The professional development panels consisted of groups of faculty and students of diverse backgrounds, career stages, and academic experiences.   One of the most important outcomes of each USTARS conference is that participants are encouraged to develop a network of mentors and peers that will serve as a vital resource for collaboration and professional development throughout their careers.  The networks of new connections made at USTARS 2017 is included as a supporting image to this report.          Last Modified: 02/11/2019       Submitted by: Erik A Insko]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
