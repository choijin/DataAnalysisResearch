<AbstractNarration>The Asian Technology Information Program (ATIP) proposes to hold a Workshop at SC'17  in Denver, CO, that will provide a balanced picture of key HPC R&amp;D in Japan, China, India, and other Asian countries. It is not easy way for US experts to fully understand what is occurring in Asian countries. This is specifically true for younger US researchers who are not familiar with where to access the best research in Asian countries. Broader impacts will include potential US collaborative efforts in HPC research. More importantly, it enables US researchers to keep abreast of developments in Asia and to incorporate the best ideas in their research in the US. It will also enable funding agencies in the US to keep abreast of the priorities of funding agencies in HPC. &lt;br/&gt;The Workshop will include presentations, posters, and discussions by Asian researchers from universities, government institutes, and industry in sessions addressing systems, centers, and government plans, progress in components, system software, and applications, and human resource and eco-system development. This balanced program will enable the US research community to gain a more holistic understanding of the current situation and better evaluate potential opportunities for collaboration. As part of this proposal, ATIP will support at least eight young US researchers identified as having a high potential for research interests that overlap with their Asian counterparts and who would normally be unable to attend SC. Members of the international research community have agreed to support attendance by similar students from Asian countries who are anxious to share their ideas and engage in collaborative work. The key aspect of the proposed Workshop will be the unique opportunity for members of the US and international HPC research community to interact and have direct discussions with the top Asian scientists and leading graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ ATIP held full-day workshop on "International Exascale and Next-Generation Computing Programs" at the Supercomputing 2017 conference (SC17) in Denver, Colorado on November 13, 2017.  Speakers included leaders from Asia, Europe, Australia, India, and the US who are involved with developing and implementing major national programs. Presentations covered a variety of HPC-related topics ranging from infrastructure development, facilities, technologies, funding, applications, human resources, industry development, impediments, etc. In addition to senior developers and policy makers, junior scientists from around the world were also invited to attend the conference and showcase their work.  Primary goals for the workshop were as follows:  Inform the US HPC research community about next-generation computing project plans as well as new research projects, focusing on next-generation computing and Exascale system development programs. Enable HPC researchers within the international community to meet and share ideas concerning these topics.  Motivate the preparation of joint research proposals with researchers and companies from both the US and abroad.   This workshop provided conference attendees with a one-stop survey of international advanced computing activities.   US scientists attending the workshop were able to become acquainted with different approaches that are being considered globally.  Young US researchers attending the workshop had an opportunity to identify potential international collaborations.  The inclusion of young researchers from the global community generated positive feedback from other workshop attendees.    Intellectual Merit The national and individual research projects presented in this workshop illustrate the best of the best ? nationally significant programs entrusted to intellectually gifted scientists and esteemed organizations. Each project is unique. The resources that are provided make clear that important results are expected.  Broader Impact Since ATIP?s workshop brought together top scientists and graduate students from both the US and abroad, ATIP believes some have formed connections that could lead to future research collaborations, particularly in the area of future extreme-scale computing systems and applications.
