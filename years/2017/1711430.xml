<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2017, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. In doing so, the proposed research will highlight the importance of natural history collections in broadening our understanding of how biodiversity arises relative to ecological variables such as habitat and to symbiotic associations with microbes, upon which all animals depend. Specifically, this study investigates the role of habitat use and a symbiosis with luminous bacteria on the diversification of a group of bioluminescent coral reef fish. The methods that will be developed to extract both host and symbiont DNA from museum specimens will establish new opportunities to understand the way in which host animals and their bacterial symbionts change over time relative to each other and to their environments. Such information is especially valuable at this critical time when rapidly changing environments threaten to de-couple essential symbiotic associations. The historical patterns of species' dependencies on particular habitats and their abilities to adapt to new conditions, along with their symbionts, can be used to predict their future responses to impending environmental changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines the symbiotically luminous genus of coral reef fish Siphamia (Perciformes: Apogonidae) as a model with which to investigate both habitat use and its symbiosis with luminous bacteria as drivers of speciation in the host. By applying next generation sequencing methods to archived museum specimens, the specific research objectives are (i) to infer the phylogenetic relationships among Siphamia fishes, (ii) to compare the defined divergence patterns in Siphamia relative to species-habitat use and biogeographic distributions, (iii) to identify the luminous symbionts of various Siphamia hosts species, and (iv) to compare symbiont genotypes and phylogenic relationships with both host divergence patterns and environmental characteristics such as depth and temperature. To carry out these objectives, the fellow will extract DNA from the tissue of all 23 described Siphamia species archived in museum collections from sites representative of their geographic ranges and will apply restriction site associated sequencing (RAD-Seq) methods to resolve the phylogeny of the host fish. The fellow will also extract the DNA of the luminous symbionts from Siphamia light organs, including those from modern specimens collected during this project, and will sequence genes known to vary between luminous bacteria in the Vibrionaceae family to infer a phylogeny of the light organ symbionts. The divergence patterns in the host fish will then be compared to their habitat use, distributions, and patterns of symbiont diversification to test for signatures of ecological speciation driven by these factors, revealing the underlying ecological processes that might have shaped the diversification of this coral reef fish and its bioluminescent symbiosis. This research will be based at the California Academy of Sciences (CAS) and will foster public engagement on the underlying themes of microbial symbioses and of species-adaptive responses to their environment through outreach programs and exhibits designed to highlight the importance of biodiversity in coral reef ecosystems and its current threats. Other important aspects of this project include the incorporation of new specimens in the ichthyology, microbiology, and frozen DNA collections at CAS for use in future research as well as the training of undergraduate students on the applied molecular methods.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>During this award, I investigated habitat diversification and a bioluminescent symbiosis as ecological drivers of speciation in the symbiotically luminous genus of coral reef fishes, <em>Siphamia</em>. The primary goals of my project were to (i) infer the phylogenetic relationships among <em>Siphamia </em>species, (ii) compare divergence patterns of Siphamia with habitat use and biogeography, (iii) identify the luminous symbionts of various <em>Siphamia </em>hosts, and (iv) compare symbiont genotypes to <em>Siphamia</em> divergence patterns and habitat characteristics (i.e. depth, temperature). To do so, I extracted the DNA from the light organ tissue, which houses the luminous bacterial symbiont, from <em>Siphamia </em>specimens archived in natural history collections, many of which were initially fixed in formalin. I then sequenced the DNA from these tissues and was able to recover informative genetic information for both the host and its bacterial symbiont from many of the specimens, including one specimen collected in 1931. With the sequence information recovered, I identified the luminous bacterial symbionts of nearly half of the species in the host genus across their broad Indo-Pacific distribution from eastern Africa to French Polynesia. Thus, the methods developed to extract and sequence bacterial DNA from archived specimens in the wet collections of natural history museums were successful and could be applied to a number of other systems, including other symbiotically luminous fishes. In addition to recovering bacterial DNA from theses specimens, I was also able to recover host fish DNA. Using mitochondrial DNA sequences (COI), I inferred the phylogenetic relationships of over half of the host species. To increase the resolution of the phylogeny, I am also incorporating nuclear DNA sequences recovered from the host fish using sequence probes sets designed to capture ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and exons. These results are currently being drafted up as two research articles, one describing the specificity of the symbiosis throughout the host genus and biogeographic range, and another describing the diversification of the host fish relative to habitat use and biogeography. Furthermore, preliminary results of this research have been disseminated to the scientific community through presentations at conferences and lectures at various academic institutions, as well as to the public through engagement at outreach events such as the California Academy of Science's (CAS) NightLife events. As a part of my postdoctoral training, I mentored one undergraduate student from San Francisco State University and one high school student through CAS's Careers in Science internship program during this award. Mentees developed skills in the lab such as sterile technique, fish dissections, and DNA extractions.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/12/2020<br>      Modified by: Alison&nbsp;Gould</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
