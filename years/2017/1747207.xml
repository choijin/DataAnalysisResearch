<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the ability to address secure communications with virtually no overhead at reasonable cost.  The asynchronous engine developed in this program will enable robust encryption and decryption while offering improvements in power efficiency, data throughput and security.  According to SDM, the market for encryption and decryption technology could be as high as $38.5 billion by 2020.  Additionally, there is a recognized need for encryption and authentication of power and chemical/process plants in the U.S., currently dangerously underserved.  The initial market is estimated to be $270M and the serviceable addressable market is $2.7B.  This program's primary focus will be on the asynchronous engine for the industrial and data center industries with a total market of $27B.  In addition, the proposed technology will be flexible enough to be incorporated into encryption-decryption products in many other industries.  These include consumer goods and services, such as mobile communications devices, entertainment and transportation (vehicles, airplanes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the need for cyber security for Internet-of-Things (loT) systems using an innovative approach: an asynchronous engine using chaotic functions to generate an infinite length key for encryption and decryption.   During the past few decades, information has emerged as the most valuable asset for both individuals and corporations.  Cyber-attacks no longer exclusively target military or large enterprises; everyone from private citizens to businesses to governments requires secure communications.  The methods of encryption rely on digital schemes to encrypt and decrypt messages using general-purpose CPUs and software; which means that loT devices impend hacking of information, system function, corporate profits, and national security.  Our unique approach will include a discrete-logic program with reconfigurable chaotic oscillators loaded into a field programmable gate array (FPGA).  This hybrid system will be tested with different loT devices and network configurations.  The long-term goal of the hybrid encryption-decryption engine is to build a hardware encryption device to secure peer-to-peer communication.  The innovative solution will allow the attached device to execute much faster than current solutions of similar complexity while reducing or eliminating overhead, and allowing one-time pad encryption.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The increased adoption of the Industrial Internet of the Things (IIoT) has enabled companies to achieve more productivity, collaboration, and efficiency.  However, this has also created vulnerabilities that did not exist before.  Industries like Oil &amp; Gas use a good portion of equipment and technologies originally built over 20 years ago.

We proposed a SBIR project to solve these critical problems, at a low cost and without having to unnecessary replace existing equipment.  Our proposed solution is to create a Chaotic Hybrid Encryption Communication Kit (CHECK(TM)) "dongle" that can be plugged in at both ends of an unsecured network connection and enable highly-secured encrypted communication.  This report summarizes the research and commercialization results of this project. Beat the Odds Bootcamp: We interviewed over 170 people (100+ during I-Corps, 30+ during "Beat the Odds Bootcamp", and 40+ during recent industry conferences and site visits).  These people belong to various companies in the industry ranging from equipment and service providers to refinery operators.  They represent companies like Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, National Instruments, Aeron, GTI Predictive, BP, ConocoPhillips, Anadarko, and Valero among other companies. It helped us pinpoint our commercialization approach from single-pronged to a multi-pronged approach. We learned who our customers are and who are the "Saboteurs", "Buyers", and "Users" in our niche. With this knowledge, we were also able to find the right pricing for our products.   Crypto Hybrid Engine(TM)(CHE(TM)): The main objective of this milestone was to create a software application that can be used by the different ARM processors and FPGA chips.  There were two obstacles that influenced the design of the encryption/decryption app to be developed.  It is required to be a multiplatform application that can be used in Windows, Linux, and iOS.  The application should depend as little as possible on large specific libraries and, if possible, use standard libraries only, to facilitate an easy transfer to a microcontroller.  The results of the CHE(TM) tests were satisfactory.  For example in the FPGA implementation, all data sent was encrypted successfully and the execution time was around 6 micro-sec to create 16 new keys.  It can potentially generate up to 2.6 million keys per second.  These two implementations, ARM &amp; FPGA, are the core of our product line CHECK(TM).  The ARM implementation is going to power the CHECK-EP(TM).  This product is a low-bandwidth entry-level version.  It is designed to be located at different end-points such as pumps or sensors.  On the other hand, the FPGA implementation is going to power the CHECK-NC(TM).  This product is a high-bandwidth, high-speed device, the node-controller.  It is designed to be placed close to the control units. CHECK(TM) Proof-of-Concept: The main objective of the SBIR phase I, was to create a proof-of-concept (POC) of CHECK(TM).  Our starting point is the Crypto Hybrid Engine(TM)as explained above.  Around the HCE(TM), we wrap an application running as a daemon (background process) service.  We used different microcontrollers, like Texas Instruments' AM3358 Sitara , Analog Devices'  FIDO5100, Xilinx's ZinQ (Kintex-7 325T w/ FPGA embedded), etc., and we used different commercial boards, like National Instruments' cRIO and cRIO SOM, Analog Devices's RapID Platform Network Interface Evaluation Kit (NIEK), Digilent's Kunbus' Revolution PI Connect, Raspberry Pi, ZedBoard, etc. Industrial Communication Test Bed: The testbed was composed of two National Instruments (NI) cRIO-9043 and one cRIO-9049.  In order to test the proof-of-concept, we set the cRIO-9049 as a primary device.  This primary device acts as a controller. The second cRIO-9043 was set as an endpoint with a virtual valve as an actuator and a virtual tank level as a sensor. Since we needed some dynamics to test the speed of transmission, a tank plant was simulated.  The primary device controls the tank's level by changing the valve's state (open or close).  The simulation is set to run around 1ms to give enough time for the communication to send the sensor's data and receive the valve's state.  We perform several test included with no encryption, embeded code (no added hardware) and CHECK(TM) POC. The results were satisfactory. Our CHECK(TM) POC was able to handle the communication without much overhead.  In conclusion, our technology will enable Industrial IoT devices to establish ubiquitous secure communication.  In our long-range plan, we expect to develop products and/or partner with companies that serve these markets.  Our core technology has nested components: CHECK(TM), CHE(TM), InfiniKey(TM), and a Hybrid Processor.  Each component will have broader impacts.  The impact of our technology will be much broader as the secure communication and authentication will ripple through the industrial, health, and governmental sectors to name a few; eventually covering the whole IoT, our serviceable addressable market.
