<AbstractNarration>One of the most fundamental questions in neuroscience is how the 86 billion neurons in the&lt;br/&gt;human brain can coordinate their activity to give rise to our amazing cognitive abilities. With&lt;br/&gt;support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Voytek and his research team at UC San&lt;br/&gt;Diego will examine the role that rhythmic fluctuations in the brain's electrical activity, namely neural&lt;br/&gt;oscillations or 'brain waves', play in shaping how the brain processes information and how&lt;br/&gt;groups of neurons communicate with one another. Using a sophisticated blend of human&lt;br/&gt;electrophysiology and innovative brain-state-dependent stimulus presentation, these projects&lt;br/&gt;will test how neural oscillations route the flow of information influence the brain's activity and,&lt;br/&gt;therefore, impact learning and memory. The results of these projects have broad implications&lt;br/&gt;ranging from age-related cognitive decline to cognitive enhancement. Additionally, this award&lt;br/&gt;will provide the resources for building open source methods and tutorials for analyzing complex,&lt;br/&gt;non-linear neural data, as well as support Dr. Voytek's extensive work in science&lt;br/&gt;communication and outreach. These open science, science communication, and diversity&lt;br/&gt;outreach initiatives will be distributed freely online with code and other materials and, ultimately,&lt;br/&gt;may be expanded into a Summer School focused on training students how to analyze oscillatory&lt;br/&gt;neural data and how to communicate their research to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These projects will extend our understanding of oscillatory phase as a neural communication&lt;br/&gt;mechanism. This is critical, as oscillations have been implicated in healthy cognitive functioning&lt;br/&gt;by allowing for efficient information transmission, top-down attentional control, cognitive control,&lt;br/&gt;and working memory maintenance, among many other functions. By extension, dysfunctional&lt;br/&gt;phase dynamics may underlie a variety of cognitive disruptions such as those seen in normal&lt;br/&gt;aging, as well as in psychiatric and neurological disease. These projects will significantly&lt;br/&gt;advance our understanding of network phase dynamics in human cognition specifically, and as&lt;br/&gt;a general a computational mechanism in general. This award will also support the development&lt;br/&gt;of a suite of computational tools, open source methods, and code for analyzing oscillatory&lt;br/&gt;phase networks and their computational capacity. Additionally, it will support continued&lt;br/&gt;development of a system for real-time, phase-triggered stimulus presentation, which will open&lt;br/&gt;entirely new avenues of cognitive research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this project we sought to better understand the role that rhythmic electrical activity in the human brain&mdash;otherwise known as neural oscillations&mdash;plays in how brain regions communicate with one another, and how these oscillations influence perception and cognition. We approached this with two specific objectives: 1) to look at what happens when neural oscillations are too strongly or too weakly coupled, and; 2) to look at how subtle, moment-to-moment changes in an oscillation&rsquo;s phase&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s at its peak or trough&mdash;influences perception. While we made significant advances in this area, we also found ourselves having to pursue a parallel path of inquiry into the role that <em>non-oscillatory</em>, aperiodic activity also plays in cognition. This parallel path arose from the fact that, while oscillations are common, the predominant signal in human electroencephalography (EEG) is the non-oscillatory, aperiodic component.

As we pushed at this further, we realized that this conflating of the two signals is fairly common in neuroscience, and that there were no rigorous, well-tested methods for disentangling these two signals. For that reason, we introduced a novel algorithm for the parameterization of neural power spectral densities as a combination of the aperiodic signal and periodic oscillations. This algorithm is amenable to large-scale data exploration and analysis, providing researchers with a tool to quickly and accurately parameterize neural power spectra. We leveraged our new approach to better understand how both oscillations <em>and</em> the aperiodic signal influence neural communication and cognition.
