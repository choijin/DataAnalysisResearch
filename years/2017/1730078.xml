<AbstractNarration>Abstract: Collaborative Research: Accounting for the Rise in College Tuition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Persistent rising college tuition and student debt in the U.S. are growing public policy concerns, yet factors driving their growth remain unresolved.  With its combination of extensive public subsidies, complicated financial aid rules, segmented market structure, and widespread use of differential tuition pricing, the higher education market functions quite differently from many other markets. In addition, most traditional colleges are non-profit institutions that pursue objectives that differ from those of profit-maximizing firms.  In addition, the incentives colleges face are less well understood.  This research project develops a new approach to quantify the determinants of U.S. college tuition and how they contribute to tuition inflation, as well as assess the impact of programs aimed at expanding college access and easing the burden of student debt. Focusing on explaining the aggregate trends in college tuition increases, it will shed light on differences across college types and investigates ways to promote educational opportunity across the socioeconomic spectrum. The methods used in this research can also serve as a template for future students and researchers interested in studying the complex higher education market.  The results of this research can help policy makers develop better policies to increase higher education attainment for the American workforce, hence improving U.S. competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research develops an equilibrium structural model that includes life-cycle decision-making by households, imperfect competition and price discrimination in the higher education sector, student loan borrowing, and uninsurable post-graduation earnings risk. Relative to the existing literature, the presence of forward-looking behavior and higher expected post-graduation earnings endogenously motivates college attendance and facilitates taking the model to the data. The model is then used to test and quantify various hypotheses for the rise in college tuition---an approach which permits counterfactual analysis and decomposition of tuition drivers. Lastly, the project will use the model to study the efficacy of recent and proposed reforms whose goals are to restrain the growth of tuition and student debt.  The results of this research project will help guide policies aimed at improving college education, thereby increasing the U.S.?s human capital and competitiveness.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project quantitatively evaluates several prominent theories of college tuition inflation to explain the persistent rise in college prices between the late 1980s and the Great Recession. The analysis uses rich institution-level data and a computational model that incorporates several key features of the higher education landscape. To organize thinking, we separate the theories which involve factors that directly affect college supply from those that revolve around forces that shift demand. On the supply side, Baumol's cost disease emphasizes the commonality between higher education and other service sectors, where the stipulated combination of stagnant productivity growth and rising labor costs creates persistent inflationary pressures. Another common supply-side explanation focuses on the role of declining state support for public institutions. We analyze this theory both independently and within the broader context of changes to other sources of non-tuition revenue. On the demand side, we examine the frequently-mentioned Bennett hypothesis, which attributes higher tuition to the same federal student aid programs that are meant to help with college affordability. Specifically, we assess the contribution of pre-Great Recession reforms to the Federal Student Loan Program (such as the addition of unsubsidized loans in 1993) in addition to the evolution of loan limits, interest rates, and Pell Grants. Lastly, we also quantify the role of rising labor market skill premia and higher parental income through their impact on college demand.</p> <p>With the presence of extensive public subsidies, complicated financial aid rules, market power, and widespread price discrimination, higher education functions quite differently from most other markets. Furthermore, non-profit institutions---which are the focus of this analysis---face different objectives and incentives than profit-maximizing firms. To capture these features, we assume that colleges seek to maximize quality, which is specified as a function of per-student investment and average student ability. Thus, schools can improve their quality by spending more per student or by attracting a more capable student body that creates positive academic spillovers for all those in attendance. In other words, unlike in most markets, the consumers (students in this case) of academic quality are also producers of it because of the peer effects they generate. By operating with market power, colleges engage in price discrimination to balance student recruitment against the need to raise revenue for quality-enhancing investment. Students, in turn, weigh cost and quality when choosing from among the set of colleges to which they receive an offer of admission.
