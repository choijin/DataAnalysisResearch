<AbstractNarration>Various aspects of economic burden of the United States are associated with an aging population, of whom 70% will need some kind of long-term care. C2SHIP (Center to Stream Heathcare In Place) will unite the best minds in academic medicine with leaders in the biomedical industry to research and develop intelligent monitoring and intervening wearable technologies, and in particular will be focused on enabling and promoting aging in place, personalized medicine, and smart management of chronic and non-communicable disease through telecommunication, data mining, and comprehensive feedback. The thrust of our research will be on the aging patient's central role and responsibility in enabling an optimized healthcare ecosystem.  This award supports planning for the formation of this Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our trans-disciplinary research will pursue research and development in reconfigurable designs and system integration centered on the aging/health "in place" concept:  establishment of an environment or mobile hub for patient-in-need within his/her own location facilitated by the streaming of data to medical professionals at remote locations in real time through the Internet of Things. This represents a crucial first step toward characterizing abnormalities in environment and activity. Moreover, C2SHIP will focus on the mitigation of physiological, environmental, and psychological changes for real time management and intervention as well as infuse new in place technologies into relevant user communities and residences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C2SHIP will investigate techniques and mechanisms that can facilitate real time interventions for a number of chronic diseases. The Center will not only advance the science of physiology, aging and pediatric medicine but also accelerate both knowledge and intellectual property transfer between academia and industry through our collaborative partnerships. This will allow for the rapid development of new in place technologies that can potentially transform health care delivery, reduce health care costs related to care of chronic disease and preventable readmissions, and, moreover, improve outcomes and quality of life for aging and chronically-ill patients.</AbstractNarration>

All of these factors continue to overwhelm unchanging healthcare delivery systems. In response, many healthcare providers are re-engineering their pathways of care for patients with chronic disease to promote alternatives to repeated hospitalizations. Because management of chronic conditions requires lifestyle and daily behavior change, a greater emphasis must be placed on the patient&rsquo;s central role and responsibility in healthcare. Focusing on the patient in this way constitutes an important shift in current clinical practice. At present, systems relegate the patient to the role of passive recipient of care, missing the opportunity to leverage what he or she can do to promote personal health (in-place care). Healthcare for chronic conditions must be re-oriented around the patient and caregivers.</p> <p>However, to date there is no I-UCRC center in U.S. to accelerate development of &lsquo;in-place&rsquo; technology to facilitate management of chronic disease in-place as an alternative to repeated hospitalization.
