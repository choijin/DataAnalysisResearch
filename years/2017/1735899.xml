<AbstractNarration>This one and one-half day workshop will focus on the meanings, implications and impact of increased transparency and accountability in scientific research and scholarship for qualitative research.  The workshop brings together practitioners from the disciplines of political science, sociology and anthropology to discuss the  multiple meanings of transparency and accountability, both across and within different practices of science. This workshop focuses on ethical questions about the when, why, where and how      of the impact of evaluation, transparency and accountability on qualitative work. The research agenda developed from this workshop will be of interest to researchers, policymakers and participants in qualitative research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together qualitative researchers to focus on: (1) underlying assumptions of various calls to "make transparent" particular kinds of qualitative research data; (2) clarification of appropriate implementation activities to increase transparency; (3) the role of professional associations in discussion, development, and implementation of disciplinary standards; and (4) the role of data management plans in qualitative accountability.  The workshop will contribute to improved understanding of issues arising from the calls for data access and transparency in the context of qualitative research. It will generate a white paper on the challenges identified for qualitative research, transcparency and accountability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This two-day workshop, 'Intention and Implementation: Transparency in Qualitative Social Science,' reached beyond a single discipline to engage practitioners along a broad spectrum of qualitative research in interdisciplinary conversations about the issues raised by current calls for  replicable,  reproducible and generalizable  science - calls for a general transparency - and to share  lessons learned among related disciplines.  The workshop was inspired by a general concern about transparency in the social sciences, and the more specific concern raised by a 2016 Dear Colleague letter from the SBE Directorate of NSF.  This letter stated the laudable goal of enhancing the robustness and reliability of research, but then defined 'robust and reliable research' as 'research that is reproducible, replicable, and generalizable.'  Given that there are other ways to define 'robust and reliable' -- such as 'credible,' 'confirmable,' 'dependable,' and 'transferrable' -- the choice of 'reproducible, replicable, and generalizable' suggested a particular orientation to knowledge production with assumptions and goals that may not be compatible with, or relevant to, many kinds of qualitative research.  Because these are complicated and problematic concepts as they relate to many types of qualitative research, the goal of the workshop was to facilitate a discussion among practitioners, professional leaders, and policy makers to clarify the meaning and intentions in calls for 'robust?' and 'reliable' research.  As we were  committed to exploring the similarities and differences of such conversations across the social sciences, we convened practitioners from three disciplines: anthropology, political science, and sociology. We also invited the Executive Directors and Presidents of the professional associations representing those disciplines. Finally, we invited funding agency sponsors - NSF, NIH, SSRC and Wenner Gren - to share perspectives from their contexts.  The workshop was successful in bringing together a diverse group of scholars and professionals to discuss the different meanings of 'data', 'data sharing', 'data access', 'research transparency', and 'reproducibility'. We also discussed the descriptive and normative roles of researchers, research staff, professional associations, and funding programs in defining, creating, collecting, analyzing, sharing, and providing access to data. Participants included 27 specialists representing a variety of career stages, disciplinary backgrounds, research expertise, and professional appointments.  The diversity of participant experience and knowledge included, among others, science and technology studies, public policy, public administration, political science, bioethics, behavioral medicine, sociology, genetics, and social psychology.  Projects which were inspired by this workshop included: a special event at the 2018 American Anthropological Association meetings, which used the participatory concept of a 'data scavenger hunt' to encourage more disciplinary conversation about our relationship to data's several lives. Additionally, the workshop's conveners continue to pursue publication of three linked papers - one for / from each discipline -  and reflecting on a different fault line emerging from the workshop. Finally, another NSF-sponsored workshop was held in the Fall of 2018 [Shaw and Feldman, co-PIs], with the goal of taking steps toward the establishment of guidelines for data sharing/access/transparency.  The workshop facilitated a productive transdisciplinary discussion that will likely have an impact on participants, other scholars, and the direction of the field. All of the participants benefited from the discussions in ways that will continue to influence their work.          Last Modified: 03/20/2019       Submitted by: Dena K Plemmons]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
