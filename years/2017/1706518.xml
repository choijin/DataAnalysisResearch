<AbstractNarration>Current medical practice to diagnose Lyme disease by observation of symptoms combined with blood testing produces a lot of errors.  The long-term goal is to develop a new approach that overcomes this limitation in Lyme disease testing and to create a general (cross­species) test for Lyme disease that can be used in humans, pets, livestock, and wild animals. The proposed research takes advantage of a largely-unknown property of the antibodies that form in response to Lyme infection that can be conveniently measured by their chemical reactivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lyme disease is the most common vector­borne disease in the United States, infecting 300,000 Americans per year.  Current medical practice is to diagnose Lyme disease by observation of symptoms combined with serological detection of the host animal's antibodies against Borrelia antigens using ELISA and  Western blot. Both of them have their limitations, namely, the secondary reagents exhibit nonspecific binding.  The secondary antibodies make the test specific to the species providing the serum. Inexpensive, isotype- and species-independent antibody sensors are important because they can facilitate widespread monitoring of infectious disease, the cross-species study of the dynamics of seroconversion and early detection following exposure.  The long-term goal is to implement and standardize a new biosensor based on direct measurement of antibody catalysis via the antibody-catalyzed water oxidation pathway (ACWOP). The objective is to elucidate the physiochemistry of antigen immobilization and catalytic sensing which produces hydrogen peroxide for a colorimetric or electrochemical readout. Three research aims will be pursued; namely, experimentally show antigen localization and specific antibody binding on paper substrates; show ELISA-level sensitivity from direct catalytic readout of bound antibodies; and, show detection of Borrelia antigens in clinically relevant samples. The key features are novel ACWOP-transduction mechanism that eliminates secondary antibodies from immune-specific sensors and practical implementation of immobilization chemistry that is resistant to nonspecific binding. It is anticipated that the proposed biosensor will have a significant practical impact because species­independent detection of  Lyme borreliosis enables monitoring of the  Borrelia reservoir as well as livestock, companion animals, and humans.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed sensors to detect human response to infection through serology, the detection of antibodies in the blood that are specific to a known pathogen.  Although the study was fundamental, the process was motivated by the persistent limitations of Lyme Disease detection and the societal cost of these limitations in the US.     The standard test for Lyme disease is two-tier testing in which patient serum is examined for evidence of antibodies against proteins associated with Borrelia burgdorferi, the spiral-shaped bacterium that causes Lyme after transferring to humans via tick bite. Interestingly, the standard tests for Lyme disease in humans, dogs, and horses are all different, with different strengths and weaknesses, and there is little synergy between the independently developed tests for different species.  This project proposed to detect antibodies by use of ACWOP, the antibody-catalyzed water oxidation pathway.  This approach takes advantage of the fact that antibodies, which we normally think of as being proteins that recognize foreign substances in the body, also are catalysts that can convert water to peroxide in the right conditions.     The project?s objectives included quantification of the ACWOP effect, design of sensors using the ACWOP effect, and implementation in patients.  The results and impact of the work are primarily in parameterization of ACWOP sensing effects and the chemical process by which an antibody can be used to first bind to a known protein (for example a protein known to be found on Borrelia burgdorferi) and then used to create a colored or fluorescent readout for detection.  Experiments performed characterized the ability for antibodies to bind to a surface and their ability to perform as catalysts both in solution and when attached to a surface.  Characterization was also performed to measure the sensitivity of the ACWOP sensor to established norms as well as quantifying that response was not a strong function of the species of antibody used.     The impact of this work will be felt in linking multiple populations in which Lyme need be detected, as well as the technologies that have impacted each.  We expect that this unification will enable a next generation of human Lyme Disease tests that transcend current CDC-approved two-tier testing.
