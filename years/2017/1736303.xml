<AbstractNarration>The National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS) will host its ninth annual Undergraduate Research Conference (URC) at the Interface of Mathematics and Biology, Nov. 10-11, 2017, in Knoxville, Tennessee. Since 2009, the conference has showcased the wide array of undergraduate research in mathematical biology, has provided students a chance to practice their scientific presentation skills in front of a supportive audience of peers, and has given students a venue to network with others having similar interests. In addition, two invited lectures by inspiring leaders in research at the interface of mathematics and biology will teach students about current research in this area. About 100 participants will attend the conference, many from traditionally under-represented groups in mathematics and biology. Since the conference emphasizes networking and reaching as many students as possible,  the conference format allows the possibility of all student participants to have the valuable experience of presenting their choice of a research talk or poster to peers. The event strengthens exchanges between the mathematical sciences and life science disciplines, as many of the projects are presented by student teams of math and life science majors. It is not uncommon to hear from life science students attending the conference that their eyes have been further opened to the usefulness of mathematics for making exciting progress in biological questions, and for mathematics students to be inspired by encountering new applications for their mathematical tools of which they were previously unaware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NIMBioS URC's primary objective is to provide opportunities for undergraduates from across the country to share their research at the interface of biology and mathematics to peers and faculty mentors. Between 50 and 70 contributed student talks and posters will be featured. Student abstracts will be gathered into a program book and published on the NIMBioS conference website. Students present their own work that uses mathematical, statistical and computational approaches to address challenging questions in the life sciences in areas of molecular biology, biochemistry, epidemiology, immunology, ecology, and more. Participants' work comes from summer or academic year research experiences supported by agencies such as the NSF, the National Institutes of Health, the National Security Administration or through their home institutions, allowing for excellent cross-pollination of ideas from different programs. These young researchers will receive helpful feedback and have their eyes opened to the variety of applications for mathematical tools in biology as well as the opportunities biological problems provide for exciting advances in mathematics. Sharing information about recent research and forming new connections may result in significant progress in undergraduate mathematical biology research programs, enriching the research programs of faculty mentors. The conference's secondary goals are to provide students with career and graduate school information and opportunities to network. Each conference hosts a panel discussion on career opportunities, a graduate school showcase, and ample networking opportunities through shared meals, frequent breaks, and an organized networking game. The conference provides a valuable opportunity for students to develop their identities as researchers, and the interest in this conference has continued as there are many more qualified applicants applying for travel support each year than there are funds available.</AbstractNarration>

All participants took part in an activity using the &lsquo;Set&rsquo; game as anmeans to encourage meeting new people and networking. Participants were encouraged to form &lsquo;sets&rsquo; with as many other participants as possible, each recording the name and interesting facts/information about the other participants.Another event at the Conference was the Graduate School Opportunities Showcase. This showcase consisted of informational booths on graduate school opportunities from several departments and programs from different institutions, including Biochemistry and Cellular and Molecular Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Mathematics, Genome Science and Technology, NIMBioS, and the Graduate School from University of Tennessee; Mathematics from Western Kentucky University; Mathematics from University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee; Mathematics from Middle Tennessee State University; Mathematics from University of North Carolina, Greensboro; Mathematics from University of Nebraska; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from University of Kansas.</p> <p><br />Several positive impacts resulted from this Conference. All presentations, except for the Keynote Address and Featured Talk, were presented by students. Students were provided ample time to present their talks and have discussions with audience members following each individual talk, and students presenting posters interacted with students, as well as faculty, during the allotted time for poster presentations. Additionally, students were given opportunities to gain information on academic and career development during the Career Panel and Graduate School Opportunities Showcase.The development of this new group of researchers is important to the growth of mathematical biology. Additionally, a diverse group of participants (53% female, 12% Black, 5% Hispanic, and 3% Native American) were funded by this grant.

Over 84% of undergraduate respondents to the Conference evaluation indicated participating in the Conference helped them make connections with others in the interdisciplinary field of math and biology, and 95% of respondents indicated the Conference was successful in creating a forum through which they could present research and make new connections at the interface of math and biology.Finally, 51% of undergraduate respondents to the Conference evaluation indicated that attending the Conference impacted their likelihood of applying to graduate school. These responses to the evaluation indicate that the Conference was well-received and a constructive and meaningful experience to many of the undergraduate participants.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/30/2018<br>      Modified by: Suzanne&nbsp;Lenhart</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1736303/1736303_10503453_1517325579354_IMG_20171112_113549--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1736303/1736303_10503453_1517325579354_IMG_20171112_113549--rgov-800width.jpg" title="NIMBioS Undergraduate Conference"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1736303/1736303_10503453_1517325579354_IMG_20171112_113549--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="NIMBioS Undergraduate Conference"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students presenting a poster session</div> <div class="imageCredit">NIMBioS</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Suzanne&nbsp;Lenhart</div> <div class="imageTitle">NIMBioS Undergraduate Conference</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1736303/1736303_10503453_1517325787012_IMG_20171112_084603--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1736303/1736303_10503453_1517325787012_IMG_20171112_084603--rgov-800width.jpg" title="NIMBioS Undergraduate Conference, talks"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1736303/1736303_10503453_1517325787012_IMG_20171112_084603--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="NIMBioS Undergraduate Conference, talks"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student talk on atherosclesosis</div> <div class="imageCredit">NIMBioS</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Suzanne&nbsp;Lenhart</div> <div class="imageTitle">NIMBioS Undergraduate Conference, talks</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
