<AbstractNarration>Embedded deep in the ice cap at the South Pole, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (ICNO) is the world's largest and most sensitive high energy neutrino telescope. It is a 1 billion-ton detector using the Antarctic ice as a detection medium for high energy atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. Most of the neutrinos observed by IceCube exhibit energies in the range expected for atmospheric neutrinos originating from decays of particles produced in extensive air showers by cosmic rays coming from nearby sectors of the Milky Way Galaxy. These may be used to measure the fundamental properties of neutrinos. At higher energies, astrophysical neutrinos are key probes of the high-energy universe. Because of their unique properties, neutrinos escape even dense regions, are not deflected by galactic or extra-galactic magnetic fields and traverse the photon-filled universe unhindered. Thus, neutrinos provide direct information about the dynamics and interiors of the powerful cosmic objects that may be the origins of high energy cosmic rays: supernovae, black holes, pulsars, active galactic nuclei and other extreme extragalactic phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of a diverse STEM workforce is an important goal, and women and members of under-represented minority groups have made up more than half of the graduate and undergraduate students in the research group. Hands-on research opportunities are provided to several undergraduates working on key IceCube research topics.  The group engages the public with this research at a variety of levels and through a variety of media.  This award also supports an IceCube MasterClass workshop for local high school students, giving them experience with analysis of real IceCube data, using the highly successful program developed for IceCube at the University of Wisconsin and delivered at collaborating institutions around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IceCube Observatory was designed primarily to observe very high energy neutrinos from galactic and extragalactic sources. An inner array known as DeepCore, located in the center of IceCube, also permits observation of neutrinos with energies at which flavor oscillations are visible. This award supports oscillation measurements with precision comparable to the current world-leading results from the MINOS, T2K, and NOvA experiments, but at much higher energies - providing a complementary view of neutrino oscillations with broad sensitivity to new physics. In addition, the relatively high energy range of DeepCore allows the world's highest precision measurement of tau neutrino appearance: a direct, model-independent test of the standard theories of neutrino oscillations and neutrino interactions with matter. IceCube data is also used to search for dark matter in the Sun and our Galaxy, with world-leading sensitivity to some models of dark matter.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located at the National Science Foundation-managed Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, is a unique facility that detects neutrinos over an energy range spanning six orders of magnitude.  Lower-energy neutrinos produced by the interaction of cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere are used to probe the physical properties of neutrinos, the most enigmatic of the fundamental particles currently known, while high energy neutrinos from distant objects in the Universe shed light on astrophysical processes in the most extreme environments we observe.  The intellectual merit of this project related primarily to analysis of lower energy neutrinos observed by IceCube.  At least three types, or "flavors," of neutrino exist, and individual neutrinos change flavor as they travel through space.  These flavor changes, or oscillations, happen more quickly for lower energy neutrinos, and for the lower energy neutrinos observed by IceCube these oscillations take place as neutrinos travel through the Earth.  Precise measurement of these oscillations are the best window available for probing the fundamental properties of neutrinos, including whether additional types of neutrinos exist and whether they can explain why we live in a Universe dominated by matter.  This project supported a unique measurement of neutrino flavor oscillations with IceCube over baselines an order of magnitude longer, and at energies more than a factor of 10 higher, than is possible using particle accelerators.  This measurement was highlighted with a Synopsis on the American Physical Society's website and was an Editor's Suggestion when published in Physical Review Letters.     The measurement also laid the groundwork for a search for signatures of dark matter accumulating in the Sun; if successful, this search would provide crucial information regarding the nature of dark matter and its role in the Universe.  The methods developed during this project will also be used to analyze data from the forthcoming IceCube Phase 1 Upgrade, an NSF-funded Mid-Scale Research Project that will extend the reach of IceCube in both multi-messenger astrophysics and measurements of neutrino flavor oscillations.  The broader impacts of this project were primarily related to development of public interest in STEM and a diverse STEM workforce.  Efforts in this area included an annual "IceCube MasterClass" hosted at Michigan State University, where Michigan high school students had the opportunity to analyze real IceCube data and to build and operate their own detectors of high energy cosmic rays.  A show explaining IceCube research was presented at MSU's Abrams Planetarium on Michigan's State-Wide Astronomy Night, highlighted by a show-and-tell session featuring IceCube sensors and Antarctic cold-weather gear hosted by a project-supported graduate student who had just returned from the South Pole and was able to share her experiences with a sold-out crowd.  Training and mentoring was provided to three graduate student and four undergraduate student researchers working on this project, more than half of whom were women or members of under-represented minority groups.  During the course of the project, one of these graduate students won an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship to support her research in this area.
