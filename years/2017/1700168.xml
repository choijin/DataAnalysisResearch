<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the program "Analysis in Quantum Information Theory" that will be held the Institut Henri Poincare during the fall of  2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the field of Quantum Information Theory. A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this long-term conference. This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be made available at: www.ihp.fr/en/CEB/T3-2017.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to support participation of the United States based mathematical scientists in the trimester "Analysis in Quantum Information Theory"  held at the Institut Henri Poincare (IHP) in Paris, France, from September 4th to December 15th, 2017.  The trimester (web site: http://www.ihp.fr/en/CEB/T3-2017) was a major interdisciplinary event involving hundreds of mathematicians, physicists and computer scientists. Its  program included an introductory summer school and three one-week long conferences, about 100 hours of courses and mini-courses, numerous seminars, collaborative research, and outreach activities. In all, 26 scientists who participated in the trimester have been supported, with the bulk of the funds going to early career scientists, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers with no active research grants.    Mastering quantum technologies is one of the major scientific and engineering challenges of the 21st century.  They have the potential to completely transform the way humans process information by introducing novel methods of computation, data transmission and encryption. A theoretical basis of this endeavor, quantum information theory (QIT), is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary field connecting mathematics, computer science and physics. Conversely, the impact of quantum information science on the diverse subfields of mathematics has been significant in the last few years.
