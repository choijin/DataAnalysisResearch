<AbstractNarration>Parasitic roundworms, also known as parasitic nematodes, infect over one billion people worldwide and are major agricultural pests, causing the loss of billions of dollars in crops and reduced production from livestock. Despite this massive impact on public health and food security, a limited number of drugs and chemicals are available to combat these parasites, and resistance to particular drugs is emerging. Novel approaches are therefore needed to control parasitic roundworms. Caenorhabditis elegans is a non-parasitic nematode that is studied by a large, robust research community which possesses a powerful collection of tools to study its biology. However there is historically limited interaction between the C. elegans community and the parasitology community. This workshop will bring together C. elegans biologists and parasitologists during the International C. elegans Meeting (to be held in Los Angeles, CA June 21-25th, 2017) in order to bridge these communities and to drive new approaches and collaborations to control parasitic roundworms. Funds will be used to support travel expenses for experts on parasitic roundworms, including female and underrepresented minority speakers, and to allow underrepresented minority students to attend and participate in this workshop as well as the rest of the C. elegans meeting.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of this conference is to educate and promote interactions and collaborations between the parasitic roundworm community and C. elegans researchers.  In particular, the goal is to increase awareness among C. elegans scientists of the issues and problems that parasitic roundworm researchers face, and pave the way for applying to parasitic roundworm studies the powerful approaches and technologies that have advanced C. elegans research. The upcoming International C. elegans Meeting provides the best opportunity to reach the majority of C. elegans researchers. A session will be organized at that meeting in which six experts on plant, animal and human parasitic nematodes speak on the life history and unique biology of parasitic species and on the outstanding issues in their field.  In addition to educating the C. elegans community, time will be provided for researchers in the two communities to interact.  The goal is to stimulate C. elegans researchers to think about problems facing the study and control of parasitic nematodes and to apply their expertise toward solving these problems.  To this end, a second, more informal event will be hosted after the session to provide opportunities for one-on-one conversations with the invited speakers. This workshop is unique, because it is embedded within the C. elegans biannual meeting, ensuring exposure to a large number of C. elegans investigators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Nematodes (roundworms) are the most abundant multicellular animal on the planet, with over 20,000 species in the Nemata phylum and an estimated 500,000 yet to be discovered. Nematodes live in virtually every region of the planet including hot springs and Artic sea ice.  While some nematodes are free living, many are parasitic, living in or on countless species throughout the plant and animal kingdoms. Nematodes affect their plant and animal hosts in numerous ways, and several nematodes cause debilitating human diseases, affecting over 1.5 billion people worldwide, particularly in developing nations.  Nematodes are also serious agricultural pests, reducing global food production. A year ago the World Health Organization, USAID, the Gates Foundation, and many other organizations and businesses issued the London Declaration, announcing a combined effort to eliminate or eradicate ten so-called Neglected Tropical Diseases by 2020. The Neglected Tropical Diseases  affect 1.9 billion people, and four of these diseases are caused by nematodes (Guinea worm, river blindness, lymphatic filariasis, and soil-transmitted helminthic diseases).    In spite of the biomedical significance, diversity, and fascinating biology of nematodes, relatively little is known about their cell and molecular biology with one notable exception.  That exception is the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.  Since Sydney Brenner began working on C. elegans in the mid 1960s, this animal has become one of the premiere model organisms in biology.  Studies using C. elegans led to the discovery of a large number of important biological processes (programmed cell death, importance of small RNAs, genetic basis of aging, etc.) that are present in all multicellular animals, and sequencing the C. elegans genome was the pilot for the Human Genome Project. To date research on C. elegans has earned three Nobel Prizes for six researchers.  As C. elegans researchers have begun to explore non-parasitic nematode models, they have gained remarkable insight into evolution of development.    The award funded a workshop designed to bring C. elegans researchers and parasitologists together. We strongly believe that there is a wealth of developmental, cell biological and neurobiological information and techniques within the C. elegans community that could accelerate progress toward advancing basic and applied parasitic nematode research.
