<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical:&lt;br/&gt;This award by the Biomaterials Program in the Division of Materials Research to Purdue University is to develop new principles for synthetic molecular topologies from DNA-based origami self-assembly. DNA-based origami is just like paper-based origami of folding and shaping into different forms. The focus of this award is in preparing DNA-based geometric figures with properties that are not changed by mechanical deformations such as stretching, bending, and/or twisting. Topological structures, in general, they are physical representations of geometrical theories. Studies of molecular topologies and relevant shape-changing mechanisms could advance several scientific disciplines including mathematics, chemistry, and materials sciences, and also lead to revolutionary engineering strategies. This research will demonstrate a new class of macromolecular topologies and their relevant shape-changing mechanisms, by exploiting the excellent programmability and predictability of DNA self-assembly. This award supports fundamental research in developing new principles for synthetic molecular topologies via DNA self-assembly with a focus on programmable reconfigurations using external light irradiation. The scientific broader impact of the project could be in developing novel technologies with potential applications in mobile nano-devices, biophysical tools, synthetic molecular motors, environmental/ biochemical sensors, DNA computations, and drug delivery systems. This project will integrate research efforts with educational and outreach activities designed to advance the public understanding of biomolecular nanotechnology. Outreach and educational activities include development of a new hands-on module on DNA self-assembly. The PI will be actively involved in recruiting female and underrepresented minority students at the individual level as well as through campus-wide programs such as Women in Engineering and Minority Engineering Programs at Purdue University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;Biomolecular topologies are abundant in nature. Their structures and reconfiguration mechanisms have significant implications in biomolecular and cellular properties and functions. In contrast, synthetic molecular topologies and their dynamic structural transformation remain challenging despite significant efforts in the past two decades. This research aims in developing novel scientific knowledge and strategies for DNA-origami based macromolecular synthetic topologies capable of on-demand structural transformation, particularly in response to external light signals. The three objectives of the project are to: 1) construct topological DNA origami nanostructures; 2) demonstrate on-demand reconfiguration by photo-controlled base-pairing; and 3) elucidate shape-changing mechanisms of photo-activated intercalation. The outcome of the proposed studies includes new principles of photo-regulated shape-changing mechanisms including photo-controlled base pairing and photo-activated intercalation. Furthermore, this award is expected to elucidate the correlations between structural rigidity, and the necessary energy sources required for the mechanical deformations through combined experimental and theoretical studies. These reconfiguration of dynamics will be examined as functions of photo-responsive agents and transformation modes such as stretching, bending and twisting, as well as topological designs and environments. If successful, this research may transform both scientific community and industry by providing new principles and technologies for structurally adaptable materials which can be programmed to perform specific tasks. This interdisciplinary program will help broaden participation of underrepresented groups in cutting-edge research, some of them through campus-wide activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly supported by the Biomaterials and BioMaPS Programs of the Division of Materials Research in the Directorate for Physical and Mathematical Sciences, and the Genetic Mechanism Cluster and the Molecular Biophysics Cluster of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
