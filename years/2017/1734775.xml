<AbstractNarration>Part 1: The Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF) will convene a workshop and related activities focused on broadening participation in our scientific society, and in coastal and estuarine sciences.  Despite widespread recognition of the value of increasing participation of underrepresented minorities (URM) in the sciences, URMs are still significantly underrepresented in marine science. CERF is a multidisciplinary organization committed to advancing scientific understanding of estuaries and coasts and to promoting an inclusive culture for URMs in coastal and estuarine science.  The project will provide a targeted mechanism for URM students to participate in CERF?s conference and a URM-focused workshop, and engage a large cross-section of CERF members in discussions on expanding inclusiveness.  Results of the workshop and related activities will form the basis of CERF's comprehensive Broadening Participation Implementation Plan for achieving the diversity goals and objectives in the society's 2017-2022 Strategic Plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2:  This project will support diversity and inclusion efforts at CERF?s 2017 Biennial Conference, November 5-8, 2017, in Providence, RI.  CERF will provide support for URM students and mentors to participate in the conference, including URM student professional development through cohort building, mentoring, and participation in a URM-focused workshop, scientific sessions, and other conference activities.  The project will also build the capacity of CERF to achieve diversity and inclusion objectives through a transformative workshop focused on diversity issues and integrating conversations on inclusiveness throughout the CERF conference through varied activities.</AbstractNarration>

Despite this fundamental truth, the gap continues to widen between the overall number of college degrees granted in the marine disciplines and URM degree attainment. These trends have particularly disturbing implications for the nation's estuaries and coastlines, where much of the minority population in the U.S. resides: the diversity of the individuals studying, managing, and protecting these important natural systems does not reflect the diversity of those who live there.</p> <p>The Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF) is a multidisciplinary organization committed to advancing scientific understanding and wise stewardship of estuaries and coasts. Through this project, CERF (1) provided 11 URM students with professional development while inspiring and supporting them along their chosen career paths in coastal and estuarine science; (2) enhanced its capacity to broaden participation of URMs within the organization, and (3) raised awareness of issues surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion within the wider coastal and estuarine science community.</p> <p>Through this project, 11 URM students and their mentors were able to attend and participate fully in the 24<sup>th</sup> Biennial CERF Conference in November 2017. Through a series of workshops, URM students learned strategies for success in coastal and estuarine science professions, and students and mentors developed a support network. This network is maintained by formation of an online community and sustained through continued interaction with CERF. In addition, CERF members and conference attendees were educated on the value of diversity to science, identifying unconscious biases, and mechanisms to cultivate a culture of inclusion within the organization and attendees' home institutions. This information formed the basis of a new Broadening Participation Comprehensive Plan for adoption by the CERF Governing Board. Implementation of this Plan will increase diversity and inclusion within CERF, and, by extension, within members' home institutions, with the ultimate intended outcome of improving innovation and discovery in coastal and estuarine science disciplines. Finally, CERF's plans for broadening participation were synthesized within the more general context of diversity in coastal and estuarine science in a white paper entitled "Building and Embracing Diversity in Coastal and Estuarine Science and Management: A Socio-ecological Imperative".
