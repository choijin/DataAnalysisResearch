<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to establish a broadly applicable, breakthrough biocatalytic technology to produce an important class of compounds called chiral cyclopropanes.  Cyclopropanes are key intermediates that are used in the synthesis of drugs, crop protection agents, and high-value electronic chemicals. Products accessible using this technology have markets totaling more than $10 billion annually. If successful, the technology under development will create safer, cleaner, more sustainable routes to important chemical products that will lower cost by reducing the number of production steps, lowering the required capital investment, significantly decreasing waste. Replacing existing chemical routes with the more efficient and sustainable enzyme-catalyzed steps will also improve the purity of many advanced pharmaceutical intermediates used in the manufacture of drugs and crop protection chemicals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase I project proposes to build on the results from Phase 1 in which a highly efficient biocatalytic process for the manufacture of the drug ticagrelor was developed using a novel, engineered enzyme. We will create an expanded set of cyclopropanation biocatalysts with the capability to act on a wider range of starting materials, thereby broadening the scope and utility of this new enzymatic reaction. We will complete the development and commercialization of the process for production of the key intermediate for ticagrelor and initiate work to develop novel biocatalysts to produce ley intermediates for anti-viral drugs. We will also develop and commercialize a set of enzymes that can be used by drug discovery chemists to establish efficient routes for next-generation drugs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The discovery in the laboratory of Frances Arnold at Caltech that heme proteins could catalyze the formation of cyclopropanes opened new possibilities for biocatalytic reactions. This reaction to form cyclopropanes is not observed in nature, and had never been known previously as an enzyme-catalyzed chemical transformation. This project focused on examinging the range of products that could be produced using this new biocatalytic reaction.  A primary focus of this work was establishing a biocatalytic route to the cyclopropane intermediate for ticagrelor, a cardiovascular drug with a large and rapidly growing market. A novel enzyme as developed using the method of directed evolution to achieve efficient produciton of the desired drug precurosr in high purity. The enzymatic reaction was optimized to achieve a total turnover number for the biocatalyst of greater than 10,000, and a process to produce the enzyme by microbial fermentation was developed.   Further work was carried out to expand development of new carbene transferase enzymes to produce active ingredients for other pharmaceutical and crop protection targets. Key compounds that are useful in medicinal chemistry as  drug disvcovery building blocks were made using novel carben transferases.  An important lesson learned during the course of this project is the importance of handling the evolution of nitrogen gas that occurs during the reaction. The enzyme-catalyzed reaction is extremely rapid, and the resulting evolution of nitrigen can cause bubbling in the reaciton that must be controlled. The importance of qualifying the key raw mateirlas for commercialization was anotehr important factor.   Overall, carbeen trasnferase have been shwn to enable enzymeatic reaction that were previosly unknown, adn these reations can be used to proudce cyclopropane-based products in high purity once the enzyme has been optimized..
