<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Alexander Radosevich of The Pennsylvania State University is investigating inexpensive nonmetal compounds for hydrogen transfer catalysis. Geometrically distorted tricoordinate phosphorus compounds are prepared and evaluated for transfer hydrogenation catalysis via pentacoordinate dihydridophosphorane intermediates. The research involves an investigation of the mechanistic factors that permit hydrogen transfer reactivity with phosphorus-based catalysts and an assessment of the molecular and electronic design principles required to develop efficient nonmetal catalysts for valuable synthetic transformations. In conjunction with local partners, outreach efforts to promote active participation in science by K-12 students are being pursued including a summer research curriculum for high school students from underserved populations, and a chemistry-focused, interactive children's museum exhibit for young learners. The broader impacts of this work include potential benefits from the discovery of catalysts from less toxic, earth abundant elements as well as the introduction of students to active learning in science through non-classroom activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catalysts enable the preparation of medicines, materials and fuels in a scalable, economical, and environmentally responsible manner. This project focuses on the discovery of a new class of catalysts based on lightweight, inexpensive, and abundant nonmetal elements. The potential broader societal benefits include the production of chemicals and materials free of residual metals and in a sustainable manner.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit.  In this project, we established a new class of tricoordinate phosphorus compounds that helps expand our understanding of homogeneous bond activation and catalysis with main group elements. We established an approach to accessing compounds with the ability to express ?biphilic reactivity? at triccordinate phosphorus cycling in the P(III)/P(V) redox couple by enforcing low-symmetry, nontrigonal geometries on the tricoordinate phosphorus core. We obtained direct spectroscopic evidence that substantiates the electronic perturbation that accrues to these nontrigonal P(III) compounds and we have shown that the resulting compounds are capable of certain group transfer reactions including the hydroboration of unsaturated C-N bonded substrates.     The major intellectual outcomes of this project include: 1) An improved understanding of the manner in which structural distortion controls electronic structure at tricoordinate phosphorus, 2) An acquired knowledge regarding the ability of trianionic chelating structures to support phosphorus-based compounds not only in the tricoordinate P(III) oxidation state, but also in the tetracoordinate and pentacoordinate P(V) states, and 3) Demonstrations by which nontrigonal phosphorus compounds react in cooperation with their appended supporting 'ligands' in order to arrive at main group compounds exhibiting bifunctional behavior. The ability to access persistent phosphorus compounds with inherently distorted grounds presents new fundamental opportunities for novel elementary reactivity. Our results advance a working hypothesis in which lower-symmetry main group compounds are expected to display the electronic features necessary to support biphilic catalysis.     Broader impacts  This award resulted in the development of a structurally and functionally new class of catalysts composed of terrestrially-abundant elements in line with sustainability initiatives in chemistry.     This award supported in full or in part the training of: 2 postdoctoral researchers (now faculty in chemistry); 6 graduate students (two female), and 5 undergraduates (three female). The PI served as NSF-REU research mentor project to host undergraduate students for summer research experiences. Three undergraduates are coauthors on publications.     The results of the supported work were disseminated by presentations from the PI, including: lectures at major domestic and international scientific conferences, several dozen invited departmental seminars at domestic and international academic institutions, and numerous presentations at domestic industrial research and development sites.
