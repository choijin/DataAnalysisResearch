<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Description: The 10th International Workshop on Bulk Nitride Semiconductors (IWBNS-X) held in Espoo, Finland, from Sep 18. - Sep. 22, 2017 brings together researchers from around the world focused on understanding, developing, and applying semiconductor crystal growth technologies. Sharing and discussing the current state-of-the-art greatly contributes to advancing science and technology, thereby impacting society by enabling applications of these materials, such as inexpensive disinfection tools to reduce infections or energy-efficient electrical power conversion to reduce energy waste. Cross-pollination of scientific ideas across multiple specialized research fields positively impacts the scientific community in various countries. This workshop provides a unique opportunity for scientists to share and stimulate new ideas, learn new challenges and directions, and explore and promote new collaborations. The requested funding supports the participation of both junior and senior researchers from the U.S., while also increasing access for women, to enable further education as well as development of collaborations with international experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: This workshop brings together internationally leading scientists and engineers who are experts, working at the frontiers of wide bandgap materials, including device research and development. Leading experts present their recent achievements in the field of bulk nitride growth, controlling their properties and integrating these materials into optoelectronic or electronic devices and applications. Specific goals of this workshop include discussions of critical scientific challenges related to enabling nitride devices, while also facilitating international collaborations. Topics discussed at the workshop include: development of bulk nitride growth methods, understanding connections between growth parameters and materials properties, controlling doping uniformity and targeting desired doping levels, defect reduction and mitigation, advances in characterization of bulk materials, implementing advanced computational growth models, (vertical) device structures, and homoepitaxial growth of nitride devices. The workshop helps advance the field by sharing results and methods, inspiring new ideas, and initiation of new collaborations - all while enhancing career development of the participants by facilitating interactions with international experts.</AbstractNarration>
