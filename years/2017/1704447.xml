<AbstractNarration>This project will answer the fundamental question of what happens when solids or liquids burn. The burning of any material involves complex heat and mass transfer processes near the fuel surface. These reacting interfaces are commonly found in engineering problems where chemical energy is converted to thermal energy. Examples include biomass heating, solid rocket motors, and internal combustion engines. Mathematical models to describe these interfaces, however, continue to be one of the main challenges in predicting combustion performance. This study focuses on developing new mathematical theories and conducting laser-based measurements to understand the nature of reacting interfaces. The impact of this effort to society is to offer scientific insight in the conversion of fuels to useful energy for power production and heating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing accurate models to describe reacting interfaces remain a daunting task in combustion science. The fundamental difficulty is the coupling of thermal and mass transport with chemical reactions at length and time scales that are far smaller than system scales of interest. Compounding these challenges is the response of liquid or solid fuel surfaces, which regress during the burning process and are dependent on local flame structure. To reduce the degree of freedom of the problem, flamelet generated manifolds of the reacting interfaces will be explored in this research. The appeal of the new modeling approach is that it couples important mass and thermal transport processes with detailed descriptions of chemical kinetics, thus allowing for accurate predictions of energy conversion rates and harmful pollutants. The proposed method will be used to predict upward flame spread over both synthetic and natural materials. To validate model predictions, both direct numerical simulation and experiments are planned. The experiments will employ tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy to probe species composition and temperature near at the reacting fuel surface. The expected short-term impact of the research is to provide a flamelet generated manifold library to the combustion and fire modeling community. The long-term impact of this research is to provide a high-fidelity, broad-based computational tool and experimental techniques to understand and predict the burning of biomass materials.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></p> <p>The primary objective of this study has been to develop an advanced modeling and simulation framework for the ablating reacting boundary layer combustion of solid fuels. These types of problems have a large application space including fire safety, biomass combustion, and hybrid rockets. Additionally, this project focused on validating the developed computational tools through experimental measurements using two newly developed diagnostics &ndash; 1) laser-based measurement technique to probe the near-wall interfaces and 2) a non-intrusive flame to fuel radiative heat flux diagnostic.</p> <p>The first phase of the project focused on developing the laser-based diagnostic. This diagnostic was utilized to measure the near-wall concentrations of CO2 and H2O. It was found that the simplest direct absorption spectroscopy cannot be applied due to overlapping absorption features of both CO2 and H2O at the typical temperature, pressure, and concentrations studied. Thus, a new baseline fitting technique was developed that enables accurate determination of species concentrations. This technique was validated using another absorption technique, wavelength modulated spectroscopy. The new baseline fitting technique helped improve signal-to-noise ratio and also increased the detectability of the species by up to two orders of magnitude. This technique allowed to obtain measurements with multiple overlapping features enabling the study of multiple gases with fewer lasers, reducing the system cost and analysis complexity. It was further applied to measure the exhaust emissions of biomass hydronic heaters and the results were compared to the three-zone system level model developed to predict the exhaust.</p> <p>A second non-intrusive diagnostic was developed during this project that utilizes CMOS digital cameras to measure the flame field temperatures, soot volume fraction (SVF), and the flame to fuel surface radiative heat flux. The non-intrusive diagnostic developed in this project provides a field measurement along the entire fuel surface and allows model validation. This technique utilizes commercially available DSLR cameras and two-color pyrometry. The ratio of red and green channel signal intensities from the images is used to measure the flame field temperature. This diagnostic was applied to an upward flame spread experiment by neglecting the self-absorption effects. A novel approach was developed to reconstruct 3D flame volume from front and side views. A ray-tracing algorithm was developed to solve the radiation transfer equation to obtain the radiative heat flux from the flame to fuel surface. The results obtained from this approach were in very good agreement with experimental measurements where the flame was optically thin. However, in optically thick regions, the self-absorption effects become important and the values of heat flux were very high. To overcome these issues, the final phase of the project focused on including the radiation self-absorption effects. This was achieved through joint experimental and modeling effort where, the flame properties were looked-up from tabulated 1D flame solutions using the ratio of intensities obtained from the camera images. The flame temperatures and SVF values were directly obtained from the flame solutions and naturally accounted for self-absorption effects through camera signal. The radiative heat flux results found to be improved in comparison to the previous technique in the optically thick flame regions.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p> <p>The project has provided a graduate student with the opportunity to participate in the Pathways Intern Employment Program (IEP) at NASA Langley Research Center.&nbsp; The student is currently working in the Advanced Measurement and Data Systems branch on optical diagnostics for experimental testing.</p> <p>The experimental diagnostics and modeling approaches developed in this study are also being directly used in an Army SBIR project on exploring the fire safety of light weight Army tent shelters. The Army project is in collaboration with Reaction International Engineering - https://www.reaction-eng.com/ . The developed diagnostics and models are the primary focus on exploring flame spread on PMMA and wax fuels in microgravity on a recently funded project by NASA that focuses on utilizing the data obtained by NASA during their BASS II project. Furthermore, the developed diagnostics, numerical model and the experimental setups will be used in a center level award grant by DoE under PSAAP III to investigate the Exascale simulation of hybrid rocket motors. Apart from these projects, we are also extending the developed diagnostic on FLARE, a situational tracking system for fire-fighters. The proposed project is in collaboration with 3AM Innovations, a local Buffalo company (https://www.3aminnovations.com/). This project will be funded under UB CAT - http://www.buffalo.edu/bioinformatics/resources/funding-incentives/ub-cat.html program. The main focus of the project is to extend the capabilities of FLORIAN (software environment) by including a smartphone interface that will enable fire-fighters to capture the videos of the live fire. At the back end the uploaded videos will be processed through the 3D ray-tracing code and provide fire temperatures, pollutant information, and the radiative heat flux field in real-time. These measurements will enable fire-fighters to analyze the fire spread and take necessary controlling measures along with warning them of the harmful pollutants.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/06/2020<br>      Modified by: Paul&nbsp;E&nbsp;Desjardin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1704447/1704447_10499841_1607115459458_TCP--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1704447/1704447_10499841_1607115459458_TCP--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Two-Color Pyrometry Temperature"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1704447/1704447_10499841_1607115459458_TCP--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Two-Color Pyrometry Temperature"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Front and side view images of flame spread along PMMA and their corresponding temperature fields.</div> <div class="imageCredit">S.
