<AbstractNarration>Aerial robots, commonly referred to as drones, offer promise in several research, educational, defense and commercial applications.  Some examples include precise agriculture, aerial photography, agile inspection and monitoring, and package delivery.  In most of those applications that aerial robots have started venturing outside the research lab and into the real world, robot operation is often semi-autonomous.  Semi-autonomous operation typically assumes availability of GPS signal for localization, and at least some prior information about the working environment. Sensory-based, fully autonomous operation in unknown environments remains mostly at the research stage.  Yet, endowing full autonomy to aerial robots can enhance their impact on the nation's education, economy, and defense.  To this end, it is important to seamlessly merge perception, planning, and control for autonomous robotic flight in unknown environments.  This can be achieved by integrating machine learning tools into aerial robot perception and control.  Deep learning has recently emerged as a promising way to extract semantic meaning for autonomy.  Learning perception and control for autonomous flight can be approached by replacing hand-engineered map representations with raw sensor observations, and learning appropriate responses.  However, this is not a straightforward task, and several challenges remain.  This workshop critically addresses how to i) best incorporate memory and ii) derive safety guarantees for the learning-based system.  These two aspects are necessary to improve the capacity of aerial robots to operate autonomously in unknown environments, and to push forward the current state-of-the-art in robotic flight.  In addition to the domain of robotic flight, the outcomes of this workshop are relevant to endowing autonomy in general robotic systems that are able to learn, thus helping make autonomous robots ubiquitous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this workshop is to address the theoretical and technical challenges faced in order to endow learning-based systems with the capacity to operate autonomously in unknown environments.  A critical step in this effort is to understand how memory-augmented autonomous learners can operate with provable safety guarantees.  The workshop thus examines two highly-relevant questions.  i) How to theoretically analyze the data and structure of learning-based systems to provide guarantees on safety and task success?  ii) What is the effect of long-term memory and, in particular, can recurrent connections or dynamic external memory replace global map information?  The workshop seeks answers to these questions by bringing together experts from robot planning and control, reinforcement learning and deep learning, and formal methods. The workshop also solicits participation of contributed authors working in relevant areas.  These include but are not limited to applying deep reinforcement learning for vision-based control of underactuated robots; learning visuomotor policies and deriving formal guarantees for learning based on neural networks; and developing neural network architectures that involve temporal recurrence and memory.  The above questions are asked here in the context of high-speed aerial robot autonomous navigation.  However, their scope can be generalized to other areas of robotics that learning perception and control for autonomous operation in unknown environments is desirable; examples include manipulation and legged locomotion.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project was to support travel expenses for (student) participants from underrepresented groups in STEM to technical meetings (co-)organized by the PI on engineering topics that are currently at the forefront of research.  The award supported partial travel expenses for participants in two workshops co-organized by the PI.  These are (1) "Learning perception and control for autonomous flight: safety, memory, and efficiency," which took place under the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) conference in MIT, Cambridge, MA on July 16, 2017; and (2) "Design and Control of Small Legged Robots," which took place under the RSS Conference on June 30, 2018.  Both workshops brought together highly-cited researchers from Academia and Industry as well as several student participants.  Both workshops were quite successful and attracted audience.  The RSS'17 workshop on learning-based navigation gathered over 120 participants, while the RSS'18 workshop on small legged robots gathered over 50 participants.   RSS'17 Workshop: The workshop featured technically thorough presentations on learning-based autonomous systems.  These presentations offered a well-rounded literature review of key prior results, as well as interesting insight on new findings.  The focus of the workshop was primarily on investigating (1) how to provide performance guarantees, and (2) how to best handle memory in learning-based autonomous systems.  While these two areas are very important for practical applications of autonomous vehicles, there is not a solid understanding yet on how memory can be manipulated to increase the efficiency of these systems and what ramifications this may have in the overall performance of the system.  Presented results as well as discussions during the workshop are very likely to lead to new research directions in the near future, to improve the performance and efficiency of learning-based autonomous systems.  The award supported partially or fully four student workshop contributors from US Institutions, one of whom is from underrepresented groups in STEM, as well as three of the workshop's invited speakers.   RSS'18 Workshop: The workshop brought together researchers from planning and control, mechanisms and design, and biology to examine the challenges and opportunities surrounding the design and control of small legged robots.  Invited presentations offered a well-rounded literature review of key prior results, as well as interesting insight on new findings.  The primary focus was to address challenges regarding (1) how new materials and processes can lead to unified approaches in design and manufacturing of small legged robots in a reliable and cost-efficient manner, and (2) what control approaches can ensure reliable controlled operation of small legged robots in realistic case studies.  The workshop discussed open challenges regarding how to design the next generation of small legged robots, how to best control their motion given the inherently uncertain foot-ground interaction, as well as the role of machine learning on this area of robotics research.  Presented results as well as discussions during the workshop are very likely to lead to new research directions so as to improve the performance and efficiency of small legged robots in real-world applications.  The award supported partially or fully two student workshop contributors from US Institutions, as well as five of the workshop's invited speakers (one PhD Candidate, one PostDoc, three Faculty), two of whom are from underrepresented groups in STEM.
