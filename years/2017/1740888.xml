<AbstractNarration>The Between Geometry and Relativity summer school (July 17-21, 2017) and conference (July 24-28, 2017) will be held at the Erwin Schr√∂dinger Institute (ESI) in Vienna, Austria, as two major focus events of the Geometry and Relativity program (July 17-September 8, 2017).  The program will bring together doctoral students, promising young researchers, and leading experts to discuss spectacular recent developments in the nexus of geometric analysis and general relativity, to assess new avenues for investigations, to support existing collaborations, and to promote new ones.  In recent years, gravitational wave experiments such as that of LIGO have seen striking advances, confirming phenomena anticipated by general relativity (Einstein's theory of gravitation).  These developments have led to a new surge of activity in the study of cosmological models, black holes, and other areas in the field.  The summer school is designed to introduce aspects of the field to graduate students and other junior investigators, and at the conference participants will learn about a range of current research questions.  The ESI program affords young researchers the opportunity to enhance the development of their research program through interaction with established and emerging leaders in the field.  This grant will provide support for graduate students and other junior investigators from the U.S. interested in attending the conference and/or summer school, and who would otherwise be unable to do so without this support.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of the Einstein equations as a model for gravitational phenomena involves deep and fundamental relationships between geometric analysis and physics.  Spectacular progress has been made in recent years on several fronts, including the study of wave equations on black hole space-times (with the eventual goal of understanding black hole stability), cosmic censorship, dynamical formation of black holes in vacuum, topology of black holes, and a better understanding of the moduli space of solutions to the Einstein constraint equations that govern geometry of initial data for the Cauchy problem.  Recent advances in numerical analysis of gravitational phenomena highlight the need to push the theoretical boundaries of the initial value formulation (both in constructing solutions to the constraints and in understanding the evolution of these initial data sets) and to create a bridge between the researchers in these areas.  The purpose of the summer school and conference is to introduce graduate students and other junior investigators to the tools needed to approach such results and to frame some outstanding open problems in the field.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The study of the Einstein equation as a model of gravitational phenomena involves deep relationships between mathematics and physics.  Mathematical general relativity is a vibrant field, with outstanding recent progress in the field on a number of fronts.  Gravitational wave experiments such as that of the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), whose Nobel-prize-winning discoveries have confirmed phenomena anticipated by general relativity, have grabbed the headlines, and the imagination of people around the globe.  Recent breakthroughs in mathematical relativity include progress on our theoretical understanding of black holes.  There has been a surge of excitement around these and other results, energizing the worldwide community of mathematicians and physicists who are making progress in mathematical relativity.   The summer school "Between Geometry and Relativity," held at the Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger Institute and University of Vienna (July 17-21, 2017), brought together an international group of over 100 graduate students and postdocs in mathematics and physics, from students early in their careers to those who were more advanced, and representing an array of interests and specialties in the field.  Introductory lectures supplemented four mini-courses on mathematical aspects of general relativity, which were in turn complemented by two lectures on state-of-the-art astrophysical evidence for the existence of a black hole at the center of our galaxy, and by two lectures on gravitational wave detection.   The school served as an introduction to the thematic program at the Institute, which also included a conference the week after the summer school, and a workshop at the end of the program. An indication of the success of the school is the overwhelmingly positive response to a questionnaire filled out by many participants, addressing the topics presented, as well as the level and amount of material covered.   The NSF award provided partial travel support for the participation of nineteen graduate students and posdocs from U.S. institutions, including six from underrepresented groups, in the summer school, and/or the subsequent conference and workshop.
