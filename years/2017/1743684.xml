<AbstractNarration>Oak Ridge Associated Universities, Inc. (ORAU) requests National Science Foundation (NSF) support for selection and attendance of US graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to attend the Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF) in 2017. The Heidelberg Laureate Forum takes place annually in Heidelberg, Germany, and brings 200 young researchers in the computer and mathematical sciences together from all over the world with a group of typically 30 laureates of the Abel Prize, Fields Medal, Turing Award, and Nevanlinna Prize, and is patterned after the Lindau Meeting of Nobel Laureates in the physical sciences. The ORAU has formalized a partnership with the HLF to organize a U.S. delegation for participation in the meetings. This proposal requests support for a total of 9 graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in computer science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ORAU proposes to support this program by promoting and advertising the opportunity; recruiting from and selecting a diverse pool of applicants; developing and maintaining a program Web site for recruiting, selecting, information and dissemination; coordinating travel and orientation activities for participants, and conducting a follow-up survey to document the program's impact.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award funded seven PhD students (three males and four females) to attend the Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF) held in Heidelberg, Germany from September 23 to September 29, 2018.  This delegation of the future American computer scientists was enabled with the opportunity to interact with Laureates of prestigious computer science and mathematics awards - namely the Abel Prize, Fields Medal, Nevanlinna Prize, and the A.M. Turing Award - and with other high caliber graduate students from around the world.  HLF provided opportunities to form new research collaboration with Laureates and other students.  Participants gained a valuable global perspective on computer science that prepares them for leadership in the global community.  As one supported student received special assistance through the use of a computer-aided device. She was unable to travel to Germany for the meeting, so she participated virtually through a device called a telepresence robot. Through this device, the young researcher participated in lectures, conversed with Laureates and interacted with other young researchers from around the world. The participant related that "one of the primary reasons that I am yearning to attend the Heidelberg Laureate forum is to promote the public understanding of mathematics and computer science from the perspective of improving the quality of life for individuals with physical disabilities through the advancement of robotics."

The philosophy of the HLF is rooted in the words of the late Dr. Klaus Tschira, forum founder. He wrote: "Mathematics and computer science pervade all aspects and spheres of life.  They provide the foundation for today's highly engineered and modern society, and they belong to our culture.  Their social relevance will continue to grow."  In that spirit, the meeting connects these young researchers to collaborate and further the discipline as they mature professionally and to bridge the gap between the generations of computer science research. One young researcher described the value of the meeting through the comment, "Even though my research topics haven't changed, I'm now more aware of the topics of interest for people around the world, in other areas."  The HLF gave participants an opportunity for interaction that is typically not available within their normal university environment, whereby Laureates provided formal plenary lectures and led small group discussions with topics driven by a combination of prepared presentations as well as student questions.  The Laureates presented on a broad selection of topics related to computer science. One young researcher stated that she had the chance to speak with some Fields Medal recipients who had very encouraging ideas.  This year's events included poster sessions, a Women in Math exhibition, and several networking events.  Based on feedback collected, the supported students overwhelmingly reported that this was an invaluable experience.  The general consensus found in the participants' feedback included having the opportunity to speak with Laureates about their research, receiving inspiration and ideas, and a sense that the experience was a unique and positive opportunity that every PhD student would value.
