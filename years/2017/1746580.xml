<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an improvement in how artificial limbs (prostheses) are fitted to the individual user. This promises better rehabilitation outcomes for people with limb loss, which lowers the risk of long-term health issues, such as accidental falls, back pain, or conditions that are associated with a sedentary lifestyle. All those risks can carry substantial direct and indirect costs for the individual and the society at large. There are approximately 2 million Americans who are living with limb loss, and who will potentially benefit from better prosthesis fit. Beyond the expected long-term benefits, these individuals will experience immediate benefits that include a more inconspicuous gait pattern, a reduction in skin and muscle soreness, and an increase in activity radius. The commercial impact of this research will extend to the industry of prosthetic componentry manufacturing. Currently, the structural elements of prostheses are mass-produced, strictly mechanical components. The proposed work will entail the integration of miniature sensors into those components, which will make them more valuable, and - along with the economical long-term benefits - justify higher unit prices and thereby a substantial growth potential for this $400M market. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is focused on optimizing the static alignment of limb prostheses. This alignment needs to be carefully fine-tuned to each individual user of a prosthesis. The associated work is the domain of the prosthetist, who depends on experience, patient feedback, and intuition to achieve acceptable results. There are currently no easy ways to measure and track alignment changes throughout this process and therefore no data-based approaches to improving it. In the proposed project, small scale sensors will be integrated into the conventional alignable prosthesis components. These will provide continuous, accurate real-time measurements of alignment changes. It is planned to make those measurements available to the prosthetist via smartphone or tablet PC, so that they can help streamline the alignment optimization process. In the future, if it is possible to analyze the so collected data from thousands of alignment procedures, scientific methods can be applied to solve the problem of imperfect prosthesis alignments. The proposed work will be focused on customizing the sensors and associated hardware to existing standard components without making them much heavier or more expensive. Preliminary tests of the device with a sample of prosthetists are part of the planned Phase 1 project as well.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The work conducted over the Phase 1 project period has adhered closely to the original technical objectives. With the exception of some objectives that were not fully achieved due to unforeseen technical challenges, the development and the demonstration of feasibility of our technology was successful.  The main goal of the work was to adopt our existing alignment angle sensing technology that is embodied in a hand-held "clamp" device for application as a prosthesis-integrated module ("chip") in order to increase ease of use, accuracy, and reimbursable value.  In an early step, we changed the geometry of the device housing in an attempt to make the form factor compatible with permanent attachment to the outside of the prosthesis adapter. This was partly successful in that it could utilize many of the existing components and achieve a similar level of accuracy. However, the size and position of the device was found to be unacceptable for routine use in the clinic.  Subsequent work focused on miniaturizing componentry in order to fit it into the hollow space on the inside of the prosthetic pylon. Among the involved challenges were wireless signal attenuation and, associated with that, battery life restrictions. Optimizations of the power management and transfer rate were attempted to mitigate the clinical impact of those issues.  Concurrently, additional work was dedicated to software development, both to reduce measurement error rates and to improve the ergonomics and utility of the user interface. In that context, several iterations of a dedicated App were devised and tested, resulting in a near production version that is compatible both with the integrated "chip" device variant and the traditional "clamp" device.  We also advanced the objective of integrating our technology with existing electronic health record platforms, which is an important component of our marketing strategy. We have struck collaboration agreements with the Orthotics and Prosthetics Group of America (OPGA) and with nymbl systems to that end.  Extensive customer discovery and marketing activities were conducted at various meetings with stake holders and at the annual national conference of the American Academy of Orthotists and Prosthetists (AAOP).

This complements another conference abstract that describes the results of bench testing and that has been accepted for presentation at the 2019 World Congress of the International Society for Prosthetics and Orthotics (ISPO).  Further documents to result from this project work include a SBIR Phase 2 application that is currently being compiled.  The Phase 1 award supported the work of numerous people, including the core team at APO-Technologies, Jack Crowley and Karl Nelson (co-founder and PI Jon Akins passed away in February 2018, co-founder Goeran Fiedler was ineligible due to his association with University of Pittsburgh), along with Esteban Ruiz who took over as the PI, interns (Carlee Moran, Caspar Nguyen) and external consultants or contractors (Mark Smith, Alparen Topay).

Building up on the gained experience and insights, the next steps on the way to commercialization for APO-technologies are a launch of our first product line (the "clamp") in fall of this year, pending any design changes that may be inspired by the beta test results, and the continued advancement of the "chip" device design for eventual integration in every prosthesis adapter.
