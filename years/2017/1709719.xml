<AbstractNarration>This award is funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) Program in the Division of Chemistry. It is a collaboration between Professors Jinyong Liu and David Volz at the University of California, Riverside, and Prof. Yujie Men at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Together with their graduate students they study perfluorinated compounds (PFCs). PFCs are a family of chemicals that have the same carbon backbone as hydrocarbons but all atoms attached to the carbon backbone are fluorine instead of hydrogen. Carbon-fluorine (C-F) bonds are highly stable. Surfaces modified with PFCs are resistant to both water and oil. Thus, PFCs are widely used in fire-fighting foams, electronics, lubricants, outdoor apparel and equipment, and on-sticking cooking ware. The stability of C-F bonds makes PFCs also very difficult to degrade in the natural environment. Synthetic PFCs have been globally detected in the environment and living organisms. Bioaccumulation of PFCs has been connected to a variety of human health problems. However, current technologies are not effective in PFC degradation via breaking the C-F bonds (i.e., defluorination). Therefore, it is desired to develop both new PFCs that can be degraded more easily and new strategies for removing these compounds from the environment.   This research investigates the structure-activity relationships, reaction mechanisms, and products of cobalt-catalyzed removal of fluorine from of PFCs in abiotic and microbial environments. Outcomes may contribute to solving PFC pollution challenges by providing fundamental guidelines to the design of novel degradable PFCs and microbial remediation in natural environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research employs a multi-faceted approach combining chemical and biological tools to investigate cobalt (Co)-catalyzed defluorination of PFCs. The team investigates the product of PFC defluorination after Co-catalyzed reactions. The structure-activity relationship between the Co coordination sphere in chemically and biologically synthesized complexes and the defluorination activity is investigated.  The redox environment enabling abiotic and microbial defluorination reactions is determined. Three PhD students receive interdisciplinary training. Undergraduate and high school researchers from a diverse student population are exposed to interdisciplinary training, specifically topics related of sustainability. The broad community is reached via a public-oriented science conference and other events.  Results may be applied to biomimetic catalyst system design, synthesis of novel fluoro-pharmaceuticals, and toxicology evaluation of novel fluorochemicals.  Outcomes of this project have broad impacts on transforming industrial fluorochemical design.  Research efforts are coupled with educational and outreach plans designed to broaden participation from underrepresented minorities in Chemistry, Environmental Science, and Chemical / Environmental Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We investigated the structure&ndash;reactivity relationships within branched per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) undergoing cobalt-catalyzed reductive defluorination reactions. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal correlations among the extent of PFAS defluorination, the local C&ndash;F bonding environment, and calculated bond dissociation energies (BDEs). In general, BDEs increase in the following order: tertiary C&ndash;F bonds &lt; secondary C&ndash;F bonds &lt; primary C&ndash;F bonds. A tertiary C&ndash;F bond adjacent to three fluorinated carbons (or two fluorinated carbons and one carboxyl group) has a relatively low BDE that permits an initial defluorination to occur. Both a biogenic cobalt&ndash;corrin complex (B12) and an artificial cobalt&ndash;porphyrin complex (Co-<em>PP</em>) are found to catalytically defluorinate multiple C&ndash;F bonds in selected PFASs. In general, Co-<em>PP</em>&nbsp;exhibits an initial rate of defluorination that is higher than that of B12. Neither complex induced significant defluorination in linear perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; no tertiary C&ndash;F bond) or a perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acid (tertiary C&ndash;F BDEs too high). These results suggest the promise of (1) designing branched PFASs and metal catalysts that promote complete defluorination of PFASs in natural and engineered systems and (2) evaluating potential impacts of specific PFASs in biological systems where B12 or other enzymatic metals species&nbsp;are present.</p> <p>We further extended the investigation on other emerging reductive processes such as UV-generated hydrated electron and metal-catalyzed hydrogenation, and a broad scope of PFAS varying in the type and position of functional groups, chain lengths, and linear/branched patterns. Critical structure&ndash;reactivity relationships within a series of representative PFAS structures, including perfluorocarboxylates, perfluorosulfonates, fluorotelomers, and perfluoroether compounds, and fluoroarenes were elucidated.&nbsp;Kinetic measurements, theoretical calculations, and transformation product analyses provide a comprehensive understanding of the PFAS degradation mechanisms and pathways. In particular, the rate and extent of perfluoroether degradation depend on both the branching extent and the chain length of oxygen-segregated fluoroalkyl moieties.&nbsp;These findings provide critical information for developing PFAS treatment processes and technologies to destruct a wide scope of PFAS pollutants and for designing fluorochemical formulations to avoid releasing recalcitrant PFASs into the environment.</p> <p>Using zebrafish embryos, we screened 38 PFASs for developmental toxicity and revealed that perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA) was the most potent developmental toxicant, resulting in elevated mortality and developmental abnormalities following exposure from 6 to 24 h post fertilization (hpf) and 6 to 72 hpf. PFOSA resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in mortality and abnormalities, with surviving embryos exhibiting a &gt;12-h delay in development at 24 hpf.&nbsp; Exposures initiated at 0.75 hpf also resulted in a concentration-dependent delay in epiboly, although these effects were not driven by a specific sensitive window of development. We relied on mRNA-sequencing to identify the potential association of PFOSA-induced developmental delays with impacts on the embryonic transcriptome. Relative to stage-matched vehicle controls, these data revealed that pathways related to hepatotoxicity and lipid transport were disrupted in embryos exposed to PFOSA from 0.75 to 14 hpf and 0.75 to 24 hpf. Therefore, we measured liver area as well as neutral lipids in 128-hpf embryos exposed to vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or PFOSA from 0.75 to 24 hpf and clean water from 24 to 128 hpf, and showed that PFOSA exposure from 0.75 to 24 hpf resulted in a decrease in liver area and increase in yolk sac neutral lipids at 128 hpf. Overall, our findings show that early exposure to PFOSA adversely impacts embryogenesis, an effect that may lead to altered lipid transport and liver development. The toxicity&nbsp;effects were not observed following exposure to the reductively defluorinated products from PFOSA.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Jinyong&nbsp;Liu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1709719/1709719_10500227_1609281220382_B12work--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1709719/1709719_10500227_1609281220382_B12work--rgov-800width.jpg" title="B12 PFC defluorination"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1709719/1709719_10500227_1609281220382_B12work--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="B12 PFC defluorination"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Molecular cobalt species such as B12 and Co-porphyrin complexes can catalyze reductive defluorination of branched perfluorinated compounds.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jinyong Liu</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jinyong&nbsp;Liu</div> <div class="imageTitle">B12 PFC defluorination</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
