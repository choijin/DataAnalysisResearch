<AbstractNarration>CBET - 1705474&lt;br/&gt;PI: Tryggvason, Gretar &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support participation of US scientists and engineers at the Japan-US Seminar on Two-Phase Flow Dynamics, which will be held June 22-24, 2017 at Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.  This is the 11th seminar in a series that started in 1979.  The goal of the seminar is to enhance progress in understanding two-phase flow dynamics and to accelerate the development of improved measurement techniques and predictive computational models.  Multiphase flows are found in many industrial processes, including boiling heat transfer in conventional boilers and nuclear reactors, atomization of liquid fuels, flow through porous media, filtration and separations, and certain kinds of catalytic reactors.  Multiphase flows are found in naturally-occurring processes, including heat and mass transfer at air-ocean interfaces, cloud formation and precipitation, sandstorms, avalanches, and coastal sediment transport.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the symposium are to disseminate recent research findings, establish new collaborations, and improve the training of students in multiphase flow phenomena. The meeting will consist of a series of keynote lectures and research presentations. Sessions topics will focus on evaporating flows, microscale two-phase flows, bubble swarms, numerical challenges, gas-liquid interfacial dynamics, bubbly shear flows, advances in measurement techniques, flow visualization, high-speed interfacial flows.  The seminar will also include laboratory tours and reports on two-phase flow research activities in the US, Japan and EU. Support will be provided to emerging scientists and junior faculty members with the goal of engaging young researchers in the science of multiphase flows.</AbstractNarration>

The Seminar was first held in 1979 and has served as an important forum for communication advances in research on multiphase flows, particularly those aspects found in conventional and nuclear power plants.

Advances in experimental techniques and diagnostics, progress in computational methods and simulations, and new ideas in modeling multiphase flows have all been discussed at the Seminars. The eleventh seminar was co-chaired by senior researchers from Japan and the United States, but organized by researchers at Hokkaido University. It consisted of nine sessions with a total of thirty-five presentations, including four keynote talks. Twelve talks, including two keynotes were presented by researchers from the United States. In addition, a special session on large scale research projects in multiphase flows consisted of short presentations and discussions by senior researchers from both countries. The delegates also visited research laboratories at Hokkaido University. The keynote presentations gave an overview of recent progress in experimental studies of shock propagation in cavitating flows, experiments on the effect of bubble clusters on turbulent flows, modeling and simulations of flow in bubble columns, and measurement of flow around large bubbles in pipes.
