<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project stems from a potential reduction in the capital cost of wind turbines by an astounding 15x. The Company's patented, remarkably simple design also reduces transportation, maintenance, and land costs, and provides greater location and altitude flexibility. It uses the same aerodynamics as today's dominant wind technology, the horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT), but with innovations that build on recent research into airborne wind energy generation. Multiple, 6-meter airfoils (they look like model airplanes) behave exactly like the outer tips of a conventional wind turbine blade, which is where most of the power is generated in a HAWT. The airfoils run along a rail- as if one captured kites and put them on short leashes - and a linear generator makes the power. The proposed research is a continuation of SBIR Phase I research and development that had demonstrated that these principles are scientifically sound. If successful, this Phase II project would drastically reduce the cost of wind-generated electricity, making it competitive with fossil fuels. It would thus be a completely self-sustaining commercially viable entity, creating jobs and generating tax revenues. By out-competing fossil fuels, it would use market forces to encourage renewable energy development, thus reducing energy-related emissions and improving national health, prosperity, and welfare. The project's light weight, low profile, and easy, flexible set-up may also have military and emergency applications that would help secure the national defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology captures energy through translational rather than rotational motion in the tips of the airfoils as they run along a rail tethered by bridles. Its major innovation is a patented bridling system that handles downwind forces (aerodynamic tip-over forces), which are the primary cause of the HAWT's mass and cost. Another major innovation is to run airfoils in an oval rather than a circle. This alters the math behind swept area, the key input for generation capacity. Because the oval's swept area is a function of length and height, rather than radius squared, this project can add capacity in many different ways, escaping the tyranny of building ever-bigger and -taller circles. The first objective is to design, test, build, measure, and refine a 100 kilowatt (kW) device. A meaningful-scale second-generation device will demonstrate the project's ability to meet performance, weight, and cost targets, while facilitating decisions about how to build far larger devices, and modeling their costs. The methods and approaches will continue to conquer challenges in five subsystems: structures, aerodynamics, power generation, control, and grid integration. The team, which includes leading experts in both academia and industry, will design subsystem options. It will convene to find the best system-wide design and construct the device, with many refinements along the way.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The AirLoom Wind Energy System has the potential to completely transform the wind energy industry.  Like traditional wind turbines, the AirLoom is a lift-based device.  However, the AirLoom translates along a lightweight oval rail, rather than rotating around a hub.  We can cover massive swept area at a remarkably low cost.  In addition, there are very positive implications for view plane, zoning, infrastructure, and environmental footprint.  This unique patented geometry reduces the levelized cost of wind energy (LCOE) by 75% or more.   With this NSF SBIR Phase II grant, we developed power electronics and a System Control and Data Acquistion (SCADA) system that successfully demonstrates positive power generation.  The core concept is validated.  Our wireless SCADA system responds to environmental changes (wind speed, wind direction, speed of the wing, curve dynamics) four times per second, and logs data at a frequency of 100 times per second.  It is responsible for autonomous optimal speed and optimal pitch angle to maximize energy production.  We investigated three power take-off topologies for this unique machine -- (1) a transverse flux linear generator, (2) a rack-and-pinion based generator on each wing, and (3) a continuous belt power take-off system.  We explored system dynamics, and methodologies to mitigate extreme aerodynamic and kinematic forces that the system generates.  This mitigation will allow us to meet the 20 year lifespan expected of wind energy systems.  We built a highly efficient three phase motor controller that is efficient and responsive to our very  dynamic power needs.  Various control algorithms (field-oriented control, direct torque control, and PID speed control) are implemented in firmware.  These power electronics and control algorithms form the brains which assures the system captures power efficiently.  In addition to our single wing system, we built our first multi-wing system (six wings).  Testing and evaluation of this system will continue over the next several months.  Once complete, we are in a position to rapidly upscale our technology and drive the cost of wind energy to very, very low levels.  We have alpha partners ready to install our system at the three industry scales -- residential, distributed, and utility.   We are grateful to the National Science Foundation for assisting us in developing this completely new wind energy generation system.
