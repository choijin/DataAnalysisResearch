<AbstractNarration>The conference "A Broad Perspective on Finite and Infinite Dimensional Dynamical Systems" will be held in Barcelona, Spain, June 12-16, 2017.  The event aims to serve as a launching pad for advancing the frontiers of research, and for promoting international collaborations between scientists from the USA and abroad. The NSF award will defray the travel expenses of attending the conference for PhD students, young researchers, and participants from the USA with no current NSF support, including members of under-represented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the core of this conference stands the interdisciplinary approach to fundamental problems at the interface of finite and infinite dynamical systems, partial differential equations, and geometry. This approach has lead in the recent years to the development of innovative methodologies, including computational tools, that are relevant to working scientists in different fields, such as molecular biology, particle accelerators, plasma confinement, condensed matter, geophysical fluid dynamics, astrodynamics,  and astrophysics. The conference will showcase and disseminate recent progress in the field, unfold innovative ideas, and jump-start new research projects.
