<AbstractNarration>The U.S. Supreme Court decides cases by way of an adversarial system of justice. In particular, lawyers from opposing sides of each case write legal briefs that attempt to persuade the justices that their view of the law is the most correct. To make their case, lawyers base their legal arguments in existing court decisions, known as precedent. Because some precedent is more relevant and influential than others, there will be differences in the overall strength of the lawyer's arguments. Consequently, this project will generate an empirical measure of legal quality that identifies the strength (or weakness) of each side's legal arguments in a case. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To generate this measure of legal quality, this project will draw extensively from the archival materials of retired Supreme Court justices. To do so, the project will examine bench memoranda, which are documents prepared by each justice's law clerks. The project will digitally photograph, content analyze, and make publicly available over 6,000 bench memoranda spanning nearly a dozen retired justices, from 1946-1994. These bench memoranda offer an evaluation of each side's legal arguments, based on the information provided in the legal briefs submitted by the parties, as well as that provided in the amicus curiae briefs, in each case. This project will use the information from the bench memoranda to evaluate and then create a measure of legal quality based on multiple aspects of legal doctrine. This resulting empirical measure, when combined with existing available data, will enable assessment of the impact of law on the Supreme Court's decision making process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main objective of this project was to create a measure of legal quality to assess the impact of law on Supreme Court decision making that can be applied across a wide variety of cases, issue areas, and terms, to understand how justices are constrained by law.  To do this, I photographed over 100,000 pages of bench memoranda from Justice Harry Blackmun and Justice Thurgood Marshall?s archives at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.  In order to analyze the contents of these memoranda, I ran each photo through optical character recognition software to convert photographs to searchable text files.  To create the measure of legal quality I extracted multiple pieces of information from the files, including the final recommendation as to how the case should be decided and the certainty associated with this recommendation.  I verified that my measure of legal quality is related existing measures associated with a quality legal argument, such as the experience of the attorney arguing the case.  I then was able to examine how legal quality impacts justices? votes. My findings suggest that law can constrain a justice from voting with their preferences and also liberate a justice to behave as he/she wishes.  Put differently, if a justice prefers to rule for the petitioner but the respondent has a stronger legal argument, a justice will be less likely to vote for the petitioner and more likely to vote for the respondent to win the case.  Yet, if the justice prefers the respondent?s position and the respondent also has a stronger legal argument, the justice is free to vote his/her preference.  In addition to testing new models, I also reevaluated existing theories.  One theory in particular that political scientists have called into question is whether an attorney?s oral argument performance actually impacts case outcomes before the Court. Existing research demonstrates that attorney?s oral advocacy has a significant impact on case outcomes, however conventional wisdom suggests it should not. Some researchers suggest it is easier for attorneys to advocate for their client if they have a stronger legal argument.  I find that not only does a strong legal argument increase a litigant?s likelihood for a positive case outcome, it can help overcome poor oral argument performance or ideological differences.  Other sections of the bench memoranda have proven extremely valuable as well.  One example of other data that have also been useful is commentary on amicus curiae briefs.  Bench memoranda demonstrate that many briefs simply repeat information provided in the parties? merits briefs, which is not helpful for the Court, and actually violates Rule 37 of the Supreme Court Rules. Alternatively, in some cases these briefs are very important because they are written and constructed much better than the litigants? briefs.  This commentary suggests wide variation in the utility of amicus briefs and which information is actually communicated to the justices.  This work would not have been possible without the help of smart and driven undergraduate research assistants, another goal of the project. I engaged many students interested in attending law and graduate school post-graduation, the vast majority of which are women.  I continue to use these data, primarily the photographs I took, on a regular basis in my teaching of both constitutional law and special topics classes on the United States Supreme Court.  Students repeatedly show enthusiasm and interest in being able get a glimpse of work material and information actually used by the justices to make their decisions.
