<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to explore the challenges of developing E-Witness - a system that allows civilians to use their smart devices to collect forensically sound multimedia evidence. In order to be considered authentic and forensically sound, a digital evidence needs to have a proof of being untampered and the time and location of the event needs to be attested in a way that it is immutable. Such research on forensically sound and anonymous evidence gathering is hard due to various challenging requirements: user friendly application interface, unbiased, collusion-resistant and privacy-preserving time-stamping service as well as accurate location attestation. The effectiveness of each aspect needs to be proved to build a robust system. The overarching reward of this project is its ability to record and validate facts in real-time while bringing forensic accountability to such collected evidence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The building blocks of E-Witness consist of: (a) a secure smart phone application, (b) a time-stamping service implemented as a public blockchain maintained by individual miners, and (c) a location-attestation service that provides confidence on the truthfulness of the location reported by the evidence device. A prototype will be developed and performance analysis will be performed over a testbed deployment to ensure correctness of all components of the system. A pilot study involving University users will be performed to identify the challenges of a large-scale deployment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcome Report   In this project, the goal was to develop a system for citizen journalism that enables civilian witnesses of crime, protests or other events. This goal was achieved through several iteration, each being informed by research as well as potential users and stakeholders such as journalists, activists and experts from the criminal justice system.  The first version of this system, that includes a smart-phone application, and a backend database has been available in the public domain on Google Play since 2018. A second iteration which integrates with a permissioned blockchain based on the Quorum blockchain was demonstrated at a conference in 2018. A third iteration, meant for large scale usage by the general public is under development. This iteration will include smart-phone applications for both android and iOs users, a dashboard to verify registered  media, integration with a major public blockchain and a secure API gateway to enable eWitness guarantees in third party business software.    The most notable outcomes are:   Involvement of undergraduate and graduate students at a minority serving institute.  Outreach through participation in tech incubators to explore commercialization prospects and widespread adoption of the technology.  Publications at conference proceedings and technical reports.  Presentations at conferences and panels.  Patent application.  Partnership with venture backed startup companies to bring the technology to market.  Participation in the NSF iCorp program for customer discovery       Last Modified: 01/25/2021       Submitted by: Shweta Jain]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
