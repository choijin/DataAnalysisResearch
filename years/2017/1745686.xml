<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore the product-market fit  for a conceptual model-based math intelligent tutors (COMMIT) for teaching students with learning disabilities or difficulties in mathematics.  The technology will help overcome a current impediment for these students' success in mathematics, the shortage of response to intervention curriculum materials and service providers.  The COMMIT products will potentially address a practical issue in today's inclusive elementary classrooms: the need to deliver individualized and effective intervention programs to those students who are not responsive to or are struggling with mathematics content in their regular classrooms. The COMMIT products will also promote the implementation of evidence-based practice and translation of research into practice. Because the COMMITs emphasize a conceptual model-based problem solving approach that orients students' attention to deep problem structure, it is expected that this program can also be used to improve mathematical learning of elementary students more broadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project, conceptual model-based math intelligent tutors (COMMIT), represents a shift from traditional mathematics problem-solving instruction, which focuses on the choice of operation for solution, to a model-based problem-solving approach that emphasizes an understanding and representation of mathematical relations in algebraic equations and therefore facilitates generalized problem solving skills. The COMMITs incorporate a constructivist view of mathematics learning so that the reasoning behind mathematics is explicit to the students. In other words, students will be able to make sense of what they are doing with mathematical models and abstract symbols. The COMMIT project will demonstrate how intelligent tutors will work with teachers in synergy and provide personalized curriculum recommendations that are based on a dynamic assessment of individual student's learning profile. COMMITs help build fundamental mathematical ideas that are essential to enabling struggling students to understand mathematics at a conceptual or abstract level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major objectives of the project were for the team to conduct interviews with people who are part of the eco system of the COMMIT (Conceptual Model-based Math Intelligent Tutors) program, and to discover specific customer segment and create a value proposition statement.   Through this NSF I-Corps program, we have learned that school teachers are short of mathematics intervention curriculum or materials that emphasize concept building, particularly conceptual understanding of mathematical problem solving involving students with learning difficulties. Conceptual Model-based Math Intelligent Tutors (COMMIT) provide teachers with a tool that will enable conceptual understanding of mathematical problem solving of students with learning difficulties.  The major outcome of this NSF I-Corps program is the customer segments we have identified, which include Headmasters of private schools; Principals, math teachers, special education teachers of Title I schools; as well as various learning academies for students with learning disabilities or difficulties.    Another outcome of this project is the interview data we obtained through this NSF I-Corps program. From interviewing potential customers of the COMMIT program (e.g., teachers, interventionists, parents, or any practitioners/educators who work with students with learning difficulties) we have learned about desired features of their dream-tutoring program, which in turn will guide our future effort to enhance the feasibility and usability of the COMMIT program.
