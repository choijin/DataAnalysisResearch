<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2017. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The host institutions for the fellowship are Duke University and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI; Philippines). The sponsoring scientists are Drs. Thomas Mitchell-Olds and Shalabh Dixit. This award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve lower production costs for rice the current agricultural trend is to shift from transplanting seedlings to direct sowing of seeds. Those seeds may have to germinate under anaerobic conditions due to flash flooding. The study of complex genetic variation and physiology in rice under anaerobic germination is necessary to produce seeds with traits that can fulfill societal and agronomical needs.  The training objectives in this project are to: 1) learn experimental and analytical approaches for genome association analysis of complex trait variation; 2) learn data analysis approaches that involve genome association and physiology data using machine learning implementation; and, 3) participate and lead outreach activities for minority groups and develop a multi-year curriculum focused on food security with Maureen Joy Charter School in Durham (NC). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study complex genetic variation and physiology of anaerobic germination (AG) in rice natural populations, by using new analytical methods to integrate diverse functional information to identify complex trait loci in genome wide association studies (GWAS). These methods can be applied to a range of traits in genetically tractable species. The main research goal is to identify candidate genes that influence quantitative variation for AG in rice, and to determine their mode of action. Specific objectives are to: 1) use GWAS to identify candidate genes associated with AG in sequenced rice genotypes; and, 2) determine the physiological and genetic correlations that contribute towards AG in rice. Data dissemination will be done through CYVERSE-http://www.cyverse.org/, IRIC- http://iric.irri.org/, and GenBank-http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra. Biological materials and seeds will be made available through IRRI-http://irri.org/our-work/seeds.</AbstractNarration>

Following heavy rains, direct-sowed seeds may need to germinate under anaerobic conditions, but most rice genotypes cannot survive these conditions. To identify the genetic architecture of complex traits, we quantified anaerobic germination percentages (AG%) in 2,700 (wet-season) and 1,500 (dry-season) sequenced rice genotypes and performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using 693,502 single nucleotide polymorphisms. This was followed by post-GWAS analysis with a generalized SNP-to-gene analysis, meta-analysis, and network analysis. We determined that AG% is intermediate-to-high among <em>indica </em>subpopulations, and AG is a polygenic trait. Our network-GWAS analysis identified several genes involved in a wide variety of metabolic processes that were evaluated using functional genomics approaches. We found three independent lines of evidence showing that one of our genes of interest is associated with high AG. We propose that our&nbsp;gene of interest influences the RNA directed DNA methylation pathway, causing enhanced survival of seeds to low oxygen and greater seedling establishment in flooded environments. Our work furthers the knowledge and understanding of pathways influencing AG. We suggest that these post-GWAS approaches can help prioritize polygenic candidates for other traits and agricultural challenges.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The result of this research have been presented in several research conferences such as: Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Sciences (Honolulu, 2019); American Society of Plant Biologists National meeting (San Jose, 2019); American Society of Plant Biologists Northeast meeting (New Hampshire, 2019); Plant and Animals Genomics (PAG) conference (San Diego, 2019); Duke University Ecology Retreat (North Carolina, 2018); The North Carolina School for Science and Math Science Day, public at this event were junior and seniors in high school (October 14, 2017).
