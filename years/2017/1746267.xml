<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes education of water engineering processes and training for success in the advanced technology economy and workforce. Plant Control will teach students the system that supplies safe drinking water to their schools and homes while applying chemistry and engineering concepts in an engaging format. Student exposure to engineering in high school is correlated to choice of STEM majors in college. The product will introduce students to a wide range of disciplines including civil, electrical, mechanical, biological, and materials to promote student choice of engineering majors. The disruption of clean drinking water in Flint, MI highlights the critical importance of safe drinking water and technical hurdles that an aging utility infrastructure presents. Water quality STEM concepts presented in this product are essential for a voting population to make local and federal decisions related to population growth and aging utility infrastructure. High School STEM classrooms are centers of innovation for students. This product will provide the students a sand-box tool to develop their own control and data acquisition as well as train them in software that is widely used in the controls and data acquisition industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop a simulation and remote plant model intended to engage students in a new context and compliment STEM engineering curriculum in K-12 environments. The goals of the research are to understand the effect of simulation learning tools on STEM education, to develop a simulator for educational and workforce training purposes, and to develop a programming tool to enable student and maker applications of control and data acquisition systems that is currently lacking in that market. Simulation development technical hurdles include flow modeling in a wide-range of student defined configurations, equipment and filtration media. The simulation developed in this project will be further applied in the water and wastewater market to train plant operators for standard and emergency plant operation conditions. The web-accessible remote plant model component of the project requires connectivity of nationwide users to the remote plant and protection of the physical plant equipment. The development platform used for control of the plant will be available to the students for modification and use in their own projects. The student-version will require a limited and simplified version of the professional platform currently available. Development of the student version will require platform reconfiguration and user capability modification.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Due to the urgent need for innovative water technologies to alleviate water access challenges, including water scarcity, contamination, desalination, and aging infrastructure, more emphasis should be placed on water engineering concepts in K-12 to develop the engineers of tomorrow in these areas. While current K-12 curriculum teaches water science concepts throughout, the growth in engineering education in K-12 provides a platform to teach students the engineered water cycle. Education in the engineered water cycle (the engineering design and infrastructure required to bring clean water to homes and purify wastewater for re-entry to our streams, lakes, and rivers) is lacking and is highly needed. With the inclusion of engineering design in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) as an equal to Physical Science (PS), Life Science (LS), and Earth and Space Science (ESS), an engineering water curriculum that connects to real jobs and engineering practice is in high demand by teachers, administrators, and curriculum providers. In addition to our Phase I research accomplishments, participation in the Beat-the-odds Bootcamp allowed our team to interview more than 50 decision makers in K-12 education that developed our understanding of the need for an engaging water engineering platform.  In the NSF SBIR Phase I grant period, January 1, 2018 to February 27, 2019, Brown Engineers has researched Water Engineering educational concepts, curriculum resources, and educational structures. In order to develop both a computer-based simulation and a hands-on design-build toolkit for students, we have focused our development efforts in Phase I on computer-simulation and computer gaming, as well as physical, hands-on Raspberry Pi and design-build kits.  To date Brown Engineers has accomplished the following objectives of the Phase I research:  -Development of a SCADA system-based water quality and treatment sim-set to teach basic water treatment concepts to high school and 2-year college students.  -Development of a proof-of-concept 3rd person water plant control video game.  -Development of a hands-on tool for students to engineer Water Plants and control them with SCADA systems.  -Development of a Water Concepts Assessment Test for pre-testing students prior to starting the Water Engineering course.  The main conclusions of the Phase I work are as follows:  -There is a large, unmet need in the education market for engineering education tools for the secondary education level.  -The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) include Engineering as equal to Science in the standards.  -Water engineering easily integrates into existing science curriculums, making water engineering a natural fit for teachers that are now required to teach the engineering design process (NGSS)  -The initial screens of the SCADA-based simulation have been built and prove feasibility to build a simulator in an industry standard SCADA software.  -The 3rd person video game can be developed using low-cost tools and will exceed the aesthetics of the graphics of the leading competitor.  -A design-build kit can introduce students to the engineering process and a real-life water storage system can be modeled using inexpensive kit components.
