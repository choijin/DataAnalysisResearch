<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical description: This project addresses the preparation and investigation of new materials made of semiconductor nanocrystals that can detect heat emitted by warm objects.  Examples of potential applications of thermal infrared technologies are rapid avoidance sensors of people for self-driving vehicles, sensing of specific greenhouse gas emissions, and eye-safe high-bandwidth optical communications through the atmosphere.  However, the widespread use of infrared devices in these types of applications is limited by the very high cost of the current technologies. The focus of the project is on semiconductor quantum dots.  The new material approach may completely transform the accessibility of mid-infrared technologies in our daily life for safety, surveillance, communication, health and pollution monitoring. The project supports research on the synthesis of novel quantum dots and the testing of their properties. In addition, the research offers advanced training opportunities for graduate students in physics and chemistry, while also supporting related outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description:  It has been recently shown that electron-doped colloidal quantum dots exhibit strong optical response in the mid-infrared from 3-12 microns and function as mid-infrared photodetectors and emitters.  The infrared response arises from the intraband optical transition between the two lowest electron states, while the wavelength is tunable by the size of the particle.  The project expands the range of electron-doped quantum dot materials with tunable and stable doping, including oxides and chalcogenides.  In parallel, laser studies in the mid-infrared enable the measurements of the photophysical properties of the different materials.  Studies of the quantum yield as a function of wavelength, materials, ligands, temperature and surrounding matrix are performed to understand and reduce non-radiative processes.  Pump-probe studies address the Auger recombination kinetics.  Time-resolved spectroscopy allows measuring the coupling to phonons and the homogeneous linewidths. This project defines the physical boundaries for the possible properties of these n-doped colloidal quantum dots, and therefore informs the degree to which these new infrared chromophores could transform infrared technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project was aiming to expand the range of colloidal quantum dots exhibiting a very promising infrared transition called the intraband transition, and to explore its photophysics, primarily lifetime, the coupling to phonons, the PL quantum yield, and the Auger process.  Besides the training of the next generation of scientists, its broader impact was the potential for making new materials for emission of infrared light which could find many applications from sensing monitoring, imaging, and through space communications.  The project funded primarily two PhD students and partially supported two others. Graduated students went to work at major US corporations or back to their country for academic positions.   The projectâ€™s major results relate to the Auger relaxation which is a mechanism by which semiconductors loose energy when there are too many electrons present.  This effect is a detriment to semiconductor light detectors and lasers, especially in the infrared.  Colloidal quantum dots allow to lower the density of states that the electrons can occupy and the project showed that this led to a significant reduction of the Auger processes in interband HgTe and HgSe and even a suppression in intraband HgSe CQDs. The results were published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters and ACS nano respectively. The Auger suppression discovered in n-doped HgSe CQD is the most important basic result and it confirms the promising nature of the intraband transitions.  In that grant, we also started the study of the photoluminescence of core/shell mercury chalcogenides.  A synthesis of HgSe/CdS/Se core/shells with 2-3 monolayers was developed and published in Chemistry of Materials. However, this led to a surprisingly small luminescence improvement and this highlights the fundamental problem of understanding and solving the low photoluminescence quantum yield of quantum dots in the mid-infrared.   The importance of the relation between making bright materials and good light detectors was highlighted in an article published in the Journal of Chemical Physics, showing a square root relationship between the emission efficiency and photodetector performance.  Seemingly counter intuitively, the best detector material is the one that purely reemits the absorbed photons if they are not detected.
