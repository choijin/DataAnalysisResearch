<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "Conference: A Noncommutative Geometry Festival in Shanghai" that will be held from March 23, 2017 to April 7, 2017 at Fudan University in Shanghai, China. Additional information is available on the conference website http://www.fdias.fudan.edu.cn/en/non-commutative-geometry-2/conference-info/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject of noncommutative geometry is being pursued by many leading researchers in various locations around the globe. The field of is presently going through a stage of critical development to the point where a conference bringing together the international community of researchers in the field is most timely. The conference will provide a unique opportunity for these researchers to obtain a good sense of the current state of the subject and to understand the future challenges in the area of noncommutative geometry. The conference will have broad scope and international participation. It is important that the next generation of  U.S. researchers be informed of the state-of-the art and future of this field. This award will enable the participation of graduate students, junior researchers, underrepresented groups and other U.S. based researchers without support to travel to this meeting and be in on the ground-floor of future developments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     We successfully organized a two week conference, a noncommutative geometry festival at Shanghai in Spring 2017. There were over 170 participants of this conference from all of the world, among which there over 100 junior researchers.  62 world leading mathematicians spoke in our conference covering almost all aspects of noncommutative geometry. Among the speakers, there 3 Fields medalists (Atiyah, Connes, Lafforgue), 1 Abel prize winner (Atiyah), and a Wolf prize winner (Sullivan). Aityah and Connes each gave a public lecture. The conference was full of inspiring talks. The speakers presented many state of the art results in noncommutative geometry, survyed its milestone achievements in the last 40 years, and casted exciting future directions of noncommutative geometry.  With the help from the local organizers, we supported 20 U.S. based participants focusing on junior researchers, underrepresented groups, and mathematicians without federal support. In this group, 13 participants are junior, 2 are female.          We also partially supported the following two conferences.   1. A noncommutative geometry workshop was held on May 21-May 25, 2018 at Texas A&amp;M University.   The week long workshop at Texas A&amp;M was a part of the Workshop in Analysis and Probability at Texas A&amp;M University. It provided an opportunity for young researchers in noncommutative geometry to share their ideas with peers and with some of the leaders of the field. The theme of the workshop was noncommutative geometry and index theory for group actions and singular spaces.  2. A Symposium on K-theory and noncommutative topology was held on October 22-25 at San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The symposium on K-theory and noncommutative topology at San Juan, Puerto Rico, was suggested by NSF program director to show our solidarity with the Puerto Rico mathematical community after the hurricane. Experts from all over U.S.A. and the local researchers based in Puerto Rico had a successful conference together about K-theory and noncommutative topology.
