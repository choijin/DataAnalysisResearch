<AbstractNarration>The research supported by this award will investigate how perceptions of a disaster are formulated in the immediate aftermath of the event. The researchers will investigate the proposition that social and economic position affects understanding of the disaster and thereby produces variable goals and plans for disaster mitigation and post-disaster reconstruction. Previous research has shown that disasters can reveal strengths and weaknesses in the behaviors influenced by social and cultural factors. In this project, the researchers explore how those revelations are produced in the immediate aftermath of making sense of what has happened and how they vary across different stakeholders. Findings will be disseminated to organizations that explore and manage the causes, consequences, and complexities of disaster management and recovery. Funding this research also trains students from underrepresented groups in social science research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID award supports the collection of data in Houston using anthropological ethnographic methods. The researchers will conduct saturated interviewing of city officials involved in land use planning, disaster reduction, disaster response, and disaster recovery. A stratified (by socio-economic, racial, and other variables) sample of community leaders will be researched through participant observation and interviews. The objective is to document how perceptions vary, how they develop over time, and how they affect the eventual mitigation and prevention plans that are produced. The research will produce a baseline ethnographic map (an ethnographic narrative that connects the social production of space with the social production of social difference and disaster vulnerability) of Houston that identifies city residents' varied problematizations of the disaster. This will provide a database baseline for future research and for stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>For anthropologists, disasters are the result of interactions between people and their environments in which the latter engage in behaviors (e.g. land use and political practices, social inequality) that enhance the materially destructive and socially disruptive capacities of geophysical phenomena, technological "accidents," and communicable diseases. While catastrophic events are often seen as extraordinary events, the natural hazards (e.g. hurricanes, earthquakes) that set them off are not the disaster in and of itself. Most importantly, the human practices that convert a hazard into a disaster are often accepted as part of ordinary life. However, because of their related social disruption, environmental transformation, and material loss, some anthropologists have analyzed the catastrophic phases of disasters as opportune moments that shed light on the social dimensions of disasters and provide a window for critical reflection (and perhaps mitigation) on their root causes.

We were particularly interested in using responses to this question to develop a better understanding of the vantagepoints from which Houston's diverse residents interpreted Hurricane Harvey's effects, how that vantagepoint affected the ways they imagined the policies and practices necessary to reduce the severity or likelihood of similar catastrophes in the future, and whether their vantagepoint changed over time as a result of the catastrophe's effects.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our project relied on what we called a &ldquo;purposive snowball&rdquo; sampling technique.
