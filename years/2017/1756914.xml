<AbstractNarration>People in the United States and throughout the world are highly dependent on fisheries for their food system infrastructure. Many fisheries are considered small-scale fishing operations, which play an important role in supporting livelihoods, contributing to food security, and combating poverty. Despite their importance, debates continue regarding the sustainability of fisheries as well as which management strategies are most effective in which contexts. In addition, communities throughout the world are increasingly inter-connected due to the globalization of markets and economies, the increasing use of technologies such as cell phones and the internet, and large-scale migration. In light of this, it is virtually impossible to find an example of a natural resource being managed at the local scale, without being influenced by external factors. Often, resources and resource users are subject to regulations and management regimes at multiple levels (such as federal and territorial, as in this case). Therefore, it is critical to examine how management institutions across scales impact one another and influence key elements of management, such as whether resource users cooperate with one another, and whether they participate in management processes. Findings will be disseminated to organizations and individuals that influence policy debates related to fisheries management. The project also provides training for graduate students in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis, and broadens the participation of groups traditionally underrepresented in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will produce a multi-level analysis of fisheries management structures and networks using a mixed-method approach. This research will be conducted in St. Croix, US Virgin Islands, a small island in the Caribbean whose residents are highly dependent on fisheries for nutritional, economic, social, and cultural reasons. Dr. Grace-McCaskey of East Carolina University will build on previous research conducted on the island to further understand how social differences and inequalities among fishers, managers, scientists, and other marine resource stakeholders impact fisheries management processes.  She will use a social networks approach to examine the web of complex relationships among individuals that may hinder or facilitate the exchange of information and resources. The study will conclude with a fisheries management workshop at which time the results (including social network visualizations) will be presented to encourage open discussion about social group interactions and geared toward fostering and improving communication across stakeholder groups involved in management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
