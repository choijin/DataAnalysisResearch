<AbstractNarration>This award is funded by the Chemistry Division's Chemistry of Life Processes Program. Professors Leonard Mueller and Li Fan from the University of California at Riverside bring together two of the tools of molecular imaging, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, to describe an enzymatic reaction with atomic resolution (the ability to distinguish between atoms of a molecule and between molecules). Enzymes catalyze specific chemical reactions that impact nearly all life processes. Yet the details of how they do this remain elusive. In this study, the location of all atoms including hydrogens, the smallest of all atoms, are described as the reaction takes place. The result is a unique and detailed view into the reaction that shows how atoms move during the process. This new method is applied to one enzyme in particular, but the basic approach should be widely applicable to many enzymes. This research is carried out by graduate and undergraduate students at UC Riverside and by first-generation undergraduate students from neighboring Claremont colleges. The researchers share their results and experience at scientific conferences and in the local elementary and high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops of NMR-assisted crystallography, the synergistic combination of solid-state NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and computational chemistry as an atomic-resolution probe of structure and dynamics in enzyme active sites. The goal is to understand the molecular basis for reaction specificity in the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzyme tryptophan synthase (TS). To accomplish this goal, Professors Mueller and Fan describe with atomic resolution, the transformation of substrates into product in the beta-subunit active site of TS. The location of all atoms is specified, including hydrogens, for multiple intermediates along the beta-reaction pathway. The combination of X-ray crystallography, solid-state NMR, and computational methodologies give chemically-rich detail that is not available when these methodologies are applied in isolation. Taken together, these techniques can provide consistent and testable models for structure and function in an enzyme active site: X-ray crystallography provides a coarse framework upon which models of the active site can be developed using computational chemistry.  These models can be tested by comparisons of their first-principles predicted chemical shifts and the results of solid-state NMR spectroscopy experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An innovative combination of X-ray crystallography, solid-state NMR, and computational methods have been developed and applied to make possible the investigation of enzyme catalytic mechanism at a new level of atomic detail. This combined methodology has the advantage that three-dimensional structural information derived from X-ray crystallography can be extended to include chemically-rich detail concerning the interactions between enzyme site residues and the reacting substrate that is not possible when these methodologies are applied in isolation. In effect, each technique is a puzzle piece offering a generous view of the big picture. However, only when correctly pieced together do they reveal the big picture at highest resolution.     Collectively, these methods act as a molecular camera that gives an atomic level snapshot of a key step in the mechanistic transformation of substrate to product within the enzyme active site of tryptophan synthase.  This work points to a new structural hypothesis for the location of the protons on the substrate and their surprising role in directing the next step in the catalysis.  The goal is to provide structural models that enable the rational design of drugs for use in the treatment of human disease and for the design of herbicides for use in agriculture.     This work has been supported by the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences under the Division of Chemistry.  This project brought together researchers with expertise in enzymology, X-ray crystallography, solid-state NMR, and computational chemistry to provide the first step toward a complete atomic level description of a multistep enzyme mechanism under conditions of active catalysis.  Faculty, staff, graduate, and undergraduate students have all contributed to the project and participated in outreach to the broader community.
