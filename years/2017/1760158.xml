<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the effect of Hurricane Harvey on the morphology and sedimentary characteristics of the beach area extending from the dune tow to the shoreline along selected beaches in Texas. Changes in sediment size and sorting, in response to storm surge and large wave forcing associated with the hurricane, are related to changes in morphology along the coastline.  Hurricane Harvey made a landfall near Port Aransas, TX on August 25th 2017, and beach systems in this region were disturbed significantly. Field experimental campaigns will be conducted at several of the affected beaches that cover the region of Corpus Christi - Port Aransas - Padre Island - Mustang Island, TX. Sediment samples and topographic data will be collected before the occurrence of a significant beach adjustment and during the early phases of the natural adjustment processes. This dataset will be used to develop a fundamental understanding on the sand sorting characteristics during hurricane events. The research questions that will be addressed are related to sediment size distribution characteristics, responsible forcing mechanisms, and short term beach recovery processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific findings using this dataset will advance understanding on the short-term beach dynamics during and after hurricanes, which will impact various relevant applications. For example, this improved understanding may be translated into more effective decisions related to the beach nourishment projects and dune restoration/management, sediment transport predictions for hurricane-impacted beaches, among others. Moreover, the developed dataset will be very&lt;br/&gt;valuable for the calibration/validation of the numerical coastal sediment transport models and it will contribute to the training of graduate and undergraduate level students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This NSF-RAPID project was in response to Hurricane Harvey that made landfall on San Jose Island, Texas on August 25 2017.  The project was to investigate response and recovery of 6 selected beaches impacted by Hurricane Harvey and to elucidate the hurricane-driven sand sorting characteristics in the cross-shore direction from dune to shoreline.  Immediate action was critical in order to collect the essential data before the occurrence of a significant beach adjustment and during the early phases of this adjustment.  Therefore, the major tasks of this project were: (i) to conduct timely field experiments at selected beaches to collect morphology data and sediment samples in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey; and (ii) to analyze the collected samples and data to develop a valuable dataset and fundamental understanding on the response, short-term recovery, and sediment characteristics of hurricane impacted beaches to the extent possible by the time-limitations of the project.  Selected six beaches are along the Mustang and North Padre barrier islands and Corpus Christi ? Rockport areas of the Texas Gulf Coast, which are within approximately 60 km of the Hurricane Harvey landfall location.  Three field campaigns, along with multiple field visits, were performed between October 2017 and March 2018.  During each of the field campaigns, real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK-GPS) data to construct cross-shore beach profiles, beach sediment cores to analyze sand characteristics, and beach compaction data were collected along cross-shore transects of each of the beaches.  Furthermore, publicly available LiDAR data from different time periods over the past two decades, including recent data before and after Hurricane Harvey, were gathered and Digital Elevation Maps were constructed to study the observations in the context of recent morphological changes and long-term shoreline evolution trends.  The results of these observations and analyses revealed important insights on, among others, the response and recovery of beach-dune systems, effectiveness of the existing coastal management practices, and insights for coastal resiliency and adaptation strategies for coastal beaches and communities that are prone to hurricanes and powerful storms.  The results of this project have been and will be disseminated through scientific publications / presentations.  The project provided research and learning experiences for a large number of graduate and undergraduate students through both direct involvement in the project and also research presentations and discussions in various graduate and undergraduate level courses.  Overall, all of the set goals of this NSF project were achieved and the project was successfully completed.
