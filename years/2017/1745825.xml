<AbstractNarration>The productivity and efficiency of government-sponsored academic research depends not only upon the training, creativity, and hard work of researchers but also the administrative systems within which researchers are embedded. However, increases in the research policy-based administrative burdens experienced by academic researchers suggests there is a worrisome reduction in the percentage of work time available for core research activities. The project explores the relation of universities? diverse research administration policies and organizational structures on researchers' administrative experiences.  The broader impacts of the study include providing evidence of most effective strategies for efficient research administration and suggesting possible administrative reforms, with the objective of enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of research administration and, thereby, the productivity of academic research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research surveys  academic principal investigators about their experiences with research administration, including perceptions of administration burden, the amount of time spent on grants-related administration and the strategies employed for effective and efficient research administration.  The project assesses research administration activity in terms of the time and resources required but also the extent to which a policy objective.  This approach implies that some administrative burden is more harmful than others; if no significant policy objective is advanced then the efforts at administrative compliance does little more than promote red tape. By contrast, activities requiring considerable administrative burden may be redeemed by serving an important policy goal or social impact. The project is based on (1) semi-structured interviews with academic researchers, as well as interviews with university research administrators who are support staff, and (2) administrative diaries provided by the PIs participating in the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Award 000264174 focused on administrative burden associated with research grant awards for federal research funding agencies.  While we conducted 114 interviews with NSF principal investigators on a variety of issues pertaining to administrative burden, we also focused specifically on "robotic compliance requests," automatic emails send, usually from university research administrators and, in most cases with no ability to write a direct reply and, in many cases, no indication to whom to reply or to ask questions.  We examined the emails chiefly by focusing on PI’ email records, content analyzing them to determine topic, structure and response patterns and, ultimately, seeking to understand how to improve robotic compliance requests.  Suggestions included (1) involving researchers in their design; (2) using jargon not exclusive to administrators; (3) understanding the vast differences in experience among recipients; (4) permitting "reply to" rather than "do not reply;" (5) avoiding listing people who need not be parties to the email; (5) evaluating the design of the emails, which are often ad hoc and developed by people with not particularly relevant experience.  The study examined not only perceived administrative burden in the interviews with PI’s but also the "workarounds" some used when rules were unclear or presented what was perceived as undue administrative burden. We found that less than 25% reported any workaround behavior and no one reported appealing a rule.  Most who develop workarounds do so for small stakes problems such as reimbursing small amounts to a graduate student when there is an inadequate paper trail or seeking to buy needed small equipment such as a laptop when purchasing requirements do not permit the laptop of choice.
