<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a superior methos for the treatment for dry eye syndrome. Dry eye affects tens of millions of people in the United States alone. The symptoms of dry eye are vast and varied however even mild symptoms are detrimental to one's quality of life. Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) is the most common contributor to dry eye, and the current treatment options are either ineffective, inconvenient, or extremely expensive. The technology developed here is a device that supplies superior effectiveness and convenience over current treatment options. The introduction of a device with these superior aspects has an opportunity to deter the progression of dry eye syndrome and thus decrease the cost to both patients and the healthcare market as a whole. The goal of developing a convenient and effective MGD treatment option creates an opportunity to be a leader in the $3 billion dry eye market and relieve the dry eye symptoms experienced by millions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will focus on developing a thorough consumer and stake holder comprehension in order to explore the utilization of a novel dry eye treatment device. Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) has only recently been identified as the leading cause of dry eye symptoms and thus current treatment options are limited. The technology developed here utilizes a reusable design in a unique way that promotes natural Meibomian gland expression and improved customer convenience. This solution has potential to gain traction with clinicians through mimicking effective office procedures and supporting known anatomical functions.</AbstractNarration>
