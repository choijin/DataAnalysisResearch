<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a novel integrated circuit (IC) power estimation simulation technology into an integrated simulation tool that is superior to the current state-of-the-art.   The Scalable Accelerated Power Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SAP-SPICE) will drastically improve the way IC manufacturers design, fabricate, and test modern chips by significantly increasing the speed and the accuracy of the power estimation simulations.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gap as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  While the gold-standard simulation tool HSPICE produces the most accurate result, it comes at a high computational cost.  On the other hand, accelerated simulators are faster because they depend on larger component models but they produce less accurate average results.  The SAP-SPICE project uses a different approach with logic design, a logic simulator, and a portion of power data to extract a more accurate result while maintaining fast computational speed.  The goal of this project is to produce a preproduction quality prototype that will integrate with existing industry standard tools to demonstrate the advantages of the technology over other tools to potential customers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SAP-SPICE will have broader impacts on several fronts. First, the tool can lead to significant societal and environmental benefit when it is used by the chip manufacturers to improve the chip yield. Second, the techniques developed for the product have potential broader applicability to other areas of computing such as large server systems, mobile devices, and consumer appliances; especially in a future where a fine-grained energy accounting will be an integral part of all computing devices. Beyond its impact on technology, the project will also contribute to workforce development through educational benefits to the students participating in the project who will be organized in a structure similar to a small business, encouraged to find innovative solutions on a short timeline, and will meet weekly with the business mentor.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF PFI: AIR-TT: Scalable Accelerated Power Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SAP-SPICE)  P.I.: Young H. Cho, University of Southern California/Information Sciences Institute  Abstract  The goal NSF PFI: AIR-TT SAP-SPICE is to demonstrate a scalable high-performance power simulator with up to 3 orders of magnitude higher performance per cost result of other commercially available physical level power estimation tools.  In NSF CNS #0905596 Green Edge Network, we discovered a novel on-line digital hardware power measurement instruments and machine learning algorithm for integrated circuits that is superior to the state-of-the-art on-chip methods.  However, upon further research we also discovered that the same core technique can be applied to circuit simulators to significantly accelerate power simulation with lower memory requirement. Our project integrates (1) a power simulator partitioning algorithm suitable for cloud computing platforms, (b) a machine-learning driven self-calibrating power model for simulation software, and (c) a simplified result extraction and evaluation output.  These features provide significant advantages in system cost, performance, and accuracy of simulated power estimation when compared to the lead technology in circuit simulation market.   The SAP-SPICE is important because the techniques developed for the prototype have broader applicability to other areas of computing such as low power computing, high performance server systems, and consumer appliances such as mobile phones. Indeed, all the technology trends suggest a future where a fine-grained energy accounting system will be an integral part of most computing devices.  As expected, the findings of this research project are the key factors behind a patent and licensing negotiations with two independent integrated circuit companies.  Today, the integrated circuit (IC) design industry desperately needs highly accurate power simulation technology that is fast.  Many commercial simulation tools resort to trading off accuracy for increased speed by leveraging much less accurate (up to plus or minus 30% error) macro models to produce power specification for each design.  When such large error is made worse by process variations on fabricated chips, power simulations are often found to no longer play a significant role in improving system performance or chip yield.  As this project translates from research discovery toward commercial application, the translated product(s) will fill the technology gap in the power simulation technology to enable improvements in chip-yield and low-power consumption in modern ICs.  The potential economic impact is expected to increase rapidly in the next five to ten years to affect a significant portion of $300B IC market.  More specifically, our work will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the future of power-aware IC industry.       Last Modified: 01/02/2019       Submitted by: Young H Cho]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
