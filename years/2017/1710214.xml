<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;A grand challenge in materials research is the preparation of novel compounds with designed properties. The ability to create stable layered materials with complicated layering schemes provides an unprecedented ability to probe the interplay between structure, composition, and physical properties of the constituents. This research produces a rich collection of new materials with diverse and highly unusual properties and an improved understanding of structure-property relationships in compounds containing structurally different layers. A goal is to understand the dependence of physical properties on the identity, thickness, and the sequence of individual layers. A second goal is to understand the fundamental aspects of the synthesis approach that result in the preparation of stable products. Current and future technologies crucial to international competitiveness depend on being able to both prepare and characterize stable layered materials to obtain enhanced properties, which are not found in any of the individual components. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This research extends a synthesis approach to create new, layered solids containing two or more structurally different constituents with atomically abrupt interfaces between them. Designed precursors enable kinetically stable heterostructures with designed nanoarchitectures to be prepared over large areas. The project goal is to understand the dependence of transport properties on nanoarchitecture in heterostructures containing electrically isolated two dimensional layers of transition metal dichalcogenides, bismuth chalcogenides and related ternary structures. Large band gap spacer layers of varying thickness electrically isolate the dichalcogenide monolayers and adjacent magnetic layers are used to perturb the monolayers. This research is timely, as recent discoveries promise advances in a variety of technologies including tunnelling transistors, flexible electronics, photodetectors, photovoltaics and light-emitting devices with unprecedented characteristics and/or unique functionalities. This research provides a broad technical background for graduate students in deposition technologies, thin film characterization techniques, and physical phenomena that occur in 2D heterostructures. This training enables them to thrive in careers in high tech industries, academia or national laboratories.</AbstractNarration>

Given the large interest in two dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures made from them, this creates an exciting opportunity to expand the library of 2D layers, both with respect to structure and properties.           A key advance in this project was the discovery that X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is a quantitative probe of the number of atoms of each element in a thin film. The ability to quantify the number of atoms of each element in a film has already had a broader impact, with applications already occurring in research, development and manufacturing. Two examples include an optical coatings company using our XRF advance and X-ray reflectometry to quantify density differences that caused optical constants to vary from those expected and a German research institute using our XRF advance to evaluate surface pretreatments through quantifing the amount of each element deposited as a function of cycle number. We anticipate broader use of XRF to characterize thin films produced using a variety of methods as the technique becomes better known.           This XRF advance enabled us to gain a greater understanding of how the nanoarchitecture and number of atoms in the elemental layers in a precursor influence the reaction and self-assemble of products.

For example, Bi|Se bilayers with enough atoms to form a single layer of Bi2Se3form Bi2Se3 when adjacent to either PbSe or another Bi2Se3 layer.  When adjacent to a transition metal-selenium bilayer, the same Bi|Se bilayer evolves to form BiSe with the extra Bi and Se layers diffusing to the top of the sample. There is still much to learn about how to control reaction pathways of solid state reactions.           We suspect that the surprising stability of the heterostructures prepared in this project is due to charge transfer which occurs when ultrathin layers of two constituents are in contact.
