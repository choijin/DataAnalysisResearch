<AbstractNarration>This Planning Grant proposal is focused on the establishment of a new Site in the Center for Membrane Science, Engineering and Technology (MAST) at The Pennsylvania State University. Membrane-based separations offer a number of unique advantages compared to competing technologies including: lower energy requirements, relative ease of scale-up, and room temperature operation.  The current market for membrane technology is expected to grow at 8.5% over the next several years, reaching annual sales of $26 billion by 2019 with approximately 25% of that in the U.S.  The Penn State Site will focus on applications of membranes in the biopharmaceutical industry and for sustainability, addressing key fundamental issues that limit the use of membranes in these areas.  The Planning Grant Workshop will be held in April 2018 on the Penn State campus, providing opportunities for potential industry sponsors to learn about the plans for the new Site, the proposed research efforts, and the experimental capabilities in membrane science and materials characterization at Penn State.  The feedback obtained from this Workshop will form the basis for a follow-up proposal to formally establish the Penn State Site, which will provide unique educational opportunities for students to work on industry-sponsored projects in membrane technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds to host a Planning Grant Workshop in April 2018 to develop a new Site in the Center for Membrane Science, Engineering and Technology (MAST) at The Pennsylvania State University with a specific focus on membrane applications in the biopharmaceutical industry and for sustainable energy.  This Workshop will allow prospective sponsors to learn about detailed plans for the Penn State Site, including the proposed research thrusts and experimental capabilities, while meeting with current industry partners, faculty, and graduate students in the MAST Center.  The feedback obtained from this Workshop will form the basis for a formal proposal to establish the Penn State Site.  The Penn State Site will complement and expand the research portfolio in membrane science and technology by addressing pre-competitive research challenges in bioprocessing and sustainable energy generation. This includes issues associated with the use of membrane technology in continuous bioprocessing and the development of cost-effective membrane systems for harvesting energy from waste heat and naturally occurring salinity gradients.  The Penn State Site will provide an ideal environment for training both undergraduates and graduate students, including extensive interactions with leading researchers in industry and at the other MAST Center Sites.</AbstractNarration>
