<AbstractNarration>Award: DMS 1708310, Principal Investigator: Clifford H. Taubes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The immediate goal for the project is to develop new tools and methods to study the structure of three and four dimensional spaces. Questions about these spaces are central to much of current research in both geometry and topology (not to mention physics and astrophysics/cosmology - four dimensions is relevant because space with time is four dimensional).  There exist powerful mathematical tools for studying these spaces, but more tools are needed.  This is especially true for four dimensional spaces because the ignorance here is broad and deep. This lack of information motivates the project to develop new tools and sharpen the old ones while keeping in mind the long term goal of understanding more about the spaces involved. The research to be carried out could construct bridges between the fields of topology, differential geometry, symplectic geometry and mathematical physics.  Concepts from the mathematical fields of the project are now used extensively (and centrally) in condensed matter physics, high energy physics, and theories of gravity and cosmology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long term goal of this project is to understand the structure of smooth, low dimensional manifolds through the following primary areas of study: (1) The behavior of sequences of solutions to certain generalizations of Seiberg-Witten equations will be studied on four dimensional manifolds.  The ultimate goal in this regard is to determine whether non-convergent sequences have pathologies that obstruct solution counting definitions of invariants that can distinguish different 4-manifolds or, when the four dimensional manifold has a boundary, distinguish different knots or links on the boundary.  (2) The structure and topological significance of the zero locus of a harmonic section of a spin bundle that is defined only where the section is not zero will be investigated.  This second research focus has implications for the first because harmonic sections of the sort described arise in the study of sequences of solutions to certain equations of interest.  (3) The third research focus will look for invariants that could distinguish path components of the space of Riemannian metrics on a 4-manifold with anti-self dual Weyl curvature.  Of particular interest would be an invariant that distinguishes the products of a circle with hyperbolic three-dimensional manifolds because an invariant that does this might distinguish certain pairs of homeomorphic, but not necessarily diffeomorphic, four dimensional manifolds that can not be separated with existing tools for smooth structures.  All of these topics use methods from differential geometry and analysis to construct new tools for studying the differential topology of low dimensional manifolds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the work supported by this grant was to develop new tools  to  investigate the structure and classification of smooth,  4-dimensional  manifolds.   By way of background:  The spaces of  interest require 4 coordinates to uniquely  specify any given event.  An  instance of such a space is our own  universe which requires three  spatial coordinates plus time, the fourth  coordinate, to specify an  event.  Whereas the structure of our  particular 4-dimensional universe  is a question for astronomers (and  physicists), the list of all possible 4-dimensional spaces is a  mathematical question.  Much has been  learned in this regard using the solutions to two iconic differential  equations, first the self-dual Yang-Mills equations (introduced in the  1980's) and then the Seiberg-Witten equations (introduced in the  1990's).   Even so, the fundamental classification and structure  questions are still open.   This work being reported studied the  space of solutions to two generalizations of the self-dual Yang-Mills  equations.  The first of these generalization is called the Vafa-Witten  equations.  Like the original self-dual Yang-Mills equations, these  equations are closely related to equations that are studied by  physicists as models for the subnuclear forces.  The complicating  feature of these Vafa-Witten equations concerns the fact that they may  admit an infinite, unbounded set of solutions.  This by itself is not  necessarily an obstacle to their use if the unbounded behavior can be  usefully characterized (as was the case with the self-dual Yang-Mills equations).  One outcome of this research was a  characterization of the unboundedness in terms of what are now called  Z/2 harmonic forms.  By virtue of their appearance in this context,  these newly discovered objects must therefore play a potentially central  but still completely mysterious role in aspects of the classification  problem.  Much current research is now directed at elucidating that  role.  The second system of equations is called the Kapustin-Witten equations.  A suitably weighted count of certain solutions to these equations on 4-dimensional spaces that are a product of a 3-dimensional space with a half-line (the positive real numbers) was conjectured to be an invariant of the 3-dimensional space itself.   As was the case with the Vafa-Witten equations, the potential monkey wrench in the conjecture is tied to the possible existence of an unbounded sequence of solutions (hence an infinite count).  The research funded by this grant determined that the existence of this pathology is again characterized by a Z/2 harmonic form, this time living on the 3-dimensional space.  Thus, Z/2 harmonic forms must play a central role here also.        Last Modified: 08/01/2020       Submitted by: Clifford H Taubes]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
