<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Engineering Division of the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) will hold its 16th Chemical Engineering Summer School from July 29-August 3, 2017 at North Carolina State University.  The Summer School has been the premier faculty development workshop for new chemical engineering faculty since 1931. In order to provide maximum benefit to the faculty, this workshop is offered every five years. The Summer School is unique in its emphasis on the development of new chemical engineering educators. By targeting faculty within their first five years of their careers, professors can become more effective at all facets of their job as educators and ultimately produce better prepared undergraduate and graduate chemical engineering professionals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the 2017 Chemical Engineering Summer School, new faculty will learn best practices in effective teaching, including active learning techniques. The instructors are leaders in chemical engineering education. Furthermore, the participants will also learn about technical (such as safety, sustainability, computational fluid dynamics, process modeling, and emerging topics within the discipline) and non-technical topics (such as communication skills, leadership, ethics, etc.) Historically, around 200 chemical engineering educators, many of whom are within the first five years of their initial faculty appointment and others who are returning as instructors, attend the Summer School. The new educators are able to form strong partnerships with their peers who are in similar stages of their careers. In addition, they meet and interact with senior chemical engineering faculty and receive critical advice on career development matters. To foster interactions, the participating faculty present a poster about their research and education activities at their home institution.</AbstractNarration>
