<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Measurements and Imaging program of the Chemistry Division, Professors Alexej Jerschow and James W. Canary and their groups at New York University are examining techniques for enhancing sensitivity and improving signal persistence in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, one of the most important tools for characterizing the structure and interactions of molecules. The anticipated enhancements will enable, for example, highly enhanced imaging techniques for medical applications, and more detailed studies of metabolite and enzyme activity. The NMR methodology, theoretical insights, and chemical syntheses developed in this project will be applicable in a broad range of fields, from biochemistry to physical chemistry and materials chemistry.  Students participating in this work have the opportunity to be broadly educated while interacting with domestic and international collaborative teams. Furthermore, through collaborations with the Pratt Institute, Dr. Jerschow and his group participate in projects that apply NMR techniques in the field of art conservation, thus reaching and interacting with colleagues outside traditional science disciplines.  The Canary group provides research mentoring through the Societe de Chemie Industrielle, and through hosting high school students, including participants from the Harlem Children Society and ACS Project SEED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project probes nuclear spin singlet states as polarization storage states, and the elucidation of the fundamental mechanisms that lead to polarization loss. These singlet states allow, in principle, the storage of polarization over minutes and hours, but it is currently unknown what limits their lifetimes. Using both chemical and NMR spectroscopic strategies, including a chemical symmetry switch reaction, these states and mechanisms will be investigated systematically. Professor Jerschow also continues to collaborate with conservation scientists on the application of spectroscopic techniques, and Professor Canary is involved in outreach activities related to undergraduate professional and research mentoring.</AbstractNarration>
