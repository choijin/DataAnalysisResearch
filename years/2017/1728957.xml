<AbstractNarration>The research supported by this award investigates changing linkages between local communities and the nation state in the contemporary United States. As distributor of welfare, administrator of bureaucracy, provider of security, and in many other ways, the state is critical for local life. But the nature of that relationship is dynamic, shifting over time and place in ways that change our understanding of what a government is at all levels of scale. This project asks, What are the key new elements of that relationship now? And what are their local effects? Noting how central discussions of security have become in recent years,  the researcher approaches these questions through the lens of local policing and the increased use of equipment once reserved for the military. What does this apparent blurring of state and community lines tell us about the local impact of the nation state today? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out in the Washington/Baltimore area by Brown University doctoral student, Jessica Katzenstein, under the supervision of Dr. Catherine A. Lutz. She will focus on how this equipment is made available and why police departments choose to obtain it;  how personnel are trained in its use; and how its availability affects their sense of responsibility for threat response and their relations with local citizens. To gather data, she will employ a range of anthropological research methods including: interviews, participant observation in trainings and ride-alongs, and spatial analysis of equipment movements. Findings from this project will provide important insight into what militarization signifies about the contradictions and shifts in state influence in a historical moment in which community police have more effective resources and yet more limited room to use those resources without public challenge, and where they are called upon to serve as homeland defense against a broadening array of threats. This information will help to build new social scientific understanding of new aspects of what the nation state now means for local communities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Co-PI Jessica Katzenstein, under the supervision of Dr. Catherine Lutz (PI), conducted an ethnographic study of U.S. policing in the Baltimore-D.C. region. Over 12 months of dissertation fieldwork in 2017-18, she conducted approximately 60 formal interviews, attended over 100 hours' worth of police trainings, and participated in over 50 hours' worth of ride-alongs. She attended various police recruitment, memorial, and oversight group events; spoke with non-police stakeholders including activists, volunteer chaplains, and reformers; and worked with officers at 20 different police departments in Maryland. The full research project currently comprises over 75 formal interviews, over 100 hours of ride-alongs, 120 hours of trainings, and many dozen informal conversations with police officers of all ranks. Katzenstein's project specifically examines police militarization, which entails urgent questions about how policing's orientation to threat and its ultimate goals are shifting, and about what that entails for the nature of the state and governance. Her research explores what militarization - as both an increase in state capacity for violence and a sign of alleged growing state vulnerability to certain threats - can tell us about the changing nature of state power.</p> <p>Understanding how military-originated and military-style equipment circulates in law enforcement provides one window into this shift. Katzenstein interviewed officers involved in equipment management, toured inventories, and spoke with SWAT team members in order to understand militarization in the form of rifles, armored personnel carriers, and surveillance technologies. She found that economies of police equipment are multifaceted, marking both power and vulnerability in surprising ways. For example, while much public critique of police militarization has focused on the 1033 Program (which loans materials from the U.S. military to law enforcement), officers themselves often shy away from the age and regulatory burden of 1033 Program equipment. Some instead purchase equipment like semiautomatic rifles themselves, or simply must go without certain items in cash-strapped departments. The political economies of "military" equipment - heavily criticized, argued to be necessary, inaccessible to some, used to both control political protests as in Ferguson (2014) and to halt mass shootings - signal the complexity of police militarization. Katzenstein's dissertation will explore how we might square critiques of police as overly "militarized" with the social role we assign them and the protective labor they do provide.</p> <p>Police training is also a key site of police militarization, where officers learn language, ideologies, and techniques of the body sometimes derived from the military. Katzenstein attended SWAT, active shooter, and academy trainings and spoke with training officers in order to examine how officers are taught threat preparedness. She found that an ideology of officer safety/survival is central to police threat perception and preparedness. Officers are taught to maintain constant vigilance against potential attacks. The pervasiveness of threat - whether from an ambush, mass shooting, or arrest gone wrong - and the importance of self-protection may be driven home in intimate ways; officers may be asked to envision an ambush at their own police station, or to imagine how their families would fare if they were killed in the line of duty. Katzenstein's research also suggests a disjuncture between certain police reform efforts and the ethnographic terrain. Training-related reforms often seek to demilitarize policing by softening and, usually metaphorically, disarming it - e.g. via an emphasis on deescalation and sensitivity training. Some officers perceive these reforms as externally imposed by reformers who allegedly do not see how vulnerable police are to threat. In other words, certain reforms imagine a world differently from how many police now experience it.
