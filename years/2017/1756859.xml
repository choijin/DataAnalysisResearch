<AbstractNarration>The sub-arctic Pacific sustains major fisheries with nearly all commercially important species depending either directly or indirectly on lipid-rich copepods (Neocalanus flemingeri, Neocalanus plumchrus, Neocalanus cristatus and Calanus marshallae).  In turn, these species depend on a short-lived spring algal bloom for growth and the accumulation of lipid stores in order to complete an annual life cycle that includes a period of dormancy. The intellectual thrust of this project measures how the timing and magnitude of algal blooms affect preparation for dormancy using a combination of field and experimental observations. The Northern Gulf of Alaska - with four calanid species that experience dormancy, steep environmental gradients, well-described phytoplankton bloom dynamics, and a concurrent NSF-LTER program - provides an unusual opportunity to identify the factors that affect dormancy preparation. Education and outreach plans are integrated with the research. Educational efforts focus on interdisciplinary opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral trainees. The project will generate content for existing graduate and undergraduate courses. U. of Alaska Fairbanks and U. Hawaii at Manoa are Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions, and students from these groups will be recruited to participate in the project.  Because fishing is a major industry in the Gulf of Alaska, outreach will communicate the role copepods play in marine ecosystems using the concept of a dynamic food web tied to production cycles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diapause (dormancy) and the accompanying accumulation of lipids in copepods have been identified as key drivers in high latitude ecosystems that support economically important fisheries, including those of the Gulf of Alaska.  While the disappearance of lipid-rich copepods has been linked to severe declines in fish stocks, little is known about the environmental conditions that are required for the successful completion of the copepod's life cycle.  A physiological profiling approach that measures relative gene expression will be used to test two alternative hypotheses: the lipid accumulation window hypothesis, which holds that individuals enter diapause only after they have accumulated sufficient lipid stores, and the developmental program hypothesis, which holds that once the diapause program is activated, progression occurs independent of lipid accumulation.  The specific objectives are:  1) determine the effect of food levels during N. flemingeri copepodite stages on progression towards diapause using multiple physiological and developmental markers; 2) characterize the seasonal changes in the physiological profile of N. flemingeri across environmental gradients and across years; 3) compare physiological profiles across co-occurring calanid species (N. flemingeri, Neocalanus plumchrus, Neocalanus cristatus and Calanus marshallae); and 4) estimate the reproductive potential of the overwintering populations of N. flemingeri.  The broader scientific significance includes the acquisition of new genomic data and molecular resources that will be made publicly available through established data repositories, and the development of new tools for routinely obtaining physiological profiles of copepods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
