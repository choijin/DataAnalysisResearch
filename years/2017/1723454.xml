<AbstractNarration>This Early-concept Grant for Exploratory Research aims to help patients and caregivers have increased access to electronic health information. The research focuses on the Electronic Health Record (EHR). In 1996, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act entitled patients the right to obtain their medical records on request. With greater patient access, patients may become more invested in the management of their own health care and take better care of themselves. While there have been some advances in communicating EHR content to patients, physicians' and nurses' notes are not easy to convey due to communication intent of clinicians and the social and cultural issues that surround diagnosis and care. Advances from this work will reduce gaps in the care process, potentially impact consumer side patient care, and become the basis for future systems development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research investigates new and more effective presentations of this information to patients (e.g., graphic, abstracted, actionable). The project includes the following activities: 1) collect patient notes and the communicative intent for both clinicians and patients to reveal the gap between intention and interpretation; 2) iterate on new textual and visual summaries by hand until they achieve the intended communication with patients.  The proposal team's expertise will be leveraged  in designing abstractions of information to help people make decisions and positively change their behavior under stress or uncertainty to undertake these activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We are investigating new and more effective presentations of information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to rectify the communication gap between clinicians and patients. Our analyses focus on themes that can be seen across many types of medical data, for example, mentions of fever or nausea, changes in medication, or escalations to the next stage for a progressive disease or health development. We seek patterns in the data that facilitate comparison, for example, from a first experience with a medical condition to a second, or to compare an individual to a cohort through a progression of a disease or health development.  We collected several corpuses of data with which to test hunches and explore ideas. Based on our interviews, we learned that EHRs often did not contain all of the information needed by patients and was often missing details that we mentioned in patient-doctor conversations.  This inspired us to augment EHR data with conversational data.  We have gained access to 60,000 de-identified patient-doctor conversations, with associated metadata about patient conditions and physician specialty. In addition, we have begun to do research on Clinical Care Pathways as another body of information that is used to help diagnose and treat patients, thus closing the communication gap of care.
