<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polymers exhibit a wealth of useful properties that make these materials uniquely applicable for a broad range of applications in all areas of technology and society.  If  commodity polymers were capable of self-repair upon fracture, many new applications could be sought out, enabling  long-lasting properties, new functions, and substantial savings. This project seeks to understand the observed self-healing behavior in a type of commodity polymers (acrylate-based copolymers) which, in a certain intermediate compositional range undergo remarkable autonomous repair  upon mechanical damage. If this unexplained observation is understood at a molecular level, it may offer high scientific  and technological payoffs.  This project will also explore the design of new copolymers with self-healing properties, which would reduce their consumption and have positive ecological impacts.  This new fundamental knowledge may be used to explore other commodity polymers and at the same time train students in an interdisciplinary manner and prepare them to tackle global  technological challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to elucidate molecular origins of a surprising self-healing in  commodity poly(methyl methacrylate/n-butyl acrylate), p(MMA/nBA), copolymers. This will be  pursued by precisely synthesizing alternating, random, and block copolymers in the 45/55 - 55/45  MMA/nBA molar compositional range, correlating with the extent of self-healing, and identifying molecular  events that govern this unique behavior.  For that purpose, narrow dispersity copolymers with variable  block sizes will be synthesized using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and heterogeneous  radical polymerization (HRP).  These experiments will allow to determine the role of the neighboring  MMA and nBA copolymer repeating units on conformational changes during the damage-repair cycle  and subsequent self-repair.  The role of free radicals which can be potentially generated during mechanical damage as a function of copolymer molecular weight and copolymer topologies, and  particularly their role in rebonding, will also be investigated.  Since chain cleavage and/or slippage are  expected to be copolymer-composition dependent, to identify molecular events responsible for self-healing,  in-situ surface/interfacial chemical imaging (IR/Raman), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR),  and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy will be utilized.  If intrinsic free radicals are  generated during mechanical damage, they will act as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) agents to  selectively enhance the magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR signals of nuclei at the damage site.  These  measurements will be conducted as a function of copolymer topology, molecular weight, and dispersity,  and will provide information about specific atomic-level conformation of the polymer chains, concentration levels of free  radicals, and the nature of chemical groups at the site of damage.  The planned experimental studies will  parallel molecular dynamics simulations which will examine the role of van der Waals and other interactions  on copolymer topologies and self-healing behavior.</AbstractNarration>

In terms of intellectual merit, the unique self-healing behavior was attributed to favorable inter-chain van der Waals (vdW) forces forming 'key-and-lock' inter-chain junctions. Outside  self-healable compositional range as well as for block copolymers, self-healing does not occur. The main feature of vdW interactions is large polarizability (hydrophobicity) which in thermoplastic polymers leads to non-directional interactions between neighboring macromolecular segments, thus energetically favoring closer chain proximity.
