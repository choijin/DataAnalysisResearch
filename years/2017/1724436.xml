<AbstractNarration>Women are under-represented in political parties in many new democracies, in part because of social norms that inhibit women from becoming active in local politics. What are the effects of reducing the gender gap in grassroots participation? This project addresses this question by conducting two large-scale surveys to evaluate the short- and long-run effects of a community civic education program designed to encourage women's political participation in Ghana. The civic education treatment takes the form of a series of large community meetings held by Ghana's National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE), an independent, non-partisan government agency that regularly engages in similar activities, and addresses social norms against the participation of women in political parties and encourages greater women's participation. Assessing the link between civic education and levels of participation has implications for future development policy, including efforts funded and conducted by the US government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research explores (a) whether women's political empowerment increases women's access to government resources and reduces their economic vulnerability, and (b) whether women's political empowerment changes attitudes and norms about women's appropriate roles in society. It extends an emerging body of work on these questions in two ways. First, most research on gender in the developing world has focused on the impacts of women in leadership positions. This study shifts focus to the study of the effects of grassroots participation. Second, endogeneity generally complicates causal inferences on the effects of women's participation. This research will be one of a handful of studies that have randomly encouraged or exploited "natural" experiments on women's participation. Moreover, the field experiment presents an unusually well-identified test of theories of how the resources available to political parties in new democracies affect their electoral strategies, including clientelism and intimidation of voters.  The field experiment with an encouragement design allows the estimation of the effects of increased women's political participation on (a)political party strategies, including mobilization and outreach to women before the election; (b) the subsequent economic welfare of women; and (c) social norms about the participation of women in politics and local leadership.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   In many developed and developing countries, women participate in civic life and politics far less often than men.  This is the case at both the local community level and at the elite level and in both non-elected roles and elected positions.  Previous research to explain this gender gap has considered various individual characteristics that may differ between men and women such as financial resources and free time; skills in public speaking, presentation, and management; interest; ambition; and perceptions of oneself as a potential leader.  It has also considered discrimination and biases against having women as public leaders.  This study adds to this emerging body of research that focuses on the role of social norms -- views of what behavior is appropriate for women -- held by women themselves and the broader community.  We study the structure of those norms, how those norms support or constrain women?s participation in public life, and how those norms remain stable or how quickly they may change.     This study investigates efforts to close the gender gap at the grassroots level in rural Ghana, a democracy in West Africa in which a dense network of local branches of the major political parties provides the main avenue for local participation.  We randomized which communities held a durbar, a large meeting presided over by the traditional chief, to which all men and women in the community were invited to attend.  This durbar was a civic education event that included a drama with a female protagonist and local notables inviting women's participation ahead of Ghana's December 2016 elections.  We fielded a survey of a random sample of adult women and a close male relative in those communities with and without the durbars.  The surveys find first that the durbar did not increase political participation by women or change attitudes towards women?s political participation.  Second, it finds that the norms themselves vary significantly across communities, as do whether members of the same household agree on those norms.  Greater participation by women in political life is associated with public policy that is more reflective of women?s preferences, which often includes basics such as clean water in the developing world.  But the gender gap in political participation has been persistent.   This study contributes new evidence on the limitations of common civic education interventions used to increase the acceptance of women in public life and encourage women to step forward into those roles.
