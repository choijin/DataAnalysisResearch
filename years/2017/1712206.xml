<AbstractNarration>Undergraduate geoscience students learn better if provided with high-quality, accurate animations of important Earth processes. This project will generate, assess, and disseminate a set of new animations about fundamental tectonic processes such as continental rifting, continental collision, transform faulting, or planetary tectonics. The animations will be tested in classrooms at the collaborating institutions and will be made available to major science media outlets like Discovery Channel, National Geographic, and History Channel, in order to aid them in generating better documentaries on fundamental Earth processes. The final animations will be highly useful in many classrooms (high school and undergraduate) since most introductory geoscience courses begin with lectures on Plate Tectonics and could provide an important improvement in student understanding of fundamental earth processes that often have a significant impact on society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide scientifically-vetted and field-tested animations that will illustrate the concept of 'Plate Tectonics' in the three-dimensional space that is required for students to comprehend processes and interpret geologic history successfully. The work is supported by literature on visual learning styles, and these concepts are incorporated into the assessments. The evaluation methods will capture misconceptions as part of the formative assessment, which is critical to developing model animations for release to the general public, as well as undergraduate students. The project involves a rich collaboration across disciplines (art, geosciences and communications) and will systematically test several learning hypotheses in classroom environments of three campuses (University of Texas Dallas, Richland Community College, Richardson, TX and the University of South Florida) that typically serve underrepresented communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This collaborative project between the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) and the University of South Florida (USF) involved the development and testing of a series of video animations of deep-Earth processes for use in undergraduate geology and earth science courses. The USF portion of the project focused on field-testing several videos in USF courses and assessing their potential to support student learning on their topics, as well as on overall project evaluation.      Three video animations were fully field-tested and assessed for student learning impacts during the award period: "Three Great Ways to Melt the Mantle" (2017), "Continental Rifts, Passive Margins and Ocean Basins: Plate Tectonics 2" (2019), and "Continental Rifts, Passive Margins and Ocean Basins - For Beginners" (2019).  The first two videos were implemented in 3000-level Geology majors courses, while the third video was used in a 2000-level Introduction to Earth Science course.  Results of student learning assessments suggest that the videos supported improvement in student conceptual understanding of the processes depicted (melting of the mantle and the rifting of continents, respectively), although this learning did not appear to be directly linked to effective retention of key visual features or the embedded animations.      The intellectual merit of the overall project lies primarily in the successful and sustainable generation of scientifically accurate and educationally effective video content, all housed and freely available at the UT-Dallas Geoscience Studios Youtube pages, for use in undergraduate geoscience courses at both introductory levels and in courses for majors.  The broader impacts of the project lay in the wealth and diversity of video content developed via the project's model for video creation, and the interest that many of these video animations are drawing from other educational audiences (K-12 and informal), as evidenced by the growing "view counts" for many of the videos.      The UT-Dallas Geoscience Studios video collection may be examined at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGRcGfZpcWMCihRgpCrjXFA.
