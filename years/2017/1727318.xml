<AbstractNarration>Women's Intellectual Network Research Symposium: A Meeting of Mathematical Minds is a one-day symposium that will be held at Brown University on Saturday, March 4th, 2017. The goal of this symposium is to bring together undergraduate and graduate students, as well as post-doctoral fellows and faculty from New England, in order to engage in research discussions and exchange ideas. This symposium particularly seeks to connect women and other underrepresented minorities in similar fields of mathematics or statistics from universities in the New England area, as well as to promote collaboration and share strategies for addressing issues facing these groups. However, the symposium is more broadly inclusive, and hopes to benefit a larger community. The symposium is open to everyone, regardless of gender identity. The symposium will feature two plenary talks, in applied dynamical systems and geometric group theory, three tutorials, including one on public key cryptography, and one in data science, short talks by students (graduate and undergraduate), post-doctoral fellows and faculty, a poster session, and a panel on effective mentoring. A meeting of members of AWM (Association for Women in Mathematics) Student Chapters will also be convened during the symposium. The symposium seeks to have a broad representation from pure, applied and industrial math, and encourages participation from researchers in all areas of mathematics, applied mathematics and statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pan-New England symposium will serve to build bridges between universities and connect researchers, particularly upcoming and younger researchers, women and underrepresented minorities, in similar mathematical fields. The geographic proximity of these universities makes it more likely that networks formed at the conference can be sustained and strengthened, which in turn should increase the probability that these researchers stay in the field and become highly productive members of the community. The symposium lays a strong emphasis on vertical integration, namely having representation at all levels, from undergraduate students to faculty, as we believe this is particularly beneficial to achieve the objectives of the symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium website is: http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/aah/WINRS/index.html</AbstractNarration>

The conference was spearheaded by Prof. Ramanan, Division of Applied Mathematics, Brown University, and co-organized by a very able team of graduate students, including Stephanie Dodson,   Karen Larson, Amanda Howard, and Anna Lischke, Brown University, with input from Siddhi Krishna, Boston College, and Victoria Day, U. Mass Amherst.  The conference was open to everyone, regardless of gender identity, and was vertically integrated, in that it had participation of people at different levels of their career, ranging from undergraduate students to faculty.  Specifically, the conference had 102 participants, including 20 professors/senior researchers, 7 post-doctoral fellows, 35 graduate students and 40 undergraduate students.  The conference featured two plenary lectures by Prof. Moon Duchin, Tufts University, whose talk "How Things Spread Out"  described various aspects of hyperbolicity, and Prof. Mary Lou Zeeman, Bowdoin College, whose talk on "Mathematical Modeling: from Menstrual cycle to Resilience"  focused on mathematical modeling using dynamical systems and how to choose research problems.  Based on the feedback we collected, both plenary talks were extremely well received.   The conference also had three tutorials, which were given by Dr. Linda Ness, Rutgers University, who discussed an aspect of data analysis, Dan Nichols, graduate student from University of Amherst, who gave a tutorial  on cryptography and Nicolas Garcia Trillos, whose tutorial focused on topics at the interface of PDEs and machine learning.   An AWM Student Chapters meeting was also held at the  conference, so that various local student chapters could exchange practices and brainstorm on ideas to keep their chapters active.    There were also short contributed talks and a poster session, as well as a Math Corners event, in which people with similar mathematical research interests could gather -- the corners included several topics, including "Math Biology", "Dynamical Systems and PDEs", "Analysis", "Financial Mathematics", "Statistics", "Machine Learning", "Topology", "Geometry", "Group Theory" and "Number Theory".   The conference concluded with an 8-member panel, which focused on mentoring.  Funding was provided to plenary and tutorial speakers, as well as many students and post-doctoral fellows to attend the meeting.  The conference website is available here:  http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/aah/WINRS/index.html  Feedback on the panel was collected, with a 60% response rate, with all but one person saying they would recommend this conference to colleagues.  The comments were very positive, including statements such as "Our students came back full of excitement and energy.  They said the conference was fantastic." and "Thank you for initiating what we hope will become a tradition." as well as some minor suggestions for possibly changing or adding a few things to the format.  The conference appears to have filled a definite need, and the PI is identifying volunteers who would be willing to run similar regional conferences in other parts of the country as well.
