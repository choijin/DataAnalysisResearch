<AbstractNarration>This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports fundamental research to enable the realization of reliable and ultra-high energy density batteries by low cost manufacturing methods. Research results can help in making electric vehicles cost-competitive with gasoline powered vehicles. The research will also benefit the Internet of Things, the healthcare, and the consumer electronics industry, because many applications need robust and high capacity batteries.  In addition, this project will help train US workforce in the interdisciplinary areas of energy, advanced materials, and advanced manufacturing through the development of interdisciplinary curricula and various science activities for diverse youth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on making 3D electrodes using an aerosol jet-based additive manufacturing method along with nanoparticle sintering. The first research objective is to establish relationships between process parameters and the quality of 3D electrode architecture produced by the processes. Process parameters of aerosol jet-based additive manufacturing include carrier gas pressure, and nanoparticle size and dispersion; and sintering process parameters include sintering energy and time. The quality of 3D electrode architecture will be measured in terms of porosity level, pore geometry, specific capacity, and resistance to capacity fade. This objective will be achieved by carrying out experimental research guided by theoretical models. The solidification of nanoparticle solutions upon dispense and the consecutive sintering process will be modelled by using a discretized particle model and a diffusive model. Further, a model that solves the Li diffusion equation coupled with stress evolution and the cracking in the porous electrode will be developed using a multi-scale modeling approach. These models will guide the additive fabrication experiments using high specific capacity materials such as silicon and silicon dioxide. The second objective is to identify relationships between the characteristics of an artificial coating on the electrode and the resistance to electrode capacity fade. The characteristics of the coating include the thickness and uniformity of the coated layer. To achieve this objective, atomic layer deposition will be used to create an electrode-electrolyte interface layer over the 3D porous electrodes. Several microscopic analyses such as atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy will be used to measure the coating thickness and uniformity. Battery electrochemical experiments will then be carried out and the resistance to capacity fade will be measured using cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy.</AbstractNarration>

In addition to advancing the science of manufacturing to realize three-dimensional porous electrodes, the research was also focused on obtaining a fundamental understanding of the electrochemical and mechanical processes in porous electrodes to engineer improved batteries by utilizing AM. This research led to several important outcomes as summarized below. First,&nbsp;a completely new AM process was developed that created hierarchically porous structures with porosities and structural features spanning about 5 orders of magnitude in length scale.&nbsp;This method involved using aerosol jet (AJ) printing, where microdroplets containing electrode materials were rapidly stacked in 3D space without any support structures, followed by sintering, to create the hierarchically porous electrodes. Fig. 1 shows an electrode structure fabricated by AJ printing with structural features and porosities ranging from tens of nanometers to a several millimeters. A schematic of the process is shown in Fig. 2. Second outcome of the research was the realization of ultra-high capacity Li-ion batteries by using the hierarchically porous electrodes fabricated by AM. This outcome represents a major advance in battery technology. As shown in Fig. 3, the electrodes with hierarchical porosity fabricated by AM led to an unprecedented improvement in the battery performance such as 400% increase in specific capacity, 100% increase in areal capacity, and a high electrode volume utilization when compared to a solid electrode. These results indicated that the AM-fabricated hierarchical porous structures enhanced the electrolyte transport through the electrode volume, increased the available surface area for electrochemical reaction, and relieved the intercalation-induced stress; leading to an extremely robust high capacity battery system. This outcome will lead to new avenues for improving the performance of a wide range of electrochemical storage systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;The third outcome of this research was the development an electrochemical-mechanical model that revealed mechanisms by which 3D electrodes enhanced the battery performance. This generic model was used to map the lithium concentration and potential distribution in the porous electrode structures to identify the effect of different three-dimensional electrode shapes, packing densities, and porosities on the battery electrochemical performance. It was revealed that in order to fully reap the benefits offered by 3D structures for both energy and power performance, the length scale of members forming electrode structures need to be optimized at a scale of the order of the intercalation diffusion length, which is tens of micrometers. This outcome provided highly useful design guidelines for optimized hierarchically porous 3D electrodes for superior battery performance.&nbsp;In addition, the research supported by this award has led to several significant publications and a patent application, and the training of the next generation of engineers, including that from underrepresented minorities, in the important areas of advanced manufacturing and Li-ion batteries.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/25/2020<br>      Modified by: Rahul&nbsp;Panat</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1747608/1747608_10414661_1603680099079_Outcomes_Fig.1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1747608/1747608_10414661_1603680099079_Outcomes_Fig.1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1747608/1747608_10414661_1603680099079_Outcomes_Fig.1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(A-D) Aerosol Jet printed electrode structures with 3-D microarchitectures with a size scale of tens of nanometers to tens of millimeters (length scale control over 5 orders of magnitude).</div> <div class="imageCredit">AAAS</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rahul&nbsp;Panat</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1747608/1747608_10414661_1603680149556_Outcomes_Fig.2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1747608/1747608_10414661_1603680149556_Outcomes_Fig.2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1747608/1747608_10414661_1603680149556_Outcomes_Fig.2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic of the fabrication of 3D micro-architected battery electrodes by assembling nanoparticles in 3D space at microscale using the aerosol jet printing process.
