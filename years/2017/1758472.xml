<AbstractNarration>Narratives of personal change often include accounts of spiritual experiences. The research supported by this award will investigate if and how these experiences actually affect people's lives going forward.  Anthropologists have studied how cultural beliefs and practices produce spiritual experiences but less is known about the long-term effects of the experiences that informants describe. Do these experiences matter, and if so, how? Answering this question is important for understanding how and why people make major changes in their lives.  These changes could include mundane choices of school or career, or weighty choices such as whether to stop using drugs or join a terrorist organization.  Understanding the full range of factors involved in personal change is critical for developing interventions, counseling programs, and policies that will help Americans to live healthy, safe, and productive lives.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of Virginia anthropologist, Dr. China Scherz, and her team will investigate this question by studying the effects of spiritual experience in the lives of people attempting to make a major life change. Building on two years of preliminary research, they have chosen to focus the final phase of their study on recovery from alcohol addiction. The research will be conducted in Uganda because spiritual experiences are more commonly foregrounded in Ugandan recovery narratives due to the limited options for biomedically based addiction treatment.  Over the course of a year, the researchers will will gather data with qualitative ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews, and mapping exercises. They  will follow 25-30 people who have tried to stop drinking, focusing on the effects of spiritual experiences in their lives over time.   Results of this research provide a model for including spiritual experiences in social scientific understandings of life transformation, which will be generalizable to many United States populations. The study will also provide the first extended analysis of contemporary modes of conceptualizing and addressing problem-drinking in an African context.  Poverty, access to schooling, and diseases including HIV, tuberculosis, cancer, and other non-communicable diseases in many sub-Saharan African countries have been increasingly linked to high levels of alcohol consumption.  Addressing these problems is important to U. S.  interests in global health and development. This study will highlight novel and cost-effective ways to capitalize on local paradigms for addressing problems related to substance abuse and mental health.   Dr. Scherz's ties with academics and policy-makers at leading national psychiatric and medical facilities in Uganda and in the United States will facilitate the dissemination of results and the translation of the study's findings into meaningful program and policy recommendations. This study will also help to develop a cohort of researchers working in this area by providing opportunities for Ugandans and U.S. undergraduates to develop their research skills and capacities through hands-on practice and mentorship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of the "Alternative Pathways to Well-Being" (NSF Award #1758472) project were to better understand (1) how spiritual experiences affect processes of ethical transformation and (2) how spiritual experiences and participation in communities oriented towards these experiences affect people?s networks of social support.    From March 2018 to August 2019 anthropologist China Scherz and her team investigated this question by studying the effects of spiritual experience in the lives of a cohort of Ugandans living in Kampala who were seeking to leave histories of alcohol abuse behind. Scherz and her team gathered data about their experiences through qualitative ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews, and mapping exercises, focusing on the effects of spiritual experiences in their lives and shifts in their networks of social support.  The team-based approach also contributed to the training of two Ugandan researchers and a US undergraduate.  Given the relatively recent introduction of ideas of alcoholism and addiction, most Ugandans use other therapeutic resources to define and address problems related to alcohol.  These treatments can include herbal therapies, engagements with spirits and their mediums, and forms of deliverance and spiritual warfare practiced in Pentecostal and Charismatic Catholic churches.  Though these therapeutic forms differ from one another in substantial ways, Scherz and her team found that they all present challenges to the prevailing biomedical model of addiction as a chronic relapsing brain disease.    The affordances of these other approaches can be seen most clearly in the Pentecostal churches and the shrines of spirt mediums.  Despite their differences, in both of these types of sites problem drinking is thought to be caused by spiritual forces that come from outside the self. For Pentecostal Christians in Uganda, the external forces are conceptualized as demons, and moving beyond problems with alcohol requires Pentecostals to exorcise the spirit which is causing the problem through prayers for deliverance. For sprit mediums, the external force is also conceptualized as a spirit, but here the task is to better accommodate the troubling spirit by recognizing the spirit and moving into a more productive relationship of reciprocity with them. For both Pentecostal Christians and spirit mediums, alcohol-related problems can be explained as resulting from the actions of an external force. Where they differ, and here they differ strongly, is about what the moral valence of these external spirits is and what ought to be done about them.   Centrally related to Scherz's interest in exploring the relationships between spiritual experience and social support is an effort to understand how beliefs and experiences like these shape people?s relationships with others. When Scherz and her team began the study, they were conceptualizing the link between these two things, the spiritual experiences and the social relationships, as being somewhat coincidental. In short, they hypothesized that spiritual experiences might people to participate more intensively in spiritual communities and thus they find more opportunities for social support. Over the course of the study, they have come to see the connection between these two factors differently. Through their research they have come to understand that specific beliefs about spiritual forces can change the way that a person is perceived by those around them and that this can greatly alter the sources of social support that they have available to them.  To take the examples given above, when those around the former drinker see the former drinker as separate from the spiritual forces that caused the person to drink, important opportunities for building trusting interpersonal relationships in the future are created since the former drinker is conceptualized as radically separate from their prior actions.   This dynamic can be contrasted with the dynamic found in in-patient recovery centers which generally subscribe to the chronic relapsing brain disease model of addiction.

Such relationships of trust are further fostered through the creation of a series of opportunities for demonstrating one's reliability and trustworthiness in progressively more public ways.   This study not only contributes to the anthropological literature on ethics by greatly expanding the range of experiences that may be considered relevant to processes of personal transformation, it also contributes to the anthropological study of addiction by showing how addiction and recovery look in a place where the idea of addiction as a chronic relapsing brain disease has not fully taken hold.  By offering a new perspective on what might be possible outside of this model, this study will contribute to the care and healing of people living with addictions.
