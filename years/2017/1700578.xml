<AbstractNarration>Networks are increasingly becoming a powerful tool to model and analyze the properties of naturally occurring and engineered interacting dynamic systems.  In a wide range of applications, networked dynamical systems theory provides a coherent framework to model phenomena such as the emergence of highly structured or synchronized global behavior, or to analyze the possibility of altering the natural dynamics in a collection of decentralized interacting dynamic systems.  In both natural and man-made systems, the presence of inherent network structures may explain the onset of collective behavior or inhibit the possibility of freely controlling the dynamics of the system.  Although such structures are mathematically rare, they appear widely in real-world networks such as yeast protein interactions and human B cell genetic networks, technological networks such as the Western States US power grid, US airports, the Internet, and social networks such as email and academic collaboration networks.  From a controls design perspective, it is therefore imperative to fully understand for a networked dynamic system how the local structure of the network affects the ability to control or alter its dynamic behavior and to develop algorithms that avoid undesirable control intervention.  The proposed research will provide STEM training for students at a primarily undergraduate institution that serves a predominantly minority population.  Moreover, the interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research will involve students from several STEM disciplines such as electrical engineering, applied mathematics, and computer science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The existing body of knowledge on the relationship between network structure and the ability to control the dynamics of a multi-agent system has fallen behind in addressing the need to control ever more complex networks in engineering and naturally occurring systems. The objective of this research is to advance our understanding of how the topological structure of a networked multi-agent dynamic system governs the selection of a group of agents to alter the behavior of the overall system and accomplish system-level tasks such as state transfer or regulation. The methods used in the proposed research will blend techniques from mathematical control theory, algebraic graph theory and matrix analysis, and scientific computing. Outcomes of the research will include a catalog of new network structures directly related with the ability to control a given networked dynamic system, and efficient algorithms to detect these structures and their demonstration in real-world technological and biological networks.  The expected results will add to the development of a usable theory of the control of networked multi-agent systems. This research will also make new connections with control theory and algebraic graph theory.  From a practical standpoint, one of the impacts of this research will be to provide control design engineers and scientists with a broad overview of the controllability profile of a given network and its effect on designing decentralized control protocols.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A multi-agent networked dynamic system consists of a collection of entities/agents undergoing a dynamical process whereby each entity of the network is capable of communicating only with neighboring agents.  In such a network, agents operate through local interactions via an information exchange network in order to accomplish system-level tasks. Examples of such systems include communication satellites, sensor networks for environmental monitoring, social interaction sites like Facebook and Twitter, biological processes such as yeast protein interactions and gene regulatory networks, parallel computing distributed systems, and many others. Although the presence of these so-called networked multi-agent systems in applications is diverse, many of them share the following common features: (1) the individual agents are dynamic systems with decision making capabilities, and (2) information can be diffused among the agents via an interconnection network. A central issue that binds these diverse multi-agent systems is to understand how the interconnection structure (local or global) of the underlying information network affects the dynamic properties and global behavior of the system.  The goal of our research was to advance our scientific understanding of how the local structure of an interconnected dynamic system influences the ability of control engineers to efficiently perform fundamental control tasks such as state transfers and steady-state regulation.   With respect to the intellectual merits of the project, our research has uncovered new local structures that when present in a network of entities undergoing a dynamical process inhibit the ability of engineers to control the network.  Before our work, local structures such as symmetries were perceived to be the main causes of the lack of controllability in a multi-agent dynamical system.  Our findings show that symmetries are only a very special case of uncontrollability inducing structures and that a much wider class of local structures must be taken into account to ensure that networks are designed to facilitate their control.  Moreover, our work has produced exciting results on the spectral properties of a class of networks that have received much interest from the control engineering community and graph theorists.  These findings will be pursued in a future research project.   With respect to the broader impacts of the project, our research has produced a much richer understanding of the spectral properties of a well-studied class of networks which could lead control engineers to design decentralized controls that are energy efficient.  The completed research has also made a significant impact on the lives and career paths of twelve undergraduate students at California State University Bakersfield and State University of New York Geneseo.  Specifically, the students involved in the project received training and/or experience in mathematical research, computer programming, team work,  technical writing, and presentations at national conferences.  The results of the research have been disseminated at international and national conferences, journal publications, and all of the research findings have been made publicly available at the Principal Investigators professional website and open-access journal archives.
