<AbstractNarration>This study will examine the effects of reintegrating migrant children into their families and communities.  Using a longitudinal approach and mixed methods, the results should generate knowledge regarding the policies and practices of removal and reception of children, providing evidence to inform child protection and human rights locally and internationally.  The research will contribute to scholarship on migration, reintegration, and the effects of law.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project engages three areas of scholarship: the migration literature on deportability, the anthropology of youth, and socio-historical literature of post-conflict nations. Although prior scholarship has seen children as the recipients of others' care, and migrants as individuals in motion, the present project challenges this approach by positing that children are part of a family structure and that their return has effects on them, their families, and their communities. Using the household as the primary unit of analysis, the study examines the effects of youth reintegration on families, peer groups, and communities.  The principal investigator has had access to migrating youth in the United States and will follow them as they are reintegrated with their families in Guatemala. The research will employ a household survey, ethnographic interviews, participant observation, and individual ethnographies.</AbstractNarration>

Nestled within a rich literature on post-conflict Central America, the study likewise responds to significant gaps in applied and theoretical knowledge on child migration and deportation and the anthropology of childhood and youth.  This three-year, multi-sited and mixed-methods study incorporates ethnographic fieldwork with young migrants  and their families, interviews with U.S., Mexican and Guatemalan stakeholders, and participant observation at Guatemalan and Mexican centers for deported children. The study engages Maya youth as ethnographers of their own lives through workshops for returned youth. Alongside a team of researchers and community leaders, we conducted a household survey in a highland K?iche? community to assess the community-level impact of migration and removal on various indicators such as education, health, food security, land rights, and employment, combining quantitative and qualitative methods in the examination of the enduring causes and consequences of child migration.  There are four target audiences for the dissemination of research findings, including: Community members though the presentation of survey findings in Guatemala; Policymakers in Mexico, Guatemala and the U.S. through the publication of a bi-lingual report and in-person presentations in Mexico, Guatemala, and the U.S.; Scholars through series of academic publications and presentations, including conference presentations, peer reviewed publications, multilingual applied/policy publications, book chapters, and a manuscript entitled Negotiating Returns: The migration and deportation of unaccompanied children; and a Broad public through a multi-lingual, interactive art exhibit circulating across universities, libraries, and community centers the U.S., Mexico, and Guatemala; a multi-lingual series of blogs with Guatemalan scholars; and several online publications targeted toward the general public.
