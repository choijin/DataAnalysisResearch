<AbstractNarration>In the 1950's the physicist Eugene Wigner proposed the study of large random symmetric matrices in order to approximate the behavior of complicated self-adjoint operators. His goal was to understand the scaling properties of the eigenvalues of random matrices to get insight about the spectrum of certain operators arising from the study of heavy nuclei. In the last half century, random matrices found applications in a wide range of areas both within mathematics (e.g., combinatorics, number theory, and the study of interacting stochastic systems) and various other fields as well (e.g., information theory, financial mathematics, and RNA-folding). In the recent years, a new characterization has been established for limit laws of random matrices via the spectra of certain random self-adjoint differential operators. This provides a new connection between random matrices and self-adjoint operators more than half a century after Wigner's original idea. This research project explores this new area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on recent results of the investigator and collaborators on random operator representations of scaling limits of random matrices. The aim is to study the resultant random operators in order to learn more about the limit point processes.  Questions under study include the application of the classical theory of differential operators to random matrices, the study of operator level convergence results for random matrix models with quantitative error bounds, and the investigation of the connection between random matrix limits and diffusions in the hyperbolic plane. The project also includes investigations related to the study of the large-scale behavior of interacting stochastic systems. It is conjectured that a wide family of one-dimensional interacting stochastic systems share an unusual scaling behavior with limit distributions related to random matrix theory; this is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class.  The investigator intends to explore various models belonging (or conjectured to belong) to the KPZ universality class, with a special focus on directed polymers, a model describing random paths in a space-time environment that is also random.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Broader Impact  Two graduate students were supported from the award: Hans Chamont and Yun Li. Chaumont worked on directed polymer models, a model from statistical physics describing random walks whose distributions are affected by a random environment, he defended his thesis in 2018. Li started working with the PI in 2017 on problems related to random matrices, he is expected to graduate in 2022.  The PI has been successfully running a graduate probability seminar at his host institution since 2011. This is a seminar series where graduate students and postdocs give two or three talks on introductory topics that are usually not covered in the regular graduate probability courses.  The PI  gave a  graduate level topics course on random matrices during the Spring 2019 semester. The PI developed lecture notes and problem sets for the course that were made available to the students in the class.  The PI (in joint work with Anderson and Seppalainen) published an undergraduate textbook in probability. The textbook has been adopted at a number of universities in the United States as a primary textbook for introductory probability courses.  The PI worked on instructional materials for undergraduate probability and stochastic processes courses. Together with Seppalainen he developed lecture notes for a proof-based probability undergraduate course that was introduced by the PI at his institution in 2015. He also worked on lecture notes (with Seppalainen) for an introductory stochastic processes class. These notes served as the primary text for these courses in recent semesters, and they were provided to the students enrolled in these classes.  The PI  worked with an undergraduate student (Yibo Zhai)  on a reading and research project during the summer of 2019. Zhai read papers related to the PI's work on random matrices and worked on one of the open problems related to a former project of the PI. He started his graduate studies in mathematics at the University of Utah in Fall 2020.     Intellectual Merit   The study of random matrices is a highly active area of probability, with a number of interesting connections to other fields within mathematics. One of the central problems is to understand the point process limits of eigenvalues of random matrices. The limit point processes of the classical random matrix models are usually described by identifying their joint intensity functions, the asymptotic probability of seeing points of the process near a given configuration of values. Recently, another characterization has been provided for these limits, as the spectra of random self-adjoint differential operators.  The PI (with co-authors) introduced a framework that allows the study of the asymptotic behavior of random differential operators corresponding to finite random matrices.  The framework also allows the study of the limits of characteristic polynomials which characterizes the limiting point process as the zero set of a certain random analytic function.  The PI derived a number of ways to describe this random analytic function: using systems of stochastic differential equations, by expressing them in terms of modified determinants of random operators, with a Fredholm determinant like expansion, and by writing them as the principal value product of linear terms corresponding to its zeros. These descriptions provide several approaches to analyze the limiting point process. The PI applied the introduced framework to study the limiting operators and random analytic functions arising from the beta generalizations of various classical random matrix ensembles.  In addition to projects related to random matrices the PI completed projects studying the scaling behavior of a random walk on a randomly oriented version of the integer lattice, and the entanglement rate of a Brownian particle moving between two rectangular reservoirs connected by finitely many microscopic openings.
