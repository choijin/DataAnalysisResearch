<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) programs. Professor Ryan Felix from Austin College and colleagues Bradley Smucker, Andrew Carr and James Hebda have acquired a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state.  The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students via independent student research and traditional academic coursework. Students work on these projects year long and especially during the summer months. The spectrometer is also used by chemistry faculty at Grayson Community College and by chemists at Southeastern Oklahoma University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award for a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as: (a) borenium ion mediated enyne cyclization, (b) organogelation, (c) luminescent supramolecular complexes and (d) protein chaperone functions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation Program grant allowed Austin College to purchase a modern Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectrometer (NMR) to replace our aging instrument and install it in our recently constructed IDEA Center, home of the sciences division. The updated instrumentation and proximity have made the spectrometer more accessible for research students and allowed the instrument to be incorporated into our teaching laboratories and classes.  The instrument supports the research agenda of synthetic chemists in the department on projects involving organogelation, natural product total synthesis, and the construction of luminescent molecular squares.  The NMR has been used to provide 1-dimensional, 2-dimensional, and multinuclear spectra taken by 36 undergraduate researchers and three chemistry faculty members.  These efforts resulted in one publication thus far and 12 presentations at regional American Chemical Society conferences.          The NMR has enhanced classroom experiences for Organic and Inorganic Chemistry students at Austin College.  Introduction to the instrument through teaching labs resulted in 72 students learning the process of spectra acquisition with the instrument and gaining hands on experience collecting their own data. This number would be higher but for interruptions to on-campus instruction and restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Data has also been collected using the 2-dimensional and heteronuclear functionalities of the spectrometer to use in our advanced courses, giving students unique learning and spectra analysis opportunities.  In addition to enhancing ongoing research and teaching efforts, the instrument opened up collaborative projects with nearby Grayson College and Southeastern Oklahoma State University.  We look forward to continuing these collaborations in the future.          Last Modified: 11/17/2020       Submitted by: Ryan J Felix]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
