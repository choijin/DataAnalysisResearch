<AbstractNarration>This project analyzes how post-industrial workers accomplish and interpret interpersonal trust at work and how this trust influences workers' job perceptions within a broader context of labor insecurity.  The project will expand knowledge in two scholarly fields.  To the interdisciplinary scholarship on trust, the project offers a conceptual framework that addresses inconsistencies in the definition and measurement of trust across different studies.  The project also enhances labor process theory by investigating how trust organizes workplace relationships at a time when more traditional work structures, such as internal labor markets and unions, are eroding.  In highlighting how trust not only fosters economic production but also guides workplace meanings and commitments, the findings from this project can help employers to create more inclusive and supportive work environments that attract, develop and capitalize on global talent.  In addition, worker advocates and policymakers can use the project's findings to educate workers about the benefits and liabilities of trust and to develop institutional supports and policies that help workers leverage workplace relations to promote economic security and mobility.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workplace trust presents an empirical puzzle for sociologists of culture, labor and inequality. In national surveys, Americans indicate high levels of interpersonal trust at work while reporting very little trust more generally. Prior research suggests interpersonal trust in the workplace should be eroding in today's climate of transient and flexible work, workforce diversity and systematic employee surveillance, yet workers' trust in one another and in managers seems to persist within contemporary American workplaces.  The proposed research investigates this apparent incongruity by asking: (1) how trust is collectively constituted within local work contexts that are distinctly structured by varying levels of hierarchy, surveillance and social status and (2) how processes of trust influence the ways in which workplace actors develop and understand work relationships and assess work situations.  These processes are studied in two class-differentiated, service sector worksites through 12 months of participant observations and 80 in-depth interviews with workers and managers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research examined post-industrial workers? experiences of interpersonal trust in the workplace, which national surveys have reported as being relatively high compared to levels of trust more broadly.  Specifically, I conducted 10 months of ethnographic observations and 90 in-depth interviews with workers and managers in two class-differentiated, service sector worksites &ndash; a restaurant and a marketing firm &ndash; to determine (1) how trust is collectively constituted within local work contexts and (2) how processes of trust influence the ways workplace actors develop and understand work relationships and assess work situations.   Findings from interviews and observations reveal that workplace actors &ndash; both managers and workers &ndash; construct narratives of trust to negotiate and cope with the liminality of contemporary work.  This collective production of trust at work serves to align employee and employer interests, despite the precarious, short-lived, and asymmetrical qualities of today?s employment relations. Workers bracket their own replaceability at work by presenting themselves as trustworthy, and they place trust in co-workers and managers to inject meaning into short-term relations and to fend off the dehumanizing aspects of their jobs.  Managers, for their part, evoke trust to bolster the legitimacy of their authority and to entice workers into relations of obligation.  I find that gender, race, and class intersect with performances and perceptions of trust, allowing some workplace actors &ndash; particularly, white, middle-class workers &ndash;  to navigate contemporary employment more successfully than others.   These findings, which will be submitted to academic press publishers in 2019, contribute to academic scholarship in three ways.  First, I offer a new conceptual framework to the interdisciplinary scholarship on trust.  Demonstrating how social actors pragmatically, yet creatively, pull upon and combine available meanings and symbols of trust to make sense of specific situations and pursue courses of action, my "cultural-relational" approach provides a valuable framework for more nuanced and context-specific analyses of trust.   Second, I contribute to debates about the role of bureaucracy in curtailing or exacerbating workplace inequalities, showing how trust is interactionally accomplished in ways that can challenge the status quo but that performances of trust remain accountable to existing status hierarchies and organizational structures, limiting the capacity for meaningful, long-term workplace change.  Finally, as trust is made salient by insecurity, I use trust as an analytic lens to parse out three distinct, yet previously underexplored, experiences of precarious and insecure work: namely, the unpredictability and fluctuation of work tasks; the ambiguity regarding appropriate work behavior and fair divisions of labor; and the uncertainty about employment expectations and obligations.  In terms of broader impact, this research brings attention to the sometimes asymmetrical implications of the cultural lexicon of trust that exists within managerial texts.  With a more complete understanding of the role of trust, as not only a resource for collaboration and worker engagement but also as a mechanism of control and exclusion, management scholars and business leaders can revise narratives of workplace trust in ways that are more aligned with workplace equality.  Additionally, as this research demonstrates that relations of trust can create interpersonal ties of obligation that drive workers to overexert and overcommit themselves to employers, policymakers can use this information to construct stronger work hour regulations that limit interpersonal pressures within an increasingly porous contemporary work landscape.   To this end, I have presented my findings at two professional conferences, and I have also provided evidence-based consultation to my organizational hosts.
