<AbstractNarration>The main objective of the proposed research is to study robust, efficient and accurate numerical methods for multiscale and multiphysical models of nanoscale optical devices. Nanoscale experimental and manufacturing technologies have proved huge successes and potentials in biomedical engineering and new materials. Quantitative modeling and simulation will not only help to understand the mechanism of these nano devices but also greatly reduce the cost by minimizing trial errors and optimizing the performance. The PI will collaborate with chemists and material scientists on photon driven nano devices and attosciences. Methods developed  for nano-optics will shed light on a wide variety of nanoscale problems. The mathematical analysis of the self-consistent multiscale methods will bring new insights into the field of multiscale modeling and computation. Junior collaborators and graduate students will receive cross disciplinary training on new frontiers of applied mathematics, and will be better prepared to solve realistic problems with a combination of modeling, analytical and computational skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To fully understand photon driven nano and micro devices, the PI will derive multiscale models for interactions between the electromagnetic field, electronic excitations and molecular motions by combining classical electrodynamics, time dependent current density functional theory and Ehrenfest molecular dynamics in the linear response regime. The self-consistent multiscale scheme will be adopted to solve the system efficiently. Metal enhancement will also be investigated. To accurately simulate long time propagations of strong field processes involving nonlinear higher order interactions, the PI will adopt adaptive numerical strategies. Multiscale schemes will be designed for the concurrent simulation of electrodynamics and quantum mechanical processes on the time domain. The PI will also conduct a thorough analysis of the algorithms in terms of convergence and stability.</AbstractNarration>

From the modeling point of view, it is imperative to consider the microscopic fields that are created by atomic electric charges in motion. In order to overcome the high computational cost of Quantum Electrodynamics Theory (QED), a semi-classical model has been recently developed in the form of a non-local response theory, in which the evolution of electromagnetic field (light) is described using the classical Maxwell’s equation, and the motion of charged particles (matter) is treated quantum-mechanically by the Schrodinger equation.  The main objective of the research program is to apply the machine learning technique of Network Embedding in the context of intra-cellular bio-chemical reacting networks to overcome the high dimensional challenge of these systems.

Transition states for metastable systems. With simple but intuitive information on chemical kinetics, Transition States (TS) remain essential in understanding complex reacting systems when the system is metastable. My student J.
