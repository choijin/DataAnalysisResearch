<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to coordinate and evaluate the first Southeast Regional PULSE (SERP) Institute, which will be held on the campus of the University of Richmond from June 18-22, 2014. The Institute promotes the mission of the Partnership for Undergraduate Life Science Education (PULSE) to stimulate whole departments to undertake the type of transformative changes recommended in the report Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action (AAAS, 2011), so as to promote student learning of core concepts and competencies, improve student retention in the sciences, and produce more curious and scientifically literate citizens. In September 2012, the PULSE founders from HHMI, NIGMS, and NSF appointed 40 Vision and Change Leadership Fellows to pursue this mission, and the SERP Institute will be coordinated by the 14 PULSE Fellows located in the Southeast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current award funds the first Southeast PULSE Regional (SERP) Institute, which will host teams from up to 20 colleges and universities, with at least 30% from minority-serving institutions. The SERP Institute will begin with institutional teams conducting a departmental self-assessment using the STEM Department Evaluation Rubric developed by the Leadership Fellows, and participants will plan their attendance at subsequent workshops based on the areas they identify as unfamiliar and/or high priority for improvement. Each team's administrator will be encouraged to attend sessions led by administrators who have supported reform, and these leaders will share advice, successful strategies, and ways to overcome common obstacles. Prior to departure from the Institute, each team will develop an action plan to target improvements in their program for the next academic year and beyond. The project's assessment plan, developed in partnership with the American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS), will include feedback on the structure and function of the Institute as well as evaluation of each team's progress based on data collected before, during and after the SERP Institute. Teams will also be encouraged to use particular assessment tools to evaluate student learning outcomes and dispositions as well as changes in faculty teaching practices and attitudes. Each team will provide an update on their progress during a poster discussion session at the annual meeting of the Association of Southeastern Biologists (which occurs ten months after the Institute), and the southeast PULSE Fellows will present the results of this project at the annual Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACS-COC) Conference, the AAC&amp;U STEM Conference, disciplinary conferences, a publication in CBE-Life Sciences Education, and via the http://www.pulsecommunity.org website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education support of efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/.</AbstractNarration>

From the applications received, twenty (20) institutions were accepted to the first SERP Institute, and eighteen (18) were accepted to the second. Of the <a href="http://www.pulsecommunity.org/page/list-of-institutions-participating-in-the-second-southeastern-reg">thirty-eight (38) participating institutions</a>, twelve (31%) are MSIs. For several departments, it was their first time to participate in such a program. &nbsp;Teams from each institution consisted of two faculty members from the life sciences department, the department Chair, and an upper administrator with the authority to support the department&rsquo;s reform work at home (Figure 1).&nbsp;</p> <p>The ten (10) research-based factors targeted for improvement were introduced to participants via the <a href="http://www.pulsecommunity.org/page/stem-department-evaluation-rubric-and-goals">STEM Department Evaluation Rubric</a>, which was created to teach users about topics often unfamiliar to scientists, thus quickly building a common vocabulary among its users to support subsequent discussions about departmental strengths, weaknesses, and priorities for improvement.&nbsp; The Rubric&rsquo;s ten topics, which formed the basis of most of the workshops (Figure 2) and plenary sessions at the <a href="http://www.pulsecommunity.org/page/southeast-regional-pulse-serp">SERP Institutes</a>, are:</p> <ol> <li><em>Embedding authentic research into courses</em></li> <li><em>Developing students higher-order cognitive skills</em></li> <li><em>Building students&rsquo; metacognitive awareness and skills </em></li> <li><em>Developing students&rsquo; core competencies</em></li> <li><em>Increasing access to independent, mentored research</em></li> <li><em>Adopting engaging, student-centered pedagogies</em></li> <li><em>Providing faculty development</em>&nbsp;opportunities and incentives</li> <li><em>Using assessment</em>&nbsp;evidence to guide ongoing department improvement</li> <li><em>Building a change-receptive culture</em></li> <li><em>Integrating department goals with Gen Ed and Institutional mission</em></li> </ol> <p>Additional session topics included strategies for mapping a department&rsquo;s curriculum to the core concepts and competencies in <em>Vision and Change</em>, creating inclusive classroom environments, leveraging SACS-COC accreditation requirements to stimulate positive departmental change, how to apply for NSF funding, and building faculty leadership to guide department-wide reform.&nbsp;</p> <p>Each Institute team developed an Action Plan, which they shared with other teams prior to departing the Institute (Figure 3).&nbsp; &nbsp;Based on Action Plans and post-institute surveys, the most common priorities for improvement were: developing students&rsquo; metacognitive abilities, integrating research into coursework, using engaging pedagogies, building students&rsquo; higher-order cognitive skills, and increasing faculty development opportunities.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Association of Southeastern Biologists (<a href="http://www.sebiologists.org/">ASB</a>) was an important partner in the SERP Project.&nbsp; The annual meeting of ASB occurred approximately ten (10) months after each SERP Institute, and the meeting provided the venue for SERP team representatives to report on their department&rsquo;s progress since the Institute.&nbsp; Thirty-six (36) of the thirty-eight (38) institutions presented posters on their department&rsquo;s progress at one or more ASB meetings (Figure 4).</p> <p>As of November 2017, the department Chair (or designee) from twenty-eight (28) of the thirty-eight (38) participating departments completed the SERP Project&rsquo;s final survey.&nbsp; Figure 5 summarizes the reported progress of teams on six (6) topics, and Figure 6 details the total numbers of facutly and students that department leaders report have been impacted by initiatives inspired by the SERP Project.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Ellen&nbsp;S&nbsp;Goldey</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1723614/1723614_10335367_1514667137244_Fall2017SERPDataSurveyTable--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1723614/1723614_10335367_1514667137244_Fall2017SERPDataSurveyTable--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Snapshot of Impact of SERP Project"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1723614/1723614_10335367_1514667137244_Fall2017SERPDataSurveyTable--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Snapshot of Impact of SERP Project"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 6 shows the total number of faculty members and students reported to be impacted by the SERP Project.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of the Southeast Regional PULSE (SERP) Project has been to engage entire departments in undertaking the types of reform called for in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (2011).   There were four (4) main objectives of the SERP Project: 1) to be inclusive, so that the work would touch diverse faculty and students at all institution types across the southeast, 2) to focus the attention of departments on ten (10) research-based factors known to improve student outcomes and faculty efficacy, 3) to maintain a collaborative and supportive network that encouraged departments to follow through on their Action Plans, originally conceived during one of two, four-day SERP Summer Institutes, and 4) to assess the SERP Project through analysis of surveys, interviews, Action Plans, and poster presentations in order to determine the impacts of the SERP Project on departmental reform.  Thus, the Project?s Intellectual Merit has been to inspire entire departments to adopt evidence-based practices in undergraduate biology education. The inclusive and supportive nature of the Project has ensured its Broader Impacts.  Assessment evidence shows that hundreds of faculty members and well-over 20,000 undergraduates, representing the full range of the region's rich diversity, have been impacted by SERP-inspired reforms.  In addition, although the focus of the Project has been on life science departments, the impact has extended to other STEM and non-STEM departments, and several participating institutions have been successful in using what they learned in the SERP Project to secure funding from NSF, HHMI, or other sources.  To encourage broad, inclusive, and diverse participation, schools from across the southeast region were invited to apply to attend each SERP Institute, and funds from this NSF EAGER award covered the costs of attendance at the Institute.  Schools of each Carnegie Classification type were selected randomly from the list of schools accredited by SACS-COC, and the US Department of Education's list of Minority Serving Institutions was also used to ensure that at least 30% of the seventy (70) SERP Institute invitations went to MSIs. From the applications received, twenty (20) institutions were accepted to the first SERP Institute, and eighteen (18) were accepted to the second. Of the thirty-eight (38) participating institutions, twelve (31%) are MSIs. For several departments, it was their first time to participate in such a program.  Teams from each institution consisted of two faculty members from the life sciences department, the department Chair, and an upper administrator with the authority to support the department?s reform work at home (Figure 1).   The ten (10) research-based factors targeted for improvement were introduced to participants via the STEM Department Evaluation Rubric, which was created to teach users about topics often unfamiliar to scientists, thus quickly building a common vocabulary among its users to support subsequent discussions about departmental strengths, weaknesses, and priorities for improvement.  The Rubric?s ten topics, which formed the basis of most of the workshops (Figure 2) and plenary sessions at the SERP Institutes, are:  Embedding authentic research into courses Developing students higher-order cognitive skills Building students? metacognitive awareness and skills  Developing students? core competencies Increasing access to independent, mentored research Adopting engaging, student-centered pedagogies Providing faculty development opportunities and incentives Using assessment evidence to guide ongoing department improvement Building a change-receptive culture Integrating department goals with Gen Ed and Institutional mission   Additional session topics included strategies for mapping a department?s curriculum to the core concepts and competencies in Vision and Change, creating inclusive classroom environments, leveraging SACS-COC accreditation requirements to stimulate positive departmental change, how to apply for NSF funding, and building faculty leadership to guide department-wide reform.   Each Institute team developed an Action Plan, which they shared with other teams prior to departing the Institute (Figure 3).   Based on Action Plans and post-institute surveys, the most common priorities for improvement were: developing students? metacognitive abilities, integrating research into coursework, using engaging pedagogies, building students? higher-order cognitive skills, and increasing faculty development opportunities.   The Association of Southeastern Biologists (ASB) was an important partner in the SERP Project.  The annual meeting of ASB occurred approximately ten (10) months after each SERP Institute, and the meeting provided the venue for SERP team representatives to report on their department?s progress since the Institute.  Thirty-six (36) of the thirty-eight (38) institutions presented posters on their department?s progress at one or more ASB meetings (Figure 4).  As of November 2017, the department Chair (or designee) from twenty-eight (28) of the thirty-eight (38) participating departments completed the SERP Project?s final survey.  Figure 5 summarizes the reported progress of teams on six (6) topics, and Figure 6 details the total numbers of facutly and students that department leaders report have been impacted by initiatives inspired by the SERP Project.
