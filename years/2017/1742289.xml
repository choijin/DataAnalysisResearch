<AbstractNarration>With funding from the National Science Foundation's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, this project at Truman State University (TSU) in Missouri is designed to support at least 90 academically talented students with need-based scholarships for up to four years while they pursue a degree in one of four science departments (Agricultural Science, Biology, Chemistry, or Physics) to help address the regional and national demand for more and better prepared STEM majors. Because many students display poor self-efficacy, which serves as a barrier to success in earning a STEM degree, this project will test whether development of a scaffolded learning community with curricular and co-curricular activities improves self-efficacy and retention in STEM. If students can see themselves as scientists, realize available career paths, and have the tools to be successful in a STEM major, they are more likely to graduate in STEM fields. The project includes an aggressive recruiting plan that focuses on students from underrepresented ethnic and minority backgrounds, first-generation college students, students from families with low socioeconomic status (SES), and students from rural communities with plans to increase the numbers of scholars from these groups who graduate from TSU with STEM degrees. The scaffolded courses will form the foundation for a novel Scientific Research minor that will be open to all TSU STEM majors. The success of these courses, the research-focused STEM minor, and the learning communities created will be disseminated as a model for supporting student development and as a mechanism to increase participation of all students in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will employ well-documented, high-impact practices that increase success of students, and it will explore the impact of several novel practices. Participants will learn the interdisciplinary nature of science through a series of scaffolded seminars. In these seminars, interactions within and between cohorts will develop a supportive learning community. More experienced students will have increasing levels of responsibility in the seminars as they realize their ability to be successful in STEM and see themselves as developing into scientists. Through the scaffolded seminar series and academic and professional development initiatives, participants will see themselves as scientists and will be prepared to excel in careers in STEM. The mentoring and scaffolded learning opportunities will develop a supportive community for all students and will increase learning and confidence of participants. The student success and professional development activities reflect effective practices from the STEM education literature and have been shown to be successful in supporting all students, including underrepresented groups, in STEM at Truman and other institutions. Participants will have peer and faculty mentors, and, as they progress through the program, will become mentors to younger cohorts. Academic and professional development activities will help the participants visualize the transition from being a student to a STEM professional. Tutoring, intrusive advising, and study skills development will be used to increase academic success in STEM courses. Through professional awareness and development activities, such as an interdisciplinary workshop and applications for research experiences, students will see an array of career possibilities and feel prepared to explore them. The program has a robust evaluation plan that will identify program success and direct adjustments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
