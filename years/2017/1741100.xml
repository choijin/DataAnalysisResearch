<AbstractNarration>Graphene-based composites (combinations of graphene and nanoparticles) are being adopted for versatile applications in field-effect transistors, sensors, supercapacitors, solar cells, Li-ion batteries, photocatalysts, and photoconductors. However, the performance of graphene composites is often plagued by the highly disordered microstructure, aggregation of nanoparticles, and loosely connected interfaces between graphene and nanoparticles.  This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project seeks to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of enhanced electrochemical properties of graphene/silicon nanocomposites in their battery application through controlled laser processing. The laser assisted synthetic study will be complemented by theoretical modeling that seeks to predict the observed behavior. The educational activities associated with this project focus on hands-on outreach activities for middle school students on battery technology, coordinated through the Women in Engineering program at Purdue University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this research is to manufacture graphene/silicon nanocomposites by laser processing and understand the electrochemical behavior through atomistic modeling and electrochemical tests. Laser processed graphene/silicon nanoparticles display advantages in mechanical stability, material uniformity, and low contact resistance at graphene/nanoparticle interfaces. To develop a fundamental understanding of laser processing and the resulting properties, the research plan has two major objectives. The first objective is to study the interfacial engineering of laser processed nanocomposites through experiments and modeling. The second objective is to understand the electrochemical behaviors of graphene/silicon nanocomposites by performance tests, such as charging/discharging cycle stability and rate performance. The research will determine the optimum processing conditions for the enhanced electrochemical performance of graphene/silicon nanocomposite. The knowledge gained from this work will facilitate the manufacture of graphene based nanocomposites and contribute to the development of energy-storage materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aims to manufacture architectured nanocomposites from layered deposition of graphene and silicon nanoparticles followed by laser induced high strain rate compression to reach well controlled interfacial bonding between graphene and silicon for the electrochemical application.  Graphene-based composites are often highly disordered resulting in uncertainty in their reproducible performance.  Even though the nanoparticles exhibit intrinsically superior electronic, catalytic, or mechanical properties, the nanoparticles tend to agglomerate and experience a significant loss of the intrinsic properties. Meanwhile, the interface between graphene and nanoparticles often plays a crucial role in determining the electric, electrochemical, and mechanical behaviors. A loose control of the interfacial condition and porosity of the nanocomposites significantly compromises their functions.   This project deal with the above challenges with a hybrid process of layer by layer (LbL) deposition of graphene and silicon nanomaterials with homogenous chemistry, followed with laser shock compression to generate ideal interfacial bonding between the constituent materials.  This nanoarchitectured composite can be actively engineered to synthesize components with designed multifunctional properties.   1) Improved mechanical reliability:  2) Uniformity:  3) Low contact resistance between graphene and nanoparticles.   4) High energy density:  5) Low temperature processing:  6) Scalable process  We have studied the fundamental mechanism of additively manufacture layered 2D/0D nanomaterials by laser shock compression to build strong interface between 2D and 0D materials.  We have also performed standard electrochemical tests, including the synthesis of the composite electrodes, assembly of coin cells, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement, battery cyclic performance and rate performance tests, to validate the enhanced electrochemical properties of the nanocomposite electrodes.     The following tasks have been carried out:     A)    Silicon/graphene composite electrode fabrication:   Before coating process, two types of nanoparticle dispersion are prepared:  Silicon nanoparticles(NPs) dispersion.   Graphene oxide(GO) dispersion.  A laser pulse (1064 nm wavelength, 7 ns pulse duration) is applied ono the sacrificial layer, generating a shock wave propagating onto the electrode. As a result, the Si/GO composite electrode is compressed by the shock. Finally furnace annealing at 600&deg;C for 1 h under protection of argon atmosphere. Laser shock processing usually generates compressive residual stresses to the treated surface. Ideally, this effect can well handle the tensile residual stress generated during the solvent drying while coating silicon or GO layers. In the meantime, we also observed that if excessive laser power (440 mJ/cm2) is applied, the integrity of the film can also be compromised.     B)    Electrochemical performance of the Si/GO nanocomposite electrode  Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to analyze the electrochemical characteristics of the samples during charging/discharging.  The only cathodic peak in the first discharge process is attributed to a insertion-type reaction between the crystalline Si and Li ions, which forms a Si-Li alloy. The cathodic and anodic peaks in the following charge and discharge processes correspond to the recoverable reaction between amorphous Si and Li ions. All the cathodic and anodic peaks of laser treated Si/GO nanocomposite electrode are in good agreement with that of Si NPs, indicating the laser treatment does not change the chemical composition and electrochemical properties of active materials in the electrode. The maximum discharge capacity can reach 1408 mAhg-1 when the laser treated electrode is cycled at 5C (12000 mAh/g). It should be noted that the conventional slurry-based Si NPs electrodes usually can't achieve such a high cyclic rate.     C) Laser treatment induced microstructure evolution.   i) Laser shock induced Si/GO contact enhancement. Since the reduced GO provide the necessary conductivity to the composite electrode, the good contact between Si and GO is crucial for the electrode to deliver an adequate electrochemical performance. This can be also seen from TEM observations where GO wrinkles are shown only in the laser treated sample. These wrinkles are mostly like from the conformal wrapping of GO onto SiNPs.  ii) Laser shock induced defect on GO.   When GO sheets are forced to wrap on the Si NPs, a strained area on the GO sheets is often generated near the edges of the contact. The strain might assist the pre-existed crystalline defects on the GO to develop into nano-scale pores, especially during the thermal annealing process. Since the nano pores are only generated around the dimples on the GO sheets, where strain is mostly likely to be induced by the laser shock. Furthermore, these nano pores can exhibit as channel for Li ion transportation, while perfect graphene sheets won?t allow large ions to pass through. We did observe the enhanced rate performance of the laser treated electrodes compared to non-laser treated ones.   iii) Laser shock induced mechanical enhancement. We also studied the after-cycle morphology of the Si/GO composite electrodes. The SEM observation of the after-cycle Si/GO electrodes shows that the laser treated samples have less cracks and porosity compared to the non-laser treated ones. It can be inferred that the mechanical stability introduced by the laser shock process helps the electrodes extend the cycle life.
