<AbstractNarration>Proposals from SEA are fundamentally different form others is this panel because SEA does not support any NSF-funded science. Rather the program is a shipboard educational experience that has offered high-quality academic programs to college, high-school, and graduate students, as well as K-12 teachers, for 45 years. The National Science Board recently named SEA the recipient of its 2016 Public Service Award for making a substantial contribution to increasing public understanding of science and engineering. NSF recognizes that many SEA alumni are professionals working and teaching in the marine sciences and related fields and for that reason have allowed for limited support through the Instrumentation Program. The panel considered this when it evaluated the requests and found that all items were adequately justified and important to the operations of SEA. The proposal was rated as Very Good. Nevertheless, in an uncertain budget year and without compelling NSF-funded work to call on, the Program will offer limited support for the proposal. Of the six requests, the Program will recommend the top two priorities. The remaining four should be submitted next year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Program recommends an award of $16,462 for the purchase of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Deionized Lab Water System                        $7,445&lt;br/&gt;2) Two (2) Water Sampling Carousel Frames   $9,017</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Through this award, Sea Education Association (SEA) upgraded two types of oceanographic equipment on its sailing research vessels. Recognized by the National Science Board&rsquo;s 2016 Public Service Award as an important contributor to increased public understanding of science and engineering, SEA brings university students to sea on international voyages of exploration and marine science research. We place our shipboard labs and technical equipment in the hands of our students, allowing them to conduct investigations into coastal and open ocean phenomena of their own design; they then analyze, document, and communicate the findings of their projects. New water column sampling systems (carousel frames) funded by NSF provide the infrastructure for SEA&rsquo;s existing suite of sensors that together measure ocean characteristics from surface to seafloor, describing the temperature, oxygen, and productivity of different zones. Using bottles attached to each carousel frame, we also collect seawater samples from various depths and examine the water quality and chemistry (nutrient levels, pH, carbonate parameters). These analyses are now conducted using high-quality pure water generated in our sailing labs with a new NSF-supported water-maker. Beyond SEA academic semester programs, the data collected on our two ships is shared with scientists interested in similar questions or geographic areas at institutions without open ocean access, as well as with the local communities and schools in regions we visit. Each year, nearly 250 students and collaborators sail on SEA vessels and utilize NSF-funded oceanographic equipment; over half are women and a significant number identify as underrepresented minorities. All program participants, regardless of academic major or professional interest, are required to learn about marine science and work in the shipboard laboratory. The technical skills and environmental literacy gained through an SEA experience shape tomorrow&rsquo;s researchers, policy-makers, conservation stewards, and leaders.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /> </span></p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/02/2018<br>      Modified by: Paul&nbsp;S&nbsp;Joyce</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1723633/1723633_10480883_1522682519041_SEA-OI1_RobertCSeamans--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1723633/1723633_10480883_1522682519041_SEA-OI1_RobertCSeamans--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SSV Robert C.
