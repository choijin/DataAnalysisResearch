<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to advance models, theory and algorithms to solve a difficult class of optimization problems called chance-constrained mixed-integer programs (CC-MIP).  Although CC-MIPs are ubiquitous in practice, operations research theory and algorithms provide limited guidance for this class of problems.  CC-MIPs include quality of service or reliability constraints; they are dynamic, contain uncertain data, and involve discrete decisions. The resulting multi-stage stochastic mixed-integer programs are challenging both theoretically and computationally. The service level requirements are modeled with joint chance constraints, which are non-convex. In addition, the deterministic equivalents of CC-MIPs are very large-scale MIPs. To overcome these challenges, this research aims to develop a unified theory and computational methodology, utilizing extended formulations, polyhedral combinatorics, and decomposition algorithms. The research will be pursued in four major thrusts: (1) chance-constrained mixed-integer programs, (2) dynamic chance-constrained problems, (3) chance-constrained problems with special structures, and (4) chance-constrained problems with technology uncertainty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from this research will advance decision-making tools in several sectors that operate under uncertain environments and high service level expectations, such as energy, telecommunications, finance, emergency management, and distribution systems. For example, the modeling framework and strong cutting planes for joint chance constraints may be incorporated into existing open-source MIP modeling languages and software to improve their ability to solve CC-MIPs that arise in practice.  The educational goals of this award are to develop novel programs that will arm the next generation of students with skills to incorporate uncertainty into optimization theory, models and solution methods, and to attract women and other under-represented groups to pursue advanced research in this field. In pursuit of these goals, case studies will be developed from application areas to highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainty into decision-making processes, and tutorials will be given through various fora to disseminate the research results to a broader audience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award addressed decision-making problems under uncertainty involving events with low probability but dire consequences. In such cases, it is important to develop optimization models that provide cost-effective solutions that limit the risk of undesirable outcomes.  The results of this research have an impact in a range of sectors that operate under uncertain environments and high service level, quality or reliability expectations, such as power systems, homeland security, disaster preparedness and relief, and supply chain systems.  The problems faced by decision makers of complex systems are challenging because the underlying systems are dynamic, large-scale, and they involve discrete choices. Furthermore, the components of the system are typically interdependent. The models and methods developed in this project explicitly consider such interdependencies through the use of joint chance constraints. Hence they are designed to reduce overall systemic risk, instead of the risk of individual components. The theory and computational methodologies proposed in this project allow dynamic decisions that are data-driven and adaptive to realizations of uncertainty. In addition, they enable the solution of problems with many scenarios by decomposing the large-scale formulation and coordinating the solution of the smaller problems under each scenario to achieve a provably optimal solution.  The outcomes of this project are  the design of effective algorithms for joint chance-constrained optimization problems, the implementation and testing of the scalability of the new algorithms, the application of these algorithms in disaster preparedness, supply chain design, power systems, and other networked systems.  Our computational experience indicates that the proposed models and algorithms are effective in solving several classes of joint chance-constrained optimization problems, which were unsolvable by the state-of-the-art software without decomposition. Five Ph.D. students, including those from underrepresented groups in engineering, received partial funding from this grant to support their dissertation research. In addition, the investigators integrated the research results into the content of their Ph.D. classes. The results were widely disseminated through publications in top-tier journals in the operations research field, and presentations at prominent national and international conferences including tutorials.
