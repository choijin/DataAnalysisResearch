<AbstractNarration>This travel award can defray costs for selected US-based students to participate in the Intensive Research Program on Discrete, Combinatorial and Computational Geometry (IRP-DCCG), which will take place April 16 through June 8, 2018 at the Centre de Recerca Matematica, Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain.  This event is a multi-week program of mini-courses and state-of-the-art lectures, in addition to hands-on experience with software and problem-solving designed to stir interest and deepen capability for research in discrete, combinatorial, and computational geometry,  which in turn expands the opportunities for cross-fertilization between areas of research and application. Several European funding sources support lecturers. This award can defray some of the travel costs for two of the many US-based lecturers, in addition to allowing US-based students to take advantage of the event.  It particularly encourages and facilitates the participation of under-represented groups, giving junior researchers an opportunity to engage in the important technical, professional, and international exchanges that are fostered at a multi-week intensive research event.  For information and selection criteria, see http://dccg.upc.edu/events/intensive-research-program-on-dccg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Research in the field addresses fundamental questions that arise from diverse application domains, including robotics, data science, networks, sensing, biology, computer vision, geometric modeling, manufacturing, and many other areas of science and engineering.   This project funded travel for students and junior researchers to participate in the events at the Intensive Research Program on Discrete, Combinatorial and Computational Geometry in Barcelona in 2018, and the Fall Workshop on Computational Geometry 2018 (at Queens College, New York).  The Intensive Research Program (IRP) offered a unique opportunity for interaction among its senior and junior participants.
