<AbstractNarration>The diversity of biological forms and the nature of their variation lend themselves to geometric data analysis by topological methods.  These methods quantify shape by recording the values of parameters (such as height, thickness, time, distance, temperature, or curvature) across which the topology of the geometric object changes: holes emerge or collapse; connected components join or diverge; cavities form or fill. Current geometric methods of this sort can handle one varying parameter, but data often call for more than one.  This project develops an algebraic framework to encode and compute in the context of this multiparameter topological data analysis.  The proposed methodology is general, applicable to datasets from any scientific inquiry, but it is being developed here in service to a fundamental question in evolutionary biology: what mechanism drives the generation of topological variants in sufficient quantity for selection to act?  The model organism for this investigation is the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, specifically the pattern of veins in its wings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops mathematical foundations for multiparameter persistent homology.  This investigation is in service to a specific question in evolutionary biology, using fruit fly wings as the model system, but the proposed methodology is general, applying homological algebra, real algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and computational techniques to encode, control, and provide insight theoretically as well as for applied and algorithmic purposes.  The parameters are allowed to vary continuously on stratified spaces, instead of the usual discrete setup with one parameter on a simplicial complex.  As such, the project transforms the way we think about commutative algebra in two independent ways simultaneously: by considering real vectors or an arbitrary poset instead of integer vectors for multigradings, and by splicing together the augmentation maps of free and injective resolutions to get "fringe presentations" of modules.  The combination of techniques from free resolutions and injective resolutions also transforms how we think about topology and geometry, since it renders the new conception of multiparameter persistent homology transparent topologically -- features are described in terms of birth and death (generators and cogenerators) rather than by birth and relations between births (generators and relations) -- while greatly expanding the potential for effective computation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Statistical methods for geometric data are not currently set up to handle drastic, discontinuous shape changes, akin to addition of a sixth finger to a five-fingered hand as opposed to, say, lengthening the hand as a whole.  These shape changes occur in evolution, but often the pressures to maintain the original shape are so strong that errant shapes occur only rarely in each generation.  But if shape variation of this sort is so rare, how can selection act to encourage populations exhibiting the rare variant to flourish?  That is, given a discrete morphological feature that rarely varies in wild populations, how can evolutionary forces generate qualitatively new features with enough frequency for selection to act?  The grant was aimed, in the long term, at answering this biological question, starting from a dataset of photographic images of fruit fly wings that exhibit this strong shape maintenance with rare shape variation.  Answering the biological question requires statistical methods that can handle families of shapes whose topology -- that is, their overall structure -- varies.  Persistent homology is one possible such method, a multiscale analysis that takes into account what data look like as the view zooms in and out.  However, one parameter to record the zoom factor is not sensitive enough to handle topological variation in the fly wing data.  On the other hand, while multiple parameters allow enough freedom, in principle, to capture the topological variation, working with multiparameter persistent homology requires new mathematics, both for theory and for algorithms.  What kind of new mathematics is required?  Ordinary algebra deals with polynomials, where variables are multiplied a whole number of times, so the exponents are integers.  In contrast, because of the way multiparameter persistent homology is encoded algebraically, the continuous quantities common in data analysis yield exponents that are real numbers instead of integers.  The main thrust of this project laid foundations for the algebra of polynomials with real exponents instead of integer exponents.  As a result, multiscale statistical methods based on persistent homology with more than one real parameter now have mathematically precise and -- crucially -- finite data structures suitable for algorithmic implementation.  This mathematics has brought the data analysis closer to being able to answer the motivating fundamental question in evolutionary biology.  Other aspects of the project improve efficiency of symbolic computational techniques with systems of polynomial equations or provide startling symbolic methods to carry out computational tasks not previously deemed possible.  These developments are fueled by advances in deep areas of geometry using discrete structures that govern the newly laid algebraic foundations, or by landmark advances in algebra.  Among these are the first steps in the entirely uncharted realm of polynomials with real exponents and the solution of a central, widely known, half-century old problem at the interface of algebra and discrete mathematics.  The rich mix of subject areas, including aspects of mathematics, statistics, computation, and biology naturally lends itself to multidisciplinary collaboration and mentoring opportunities.  Broadly under the auspices of the grant, the PI mentored four undergraduates, four graduate students, and one postdoc to fruitful next steps in their development.  In the meantime, three undergraduates and two graduate students joined the project on a continuing basis, with two or three postdoctoral advisees to join shortly.  The research undertaken and completed by these advisees spans the range of subject areas and beyond, contributing to pairs of topics such as computation and geometry or statistics and biology.  All of the completed research, by the PI as well as the PI's advisees, was formally written and appropriately made public.  The content was also conveyed directly by lectures and minicourses to audiences ranging from high-school students and undergraduates to seasoned researchers specializing in mathematics, statistics, and biology, as well as occasionally philosophy and history of evolutionary theory. Further opportunities for dissemination were created by the PI and collaborators by workshop organization.  Outreach to the wider community, beyond research and mentoring, included activities such as interfacing with middle-grades educators in the challenging Durham Public Schools district and consulting with local major network television meteorologists to help with display of data uncertainty for primetime on-air public consumption.
