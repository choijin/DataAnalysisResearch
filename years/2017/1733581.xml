<AbstractNarration>It has long been recognized across the sub disciplines of Experimental Physics that there is an essential need to encourage and strengthen advanced instrumentation research and development at universities, to engage faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and students at all levels in the creation and development of new, transformational instrumentation to meet the challenges of near term and future experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coordinating Panel for Advanced Detector (CPAD) Workshops are a valuable mechanism for helping to foment interest and share and review developments in the critical area of instrumentation development, and provide a meeting ground for experts from both university and national laboratory communities.   The third in this series of Workshops, CPAD2017 will be held at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, NM, October 12-14, 2017, and hosted by the Department of Physics and Astronomy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CPAD2017 will overview the science drivers for new technologies in particle physics experiments, and approaches to these topics through contemporary and planned experiments with US participation will be discussed.  Dedicated parallel sessions on forefront topics in calorimetry, tracking, cryogenic detectors, trigger and data acquisition, photodetectors, noble liquids, and related subjects will be convened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF support for CPAD2017 will provide access to participation by younger scientists, who will be central to and essential for current and future advances in frontier research in Physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An award was made to facilitate the participation of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows at the CPAD2017 and CPAD2018 conferences.   Twelve junior scientists received stipends to defray their expenses in airfare, accommodation, and registration fees.  All of those people presented talks at the conference.  The talks ranged in topic from application of ultracold noble gases for particle characterization, to invention of novel semiconductor devices, to development of methods for high bandwidth digital data transmission.  The recipients of the stipends, a diverse group in many ways, were drawn from institutions throughout the United States: from Massachusetts to Illinois to California.  The intellectual merit of the stipends is: state-of-the-art scientific information was disseminated among outstanding professional scientists, leading to new approaches to research.  Areas covered by the distinguished speakers include Quantum Sensing, Next Generation Detector R&amp;D, Machine Learning, and approaches to understanding the Early and Late Universe.  The presentations are all archived at the conference websites (physics.unm.edu/CPAD2017/ and https://www.brown.edu/Conference/CPAD2018/) and are available without restriction.  The broader impacts of the stipends are: junior scientists received opportunities to network, to achieve professional visibility on a national level, and to encounter applications of instrumentation that are new and may stimulate cross-disciplinary collaborations.  Five of the students received special recognition in a plenary session where they gave presentations as finalists for the Instrumentation Graduate Fellowship.
