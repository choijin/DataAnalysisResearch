<AbstractNarration>The NSF invests in a number of programs targeting underrepresented populations and institutions relative to its meeting its goals for broadening participation in STEM. This workshop provides minority serving institutions with an opportunity to engage in dialogue about effective ways to create, implement, and evaluate models of intervention that will advance knowledge about retaining underrepresented minorities in STEM fields. It will advance knowledge in life science and the biosciences for K-12 and undergraduate students attending local schools or eligible minority-serving institutions. The workshop will focus on assisting minority serving institutions with use of research designs, and review of best practices for intervention shown to be effective in helping underrepresented student cope with chronic stresses that interfere with their retention in STEM fields and careers. The target audience for the workshop will be the participating institutions and their undergraduate students, in partnership with local K-12 schools.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In collaboration with Quality Education for Minority and MERAssociates, Rutgers University Newark will provide a unique setting to convene more than 100 participants to attend the workshop. The participants will include deans and/or department chairs; STEM faculty; educational researchers, and institutional representatives such as Vice Presidents of Academic Affairs, Provosts, or other administrators. The participants will work in teams of 4-5 to address science research topics and activities related to curriculum development, teacher support, and student engagement. Outcomes from the workshops will provide insights about successful strategies, areas of future research, and awareness about the need for better intervention models that support underrepresented minority students in STEM.</AbstractNarration>

As the regional host, Rutgers University-Newark was responsible for all local organizational matters including workshop venue preparation and catering needs; recruitment of institutional teams from the northeast region?s MSIs; participant travel, lodging arrangements, local transportation, and stipends. MSIs institutional teams consisted of administrators and STEM faculty.  Intellectual Merit Through synergistic activities among three collaborating entities&mdash;QEM, MERA, and Rutgers-Newark&mdash;and two other regional host universities, the project sought to down a profoundly entrenched and complex social problem: involvement of underrepresented groups in STEM academic fields and careers. In the partnership, the project provided three distinct workshops, to build the capacity of each region?s MSIs to prepare and submit competitive research and development project proposals to NSF DRL/Life STEM that establish, extend, or sustain underrepresented populations in STEM academic fields and careers. As such, the project extended the framework of collaborative impact (Kania &amp; Kramar, 2011).  Broader Impact  Participation of institutional teams ensured stronger campus engagement in preparing proposals and sustaining effective external partnerships and collaborations. Project activities served to broaden the participation of MSIs in DRL and Life STEM programs to support national efforts toward STEM education and workforce development as well as innovations in STEM teaching and learning across the educational landscape.
