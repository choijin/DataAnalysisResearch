<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project concerns the rehabilitation of movement deficits due to disease or injury. Commercially, the project falls within the rehabilitation robot market, specifically the segment that addresses neurological rehabilitation. Currently, available robotic rehabilitation technology focuses mainly on the recovery of motor function after stroke and restricts patient motion to a single plane. This project involves a robotic device that extends the scope of current rehabilitation robots by a) allowing unrestricted 3D movement, and b) incorporating somatosensory in addition to motor training methods. The commercial potential of this I-Corps project is not restricted to clinics specializing on stroke rehabilitation. The device can be used on a broad disease spectrum that includes stroke, but can be extended to patients with Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and traumatic brain injuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project further develops a robotic rehabilitation device that seeks to improve wrist/hand function. The robot comprises a series of motors that can passively move the human wrist/hand, or assist/resist active human wrist motion. It allows for unrestricted 3-dimensional motion while precisely recording wrist joint motion. The system is integrated with a visual virtual reality environment that can provide movement feedback and can serve as an interface for visual-based training regimes. The technology has been tested in over 300 human users aged 18-82 years. It has been applied to assess sensory and motor dysfunction in stroke survivors and patients with Parkinson's disease. Test-retest reliability and validity of its outcome measures has been established.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project concerned robotic technology for the physical rehabilitation of hand/wrist function. Together with engineering partners in Italy and Singapore, the investigators are developing a robotic rehabilitiation device called WristBot. Going through the I-Corps program helped the team to connect with patients, clinicians, and, very importantly, with decision makers in health care administration who ultimately make purchase decisions.  Intellectual Merit: Participation in the I-Corps program provided valuable resources and support to move the WristBot device closer to market. It helped the team to refine the value proposition of the device, to confirm a beachhead market, and to gain an enhanced understanding of patient need and cost constraints of the rehabilitation health care industry.  Upon completion of the program, we should be in a position to arrive at a Go/No Go decision with respect to the current WristBot platform.  Broader Impacts: For the United States market the WristBot system addresses the diagnostic and therapeutic need of an estimated 1.6-1.8 million patients a year that suffer from proprioceptive loss and associated motor deficits (incidence rates for stroke: 795,000 new cases/year, Parkinson's disease: 1.5 million/year; cancer patients receiving chemotherapy: 650,000/year; source: U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention). The majority of these patients are treated in over 10,700 in- and outpatient rehabilitation facilities, which comprise the initial U.S. market entry for the WristBot. U.S. rehabilitation robot market size was $203.3 million in 2014 is expected grow to reach $1.1 billion by 2021. Key drivers are changes in demographics, such as the increase in the ageing population and a rise in lifestyle-related chronic diseases, and the rise in healthcare spending.  Outcomes: The main insights from conducting customer discory interviews are that two value propositions have to be met before rehabilitation clinics adopt robotic technology. One concerns the improvement of clinical outcomes for patients, the other one concerns the financial value for the customer. Rehabilitation directors will buy rehabilitation technology to improve a) patient upper extremity function by a at least 15% and b) care efficiency by 30%, which increases revenue by at least 10%.
