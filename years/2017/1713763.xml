<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the "Computational Methods and Function Theory 2017 Conference" that will be held at Lublin, Poland, 2017 during July 10-15, 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of Geometric Function Theory.   A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.   The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.
