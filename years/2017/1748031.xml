<AbstractNarration>A large number of bridges located in seismic regions in the United States are in need of immediate retrofit or replacement. Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC) techniques have been investigated to accomplish these retrofits/replacements more rapidly, that is, in days, rather than weeks or months, in order to minimize socio-economic impacts due to disruptions in bridge operation.  Further advantages of ABC techniques include reduced environmental impact through reduction in construction emissions, improved safety and reduced traffic delays for the traveling public, and improved product quality/durability. Despite these advantages, ABC techniques have been mostly implemented in low seismicity areas because of uncertainties in their seismic performance. This research will study the performance of a new system, termed the hybrid sliding-rocking (HSR) bridge, which has shown the potential to combine construction rapidity with resilient (low damage) seismic performance. This research will improve understanding of the dynamic response properties of HSR bridge systems, and address the lack of design procedures for HSR bridges and the lack of methods and data to quantity the costs and benefits of such a system over its life span. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HSR bridges combine the features of rocking systems with the attributes of sliding seismic isolation, providing a versatile resilient seismic system for ABC. This research will formulate a holistic framework that integrates mechanics-based modeling of sliding/rocking systems, computational sensitivity studies for major design variables, experimental validation and performance assessment studies, development of performance-based seismic design (PBSD) methodologies, and life-cycle benefit-cost evaluations. This framework will be applied to the HSR bridge concept to investigate the fundamental dynamic response properties of HSR bridges, quantify the effects of various design variables on the seismic performance of HSR bridges, develop a PBSD and life-cycle assessment methodology for HSR bridges, and quantify the performance benefits of HSR bridges over conventional bridges over their entire service life.  This research will advance understanding of the fundamental mechanics/dynamics and seismic response of sliding-rocking systems through an integrated experimental and computational approach. This research will also advance the science of the design and evaluation of new seismic systems by formulating a new holistic framework for PBSD and life-cycle assessment that will be applicable to new systems in both building and bridge construction.</AbstractNarration>
