<AbstractNarration>The 2017-2019 BLAST conferences will be the eighth through tenth in a series of yearly meetings devoted to the foundations of mathematics, with the BLAST 2017 meeting being held during August 13 to 17 at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. The BLAST conference series focuses on Boolean algebra, lattice theory, algebraic logic, general algebra, set theory, and set-theoretic topology. The University of Denver will host the 2018 meeting and the University of Colorado will host the 2019 meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year this grant will support the participation of 15-20 graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s and 12 speakers. Participation by women and minorities will be actively sought and encouraged. The conference series provides an environment for graduate students and young researchers to learn about new developments in several related areas of the foundations of mathematics and provides them with a venue to showcase their own work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference website is at &lt;br/&gt;http://math.colorado.edu/blast/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The award 1728391 is a conference support  award for the BLAST Conference Series. This award partially supported  three conferences in the Foundations of Mathematics in the Rocky  Mountain/Western/Midwest United States during the years 2017, 2018, and  2019. The first conference in this grant cycle was held at Vanderbilt  University in Nashville Tennessee in August 2017. The second conference in this grant  cycle was held at the University of Denver in Denver Colorado in August 2018. The  third conference in this grant cycle was held at the University of  Colorado in Boulder Colorado in May 2019.  BLAST stands for Boolean algebra, algebraic Logic, universal Algebra,  Set theory, and set-theoretic Topology. The conference series, which  started in 2007, focuses primarily on the interactions between algebra,  logic, and set theory. The meetings attract leading researchers from  around the world, and the meetings are an essential source of  intellectual stimulation for researchers in the foundations of  mathematics who work in or near the Rocky Mountain, Western, and Midwest  areas of the United States.  The defining goals of the BLAST conference series are the following:  (1) Provide a forum for logicians in the mountain/western midwest  region to disseminate their work to each other, and provide  opportunities for collaborations and new lines of research to be  developed.  (2) Concentrate on the areas of logic in which researchers in these states work.  (3) Bring in leaders in BLAST fields from around the world for the  purpose of collaboration. Bring in at least one specialist in each of  the BLAST fields.  (4) Provide a conference accessible to graduate students and young researchers.  (5) Provide a venue for graduate students and young researchers to  showcase their work, provide the opportunity for them to interact with  leading researchers in the field, and provide them exposure to other  areas of logic early in their careers.  (6) Encourage and support the participation of underrepresented groups whenever possible.  A unique feature of the BLAST conference series is that it brings  together researchers from multiple disciplines within the foundations of  mathematics, offers tutorials that acquaint each group with the work of  the other groups, and then provides the intimate and friendly  atmosphere necessary for true interaction and cross-fertilization of  ideas. Each meeting is constructed around a model of 8 invited  lecturers, 4 invited tutorial speakers, and typically 20-30 special  session speakers. The meetings are attended by professional researchers  from around the world, graduate students, and undergraduate students,  and they are open to the public. The total number of participants is  typically 50-70 persons per meeting.  The BLAST grant provides important financial support for the  participation of junior researchers, students, women, and  underrepresented groups. The BLAST Core Group, who decide the venue and  program each year, also provide professional support for these groups by  actively seeking their participation and by including them in the  program at all levels.  The web page for the BLAST conference series may be found at  http://math.colorado.edu/blast/  At this page you will find links to lists of participants, speakers, titles, abstracts, and presentation slides.
