<AbstractNarration>Cognitive variability is a central aspect of human diversity but  it remains an understudied topic in social science research in general and anthropological research in particular. Therefore, in the research funded by this award, anthropology doctoral candidate Anne Kohler, supervised by Dr. Sarah Willen, will undertake to help fill this gap by studying the people who have some level of intellectual disabilities but who are nonetheless capable of expressing nuanced perspectives on their lives, including considerations of how disability affects their social experience. She  will focus on individuals with Down Syndrome, examining how they navigate social relationships and moral commitments within a biomedical setting. The research is significant because it will illuminate intellectual disability as lived experience. Furthermore, this investigation of cognitive difference,  an understudied dimension of human experience, can deepen our understanding of such core social science concerns as the nature of human morality and the sources and effects of inequality and social discrimination.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research will take place in a Down Syndrome clinic at a major teaching hospital in the northeastern United States that is well-known for its innovative work. Research will proceed in three phases: (1) observation of clinic visits; (2) interviews with individuals with Down Syndrome, their clinicians, and their parents, and (3) a photographic project in which Down syndrome participants will photograph their daily lives and reflect on their photos to communicate their experiences. These data will allow the researcher to explore how individuals with Down Syndrome experience healthcare and how they deploy social networks as they consider their health, their life goals, and their social and caregiving relationships. Key research foci include the individual desires and lived experience of those with Down Syndrome, and how healthcare encounters affect and are affected by their life plans and personal values. The research will bring an understudied aspect of the human experience -- the lived experiences of individuals with intellectual disability -- into emerging social scientific theory on intellectual disability and health inequality. Findings also can be used to improve clinical care and build equitable health policy. Existing research collaborations will ensure that study findings are shared with clinical and policy audiences locally and nationally.</AbstractNarration>

The Co-PI carried out 59 in-depth qualitative interviews and completed over 300 hours of direct observation in the clinical environment. A subset of research participants succesfully completed the photovoice component of the project. Results were disseminated to three separate audiences: (1) A data dissemination talk to the core clinical team that operated the clinic in which data was collected, (2) A data dissemination talk open to a broader clinical genetics audience at the healthcare institution in which data was collected, and (3) An invited talk at Simpson College in June 2018 to a diverse audience including undergraduate students, clinicians, community members, and academics. The CO-PI is also preparing her dissertation and will defend in Spring 2019. Several publications have resulted from this research. In keeping with the initial aims of the project, two pieces will be placed in a volume from Oxford University Press on adapting qualitative research methods for use with social science research participants with intellectual disabilities. One is co-authored with a research assistant with Down syndrome and details his experiences of actively contributing to the project as a researcher.
