<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided for participant support for the SnowPAC 2017 Workshop organized by the University of Utah. The award will support participation (via lodging and registration subsidy) by 30 individuals who would otherwise be unable to attend the meeting, with a particular emphasis on broadening participation by junior researchers and groups traditionally underrepresented in astronomy and astrophysics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SnowPAC workshop is an international meeting that reviews recent developments in particle astrophysics, dark matter, dark energy, astronomy, and cosmology. It seeks to establish new connections between these disciplines and establish new collaborative ties between individuals working in these research areas. This workshop focuses on Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs).  These galaxies are studied individually and in large ensembles to yield insight into such problems as cosmic re-ionization and the nature and composition of the matter between galaxies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Snowbird Cosmic Lyman-Alpha Workshop (SnowCLAW) has been held in Snowbird, Utah (March 19 - 24, 2017). It attracted 78 researchers from United States, Europe, and Asia to discuss Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies and their use as probes of circum-galactic and inter-galactic media, cosmic reionization, and large-scale structure in the universe. The presentations include the updates on the latest observations of Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies (e.g., from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey and the MUSE IFU observation) and the new theoretical developments to understanding those galaxies.   The workshop brought together researchers from a spectrum of research directions, fostered interactions among researchers, and facilitated communication between observers and theorists.  This grant has provided registration and lodging supports to junior researchers (graduate students and postdocs) to allow them attend the workshop -- 26 graduate students and postdocs have been supported with reduced registration fee; 43 graduate students and postdocs have received accommodation support with subsidized lodging.      The workshop provided an exceptional opportunity for researchers to learn and discuss about a wide range of topics, from galaxies, circum- and inter-galactic media, to cosmology. It helped the professonal development of young researchers. For example, 37 graduate students and postdocs gave presentations on their work. They were involved in discussions in an open environment and had ample opportunities to interact with senior researhers and discuss research projects as well as career issues.       All the talks and session discussions are available online (http://www.physics.utah.edu/snowpac/archive/snowclaw/) to benefit the general community.
