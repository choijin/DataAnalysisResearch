<AbstractNarration>Individual donors have a long history of making philanthropic gifts to colleges and universities. This doctoral dissertation research project will examine motivations and social benefits of private gifts to support scientific research centers. The project will enhance the understanding of the scientific and social outcomes of research centers established by gifts from individual donors. The findings from this project will be used by governmental officials, university administrators and scholars. The findings will be important to understand how large gifts to science at colleges and universities influences scientific discovery and the types of social benefit these gifts provide to science, the local community and broader society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project relies on qualitative and quantitative methods to provide systematic evidence of the trends and outcomes of philanthropic gifts made by individuals to establish new research centers at academic institutions. The project will employ advanced computing and statistical modeling approaches to test for the significance of donor and institutional variables impacting the establishment of over 100 research centers. In addition, semi-structured interviews with donors, academic fundraising personnel and center directors will provide qualitative data on donors' willingness to give and their expectations for their investments. Case studies on selected research centers will be assessed for their varying levels of scientific impact (e.g. number of patents and publications).  The research will provide new insights on how donors formally and informally impact scientific outcomes when making large gifts to science.  The database will be made publicly available for researchers, policymakers and administrators.</AbstractNarration>

This work addresses the phenomenon of high-net worth donors acting as benefactors of academic science. Nwakpuda&rsquo;s dissertation research increases the scholarly knowledge of the behavior and impact of individual donors who give large philanthropic gifts to support academic science, especially academic research centers. Each of the project&rsquo;s four specified goals were addressed during the funding period.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nwakpuda&rsquo;s data collection efforts began in July 2017. Her first goal was to identify historical trends in elite donors&rsquo; gift preferences for supporting academic science. Working with a machine learning specialist, she was able to expand her prior database of philanthropic gifts to academic institutions to include a total of 10,754 large gifts of $100 thousand or more. After some data cleaning the number of gifts remaining was more than 7,000 large gifts. Gifts to academic science account for roughly a quarter of all gifts in Nwakpuda&rsquo;s philanthropic database. Additionally, gifts to academic sciences are, on average, larger than gifts to all other academic disciplines and entrepreneurs are more likely to give to academic science. Statistical techniques further identify key characteristics of high net-worth donors who support academic science. By disaggregating high net-worth donors who support academic science from all other funding sources this research provides new insights on the profile of high net-worth donors to academic science. Nwakpuda is planning to publish the findings<em> </em>on this topic.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the philanthropic database expanded, Nwakpuda also systematically identified 150 academic science centers established by high net-worth donors&rsquo; gifts to academic institutions. She investigated the 1995-2004 timeframe to identify academic science centers that should have matured and been productive since being founded. A review of these centers&rsquo; websites confirmed the operating status and self advertised impacts of these centers. Sixty-three of the academic science centers were confirmed to have a research focus. The center directors and fundraisers associated with all operating academic centers were solicited for interviews. As a public policy scholar, Nwakpuda sought to use interviews to help understand the mechanisms that influence the impact of research centers. A total of 33 in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted and 26 of the interviews were in regards to research centers. Advanced qualitative analysis software identified common themes of the interviews. Donors are found to act as investors in academic research centers, not to garner monetary returns, but social and scientific impacts. However, few research centers offer evidence of their impact. Nwakpuda finds few centers have publicly accessible lists of their patents, inventions, scholarly research papers, or citations. Future research will continue to develop theoretically grounded classification to assess the success of the centers as there is currently limited information of the impacts of such centers.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The donors themselves were not available to be interviewed. University representatives safe guard their institutional relationships. Thus, Nwakpuda conducted two scenario based experimental surveys (i.e. randomized survey conditions) with less elite potential donor groups, students and entrepreneurs, respectively. Understanding the motivations of prospective high net-worth donors offers some contrast to the motivations expressed or inferred about donors who gave gifts captured in the database. The first experiment with students randomly assigned students into control and experimental treatment conditions highlighting either tax incentives, herding, and social awareness of prominent figures. Results suggest individuals are able to discern differences in innovativeness and social benefit, with a preference for high innovation and high social benefit projects. Additionally, individuals are equally likely to fund high-innovation projects in medicine and physical science. Nwakpuda then designed a second experimental survey to focus on entrepreneurs&rsquo; contributions to quantum science, a high-innovation field of physical science.
