<AbstractNarration>A small satellite with a miniature mass spectrometer (referred to as INMS) as the centerpiece instrument and including all telemetry, communication and attitude control systems has been designed, the instrumental parts fabricated, and what remains is the integration of these parts required to achieve delivery by the spring of 2017. The purpose of this CUBESAT satellite mission is to provide in-situ densities of atmospheric species near 500 km, on a global scale. This satellite, named "EXOCUBE 2", follows directly on the "EXOCUBE" mission that had a similar scientific scope. EXOCUBE suffered communication problems due to an antenna deployment system failure, and one attitude control system gravity boom also failed. Nevertheless, the key science package, the neutral and ion mass spectrometer, did perform as expected and a small amount of data retrieved indicated the efficacy of that instrument, which flew for the first time, on EXOCUBE. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rationale justifying a RAPID proposal for EXOCUBE 2 is that this satellite mission is manifested to fly on the NASA Educational Launch of Nanosat (ELaNa) launch queue in the fall of 2017.  Achieving this date would require the ExoCube-2 satellite delivery to take place within the spring of 2017. The proposed work would rapid assemble and integrate the mass spectrometer and satellite bus to meet this demanding one-year schedule. The very short development time and minimal cost is made possible by the legacy experience and materials left over from the previous flight of the EXOCUBE satellite that unfortunately failed owing to the failure of the deployment of the telemetry transmitting antenna.</AbstractNarration>

Specifically, ExoCube?s gated time-of-flight spectrometer (Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer - INMS) is designed to make thermospheric and exospheric in situ measurements of [O], [H], [He], [O+], [H+], and [He+]. Quantification of these constituents? densities is needed to advance modeling capabilities in support of space weather prediction, assessment of periodic atmospheric variability and secular evolution, and spacecraft operations in low earth orbit.  By providing benchmark measurements over Arecibo, Wisconsin, Kitt Peak, and Cerro Tololo, ExoCube is also designed to support the validation and inter-comparison of ground-based interferometric and photometric observations of neutral airglow emissions as well as active incoherent scatter radar observations of the local ionosphere.  Key scientific objectives included investigation of upper atmospheric global, diurnal, and seasonal variability; charge exchange processes; and atmospheric response to geomagnetic storms.  ExoCube was successfully launched and deployed on January 31st, 2015. Unfortunately, the ExoCube antenna did not deploy properly after the launch and the transmitted signal was weak. There was sufficient signal to send commands to the satellite and to transmit a small amount of data before losing ground contact, and the preliminary data indicated encouraging performance of the instrument.  The ExoCube 2 NSF RAPID mission is a reflight of the original ExoCube mission using an engineering model of the INMS and other spare parts from ExoCube. There are updates to the enginnering based on results of the fault analysis review, including an updated design of the antenna and gravity boom deployment systems.   During the period of performance under this award, the reflight payload and bus were redesigned, fabricated, and integrated, and the satellite is now awaiting launch, anticipated in mid- to late-2018.   The science team, of which UIUC is a part, worked to finalize plans for in-flight operation and development of data analysis tools.
