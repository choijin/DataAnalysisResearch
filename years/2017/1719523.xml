<AbstractNarration>Implementation projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, and assess strategies that can lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. The project at Grambling State University seeks to establish the foundation for building STEM student success, particularly for mathematics and physics students. The goal of the project is to prepare students for graduate school and careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities that are part of this project are: to redesign selected mathematics and physics courses by infusing problem-based learning; to support peer mentoring, mentoring and social integration of mathematics and physics undergraduate students; to develop interdisciplinary big data science courses; to infuse big data science concepts into existing chemistry courses; to provide professional development to faculty who will implement the new strategies; and to conduct an outreach program to high school students focusing on big data. The activities and strategies are evidence-based  and what is learned through this project can serve as a model for other small liberal arts institutions.</AbstractNarration>

The Retention Program focused on improving the retention rates of 2nd to 3rd year STEM students.

CMAST III was successful in implementing strategies that will decrease the gap in STEM workforce needs. Highlights of the program?s success are:  The interdisciplinary Introduction to Big Data course was implemented fall 2017 with majors enrolled from various areas that included accounting, business management, chemistry, computer science, computer information systems, economics, elementary education, engineering technology, psychology, and undecided. Thirty-five (35) students in 8th-12th grade attended the Big Data Science Camp. Forty-one (41) students and (15) faculty from all five STEM departments participated in the research program. Big Data was infused into one existing course, BIOL 409: Biological Research. Big Data was also taught in a new course, CS 435: Big Data and Cloud Security, which was created and implemented into the curriculum fall 2018. Approximately two-hundred and fifty (250) attendees received professional development through the Soft Skills Trainings.  Travel support was provided to faculty and students to attend more than 20 events that included conferences, annual meetings, competitions, outreach and team building activities. STEM faculty and students presented research at technical conferences.   Sixteen (16) scholarships were given. In addition, many STEM students received textbook awards.   The successes of CMAST III validates the Broader Impacts of this implementation project which is to create a model that can be used at the national level.

The CMAST PI, co-PIs, and project director co-wrote the book chapter entitled, "Design and Implementation of a STEM Student Success Program at Grambling State University" which is currently under review.
