<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to build knowledge, experience and leadership capacity in the intersection of science and policy.  The American Meteorological Society (AMS) will conduct an annual Summer Policy Colloquium in Washington DC that will enable interactions with agency leaders, policy makers and government leaders in the legislative and executive branches. The unique set of instructors in the Colloquium typically has interdisciplinary backgrounds in science, policy, and law. The attendees are provided instruction to allow development of skills and techniques for communicating science to policymakers and the public in ways that encourage information sharing and collaboration. Additionally, through instruction, examples, and exercises, attendees learn the legislative process and the roles of science information in support of policy. As a result, the national dialogue among scientists, policymakers, and the public will become more efficient, clear, and solution-oriented. This benefits support of national policy with respect to increased understanding and management of natural resources critical to food, water, energy, resilience to hazards, and environmental protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AMS will use funds provided by NSF to support the attendance of early career scientists as well as faculty members from Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Minority Serving Institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
