<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Professor Roberto Gil from Carnegie Mellon University and colleagues are acquiring a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with cryoprobe. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as the study of biologically relevant species. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the study molecular structure. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to many chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, forensics and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by graduate and undergraduate students via independent student research and traditional academic coursework. Industrial partners area also provided access to the instrumentation in the NMR facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of the NMR spectrometer with a cryoprobe is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts studies of atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and synthesis of protein polymers and biomaterials that have the potential for use in regenerative medicine, drug delivery and neural interfaces. The instrumement is also used for researching substances to aid in aleviating the opioid crisis in America as well as for preparing polymeric materials that bear main-group elements. In addition, the NMR spectrometer benefits exploration of solar fuel generation - making polymers and materials via the principles of molecular design. The spectrometer benefits characterization of hybrid inorganic-nucleic acid nanostructures, indicator dyes for biological imaging, atmospheric aerosols, and compressed cross-linked polymer gels.</AbstractNarration>

An NMR instrument is an essential piece of equipment for any Chemistry Department. Based on demand and department size, the number of instruments in Chemistry Departments around the world ranges from one to ten.

Without access to NMR it would be almost impossible for our Chemist to pursue their research projects. Our NMR Facility was created in July 2003 with two NMR instruments, a Bruker AV-I 300 MHz and a Bruker DMX 500 MHz of resonance frequency for hydrogens.

With funds from the current proposal, the AV-I 300 MHz instrument was replaced by a brand Bruker NEO 500 MHz system equipped with a multinuclear Prodigy cryoprobe (cryocooled with liquid nitrogen) and a 24 holders Sample Case robotic sample changer. The old AV-III 500 became our new walk-up instrument operating 24/7 in automation. This instrument is 10 times more sensitive in <sup>1</sup>H NMR than the decommissioned 300, and it has a 60-sample robotic sample changer. This change resulted in a significant enhancement of our automation capabilities, both in efficiency and sensitivity. The old 300 with a 16-sample robotic sample changer was running an average of 1000 experiments per month. The AV-III 500 is running twice as many experiments per month currently, and this number keeps increasing. On the other side, since the signal-to-noise in <sup>13</sup>C of the Prodigy cryoprobe is ~850:1, being almost three times more sensitive than in the old 500, 1D <sup>13</sup>C NMR experiments takes 1/9<sup>th</sup> of the time to be completed. Hence, the new NEO 500 became the default instrument for carbon NMR experiments. &nbsp;The NEO 500 is now used to run all the multinuclear/multidimensional NMR experiments with pure-shit (homonuclear decoupling) and non-uniform sampling (NUS) capabilities.</p> <p>The new instrument is being used by visiting scholars, postdocs, graduate students and undergraduate students doing research for credit in the Department of Chemistry.
