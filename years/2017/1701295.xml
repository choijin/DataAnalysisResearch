<AbstractNarration>This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) collaborative project will apply insights from the study of human athletes and dancers to enable similarly effective and expressive movement in humanoid robots. The objective is to create the capability for such movement without duplicating the full complexity and articulation of the human torso. Specifically, the project will implement a novel mechanism for shifting a heavy mass that shifts the robot center of mass independently of limb movements using novel muscle-like actuators, and evaluate the results based on a formal system of movement analysis developed for dance, athletics, and physical therapy. In addition to improving the robot's effectiveness at accomplishing locomotion, i.e., a walking gait, these capabilities will provide new channels for communication between robots and humans, i.e., modulating the style of the walking gait. Humans make unconscious inferences about attitude and intent from observing movement. For example, a robot co-worker will be more effective if its movements communicate trustworthiness and competence to its human partners, and a robot first-responder will be more effective if its movements communicate confidence and leadership during an emergency situation. This project incorporates the interplay of art and technology into outreach activities, such as using dance movements to understand fundamentals of robot locomotion.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project takes a novel approach to generating dynamic walking in a humanoid robot, by exploiting the dynamics of a novel, core-located rolling ball-and-tray actuation mechanism arising from exploration of embodied movement theory. The impedance of the actuator is varied in real time, modulating the robot dynamics to produce qualitatively different excitations. The focus of the project is on controlling the expressive character of robot gait, with explicit comparison to human movement. The goals of the project are to explore the role of center-of-mass control in human walking and to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach for bipedal robotic walking through modeling, simulation, and an initial prototype. The work will model and validate the ball-and-tray actuator via a set of motion primitives designed in accordance with Bartenieff Fundamentals, a formal system of movement analysis. The research team brings together experts in movement science, dynamic walking, and muscle-like actuation. In addition to improving robot performance, this work has the potential to increase the bandwidth of robot-human communications. Expressive movement can convey many different emotional contexts, including urgency, calm, enthusiasm, confidence, et cetera. The ability to engineer these contexts into robot movement has many potential applications in human facing scenarios.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Humans do not walk with a single, physically feasible gait; instead we modulate our way of walking to communicate information to human counterparts and accommodate varied environments.  An emergency scenario triggers swifter, urgent walking like a skitter or a stride; a relaxed weekend context elicits a lope or an amble -- in each case, this change in walk cues our counterparts that we are aware of the context we find ourselves in.  This will be critical for robotic agents that may inhabit our workplaces, homes, and public spaces in the future.    This exploratory project aimed to develop initial evidence to support an unusual bipedal robot design.  The goals were to establish whether a core-located mechanism could simulate the role of the human pelvis in creating variable, and thus expressive, gait. In particular, Bartenieff Fundamentals, a component of the Laban/Bartenieff Movement System, were used to inspire the design and behavior of a core-located mass in a two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulation as well as in a prototyped mechanism.  We also aimed to understand how variable gait is generated and interpreted by human viewers.    In order to conduct this work, the PI team, which was working collaboratively with a team at The University of Tulsa and a consultant who is a Certified Movement Analyst, conducted an extensive literature review on the motion of the spine in walking, created two- and three-dimensional models of a bipedal walker with the proposed core-located mechanism; generated hundreds of different gaits in the two-dimensional model; compared the behavior of simulation to an initial hardware prototype; and conducted experiments with human viewers validating and labeling various gaits, including across various contexts, which, we discovered, significantly impacts perception.  Graduate students working on the project were exposed to topics in dynamics, control, robotics, psychology, movement analysis, and dance.  Even PIs on the project learned that there are at least 62 different words to describe ``walking'' in the English language, many of which were unfamiliar to the team.  Students learned to collaborate with other students working on very different aspects of the project, e.g. a student working on hardware prototyping collaborating with a student using optimization to generate variable motion profiles.  The team also gained experience in presentation -- both at technical conferences and in outreach activities.  This dissemination will ensure that our work contributes to future development in robotics aimed at fulfilling the goal of expressive robotic systems that are harmonious counterparts to human beings.
