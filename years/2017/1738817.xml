<AbstractNarration>Non-technical description:&lt;br/&gt;Biodiversity, or the variety of species in an ecosystem, is declining in many areas of the world due to climate change. Many unanswered questions remain as to how ecosystems respond to changing environmental conditions, including changing climates, and how biodiversity is affected by large scale environmental changes. This fellowship will enable research using genetic techniques to study how organisms have responded to past and recent environmental change. The PI will collaborate with colleagues at the Ohio State University to understand how the numbers and genetic variability of four invertebrate species found in southern Appalachian forests change as their environment changes. The new skills gained by the PI will provide long-term benefits to the fellow, the home institution (University of Mississippi), and home state. The fellowship will also generate new opportunities for sustained collaboration with the host institution (Ohio State University). Findings will advance understanding of whether whole communities have the ability to respond to environmental change together, or as individual species. This information will aid in conservation and management of US forest fauna.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description:&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the impact of different historical events and recurrent microevolutionary processes on how co-distributed species show concerted versus independent responses to environmental change allows stronger predictions about how ecological communities will respond to future change. Such a comparative approach can probe the importance of the strength of ecological co-associations among species in constraining or facilitating their responses. As part of this fellowship, population genomic data will be generated and analyzed for a set of four southern Appalachian forest invertebrate species that together enable the impact of strength of ecological co-association on phylogeographic congruence to be assessed. The host institution (Ohio State University) will work with the PI in sequencing reduced representation libraries, computational approaches for performing downstream bioinformatics processing, and implementation of established and emerging phylogeographic analyses. The PI and host will also collaborate on developing analyses that extend the scope of comparative phylogeographic inference.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Biodiversity, or the variety of species in an ecosystem, is declining in many areas of the world due to climate change. This fellowship enabled the development of new skills and approaches for using genetic techniques to study how organisms have responded to past and recent environmental change. Through collaboration with colleagues at the Ohio State University, the PI conducted research that investigated the extent to which a suite of forest invertebrates from a center of biodiversity in the eastern US ? the southern Appalachian Mountains ? responded to historical climatic changes in a concerted manner. Although species-specific patterns of genetic variability were common, there were nonetheless some common themes that emerged, indicating some potential for predicting how other as-yet unstudied species in the region may have responded to same historical climatic changes. In addition to acquiring technical skills, advances relating to how genetic data can be analyzed to more fully reconstruct the history of a species were also made. This was done using computer simulations, which showed that with current genetic techniques, it is possible to detect the lingering signal of past merging of two populations, long after the ?fusion? event occurred. The new skills gained by the PI will provide long-term benefits to the fellow, the home institution (University of Mississippi), and home state. During this fellowship, numerous undergraduate and graduate students were involved in various parts of research, many of whom represent minorities within STEM fields, and an upper-level population genetics course was restructured to integrate new ideas. Overall, this work, as well as related projects and the new collaborations that were formed as consequence of the training, will aid in conservation and management of US forest fauna.</p><br> <p>
