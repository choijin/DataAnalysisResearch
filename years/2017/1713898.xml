<AbstractNarration>In the northern oceans, the distribution and diversity of species has been heavily impacted by glacial maxima. Sea anemones in the widespread temperate genus Metridium are benthic invertebrates that have been affected by past glaciations. Recolonization histories post-glaciation can be constructed and traced back to an originating refugial populations by studying the environmental adaptations and population genetics of contemporary populations of Metridium. This project will investigate the survival limits of Metridium to inform species distribution models while providing a deeper understanding of their potential and past distributions. The research for this project will be conducted at the Akkeshi Marine Station (Hokkaido University) in collaboration with Dr. Masahiro Nakaoka, an expert in marine benthic ecology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be focused on performing experiments of live Metridium senile in aquaria with manipulated variables of temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen. Populations that dispersed to Hokkaido from a southern refugium are expected to tolerate greater higher temperature and to salinity fluctuations, whereas populations originating from deeper water are expected to show lower tolerance for fluctuations in temperature and salinity. Additionally, the researcher will be collecting specimens of M. senile throughout their northern range in Japan for molecular analysis, which, when compared with others throughout the Pacific, will indicate as to whether Japan served as a refugium for the Northern Pacific. These data will be applied to a wider study on the North Atlantic and Pacific phylogeography of M. senile to examine how distributional changes have proceeded and shifted as a response to atmospheric changes and inform how they might respond to future shifting climate conditions.

Defining the survival limitations of these organisms is imperative to our overall understanding of where a species is able to survive now and in the future. Glaciation, including the most recent glacial maximum (LGM) approximately 20k &ndash; 21k years ago, dramatically changed and shifted suitable habitat for shallow water communities through the formation of extensive ice sheets in the western hemisphere. <em>Metridium senile</em>, the fluffy sea anemone, is a species only found in temperate to sub-arctic waters. Therefore, the range has been susceptible to past and future changes in ocean temperature and salinity. We therefore completed two 40-day experiments at the Akkeshi Marine Station, part of Hokkaido University in Japan, on the survivability of <em>Metridium senile</em> under a range of temperatures and salinities.</p> <p>&nbsp;We collected individuals of <em>M. senile</em> from Akkeshi Lake in Hokkaido, Japan, and acclimated them to lab conditions for nine days. These were then placed into aquariums where they were separated by plastic cups and maintained at their respective treatment temperature (control (15 &ndash;18&deg;C), 20&deg;C, 24&deg;C, and 27.5&deg;C ) or salinity (5, 15, 30 (control), 37, and 45 ppt). We monitored the temperature and salinity over 40 days, and recorded which individuals were alive/dead at the times of recording parameters. Based on these findings, we calculated the lethal temperature for 50% mortality to be 24&deg;C, and the salinity extremes to be 14.84 ppt and 37.52 ppt. Additionally, we observed asexual reproduction through laceration of the pedal disc occurring only within treatments comfortably within the survival range. These results are currently being compiled into a manuscript and will be submitted within the next few months.</p> <p>&nbsp;Additionally, I was able to collect representative individuals of <em>M. senile </em>from 6 locations around the periphery of Hokkaido. These collections represent all the major currents around Hokkaido, thus should be a complete representative of the genetic diversity in Northern Japan. These data will be added to a larger worldwide dataset that is being compiled to examine the biogeography and taxonomy of <em>Metridium</em> throughout its range. This will provide potential explanations for how benthic marine organisms responded to climatic changes during the last glacial maximums, and how genetic diversity has been preserved within refugia and subsequently dispersed.</p> <p>&nbsp;Personally, this award exposed me to how science is implemented in a foreign setting. I was able to closely work with numerous Japanese lab members at the Akkeshi Marine Station, which resulted in a constant exchange of ideas. It opened up potential collaborations with both members of the lab at Akkeshi and throughout Japan. The limitations work will be included as a chapter in my Ph.D. dissertation, and the sampling the diversity throughout Hokkaido will be included as a large portion of dissertation work.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/06/2018<br>      Modified by: Heather&nbsp;Glon</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1713898/1713898_10485372_1520392436081_GOPR1386--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1713898/1713898_10485372_1520392436081_GOPR1386--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Metridium senile in northern Hokkaido"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1713898/1713898_10485372_1520392436081_GOPR1386--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Metridium senile in northern Hokkaido"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">M. senile as observed while diving</div> <div class="imageCredit">Heather Glon</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Heather&nbsp;Glon</div> <div class="imageTitle">Metridium senile in northern Hokkaido</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1713898/1713898_10485372_1520392483762_IMG_3576--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1713898/1713898_10485372_1520392483762_IMG_3576--rgov-800width.jpg" title="M. senile in Muroran"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1713898/1713898_10485372_1520392483762_IMG_3576--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="M. senile in Muroran"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">M. senile as observed on docks in Muroran, Hokkaido, Japan</div> <div class="imageCredit">Heather Glon</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Heather&nbsp;Glon</div> <div class="imageTitle">M. senile in Muroran</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
