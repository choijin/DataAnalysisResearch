<AbstractNarration>ACM International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services (ACM MobiSys) is the premier event for presenting innovative and significant research of mobile systems, applications and services. The research topics of MobiSys span multiple disciplines, including wireless networks and communication, mobile sensing and crowdsourcing applications, wearable computing, vehicular and robotic wireless systems, operating systems, distributed algorithms, data management, energy management, sensors, security and privacy. ACM MobiSys brings together academic, industry, and government professionals to a single-track, highly selective forum, to exchange technological advances of mobile systems, applications and services. The goal of this student travel support is to promote research engagement of students, especially ones who are not well-funded, under-represented, or otherwise unlikely to be able to attend this high-profile conference on mobile systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant will support approximate 20 student participants from recognized US institutions of higher education. The opportunity will be widely advertised among the potential conference attendees. A student travel grant committee is formed to select awardees, based on student qualification and benefits to be received from attending the conference. Priority will be given to under-funded or under-represented students. The student awardees will attend the conference and have opportunities to exchange innovative ideas in a vibrant field, which will significantly influence their future research directions.</AbstractNarration>
