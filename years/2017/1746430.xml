<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at developing a superior platform for the preparation of samples for cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy (cryo-TEM). Cryo-TEM provides images of morphologies and structures of liquid-based samples with nanometer resolution, which provides crucial insight for the development of materials in the pharmaceutical, chemicals and consumer goods industries, amongst others. Cryo-TEM sample preparation requires a sample thinning step, which results in a ~10-100 nm thick film that is appropriate for both sample vitrification and imaging. Commercial platforms provide thin samples with a blotting process, which has many drawbacks. Blotting leads to a variety of significant sample artifacts due to shear induced on sample structures. Furthermore, time required for blotting limits temporal resolution for studies of dynamic processes. A proprietary blotless sample thinning strategy reduces shear induced on the sample, and improves temporal resolution of sample preparation, by orders of magnitude. The integration of an innovative process with these advantages into a commercial platform would capture a large portion of the cryo-TEM sample preparation market, and even expand the cryo-TEM market due to improved and expanded characterization capabilities crucial to many industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project involves the development of an innovative blotless sample preparation process that overcomes the aforesaid drawbacks of the commercial state of the art, while providing extensive areas of thin sample film for imaging. Experiments and simulations will build a rigorous understanding of the critical properties of these processes, namely fluid flow induced by the process, and corresponding shear in the sample, the time required for removal of excess sample volume and the resulting yield of sample film area for imaging. This research will provide control of a superior sample thinning process that will be integrated into a disruptive cryo-TEM sample preparation platform. This platform will provide unparalleled insight into materials and processes that will reduce risk and accelerate development timelines for many industries utilizing nanomaterials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy (Cryo-TEM) is an imaging technique that provides morphological information about hydrated structures in their native environment.  Fluid-based samples are vitrified on a TEM grid and imaged with a TEM; vitrification is the rapid freezing of the sample such that the resulting sample ice is amorphous, i.e. free of water crystals.  Ice crystallization can damage sample structures and strongly inhibit electron transmission through the sample; preparing amorphous samples free of crystals enables the imaging of particles in their native hydrated state. Vitrification of the sample is generally enabled by thinning the fluid sample layer to a thickness of ~10-100 nm and subsequently plunging the sample into liquid ethane.  The ubiquitous technique to achieve this sample thickness is blotting; sample is pipetted onto a TEM grid and blotting paper is pressed against the sample to wick away excess sample volume prior to vitrification.  Blotting performed by commercially available semi-automated systems generally enables vitrification, however the process results in large variations in the quality and quantity of vitreous ice on the TEM grid.  Subsequent samples prepared with the same blotting parameters on the same instrument can result in very different ice.  Sample properties can significantly impact blotting process parameters required, and blotting optimization can sometimes take months, or even years, before good samples can be achieved for imaging.  Furthermore, the blotting process requires ~1-5 seconds; reports have shown that samples must be prepared &le; 100-250 msec to ensure that particles in the sample do not interact with the air/water interface; these interactions can result in artifacts that inhibit structural biology cryo-TEM users that utilize the technique to solve three dimensional structures of biomacromolecules.  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project has resulted in a new blotless sample preparation process.  Research and development to date has shown that the process can achieve quality samples for structural biology (protein) samples. There is promise that the speed of sample preparation can be improved with continued development, while already approaching the times required for mitigation of interfacial artifacts.  Continued development will aim to drive further understanding of the newly invented blotless technology and to continue to improve repeatability and speed of preparation; ultimately the goal is to integrate the process into a commercial platform for cryo-TEM sample preparation.  This product could have major positive impacts on multiple fields and applications, include structural biology, pharmaceutical development and nanomaterial R&amp;D.
