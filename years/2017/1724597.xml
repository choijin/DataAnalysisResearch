<AbstractNarration>The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;The Program recommends an award of  for the purchase of the following:  &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;1) Network Server Upgrade/Replacement $6,500   &lt;br/&gt;2) NI VB-8034 (2 ea) $16,000   &lt;br/&gt;3) Fiber Optic Training, Supplies and Tester $12,000   &lt;br/&gt;  Indirect Costs $5,180   &lt;br/&gt;    Total $39,680</AbstractNarration>
