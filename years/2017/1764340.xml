<AbstractNarration>The landfall and slow movement of Hurricane Harvey created one of the most exceptional precipitation events on record in the United States.  This rapid response award will result in the creation of a research-quality rainfall analysis product that can be used by hydrologists, meteorologists, and engineers to study flooding and extreme rainfall events.  Traditional rainfall analysis products are limited by potential errors in the underlying data and differences in how ground-based measurements are mixed with weather radar estimates of rainfall.  The researchers in this project will collect data about the rain gauges and test the various analysis techniques to provide a product that has high spatial and temporal resolution and quantifiable uncertainty estimates.  The impact of the project will be to help improve simulations of urban flooding and to better understand extreme precipitation events.  Local high school students will work on teams to collect data for the project, introducing them to scientific research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will create a foundational set of rainfall data, metadata, and analyses for use in atmospheric, hydrologic and engineering studies of extreme precipitation events.  One of the main project goals is to create a level of consistency and accuracy of the information that goes into the rainfall analyses.  The research team will work with other stakeholders to establish metadata needs and standards and then collect the metadata from the network operators.  Different rainfall analysis techniques and the sensitivity of the analyses to technique and parameter choices will also be assessed.  One result of the project will be to provide analyses and uncertainty quantification to the research community.  Other aspects of the research project will be to place Harvey's rainfall into historical context and to establish a dataset for comparison of rain gauge network performance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focsed on the collection and analysis of rainfall data from Hurricane Harvey, which struck the Texas coast in late August 2017 and proceeded to dump rainfall onto Houston and surrounding areas for several days.  We collected data from the following sources: MesoWest, NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, the City of Austin, CoCoRaHS, the Harris County Flood Control District, divisions 6 and 7 of the Jefferson County Flood Control District, the Weather Underground, Earth Networks, and the general public.  Public data was obtained via a data solicitation broadly distributed by local media; data was entered via a web form.  We call this our "bit bucket survey".  Except for data from the Weather Underground and Earth Networks, all data providers permit us to freely redistribute the data.  This data collection effort yielded rainfall observations during Harvey from nearly 10,000 stations.  We developed a common data format suitable for this eclectic mix of precipitation data and have written software to generate observation, running total, and storm total output.  We contracted with two leading technical consulting firms that specialize in extreme rainfall analysis to ingest the data and other information and provide hourly and storm total rainfall analyses for the event.  They concluded that Harvey's peak rainfall amount was between 60 and 65 inches.  Because it is critical to understanding the extreme precipitation amounts associated with Harvey as well as the likelihood of similar events occurring elsewhere in space and time, we analyzed the motion of Harvey as well as the motion of similarly slow-moving storms using a storm track database for the Atlantic with over 150 years of records.  Intense tropical cyclones that stall near a coastline (like Harvey) have been responsible for most of the storm total records near the Atlantic coast (including the all-time North America record of over 100 inches) and three of the five deadliest Atlantic storm events in recorded history.  Such storms have occurred along the United States coastline just three times in 150 years.  Using the envelope of official forecasted storm tracks issued in bulletins in real time by the National Hurricane Center, we developed alternative hourly and storm total rainfall distributions consistent with those alternative tracks, in order to understand the sensitivity of the rainfall totals to storm motion and to determine what was possible with this event.  If the storm had moved somewhat differently up the coastline, Addicks and Barker Reservoirs could have received 30% more rainfall, resulting in much greater inundation and storm damage.  Closer to the coast, storm totals over 85 inches were possible.  We are archiving the rainfall records and collaborating on hydrological simulations to better understand the possibilities associated with such an event.
