<AbstractNarration>The research supported by this award will investigate recent changes in the mobility patterns of migrants from the global South. Over the past few decades, flows of international migration have not only increased in volume, they also have created ties between a wider range of countries than ever before. The shifts appear to have multiple causes, including: new industrial production centers; changing trade flows; improved incomes in countries outside Western Europe and North America; greater access to long-distance travel; and new technologies of communication. However, these generalizations mask considerable diversity of migrant motivations and outcomes. If policy is to be developed that will serve the needs both of the migrants and of the many countries that may or may not welcome their arrival, much more needs to be known about why migrants choose to leave home and where to go, and what becomes of them. The goal of this research is to fill that need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher will focus on the understudied population of migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa. He will base the research in the Eurasian city of Istanbul, Turkey, an emerging manufacturing zone that has attracted increasing numbers of non-refugee migrants. The researcher will employ qualitative methods to collect data on the subjective attitudes of migration actors, their socioeconomic characteristics, their perceptions of structural factors affecting their prospects in Turkey and other potential destinations, their migration decision histories, and the consequences of these decisions for individuals and their families. Targeting a sample of 400 migrants, he will collect data through participant observation, intensive extended interviews, and the compilation of life histories. These data will be used to evaluate the researcher's hypothesis that sub-Saharan migration is a middle-class phenomenon, which is misrecognized because of the large national income level differences between origin and destination nations. Findings from this research will contribute to developing dynamic approaches to understanding the complexities of migration in the contemporary worlds. This will be of importance for policy makers concerned with migration and is in the United States national interest.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A fieldwork-based qualitative research project on international sub-Saharan African migrants to Turkey, conducted in Istanbul, which has a large resident migrant population from dozens of nations. It involved investigating the relations between the long-term migrants and short term trade visitors, transnational connections of the migrants with home country and the foreign countries of the migrant diaspora, and work and housing conditions of the resident sub-Saharans. Focused on the migrants&rsquo; subjective dispositions, their views of their past, present, and host country, and their perspective and projects for the future, gathered information on their family background, education, and professional and work experiences. The countries best represented among the migrant subjects of this research are Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.&nbsp;This research provides a contribution to transnational migration literature, in anthropology and neighboring disciplines.</p> <p>Significant diversity and stratification exist among the migrants, some brought from the home country, but some generated in migration circumstances. Most sub-Saharan migrants are of civil service or urban trader origin, with relatively high levels of education and high self-regard. They represent the middle class of their countries. They venture on life abroad hoping for higher incomes to save money to serve as capital for some cherished project back home, and also send remittances to close family. Returning home with the means to achieve higher standing in the native community is a commonly shared ideal and infuses daily conversation and spiritual worship. Migrants view the years spent in migration as a period of sacrifice necessary for social advancement. The most successful migrants reactivate their connections with the home country, start business in both countries simultaneously, before making a final return. Some young migrants are attracted to the pleasures of life in prosperous urban societies rather than arduous long-term accumulation, &ldquo;adventurers&rdquo; among the better educated, and they tend to leave Turkey more easily when an opportunity to pass to European Union countries surfaces. Migrants from the Congo and Angola are the most mobile for onward migration toward Europe and the Americas. Unlike West Africans, many migrants from central Africa leave their country without thinking that they will return home one day, but they share the same vision of self-advancement and of a necessary period of hardship to achieve it.</p> <p>The arrival of a large number of students is another aspect of African migration to Turkey. Thousands come on Turkish government scholarships to pursue undergraduate degrees, but there are also students who study with the means provided by their family in Africa. Some African teenagers are brought to Turkey as high school students by religious foundations to study in religious high schools (Imam-Hatip).&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the successful African migrant businessmen are graduates of Turkish universities.</p> <p>The research had a special focus on the religious life of African migrants. More than fifty Pentecostal churches offer services and spiritual guidance in Istanbul, established and mostly attended by African migrants, up from about a dozen during my earlier extended fieldwork in 2010-2011. A few of these are long established and are affiliated with large African independent Pentecostal churches headquartered in Nigeria. The main church location gathers a congregation of 150 to 200 people for Sunday service, but there are also secondary chapels in distant migrant neighborhoods. Others churches are smaller, of more recent origin, or started by solo African pastors. Services are mostly in English, but Congolese or Cameroonian pastors lead a handful of Francophone churches; a church from Ghana held services in Twi.&nbsp;&nbsp;A large Roman Catholic following attends the two main Catholic churches in Beyoglu and Elmadag. Among the Senegalese Muslims, the followers of the Mourid Sufi brotherhood are most noticeable. This is a national institution where the majority Wolof prevail. The Mourid have two congregations (<em>dahira</em>) each with a lodge in different neighborhoods in Istanbul (a building dedicated to weekly meetings for&nbsp;<em>wird&nbsp;</em>ceremonies and prayer, serving also as social center). I visited the Yenikapi lodge, a large five-story building held in its entirety for religious purposes, the uppermost floor serving as kitchen for cooking meals in large gatherings, but as of October 2019 they had moved to another building in the same neighborhood. Periodically, they receive visits of important religious leaders from Senegal who conduct special prayer meetings (attended in the summer of 2019), an indication of the overall improved financial standing of the community. The followers of the Tijani Sufi brotherhood from Senegal, display more ethnic diversity, and also have a lodge in Istanbul. These religious organizations, the Christian and the Muslim, serve to connect people in difficult circumstances as foreigners and often also illegal aliens, and offer them assistance in finding work, housing, and social support. More subtly, they also give the subjects confidence and a way of expressing and acting upon their aspiration of upward social mobility.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/07/2020<br>      Modified by: Mahir&nbsp;Saul</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1733640/1733640_10513845_1599502093342_Women-Good--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1733640/1733640_10513845_1599502093342_Women-Good--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Women's hairdresser"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1733640/1733640_10513845_1599502093342_Women-Good--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Women's hairdresser"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A Nigerian hairdresser shop in Mecidiyek�y Istanbul</div> <div class="imageCredit">Photo: Mahir Saul</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mahir&nbsp;Saul</div> <div class="imageTitle">Women's hairdresser</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1733640/1733640_10513845_1599501856174_Topkapi_Women-labels--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1733640/1733640_10513845_1599501856174_Topkapi_Women-labels--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Topkapi workshop"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1733640/1733640_10513845_1599501856174_Topkapi_Women-labels--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Topkapi workshop"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Migrant women workers preparing clothing labels ina workshop in Topkapi Istanbul; August 2018</div> <div class="imageCredit">Photo: Mahir saul</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mahir&nbsp;Saul</div> <div class="imageTitle">Topkapi workshop</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
