<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project is focused on modeling, designing, analyzing, building and testing a prototype commercial superinsulation called High Performance Multi-Layer Insulation (HPMLI). HPMLI is based on a new technology that significantly reduces heat leak, and allows a multilayer insulation to be used in commercial applications. HPMLI could provide R-235 thermal insulation, compared to current state of the art R-6 foam insulation, offering 40-fold lower heat leak into fridges and freezers and reducing energy use. Heating and cooling account for 74% of U.S. residential energy use, with water heaters and refrigerators consuming 26% and $60B in annual costs. This superinsulation, originally developed for NASA and used for spaceflight, could save 90% of energy used for refrigeration and heating appliances, reducing energy costs and protecting our environment. This opportunity is to develop and manufacture a novel ultra-high-performance insulation for use by appliance manufacturers and consumers for improved energy efficiency, and will enable the small business to grow to 17 employees, with $20M in revenue by 2022. This insulation has many potential applications, including home refrigerators, commercial freezers, water heaters, refrigerated trucks and shipping containers, industrial hot/cold processes, food coolers and buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HPMLI is based on novel discrete spacers and radiation barrier layers, forming a new very high- performance insulation. A novel system is proposed in which the spacers self- support the layers against external atmospheric pressure, allowing use in air. Technical challenges must be solved that carefully balance structural support, heat flux, cost and ease of integration into appliances. This insulation is only possible due to the unique properties of the discrete spacers, which must be designed, developed and tested for this application. The goals are to successfully build and test a prototype demonstrating greater than R-200 thermal performance, and able to be vacuum sealed into vacuum panels or appliance case walls. The system will be thermally modeled for several concepts, a spacer design iterated, prototype demonstration units built for a fridge and/or food cooler, and the heat flux through the insulation measured. HPMLI will be compared to current state of the art foam, and factors required for commercialization considered in this Phase I design.</AbstractNarration>
