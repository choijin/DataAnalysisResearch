<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research and the Chemistry Division contribute funds to this award, which supports theoretical research and education on the conduction properties of materials used in fuel- and solar cells. Limitations in the supply of fossil fuels, environmental considerations, and the relative inefficiency of burning fuel to produce electricity have sparked considerable efforts in developing alternative sources of energy. Combustion is inherently inefficient due to the number of energy transfer steps. Fuel cells avoid the entire combustion process by directly converting chemical energy into electricity, significantly increasing efficiency. Solar cells directly convert light energy into electrical energy and, while not as efficient as fuel cells, they make use of a renewable resource.  Both processes emit significantly fewer pollutants than combustion and reduce dependence on petroleum products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A solid oxide fuel cell is comprised of two electron-conductive surfaces (electrodes) sandwiching a conductor (electrolyte) of ions. Electricity production is substantially determined by how fast the ions move through the electrolyte. In solar cells, electricity production is limited by missing oxygen atoms in the material, which comprise mobile atom-lattice defects.  Overall, understanding ion or ion-defect motion through a material is important for optimizing the performance of these devices. This project will clarify how changes in structure near an ion or vacancy influence conduction pathways. Simulations of specific materials as well as the simulation methods developed in this project will be useful in furthering our knowledge and understanding of conduction, and help engineer more efficient conductors for use in fuel- and solar cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will include training undergraduate women at Mount Holyoke College in computational chemistry, programming, and the associated mathematics. These undergraduates will attend the annual MERCURY conference organized for undergraduates doing research in computational chemistry by the MERCURY consortium, of which the PI is one of the founding members. An extension to the PI's Passport to Chemistry Adventure outreach program targeting high-school students will be developed and sent to the eleven western Massachusetts libraries participating in the program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research and the Chemistry Division contribute funds to this award, which supports computational research and education on oxygen-vacancy and proton conduction in perovskites and double perovskites. Charged-defect conduction is essential to the functioning of many devices. For example, protons and oxygen vacancies are sometimes the main conductors in fuel-cell membranes; oxygen-vacancy transport is essential for oxygen reduction at the cathode of a fuel cell. Furthermore, band gaps in solar cells are sometimes tuned by oxygen-vacancy concentration. The project will further computational investigations to understand how charged-defect conduction paths in perovskite and double-perovskite materials change with lattice restructuring near the defect, as well as with charge-defect correlation during the conduction process. The project will extend the uses of the PI's defect conduction path finding methods and centrality measures based on time. Centrality measures will be used to not only predict traps, key nexuses, and pathways, but to also predict correlated motion including proton/proton correlation and proton/oxygen-vacancy correlation in acceptor-doped barium zirconate. Complementary techniques such as accelerated dynamics techniques on an empirical potential will be used to determine how well graph-theory-based methods work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will include training undergraduate women at Mount Holyoke College in computational chemistry, programming, and the associated mathematics. These undergraduates will attend the annual MERCURY conference organized for undergraduates doing research in computational chemistry by the MERCURY consortium, of which the PI is one of the founding members.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many technologically important applications including fuel cells rely on movement of a defect through a solid medium.  Our project has both used and advanced graph theory tools to find pathways of defects moving through solid systems.  One system example is proton (defect) conduction in perovskite oxides.  Fig. 1 shows the basic structure of a perovskite as well as the possible sites at which a proton can bind in the system.  Fig. 2 shows how we map this physical system into a mathematical graph.  The vertices in the graph correspond to the proton binding sites in Fig. 1.   The vertices are connected by edges when there is a simple one step path between the binding sites or vertices.  For the proton to travel through a large crystal of a perovskite, there need to be high probability paths that can move a proton through a conduction graph like that shown in Fig. 2.  We tackle these types of problems by first building a data set of energies for the defect to be bound in all the possible binding sites in the system as well as energy barriers to move from one binding site to another in a single step or through the edges of the graph.  Once the data set is made, we can search through the graph via a variety of graph theory tools.  Some tools simply search the graph for all possible long range pathways and order them by probability.  Other tools such as kinetic Monte Carlo create a time-based trajectory of individual defect moves.  Our favorite tool shades defect sites based on the average time it takes a defect starting a site to return to that site.  The more quickly the defect returns the more central the site and the darker the shade of gray in Fig. 3.   High centrality could be a result of the trapping as seen in the circled high (dark) centrality areas of Fig. 3 which are adjacent to low (light) centrality areas.  A site can also be very central by being part of a fast moving highway as seen in Fig. 3 b and e where many high (dark) centrality sites are next to each other.  In fact, the highest probability pathways that span the system do travel through these highway regions.  Kinetic Monte Carlo time based trajectories spend time the most time moving through trapped regions with occasional escapes to the fast conduction highways. Through both the data sets and the range of methods to explore them, we have not only found proton conduction pathways in doped perovskites but also the impact of the dopant [1], oxygen vacancies[2,4], and other protons [5] on both the solid lattice and the overall proton conduction.  Data sets and molecular dynamics tools have also allows us to see that oxygen vacancies in double perovskites can have significant structural impacts [3] in double perovskites as seen in Fig. 4.  Overall, graph theory measures are very helpful in probing defect movements in perovskites and double perovskites.  Understanding how defects affect long range conduction is important to improving devices that rely on conduction.  In addition, this area has been very helpful in training over 20 undergraduate students and a high school student during the period of this grant. 1. Maria A.
