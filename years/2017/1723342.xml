<AbstractNarration>The Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) Program is a broad-based, community-initiated research program on the physics of the Earth's magnetosphere and the coupling of the magnetosphere to the atmosphere and to the solar wind.  The work of GEM is accomplished in a series of campaigns and focus groups that solve specific problems leading to the construction of a global Geospace General Circulation Model (GGCM) with predictive capability. This project will contribute essential results to this goal pertaining to understanding the role of plasma waves in energizing and transporting particles and plasma in the near-Earth space environment.   In addition, the project supports the research of an early-career tenure-track faculty member and contributes to the research training of another early-career female scientist and a graduate student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This investigation utilizes both spacecraft observations from THEMIS and Van Allen Probes and the HOTRAY wave ray-tracing computer code to study the modulation of plasma wave intensity by thermal plasma density variations in the inner magnetosphere. The specific science questions to be addressed include: (1) How do thermal plasma density variations cause modulation in the intensity of chorus, hiss and magnetosonic waves? and (2) How do the waves excited by these density variations affect radiation belt and ring current? The investigation is relevant to the GEM Focus Groups on "Storm-Time Inner Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Convection", and "Scientific Magnetic Mapping &amp; Techniques".</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Scientific Outcome:  The overarching science goal of this project is to address the two fundamental scientific questions: (1) How do thermal plasma density variations cause modulation in the intensity of chorus, hiss and magnetosonic waves? (2) How do the waves excited by these density variations affect radiation belt and ring current?   The key project outcome of this project directly addressing the above questions is summarized below.    We investigated the excitation and propagation of equatorial magnetosonic waves observed by the Van Allen Probes using instability analysis and we found that magnetosonic waves can be trapped within local density structures in the Earth?s plasmasphere.   Using THEMIS satellite data, we identified that low energy ions of ~100 eV with field-aligned distribution show density modulation that is correlated with chorus intensity modulation. Linear instability calculations also support that the enhancements of the low energy plasma density contribute most effectively to chorus linear growth rates.   We evaluated the quantitative role of plasmaspheric hiss in the Earth?s inner magnetosphere using quasi-linear particle transport code based on the realistic density and wave models, and demonstrate that plasmaspheric hiss causes significant decay of 100 keV &ndash; 1 MeV electrons with the largest decay rate at around 340 keV, forming anisotropic pitch angle distributions at lower energies and more flattened distributions at higher energies.   Utilizing simultaneous twin Van Allen Probes observations, we demonstrated that the coherent modulation of whistler mode waves was associated with the coherent ULF waves measured over a large scale, which modulate the plasmaspheric density and result in the modulation of hiss waves via local amplification.   We also identified another interesting event, where the variations of hiss wave intensity, electron flux, and ULF wave intensity exhibit remarkable correlations, while plasma density is not correlated with any of these parameters. Our study provides direct evidence for the first time that the injected anisotropic electron population, which is modulated by ULF waves, modulates the hiss intensity in the outer plasmasphere.   A review paper was published in AGU monogram to describe how whistler mode waves and thermal plasma density control the global distribution of the diffuse aurora and the dynamical evolution of radiation belt electrons.    Intellectual Merit:  The scientific outcome of this project significantly improved a unified physical understanding of the modulation of plasma wave intensity (including chorus, plasmaspheric hiss, and magnetosonic waves) by fine-scale variation of cold plasma density, and the quantification of how the modulated wave power distribution of important waves controls the dynamics of the inner magnetosphere. The results of this project are directly relevant to a few NSF GEM focus groups, including "Storm-Time Inner Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Convection" (2013-2017), "Quantitative Assessment of Radiation Belt Modeling" (2014-2018), and "Inner Magnetosphere Cross-Energy/Population Interactions" (2014-2018). The scientific outcome of this project also directly addresses primary science questions of the Van Allen Probes mission.     Broader Impacts:  This proposed project provides training for a young female scientist and faculty member (Prof. Wen Li) as well as a few postdocs (Dr. Run Shi and Dr. Qianli Ma). Prof. Li also incorporated the findings of this project into an advanced graduate class for space physics majors at Boston University.
