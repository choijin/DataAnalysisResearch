<AbstractNarration>The Russia-Japan-USA-Europe Symposium on Fundamental &amp; Applied Problems of Terahertz Devices &amp; Technologies will take place on October 2-6, 2017 in Troy, NY.  It will address research areas in the field of interaction of THz radiation with micro- and nanostructures and advanced solid-state THz emitters and sensors. This conference will foster advances in the leading research on various types of Terahertz technology, by gathering a diverse group of experts, researchers and students. The Symposium will foster interactions between leading researchers in USA, Japan, and Russia working in the area of Terahertz Devices and Technologies. Topics cover THz emission and detection, THz devices and electronic, optical components, THz physics and applications. There will be invited talks and contributed presentations. Special attention will be paid in attracting students and post-doctoral associates, and young faculty with special emphasis to inviting women and members of the under representative minorities. The highlights of the symposium will be accessible worldwide through the symposium proceedings.</AbstractNarration>
