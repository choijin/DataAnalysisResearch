<AbstractNarration>This research project will advance the way in which neighborhoods are defined in urban social science research. The definition of a socioeconomic neighborhood is an important and central issue across many research domains. Neighborhoods serve as the organizational units to frame empirical research that has examined a wide array of issues, including the ability of social networks to produce collective efficacy in a spatial context, the relationships between concentrated poverty traps and violence, spatial sorting and segregation, and the role of neighborhoods as seeds for wider urban economic development. Despite this importance, consensus has not yet emerged regarding how to operationalize neighborhoods in practice. Moreover, the role of spatial structure largely has been ignored in existing approaches to neighborhood definition. This project will produce new methods for neighborhood identification and analysis that draw on recent developments in geographic information science and spatial statistics. These new methods will enhance the urban social science toolkit enabling researchers to carry out empirical work that can be replicated, thereby moving urban policy research onto stronger analytic foundations. The new methods and analytics will be implemented in a publicly available open-source longitudinal neighborhood analysis package. The project will provide training to a post-doctoral research associate and will include a partnership between academia and industry, with applications to commercial market segmentation and analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will advance understanding of the spatial dimensions of neighborhoods. The project will focus on three central aims. First, a number of underexamined issues associated with defining neighborhoods in spatial and temporal contexts will be investigated. These issues are related to the lack of a spatially explicit approach to neighborhood definition in the current literature and the impacts of ignoring the dynamics of spatial clustering and heterogeneity. The second aim is to develop new methods for neighborhood delineation and analysis that address these issues. These new methods will include local measures to identify hot-spots of neighborhood change within individual urban areas as well as global measures that summarize the overall amount of spatial change in a given metropolitan area. The third area of activity will be the implementation of the new methods for neighborhood delineation in an open-source framework to provide social scientists with a platform of flexible, scalable, and advanced spatio-temporal clustering methods that support replication and enhance the existing infrastructure of social science research on urban dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="first-paragraph">This project developed new research infrastructure for studying neighborhoods, their geographic extent, their social composition, and the spatial and temporal scales at which these elements change. Neighborhoods are critical contextual environments for human development, and research across the social sciences has shown the impact that neighborhood conditions can have on a diverse range of outcomes including physical and mental well-being, health and safety, educational attainment, employment, and social mobility. Despite their centrality in helping to determine individual outcomes, neighborhoods are difficult subjects of study because the meaning of "neighborhood" is variable in different contexts. Recognizing this challenge, Grant #1733705 is designed to reduce the barriers to neighborhood research by providing new software and statistical techniques for analyzing neighborhoods and understanding how they are likely to change over time.</p> <p>The project supported the development of several software projects toward this end, including <span style="font-family: Consolas, serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">geosnap</span></span>, <span style="font-family: Consolas, serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">tobler</span></span>, and <span style="font-family: Consolas, serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">segregation</span></span>, all of which were created at UCR's Center for Geospatial Sciences. The <span style="font-family: Consolas, serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">tobler</span></span> package is a new addition to the PySAL software family that provides tools for performing areal allocation, dasymetric mapping, and change of support. The <span style="font-family: Consolas, serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">tobler</span></span> package (Figure 1) provides ways for researchers to take data collected at one spatial resolution (like Counties in the USA) and use spatial statistics to transfer those data to another spatial representation (such as zip codes). Apart from creating better maps and data visualizations, these techniques can also be used to facilitate better neighborhood research by ensuring that scholars can represent places using the same geographic units in different time frames.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The <span style="font-family: Consolas, serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">segregation</span></span> package is another addition to the PySAL family that implements over 40 different segregation indices, from simple to state of the art. In addition to simple measurement, the <span style="font-family: Consolas, serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">segregation</span></span> package also includes several novel and noteworthy features, including tests for statistical significance (i.e.&nbsp;the presence or absence of segregation from a statistical perspective) using computational inference, and statistical methods for comparative analysis (i.e., is Reno more segregated than Las Vegas?). Finally, the package also includes methods for understanding how transportation networks influence the geographic scale of segregation. For example, in&nbsp; Figure 2, the steeper slopes for cities like Baltimore and Chicago show that these regions are more segregated at smaller scales (i.e.&nbsp;they have more individually segregated neighborhoods) than regions like Riverside and San Francisco. Using the PySAL <span style="font-family: Consolas, serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">segregation</span></span> package developed with support from this grant, creating graphs like the one below is trivial, and it is similarly simple for researchers to examine how segregation levels fluctuate over space and time in any location on the globe.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, the <span style="font-family: Consolas, serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">geosnap</span></span> package is a brand-new addition to the spatial analysis landscape that provides tools specific to the analysis of neighborhood dynamics and change over time. Anticipating neighborhood change is a critical practice in urban planning that helps cities and region beat the curve of housing affordability and issues like gentrification and displacement, but predicting neighborhood change is extraordinarily difficult.
