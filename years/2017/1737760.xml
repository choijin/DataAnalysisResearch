<AbstractNarration>The acquisition of an Ion Chromatograph (IC) will upgrade the water quality analysis facilities at the all-women's Barnard College.  The funding will be used to purchase the instrument, to train users, and to enable users to present their results at national conferences.  The Ion Chromatograph will be used by mainly undergraduate students at Barnard College to measure water quality parameters.  The anion data is critical for understanding the fundamental chemical, physical and biological controls that affect water quality, and how that water quality changes over time.  For example Chloride and Bromide can be used to trace natural and anthropogenic recharge whereas nitrate and nitrite are essential nutrients but can also impact water quality.  The students are part of collaborative teams and the data they collect will be used in their undergraduate thesis research and peer-reviewed publications.  These collaborations include both national and international projects looking at water quality.  Examples include engineering green infrastructure in New York City to improve water quality of runoff and examining groundwater in Vietnam to better understand groundwater recharge in relation to Arsenic contamination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few measurements are more fundamental to environmental science than the concentration of ions in solution. Over the last 9 years, the Mailloux lab has conducted these measurements using a Dionex ICS-2000 Ion Chromatograph (IC) housed at Barnard College, an undergraduate women?s college in New York City. This workhorse instrument has sadly died.  It had been used to measure anions and low molecular organic acids in water collected from groundwater, surface water, and laboratory experiments.  Since the instrument was bought in September 2008 we have run over 24,000 samples, blanks, and standards.  The diverse data from these measurements has been used in 9 peer-reviewed papers with the PI, with 3 of the papers having an undergraduate co-author and 8 of the papers having a graduate student co-author.  In addition, the IC has been used in at least 19 senior theses and is regularly used in 2 classes. The goal of this award is to replace the broken instrument in order to maintain our research momentum, run a free short course to teach the students how to use the new instrument, and to take students to a national meeting.  The new instrument we are requesting is a Dionex Integrion with an AS-AP autosampler equipped to run anions and low weight organic molecules such as acetate and lactate.  The new instrument will be used on NSF and non-NSF projects to analyze samples from both the field and laboratory experiments on undergraduate and graduate student led projects.  To support current NSF funding using this instrument, we have current demand in excess of 2500 samples per year, and expect to continue to run thousands of samples per year over the life of the instrument.  The data obtained from these measurements will support peer reviewed research and publications, and the education of many young women.  The new instrument will enable us to continue to perform world-class, student-driven research on water quality, hydrology, and biogeochemistry at Barnard College.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A Dionex Integrion Ion Chromatograph with an AS-AP autosampler was purchased and installed in the lab of the PI in the Environmental Science Department at the all-women?s Barnard College during Fall 2017.  An Ion Chromatograph is used determine anion concentrations.  The anion data is critical for understanding the fundamental chemical, physical and biological controls that affect water quality, and how that water quality changes over time.  For example, Chloride and Bromide can be used to trace natural and anthropogenic recharge whereas nitrate and nitrite are essential nutrients but can also impact water quality.  A training guide was developed in order to enable utilization by a wide variety of students.  After installation 10 students have used the instrument in their research running over 2000 samples.  This includes 6 graduate students and 4 undergraduates.  Two of the graduate students using the instruments have NSF GFRP graduate fellowships.  One undergraduate used the instrument in their thesis work and for data in a conference abstract.  The projects include analysis of groundwater chemistry in arsenic impacted aquifers in Vietnam.  Using chloride and bromide values it is possible to understand recharge mechanisms and their impact on arsenic.  The Ion Chromatograph has also been used to look at anion concentrations in agricultural soils.  The Ion Chromatograph is being used on local, national, and international projects looking at water quality.  In summary, the Ion Chromatograph is already being widely used and has had an immediate positive impact on the Environmental Science Department at Barnard College.
