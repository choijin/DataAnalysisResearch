<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide K-12 schools with a learning environment, curriculum, and teacher training to expand and improve computer science education and to encourage a diverse student population to pursue further studies in computing. Computer science has become a core 21st century skill critical to careers both within and beyond the tech industry, but K-12 education has yet to meet increasing demand from industry and from parents to teach computing, and school districts still struggle to adequately train teachers and to engage students in computer science. This project provides a simple and easy-to-use solution that integrates music with computer science to drive student engagement. Moreover, this approach contributes to a diverse computer science pipeline by engaging female and minority students through an emphasis on creativity and real-world applications. Today there is a market for schools to train teachers, and to buy materials and tools to teach computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project leverages an online learning environment, curriculum, and teacher training designed for any introductory computing course from late elementary through to the college level, along with a body of research assessing the effects of this learning intervention on student content knowledge and engagement in computing. The web-based learning platform includes a code editor, a multi-track audio player, an audio loop library, an interactive textbook, and mechanisms for students to share and collaborate, along with curricular, training, and grading tools for teachers. Mixed-methods research has shown significant student gains in both content knowledge and engagement across gender and demographic groups when learning with this approach, with particularly large gains in engagement for female students. Students ascribe their increased engagement in computing to the creative, expressive, and real-world approach of the intervention through its combination of popular music and music production techniques with computational thinking and programming in industry-relevant coding languages.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     EarSketch is a web-based learning environment and curriculum designed to engage diverse high school student populations in computer science by teaching CS in the context of music production and remixing. Multiple research studies have shown that EarSketch can engage diverse student populations in computer science and increase their intentions to persist in further study.  A three-member team consisting of a faculty research investigator, a student entrepeneurial lead, and an industry mentor participated in the National Science Foundation's I-Corps program to determine if there was a feasible business model to sustain, scale, and commercialize the learning platform, thus increasing its impact on K-12 students. The team participated in the summer 2017 I-Corps cohort in Chicago, learning about the lean startup model, developing multiple potential business models, and assessing their viability through conducting over 150 customer discovery interviews.  Through this process, the team concluded that commercialization of EarSketch is not a viable option at this time. Key factors influencing this conclusion are the heterogeneous structure of the K-12 education ecosystem and particularly the decentralization of decision-making about CS education platform adoption; the prevalence of free and open-source CS education platforms and the reluctance of schools and school systems to pay for software platforms in this space; and an insufficient priority on the part of many stakeholders on broadening participation in computing.  Since the end of the formal I-Corps cohort, the team has continued to explore models for sustaining and scaling the impact of EarSketch on K-12 students that do not involve commercialization of the platform. Within the existing infrastructure of a major research university, the team has forged new partnerships to bring more financial support to these efforts and more visibility to the platform.
