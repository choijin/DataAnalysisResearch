<AbstractNarration>The proposal requests travel funds enabling students to attend 3rd Career Workshop for Women and Minorities in Computer Architecture (CWWMCA-2017) to be held in Boston, MA, USA, in conjunction with the 50th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO). &lt;br/&gt;The Workshop for Women and Minorities in Computer Architecture provides a forum for sharing advanced academic and industrial research work focused on computer architecture and career development advices for women and minorities in academia, industrial and government labs. The workshop will also cover a wide range of topics with leading experts in the filed attending MICRO as keynote speakers, invited talks and panel focused on career development for women and other minorities in the field of computer architecture.</AbstractNarration>
