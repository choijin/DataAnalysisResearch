<AbstractNarration>Cells adapt to changes in their environment through chemical communication networks (signaling pathways) that cause changes in gene expression.  Enzymes that chemically modify other proteins are key components of signaling pathways.  Lysine acetylation is a protein modification conserved from bacteria to humans.  Studies have revealed its widespread occurrence on cellular proteins but its roles in signaling-modulated gene expression are poorly understood.  The enzymes that regulate acetylation, lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) and lysine deacetylases (KDACs), are considered to promote and impair gene expression, respectively.  However, recent studies have shown that KDACs are concentrated at active genes and can promote their expression, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown.  Genes are expressed in bursts of transcriptional activity interspersed with periods of inactivity.  Signaling pathways change gene expression by modulating the frequency and/or the size of active bursts.  Understanding how KDACs affect bursting patterns of genes will allow insight into the mechanisms underlying their ability to promote gene expression.  This is important because chemicals that inhibit KDACs are present in the environment as natural products of unicellular organisms, pollutants, and drugs.  Increased knowledge of the function of KDACs in gene expression is essential to assessing the impact of their inhibitors on living organisms. The work will be performed by several undergraduates and a postdoctoral fellow.  The incorporation of undergraduates into the research team will provide mentoring experience to the postdoctoral fellow and serve under-represented groups through several University of Arizona programs that provide research opportunities to undergraduates from these groups.  Research team members will be trained in critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills that will enable them to pursue careers that contribute to strengthening and diversifying the national scientific workforce.  The research findings will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at local and national conferences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to determine how KDACs regulate transcriptional bursting patterns of genes that are activated by glucocorticoids, a type of steroid hormone.  The first aim will use single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization and live cell imaging of transcription to assay the effects of KDAC inhibitors on bursting kinetics.  The second aim is focused on determining where KDACs contribute to transcription in the regions in and around genes using global run-on sequencing.  The study results will contribute to building improved models of signaling-induced transcriptional regulation that incorporate transcriptional dynamics and the positive contributions of KDACs to the transcriptional cycle.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  The central hypothesis of the study was that lysine deacetylases, specifically KDAC1, acts within regulatory elements and/or gene bodies to facilitate efficient transcriptional initiation and/or elongation at enhancers and associated glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-activated genes.  The overall objective was to identify the stage(s) within the transcriptional cycle at which lysine deacetylases (KDACs) are required for GR-activated transcription.  The first aim employed imaging methods to understand how KDACs affect transcriptional dynamics at GR-activated genes.  Initial focus on one gene revealed that KDAC activity is required at stages before and after the onset of transcription, indicating that KDACs facilitate the process by which the gene is transcriptionally-activated as well as promoting efficient elongation of the nascent RNA once transcription has initiated.  In addition, complex gene editing was used to generate a cell-based model in which live-cell imaging of transcription of this gene can be performed.  This will allow more direct measurement of transcriptional kinetics in real time and the generation of mathematical models that will reveal the various transcriptional control points for the gene.  The success of investigating this gene led to study of additional GR-activated genes.  This work revealed that KDACs likely promote transcription by distinct mechanisms depending on the gene context.   The second aim focused on using next-generation sequencing methods to determine global patterns of nascent transcription and how they are impacted by glucocorticoids and KDAC inhibition.  The complex method for doing this was optimized and the sequencing will soon be performed.  In addition to what was originally proposed, the identity of the KDAC1-containing complexes that work at GR target genes was investigated.  It was determined that a particular RCOR complex was required for efficient activation of some but not all of the GR target genes sensitive to KDAC activity.  This finding allows further investigation of the RCOR complex to reveal how it promotes transcription including its mechanism of recruitment to particular regulatory sequences of the affected genes and the proteins it interacts with at the gene and targets through deacetylation. This finding also reveals that other KDAC1-containing complexes are likely to be involved in promoting transcription in other gene-contexts.  Currently, the experimental results of the study are being assembled into a manuscript for eventual submission to a peer-reviewed journal.  In addition, the results were used as preliminary data in a recent successful NIH grant application.  Thus, the study findings will be built upon to address the long term goals of the PI’s laboratory: to define epigenetic mechanisms by KDACs regulate signaling-induced transcription.         Broader Impacts:  The funding supported a postdoctoral fellow, who is a member of an under-represented group in STEM (Latina).  By working on the project she acquired new laboratory and mentoring skills that allowed her to gain a position in a company that develops medical devices and instrumentation.  Both she and the PI, Catharine L Smith, worked together to mentor two female undergraduate researchers who made important contributions to the project.  Their work, along with that of the postdoctoral fellow, will be included in a manuscript currently in preparation for publication.  Project funding supported one of the two undergraduate researchers for a summer of intensive research under the auspices of the highly competitive Undergraduate Biological Research Program at the University of Arizona.  These female students plan on pursuing professional degrees, one in medicine and the other in pharmacy.           Last Modified: 11/18/2020       Submitted by: Catharine L Smith]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
