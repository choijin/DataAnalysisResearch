<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for students to participate in the Sixteenth Summer School on Exotic Beam (EBSS) Physics at the Argonne National Laboratory, July 23 - 29, 2017. The school is designed for graduate students, senior undergraduate students who are actively involved in research and postdocs (within 2 years of their degree). The school will consist of morning lectures and hands-on activities in the afternoons. Students will also have an opportunity to present their research. The aim of the summer school is to educate the next generation of scientists that will drive the research at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) when it comes online and other existing rare isotope facilities. In years to come, substantial progress in low-energy nuclear physics will have a broad impact on society, ranging from our understanding of the origin of the elements to the enhancement of national security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous sessions of these summer schools have had broad participation of under-represented minorities, with slightly more than 30% of the participants of the Fifteenth EBSS being female. The organizers of the Sixteenth EBSS will continue the use of accepted best practices to increase diversity and have an inclusive summer school.</AbstractNarration>

The school is funded by these institutions, as well as the US National Science Foundation and Department of Energy. In EBSS2017, 42 participants (graduate students and junior postdoctoral researchers) attended the school and received two types of training:    1. During the morning, they received lectures given by experts in the fields of exotic beam physics. These lectures focused on experimental and theoretical aspects of nuclear physics as well as interdisciplinary subjects such as nuclear astrophysics and data management.    2. During the afternoon, students participated in a variety of hands-on activities, which dealt with specific techniques and tools used in the field of exotic beam physics and various applications.    As a unique feature of this summer school series, the combination of lectures and hands-on activities allows students to apply introduced materials immediately in practice.    Besides, the participants in the school also presented their own research to their peers and the lecturers in the poster session and students seminar. The interaction between the students and the experts is an important component of the program.
