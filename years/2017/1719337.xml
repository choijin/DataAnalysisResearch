<AbstractNarration>The fifth generation of wireless communication promises to provide Gigabits per second data transfer rates and communication delays of less than a millisecond. Significant challenges must be overcome in designing a system architecture such that data intensive and/or latency sensitive applications can obtain the information that they need for peak performance. Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has the potential to enable wireless efficiencies that are critical to support the strict guarantees desired by new applications such as virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) or the control of swarms of unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs). The goal of this project is to design, develop and demonstrate SPLICE, a Secure Predictive Low-Latency Information-Centric Edge wireless network that will be able to provide information guarantees to these emerging applications. The project will also contribute to workforce development by means of curriculum development in this domain and recruitment of students from under-represented groups in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work is anchored in an ICN implementation called Named Data Networking (NDN), which will be able to effectively tie together application demands and wireless links. The research is organized into three inter-dependent thrusts: (i) Applications for an Information-Centric Wireless Edge: This thrust will define the performance criteria and determine the architecture of the focus application of the project: VR/AR. It will exploit multiple dimensions of commonality between instances of such applications through fast content caching and retrieval, and multicast services. (ii) ICN for the Wireless Edge: explore how information exchange via caching and markets would be accomplished, and how to design secure and privacy-preserving data transfer methods. A key novelty is the use of proactive secure caching that learns the value of applications and ensures they are cached ahead of demand. (iii) Wireless Communication for Information-Centric Networks: employ multicasting capabilities of wireless communication while simultaneously achieving low-delay guarantees and low-complexity feedback mechanisms, via a mix of coding, caching and scheduling techniques.</AbstractNarration>
