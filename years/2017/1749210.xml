<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Experimental Centric Pedagogy (ECP) project, with the collaboration of the Mobile Hands-On STEM (MOHS) project supports a joint workshop that will explore broader impacts and intellectual merit of ECP within the context of the successful features of a Minority Serving collaboration.  This workshop pursues expansion of an pedagogy that is adaptive to a wide variety of fields and that engages and stimulates interest by a large population of under-served minority students enrolled in the 13 engineering programs. The guiding hypothesis is that engineering education works best in a learning environment in which experimentation plays a central role. The MOHS project pursues complementary activities including mobile hands-on student learning environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop that is hosted by the HBCU ECP and MOHS groups will work with engineering practitioners and expand the scope of the learning pedagogy. Also, they seek to reach out to Hispanics Serving Institutions to understand the opportunities to expand beyond HBCUs.  This includes exercises classifying educational activities using Blooms Taxonomy and SWOT analysis.  The workshops seeks to outline several previously identified areas of need for using ECP including;  systems engineering and integration, design of plans teaching troubleshooting and debugging; and can it be used beyond the original HBCUs and become inclusive like working with Hispanic Serving Institutions; does the pedagogy support authentic engineering experiences. Participants will be invited from a wide range of diverse backgrounds to establish how best to bring ECP to other communities. This project will add to our understanding on how an experimental centric pedagogy impacts underrepresented minorities in engineering education and may influence our future workforce of engineers in the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Intellectual Merit  For more than five years, a consortium of 13 HBCUs Universities has been collectively implementing experimental centric pedagogy (ECP) in their ECE circuits and electronics courses. These universities received funding for a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant entitled, "Experimental Centric Based Engineering Curriculum for HBCUs" to create a sustainable "HBCU Engineering Network" that is focused on the development, implementation, and expansion of an Experimental Centric-based instructional pedagogy in engineering curricula used in these HBCUs. As a step toward growing and sustaining a successful collaboration of programs developing and implementing experimental centric pedagogy, a deeper understanding of the nature of the collaboration between the ECP institutions was studied to address such questions as why it has been successful, how can it be improved, how it can be expanded and adopted by others and how it can be sustained.     Broader Impact  Because of the project?s success, participants expressed continued interest in collaborating on research and in shared dissemination of information; this includes working together on gaining support for research, conference work, and sharing advanced opportunities for students.  To date, this process has yielded a fully chartered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and a successfully funded REU-RET Mega-Site: Research Experiences for Undergraduates and Teachers in Smart and Connected Cities. The collaboration between the now 16 institutions within the ECP community will have a positive long-term impact on the development of new cooperative efforts in technical research, engineering education research and curriculum development for minority-serving institutions and is expected to have a significant impact on the retention and graduation of engineering students.     Key Findings  The workshop took place over one and a half days in Alexandria, Virginia. Details about the schedule of activities during each day of the workshop are presented in the Table 1 workshop agenda as shown below. From the discussions held among the workshop participants, four collaborative area topics emerged.  Formation of a new ECE Diversity Organization Research Experiences for Undergraduates and Research Experiences for Teachers Mega Site Major Collaborative Research Center Simulation and Programming Extension to ECP   Topic #1 Formation of a new ECE Diversity Organization  The goal going forward for the formation of a new ECE Diversity Organization is exploring how to realize the most effective working infrastructure for the evolving Minority- Serving Institutions (MSI) consortium. The key finding for this collaborative topic is that the group should further develop a formal structure in the form of a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.   Topic #2: Research Experiences for Undergraduates and Research Experiences for Teachers Mega Site  The goals going forward for the research experiences for undergraduates (REU) and research experiences for teachers (RET) mega site were stated as: 1) Agree on combined or separate REU/RET; 2) Agree on an associated research project/proposal (Smart and Connected Cities); 3) Determine which institutions will be host sites; 4) Determine if the proposal will include AP material; 5) Establish ongoing meeting times; and 6) Get feedback from NSF on submission date.  The Key findings from this topic area are that the first component of this project will be the implementation of a REU program that will provide a rich research experience and professional development opportunities to a large population of under-served minority students enrolled in the 13+ engineering programs and their partner community colleges that have been unable to participate in traditional summer resident research programs.   Topic #3: Major Collaborative Research Center  The goals going forward for the major collaborative research center were stated as: 1)Seek out a funding opportunity to pursue within the next 6 months, 2) Continue with bi-weekly meetings to refine ideas. 3) Identify existing similar research groups internal and external to the ECP group.     The Key findings from the major collaborative research center collaborative topic are that the overarching research question the Center will address is "How can smart and connected technology be used to design systems that assist with the task of learning in a personalized and efficient way?" The research methodology that will be undertaken within the proposed Center to address this question will be to design, implement, and evaluate pervasive (i.e., smart and connected) computing-based educational enhancement systems.  Topic #4: Simulation and Programming Extension to ECP (ECP+)  The goals going forward for the simulation and programming extension were stated as: 1) Get and incorporate feedback from all other faculty members of the HBCU ECP consortium. 2) Update the workshop proposal to incorporate the inputs that were provided during the Underserved Minority Institutions (UMI) workshop discussions and the feedbacks from the ECP colleagues. 3) Submit the workshop proposal to NSF.  The Key findings from this topic area are that the proposed enhancement to the pedagogy - (ECP+), will provide additional pathways to acquire deeper technical skills.
