<AbstractNarration>This award will support two special sessions related to NSF funding: "BMES-NSF Special Session on CAREER and Unsolicited Awards" and ?BMES-NSF Special Session on Graduate Research Fellowships Program.?  Both of these sessions are outside of the regular program of the Annual Meeting of the Biomedical Engineering Society being held in Phoenix, AZ, October 11-14, 2017.  The funding will be used to promote, convene and record the session and offset travel costs and registration fees for NSF awardees (3 research grant and 4 GRFP) and reviewers (5) who will serve as presenters, panelists, and potential mentors/collaborators for novice and emerging investigators.  The CAREER/Unsolicited session builds on the success of similar sessions held at BMES annual meetings since 2013.  The GRFP session was added after feedback from last year?s participants indicating a specific interest in this student-focused program.  The 2017 BMES meeting will feature 19 Program Tracks with the theme "Engineering Personalized Medicine and Therapies." Approximately 800 oral presentations, 1600 poster presentations and over 4,000 participants are anticipated. The BMES Annual Meeting serves as a primary vehicle for scientific sharing and dissemination of the latest advances in biomedical engineering, as well as a facilitator of important cross-fertilizations between the life sciences and engineering technologies, which foster a multi-disciplinary approach in the practice of Biomedical Engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research grant focused session will be a 3 hour session, featuring presentations showcasing NSF funded research and researchers (2 CAREER awardees and 1 non-CAREER awardee), a Networking Reception, a Tutorial on Essential Elements to Develop a Successful NSF BME Grant, and an Interactive Grant Writing and Submission Panel Discussion, will be held on October 13, 2017.  The GRFP-focused session will be 2 hours in length and will be held on October 14, 2017.  It will involve 4 past GRFP recipients, from diverse graduate and undergraduate institutions, as well as past GRFP panelists.  Both sessions will include time for Q&amp;A with the audience.  Both recorded sessions will be posted on the BMES website for on demand viewing.</AbstractNarration>
