<AbstractNarration>1724764 &lt;br/&gt;Williard &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will address irrigation aquifer depletion and challenges to sustainability by enhancing dialogue on solutions. It will be held as a special track in conjunction with the annual Universities Council on Water Resources/National Institutes for Water Resources (UCOWR/NIWR) conference, in Fort Collins, CO, June 2017. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that food production must be increased by 70 % from 2009 levels in order to feed an additional 2.3 billion people by 2050. Expected outcomes of this special track include the collaboration and cooperation among scientists of multiple disciplinary backgrounds in order to develop practical solutions to mitigate this complex water resources issue. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned special track, addressing irrigation aquifer depletion and challenges to sustainability, focuses upon aquifer depletion in relation to agricultural irrigation. Supporting sessions will provide opportunities to discuss related issues in groundwater management and security. A partial list of topics addressing this nexus of water resources, agricultural practices, and food security includes: groundwater assessment and management; socio-economics of irrigation aquifer management; improving irrigation efficiency; crop management; Arizona and Nevada programs and projects to address future Colorado River shortages; groundwater management in a changing environment; drought monitoring and planning for scarcity; climate disturbance impacts and shifts in hydrology over the Western United States; the U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Aquifer Assessment.  These topics are of interest to those involved in the NSF Program, INFEWS, Innovations at the Nexus of the Food-Energy-Water Systems, where the intersection of water and agriculture are concerned. A primary goal of this proposed conference track and associated sessions is to bring together a broad range of hydrogeologists, engineers, economists, agronomists, and other scientists and professionals studying groundwater depletion and adaptation in critical agricultural areas in the U.S., such as the Ogallala Aquifer, California's Central Valley, the Mississippi Delta region, and Arizona's alluvial basins. Through this workshop collaborative research efforts may be significantly advanced through the transfer of information, and workable solutions may be generated in the process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The Universities Council on Water Resources and the National Institutes on Water Resources utilized an NSF grant to support their Annual UCOWR/NIWR Conference 2017. A special session, Addressing irrigation aquifer depletion and challenges to sustainability, was supported in part by this project. Grant funds allowed conference planners to invite students and early career professionals to participate in the conference. Our two goals for the project were:   Goal #1. Promote collaboration and exchange of information among professionals studying aquifer/groundwater depletion to develop practical approaches to use water resources sustainably.    A broad range of hydrogeologists, engineers, economists, agronomists, and others came together to present this special session and to attend the annual UCOWR/NIWR conference. These individuals had numerous opportunities for discussion throughout the event, which fostered collaboration in developing research questions, outreach efforts, technology development, and other ways of addressing aquifer depletion and sustainability issues across multiple job sectors.  Additionally, the special track session consisting of 30 presentations encouraged discussion of the applicability of lessons learned through U.S. aquifer/groundwater depletion work to similar problems around the world. A direct outcome of the special conference track was the December 2017, themed issue of UCOWR?s Journal of Contemporary Water Research and Education (JCWRE), entitled Addressing Irrigation Aquifer Depletion.  Each of the select papers published in this issue were derived from presentations made during the special conference track.    Goal #2. Involve young scientists and professionals in the interdisciplinary discussion of groundwater and other water issues, fostering future leadership in water resources management and research.   This grant provided funding support for 13 graduate students and 6 early career professionals to attend the 2017 UCOWR/NIWR conference.  Special events were offered during the conference to facilitate the interaction of the early career/student attendees with one another and with established professionals. During these exchanges, careers can be shaped and mentorship relationships can be established.  These connections have the potential to shape career directions and energize the water resources community as a whole, as future water resources leaders are engaged in meaningful, interdisciplinary conversations.

Students felt they were more engaged with others attending the conference and they felt it was very easy to make meaningful connections at the conference.  We plan to continue some of these activities at future conferences including the student speed networking session, science communication workshops, and breakfast roundtable discussions.
