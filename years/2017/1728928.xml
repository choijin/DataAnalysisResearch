<AbstractNarration>The National Center for State Courts recognizes that the lack of racial and gender diversity on the bench continues to be a problem in many states. The current project is meant to answer the following research questions: What are citizens? representation expectations of state court judges? What are the consequences of the underrepresentation of women and racial minorities in state courts? How does the lack of diversity on state benches affect public attitudes toward judicial decisions and the justice system more broadly? What is the relative impact of descriptive and substantive representation on legitimacy and how does this differ based on different individual expectations? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research tests hypotheses derived from legitimacy theory, social identity theory, and expectancy theory. The research plan involves an experimental design utilizing two experiments embedded in a survey of a sample of US adults. Much of the underpinning of effective citizenship and good governance relies on the legitimacy accorded to institutions of the state. This is particularly so for courts, which often have counter-majoritarian elements inherent in their institutional characteristics. This research tests on the sources of variation in legitimacy among state courts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award was used to conduct an online survey with several embedded experiments on a nationally representative cross-section of the U.S. population, with African Americans oversampled.  The goal was to examine how variance in the number of female and African American judges affects attitudes toward the judicial system.  Initial findings indicate that the race of a judge has a much more significant impact on attitudes toward the court than the sex of a judge.  When presented with information about aggregate numbers of African American judges in a court, African Americans are most supportive of the courts when the number of African American judges in their state is at the national average compared to when the number is below or above the national average.  At the same time, white respondents are least supportive of the courts when the number of African American judges in their state is at the national average.  When it comes to female judges, however, there are no significant differences in evaluations between male and female respondents as the aggregate number of female judges in a state varies.  When presented with information about an individual case, when a singular judge makes a decision that goes against the preferences of an individual, the individual?s support for the courts is damaged least when the judge belongs to the same demographic group as the individual.  In other words, individuals are most supportive of the courts when they see a judge who looks like them deciding a case.  This is true for white males, white females, and black males.  The only exception is black female respondents, whose favorability of the courts is actually most negative when a black female judge decides against the black female respondent?s policy preferences.   Moreover, this project finds that expectations of the level of racial diversity among judges moderates the impact that a judge?s race has on support for the courts among African American respondents.  African Americans who believe there should be high numbers of African American judges in their state?s courts are less supportive of the courts when a black judge decides a case against the individual?s preferences than African Americans who believe there should be lower numbers of African American judges in their state?s courts.  This highlights the idea that expectations of judges matter, both in terms of the demographic diversity among judges as well as the specific decisions that judges make in cases.  This project also explicitly examined what individuals expect from judges and finds wide variation.  When asked about the percentage of judges that individuals believe should be African American, African American females and males both indicate higher percentages (46% and 45%, respectively) than white females and males (37% and 32%, respectively).  When asked about the percentage of judges that individuals believe should be female, black and white females both indicate slightly higher percentages (both about 44%) than black and white males (41% and 40%, respectively).  Interestingly, while all four demographic groups examined believe that African Americans should be overrepresented among judges compared to the percentage of African Americans in the broader population (about 12%), none of the four groups believe that females should be represented at a level equal to or higher than the percentage of females in the broader population (about 51%).
