<AbstractNarration>NSF actively promotes the inclusion of students in technical conferences and in the advancement of scientific research. To this affect the PI requests that the CCSS program, within the ECCS Division of the Engineering Directorate at the NSF, sponsor a select number of students to participate in the 7th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology, to be held in Pittsburgh, PA on July 25-28, 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student Travel Fellowship is requested for the 2017 IEEE Nanotechnology Conference for domestic student (undergraduate and graduate) participants and presenters. The conference, which has been held sixteen times previously, brings together researchers and educators focused on developing nanotechnologies and applying these technologies to space, electronic, magnetic, sensor, and photonic devices and systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested support will be used to provide partial travel stipends for student participants at the conference, specifically student presenters in an organized session.  NSF funding will be used to support travel, of domestic graduate and undergraduate students in the form of hotel accommodation. Fifteen (15) student participants will receive funding to support their participation in the 7th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>

There were 420 paper submissions from 40 countries.&nbsp; Over 360 professionals have attended this conference to present over 313 presentations and posters. Thirty student travel awards of $500/person, titled &ldquo;NSF Student Travel Fellowship&rdquo;, became open for application after paper acceptance notifications were sent. U.S. permanent residency was required to be eligible to apply.&nbsp;We received 39 applications in total. All applicants were first/presenting authors of the paper. The travel awards committee, headed by co-PI Dr. Qing Gu, evaluated the applications and selected 30 awardees based on the following criteria of gender, level of study (undergraduate or graduate), presentation type (oral or poster, location of school, student resume. The $500 was used to cover the awardees&rsquo; lodging at the conference venue (with 2 awardees sharing one room). An NSF Student Fellowship Dinner was also hosted, during which travel awards committee Chair Dr. Walter Hu addressed the awardees and thanked NSF for the fellowship support. NSF was particularly acknowledged at multiple times such as opening remark and closing ceremony.</p> <p>The broader impact of the NSF project includes the involvement of domestic students in a technical conference run by IEEE, which is very beneficial for their professional career growth. It also promoted interactions between our domestic students with a diversity of international students and professors at the conference.&nbsp; This program also provided good training opportunities for the students for professional presentation, conference volunteering, scientific research exchange, etc.&nbsp;Moreover, 5 workshops and tutorials with 35 renowned speakers include &ldquo;IEEE Vision on Nanorobotics&rdquo;, &ldquo;Focused Electron and Ion Beam Techniques: Basics and Applications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Spintronic and Nanomagnetic Computing Devices&rdquo;, &ldquo;Scanning Probe Microscopy, Beyond Topography&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Nanoscale Heat Transport: from Nanophononics to Energy Conversion and Devices&rdquo; were offered to the students for them to broaden their knowledge scope. Overall, the NSF travel fellowship program has added values to the student attendants of the conference and generated considerable broader impacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/09/2018<br>      Modified by: Walter&nbsp;Hu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1742986/1742986_10494114_1515540280446_conferenceintro--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1742986/1742986_10494114_1515540280446_conferenceintro--rgov-800width.jpg" title="conference overview"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1742986/1742986_10494114_1515540280446_conferenceintro--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="conference overview"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This is the brief view of the conference location and sponsors.
