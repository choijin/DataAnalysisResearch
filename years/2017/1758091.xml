<AbstractNarration>Phenotyping plants under real world conditions is highly challenging. The Frommer lab (Stanford) developed a suite of genetically encoded biosensors that report subcellular levels of ions or metabolites (e.g. ions, sugars) or that report the activity of particular transporters with high temporal resolution. Typically, plants expressing these sensors are analyzed using fluorescence microscopy. This project will explore whether ion levels can be quantified (here the signaling intermediate calcium as a proof of concept) in specific regions of plant leaves using a remote imaging system. The Kramer lab at MSU developed a growth chamber  that can mimic and replay field conditions and simultaneously phenotype photosynthetic parameters using a fluorescence imaging system. This collaboration brings together these two innovative platforms: the dynamic environmental imaging system (DEPI), and genetically encoded ultrasensitive fluorescent biosensor technology. The project aims to develop a novel system that can monitor genetically encoded sensors in intact plants with unprecedented depth and the parallel option for high throughput phenotyping of photosynthesis. The project will lay the groundwork for establishing systems and tools as community resources with the potential to transform photosynthesis research programs around the world. This high-risk project will lay the basis for phenotyping genetic variants in Arabidopsis as well as crops and expand the usefulness of genetically encoded biosensors to large scale screening. In addition, this project will train a postdoctoral scientist with experience in physical chemistry in phenotyping. The project will also train high school students and undergraduate students, and where possible minority students will be engaged in this endeavor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such an imaging system would present a completely novel tool for phenotyping molecular events in intact plants and thus present a new tool for screening genetic variants and to discover new biology at the whole plant level. The project will demonstrate the potential of this technology by monitoring novel ultrasensitive calcium sensors to test long-standing hypotheses regarding the role of calcium in signaling processes and the response patterns in leaves in fluctuating environmental conditions and specific signaling processes. One of the challenges is the sensitivity of the combined plant-imaging system. The Frommer lab developed novel ultrasensitive calcium sensors that will be used here and that may enable us to observe calcium dynamics over the whole growth cycle in populations of 100s of plants simultaneously. This approach, if successful, could be expanded to other fluorescent biosensors and implemented for crop plant screening. At the same time, such a system may uncover new biology in the areas of plant cell signaling and chloroplast ion dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The DEPI-RIB (Dynamic Environment Photosynthesis Imager- with Remote Imaging of Biosensors) was developed to allow imaging in situ fluorescence from a heterologously expressed nanobiosensor, while tracking photosynthetic performance (via chlorophyll fluorescence) under dyanmic growth conditions.  A Matryoshka biosensor (E1a59-MCaMP6s) containing a calcium sensitive green fluorescent protein domain and an insensitive orange fluorescent protein domain (Ast et al., 2017, Nature Comm.) was engineered in Arabidopsis to be expressed in the chloroplast stroma.  In a preliminary experiment, we were able to observe a transient increase in stromal calcium during a 30-minute dark interval in growth illumination by imaging E1a59-MCaMP6s fluorescence of a transformed Arabidopsis plant in the DEPI-RIB.  This result is consistent with previous observations by Sai and Johnson (2002, The Plant Cell) using stroma targeted aeqorin in tobacco.   We also demonstrate that the instrument can measure stromal calcium and photosynthetic performance under dynamically changing light intensity in a single experiment. However, more careful follow-up experiments are needed to determine if/how the changes observed in stromal calcium are connected to photosynthetic performance.  While it was optimized for detection of the Matryoshka calcium sensor, DEPI-RIB may be used to track other biomolecules using similar probes.  For example, fluorescence changes from an FRET (Fluorescence resonance energy transfer) nanosensor for ATP expressed in the cytoplasm or the chloroplast could be detected during a low to high light transition.  In plants, calcium has multiple roles (both proposed and established) from the structural and biochemical level to physiological and developmental level.  The capacity to probe calcium in any one cellular compartment, continuously and in situ opens the possibility of testing and refining models where calcium may be acting as a signal or a regulatory molecule in response to external environmental stimuli.  In this case, measurements in DEPI-RIB of plants with the sensor localized to the stroma will allow us to more directly test models where calcium is proposed to regulate photosynthesis.  We also used the platform to confirm that ATP levels in the chloroplast stroma and cytoplasm are affected by light in different ways. Interestingly, an abrupt increase in light that activates photosynthesis result in a decrease in ATP within the stroma, consistent with a new limitation for light-driven Calvin-Benson Cycle activity at the level of ATP synthesis. The utility of the approach can be increased by expanding the range of molecules that can be probed.  For example, in situ measurements of phosphate and ATP would be useful for determining how the light reactions are modulated in response to limitations by downstream metabolism, and under what conditions these mechanism are engaged.
