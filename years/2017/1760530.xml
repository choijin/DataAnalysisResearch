<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL AND NON TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Funds in the amount of $5000 are requested for support of US based participants in the 2018 ACS Symposium on "Polymers with Complex Architecture: From Synthesis to Self-Assembly " to be held at the 2018 National ACS meeting in New Orleans, LA, on March 18-22, 2018. The funds will be used to cover the registration fees for participating postdocs, assistant and associate professors. The symposium aims to highlight recent advances in controlled polymerization and functionalization techniques enabling the synthesis of chemically heterogeneous copolymers (and block copolymers) with complex architectures, as well as their self-assembly characteristics. The symposium offers opportunity for the cross-fertilization between academic faculty, R&amp;D industrial researchers, postdocs and graduate students regarding progress in both fundamental and technological aspects of polymer synthesis, self-assembly and applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of the project titled "Travel Support for the 2018 ACS Symposium 'Polymers with Complex Architecture: From Synthesis to Self-Assembly,' New Orleans, LA (March 18-22), 2018" (NSF Award No. 1760530, PI = Chang Ryu) is to highlight recent advances on understanding of structure-property-relationships of novel polymeric materials by inviting experts on synthesis and self-assembly of copolymers with complex architectures at the ACS symposium.   This symposium also targeted the broad impact opportunities to promote (1) the cross-fertilization between academia and industry R&amp;D researchers and (2) the participant diversity particularly supporting female and underrepresented minority faculty members working on the development of novel polymeric materials with new structure and function.   In addition, we provided professional networking opportunities for graduate student, postdoctoral researcher and early-career faculty to meet and interact with "senior" academia and industry members.   Students training and education opportunities were also promoted through the network for the possible collaboration on research and outreach activities.  Key outcomes  (A) Intellectual merits: The symposium provided multi-day sessions (Table 1) aiming to provide rare opportunities for the polymer synthesis and characterization researchers to discuss their recent research break-through for the better understanding of structure-property-relationships of novel polymeric materials, including both experimental and theoretical progresses.    Recent advances in controlled polymerization and functionalization techniques have enabled synthesis of chemically heterogeneous copolymers with complex chain architectures, such as star, comb and bottlebrush, as well as block copolymers. In this symposium, a wide range of converging polymer chemistry-to-physics topics had been discussed for sharing new insights and understanding on the synthesis, self-assembly and theory of random/graft/block/bottle brush copolymers and functionalized polymers with complex architectures and their composite with nanomaterials.   Many talks focused on tailoring physical (mechanical, conducting and/or thermal) properties and their structural correlations in the nanometer scale.       (B) Broad impacts: The symposium was held for 3.5 days as a part of ACS Polymer Materials Science and Engineering (PMSE) symposium.  Among 23 PMSE symposia in the ACS 2018 March (New Orleans, LA) meeting, there were only 4 symposia that have lasted for more than 3.5 days: (1) Innovative Chemistry &amp; Materials for Electrochemical Energy Storage (4 days), (2) Polymer Colloids: Synthesis, Analysis, Modeling &amp; Applications (4 days), (3) Cyclic &amp; Topologically Complex Polymers (3.5 days), and (4) Polymers with Complex Architecture: From Synthesis to Self-Assembly (3.5 days).  These symposia with an extended schedule at the ACS meeting presents the active and wide interests of subjects in the polymer materials researchers.  Furthermore, the successful fund raising of our symposium provided unique opportunities for the professional networks and diversity promotions for our strategical invitation of keynote speakers, two of which are female chaired-professors (Prof. Karen Wooley and Prof. Karen Winey).  The symposium organizers sponsored the invited speaker luncheons and a formal dinner during the ACS meeting to promote the mentoring and peer interaction opportunities during the duration of the symposium.
