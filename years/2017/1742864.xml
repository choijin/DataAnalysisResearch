<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The detailed structure of defects in soft materials like polymers has received relatively little attention compared to the vast literature on defects in hard crystalline materials (metals, ceramics and semiconductors), where high-resolution electron microscopy and other techniques have quantitatively imaged the new arrangements of the atoms caused by the various kinds of defects, thus enabling a very detailed understanding of the key role of different kinds of defects on controlling important material properties such as mechanical strength and electrical conductivity. This research will explore the use of new, highly advanced electron microscopic and tomographic techniques in an attempt to provide valuable data for comparison to theoretical simulations of the morphology of microdomain interface morphology in important classes of polymeric materials called A-B diblock copolymers.  For these materials the interplay of minimization of interfacial area between the A and B domains versus the stretching of the polymer molecules within the respective domains controls the shape of the interface.  Additionally, the PI will extend and verify advanced microscopy techniques to explore the 3D nature of grain boundary and line defects that can frequently occur in technologically important diblock polymeric materials and can limit their performance.  This research will also contribute to the training of postdoctoral scholars and graduate and undergraduate students in advanced electron microscopic and tomographic techniques.  Results from this project will also be incorporated into relevant graduate-level courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to image the 3D shape of the microdomain interface in network phases and around grain boundary and dislocation defects in block copolymers (BCPs). In noncrystalline BCPs, the order is not in the atoms but in the interfaces separating the component blocks (the so called Intermaterial Dividing Surface, IMDS). Previous limitations to 3D reconstructions will be overcome via incoherent imaging using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF STEM).  Computational work will define the limitations of the reconstruction techniques by simulations using ideal morphological models combined with the known technique limitations (missing data wedge, strong oscillations in the contrast transfer function for bright-field imaging, defocus across tilted specimens).  3D imaging of the morphology is crucial but very challenging -- the inherent lack of contrast and the susceptibility of organic materials to electron beam damage are formidable obstacles.  For some morphologies, reliable reconstructions may not be realizable due to experimental limitations.  The few literature studies featuring 3D reconstructions of BCPs display some seemingly unrealistic features of the microdomain interface. Should the approaches turn out to be unable to overcome such experimental limitations, the focus will shift to setting limits on "interpretable resolution" and cautioning that the reconstructions in the published literature to date may have been "overinterpreted".  No matter what the outcome, these results will be important for the polymer materials community to view and to understand. For ordered materials, the presence of defects can contribute positively or negatively to material performance. With such fundamental understanding, it should be possible to eventually learn to manipulate the defect types and their numbers in BCP systems and accordingly influence transport properties applicable to fuel cells, battery membranes, etc., where the light weight, flexibility, and low cost of polymers makes them highly attractive.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit    This project has provided new insight into how defects alter the detailed shapes and arrangements of tubular domains formed by the self assembly of polymer molecules comprised of two different types of chemical segments (so called block copolymers).  We found new domain shapes and spatial organizations that appeared due to the mistakes (that is, the defects) in the otherwise orderly packing of the domains.  We classified these into various groupings with common attributes.  Many of the defects cause the tubular network to have new types of loops as well as network bridges and network breaks.  We also discovered a type of surface defect that acted as a mirror.  The network has many different kinds of symmetries but does not possess mirror symmetry, so the occurance of the defect actually added symmetry! The mirror is a special defect structure (called a twin) that causes the network of block polymer domains on one side of the surface to be precisely the mirror image of the network of domains on the other side. There are two types of tubular networks in our structure (called the double gyroid structure ? see images), one network twists in a right-handed manner while the second twists to the left, so this mirror or twin surface defect changes the right handed network into a left handed one and vice versa for the second network as the two networks cross the plane of the mirror boundary.  Other surface defects were found to have a finite thickness comprised of disordered arrangements of the tubular domains.  These are a type of aperiodic grain boundary (see attached image). An important function of such double gyroid networks is their ability to transport mass and/or charge and of course, their 3D geometry as disturbed by the defects is key for allowing or not allowing mass or charge to move continuously.  Our work elucidates which types of defects can occur and how they can change the network structure which would adversely affect the transport performance of the material.      Broad Impact    The information extracted from our 3D images of defect structures will help scientists and engineers learn how to eliminate bad defects that diminish performance and promote the appearance of ?good? defects (such as the twin boundary that adds mirror symmetry) that can actually benefit material performance.  The pairing of an undergraduate and a post doctoral researcher helped learning about working in teams with two levels of mentoring for the younger researcher. Students learned to employ sophisticated imaging tools and associated software for detailed examination of highly complex 3D structures occurring at the nano-scale.  We also developed new experimental and software tools and made these available to everyone by posting on the university archive. Because the defects are relatively sparse, we developed our imaging tool to be high resolution with data obtained over relatively large volumes of material.

This is somewhat akin to the influence defects have on transport of mass and charge and illustrates the need to control/eliminate the defects for improved technological applications such as filtration membranes and battery electrodes, where optimization of mass and charge transport is key for increased energy efficiency and advancing sustainable technologies for society.
