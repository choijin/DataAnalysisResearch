<AbstractNarration>This project supports student travel to the American Geophysical Union's Chapman Conference entitled, 'Stratospheric aerosol during the past 20 years: Processes sustaining the aerosol, interactions with climate and chemistry, and importance for historical analogues.'  This conference provides a venue for the world's leading observational and modeling experts in stratospheric aerosol and precursor gases to present and discuss results focused on major science questions related to the character and processes controlling stratospheric aerosol during the quiescent to mildly volcanic period of 1996 to the present. The broader impacts of the conference will derive from the exchange of ideas that will help focus the research community on the processes controlling stratospheric aerosol, and provide an opportunity for young scientists to meet, network, and exchange ideas with leaders in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual challenges addressed by the meeting participants include: (1) Comparing and resolving measurements of stratospheric aerosol and gas phase sulfur from different platforms; (2) Deriving aerosol surface area, cross section, and asymmetry parameter from remote satellite measurements of optical properties; (3) Establishing the accuracy of the geophysical quantities derived from remote optical measurements; and (4) Extrapolating measurements of aerosol and gas phase climatologies to regions and time periods not measured. Topics at this meeting will contribute significantly to establish confidence in the aerosol climatologies used and in providing a basis against which models with intrinsic aerosol can be tested.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Stratospheric aerosol is a persistent yet highly variable component of the stratosphere and impacts radiation and stratospheric ozone, both of which affect climate. With the beginning of the modern measurement record in the second half of the 20th century, the study of stratospheric aerosol has been substantially influenced by large volcanic eruptions: Agung in 1963, Fuego in 1974, El Chichon in 1982, and Pinatubo in 1991. This paradigm of decadal major volcanic eruptions has changed since 1996 when stratospheric aerosol has been at, or near, the lowest levels observed by modern instrumentation. This period also overlaps with a golden age for stratospheric aerosol and gas phase sulfur measurements from satellites, aircraft, balloons, and the ground, and thus represents an optimum period for testing climate models that use prescribed stratospheric aerosol and gas phase sulfur, and those that use only surface emissions and predict stratospheric aerosol and gas phase sulfur. Historically such a period of quiescent to mild volcanism is perhaps more common than the active volcanism of the 1960s through the 1990s.  The 2018 AGU Chapman Conference on "Stratospheric aerosol in the post-Pinatubo era: Processes, Interactions, and Importance." provided a venue for  leading observational and modeling experts in stratospheric aerosol and precursor gases to present and discuss results focused on major science questions related to the character and processes controlling stratospheric aerosol during this recent quiescent to mildly volcanic period, and the impact of such a period on stratospheric chemistry and climate.  Five students from US institutions and two early career scientists, one from the US and one from Canada, were supported by this award to attend this 2018 AGU Chapman Conference, including air fare, lodging, and per diem. These seven individuals, which included one woman, contributed six oral presentations and two posters to the scientific program.  The seven individuals involved were given the opportunity to interact with and learn from some of the leading experts on stratospheric aerosol. Together they had the opportunity to experience the stimulation which arises from attending a small scientific meeting, from participating in detailed discussions of specific scientific issues, and from contributing to that discussion and knowledge of stratospheric aerosol through their own work.
