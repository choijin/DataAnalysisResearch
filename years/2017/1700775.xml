<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be in the modernization of the electrical power grid and solving the challenges of integrating large scale renewable sources to the grid while improving the reliability, resilience, affordability, and flexibility of the electric power grid. This project's hardware/software controller turns the battery energy storage system from a passive component in the grid to an active and smart component which is able to benefit both grid operators and customers automatically. This technology will benefit utilities and independent system operators through providing enhanced grid services and reducing investment cost of system expansion. The commercial potential of this technology is due to its capabilities for improving power quality, increasing power system reliability, decreasing green gas emission, reducing peak demand, and maximizing renewable energy utilization. This technology will also benefit commercial, residential, and industrial customers by potentially reducing their electricity bill, increasing power reliability, and providing them with revenue in the energy market. The end product is a software/hardware controller panel which will be integrated with a battery energy storage system consisting of battery modules, inverter and measurement devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project involves a real time hardware/software controller for smart operation of Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) in the grid. The developed technology incorporates a novel control algorithm/structure in the form of an integrated hardware/software device, to control the power flow of BESS. The control hardware is configured for effective interaction of the controller with inverter, battery management system, and measurement units. The control software is structured to manage the communication, safe operation and monitoring of the system. This product, by employing control, machine learning, discrete signal processing, and optimization methods, enables BESS as a buffer to dynamically compensate for the renewable intermittency and load uncertainty in the power grid. The main advantage of the controller is to minimize the size of allocated battery for applications such as voltage regulation, renewable compensation, and load compensation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ While, at the start of the project, we did not know our market, upon embarking in NSF program, the NSF I-CORPS customer discovery process and the teaching team feedback gave us insights into our market. The customer segment for our market included directors of energy services of EV fleets.   This was a new experience for us as it changed the entire direction of our commercialization effort by the time we finish all the interviews.  NSF called it "Pivot" - and we have now learnt how to "Pivot" through our own experiences via the interviews and by analyzing information and data obtained.  As one of the key outcomes of the program, we were able to identify the customer segment that fits with our technology and accordingly developed all the parts of our business model canvas. In addition, it helped us to develop our strategy to enter the market. Currently, from the list of our potential customers, one agreed to actually have an installation at their site.  Also, an Inverter company agreed to be a partner with us and this company has already provided their inverter to us which we would like to use for the installation (company name - EPC power).  A battery company had agreed to be our partner and provide the battery system for no cost which in the future we would like to use for our installation (company name - Microvast).  Based on this new equipment that is expected to be installed, we are planning a pilot project that we believe would open new discussions with a new set of stakeholders.  We have also filed an international patent as below:  R. Gadh, H.Nazaripouya,  P. Chu, "Battery Energy Storage Control System", International Patent Application Serial No: PCT/US2017/033030, May 17, 2017.  No company has been formed yet. We are currently evaluating different possible options including licensing to a larger company with market muscle or first validated in a startup and then move to the appropriate channel.   So far no funding has been raised. However, we plan to apply for couple of state and federal grants including STTR first phase.
