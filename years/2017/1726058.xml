<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Programs. Professor Lyle Isaacs from University of Maryland College Park and colleagues Lawrence Sita, Chunsheng Wang, Dongxia Liu and Efrain Rodriguez are acquiring a 500 MHz solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  An NMR spectometer measures the magnetic properties of atoms when molecules are exposed to various frequencies of light.  These signals identify the atoms present in the compound.  This spectrometer probes the properties of solid materials, including batteries, polymers, catalysts and biomolecules. The NMR is used by chemists, engineers and their students working on interdisciplinary research in materials, nanoscience, catalysis and energy science.  The instrument is the first solid-state NMR at the University of Maryland. It is a resource available to other institutions in the region and a valuable instrument to train students in NMR techniques preparing them for their later careers in academia or industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NMR spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. The infrastructure acquisition impacts the preparation of cucurbit[n]urils, studies of intermetalloid clusters, and the self-assembly of ionophores and hydrogels. The instrumentation is also used to study catalytic metal-mediated small molecule fixation and to carry out carbon-hydrogen bond activation with oxygen as direct oxidant. The spectrometer is useful for preparing new catalysts from zeolite materials, for probing structures in superconducting solids and for studying electrochemical energy storage.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Maryland received an Award from the major research instrumentation program of the National Science Foundation (1726058; "MRI: Acquisition of an Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrometer with Solid-State Capabilities for Shared Use at the University of Maryland).  This award funded the purchase of a 500 MHz solid state NMR spectrometer which was installed in June 2019 in the shared instrumentation facility in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.  Over the course of the grant, the PIs and the Facility Manager introduced solid state NMR spectroscopy into four courses at the University of Maryland: CHEM460 (Organic Spectroscopic Methods), CHBE486/ENCH648E (Heterogeneous Catalysis for Energy Applications), CHEM601 (Advanced Inorganic Chemistry) and an advanced hands on course (Chem 471, Practical Techniques in Pulse NMR spectroscopy).  The presence and availability of the 500 MHz solid state NMR spectrometer at UMD has been advertised to the Washington DC area chemistry community in the form of two external invited seminars (George Mason Univ. and Howard University), via visits to UMD by researchers from local Universities to interact with the facility managers, and by electronic means to researchers at 11 area Universities, 7 government facilities, the Washington NMR group, and 6 area companies.  The department has also broadened participation of underrepresented groups in the form of the local NOBCChE chapter, the local Alliance for Diversity in Science and Engineering, and the UMD Center for Minorities in Science and Engineering.  Prof. Gutierrez spearheaded outreach to low income URM students at Prince George’s community college via research internships and collaborations.  To date, at least 9 projects spanning from supramolecular chemistry, to polymers, to materials science, to energy science, to regulatory science have been pursued using the capabilities of the 500 MHz solid state NMR spectrometer.  To date, 5 publications have resulted from this work along with 3 conference presentations.       Last Modified: 09/12/2020       Submitted by: Lyle D Isaacs]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
