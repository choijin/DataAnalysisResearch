<AbstractNarration>This project aims to develop novel algorithms required to deploy Unmanned Vehicle (UV) networks with resource constraints in Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environments. The methods developed in this project will be useful in a wide variety of applications of national importance such as disaster management, border surveillance, monitoring of civilian infrastructure including oil pipelines, power grids, harbors, inland waterways, and intelligent transportation systems where GPS signals can be easily jammed either intentionally or unintentionally. The proposed research spans several areas including control, estimation, sensing, robotics and optimization. This project provides a rich opportunity for involving undergraduate and graduate students in the development of vehicle platforms, sensor networks, and in the implementation of the control and optimization algorithms. This project engages minority students in small research projects to motivate their interest in engineering and science. Enabling autonomous unmanned vehicles with a capability of navigating in GPS denied environments can aid in effectively monitoring large infrastructure systems, protect their structural integrity and functional reliability as well as provide ecological, societal and economic benefits, including better preservation of natural resources, reduced property damage and reduced loss of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses the following fundamental problem that arises while deploying unmanned vehicles in GPS-denied environments: Given a set of vehicles and targets to visit, find a path for each vehicle such that each target is visited at least once by some vehicle, the error in the position estimate of each vehicle at any time instant is within a given bound and an objective which depends on the travel and sensing costs is minimized. The specific technical objectives of this project are to: determine the minimal set of requirements that would render the system of vehicles observable over a time period, develop novel approximation and exact algorithms using cutting plane, rounding and Lagrangian dual methods for the optimization problems, and experimentally corroborate the performance of the proposed algorithms using large scale and hardware-in-the-loop simulations, and field demonstrations. It is anticipated that this project will significantly advance the state of art in the area of observability analysis for a team of cooperatively localizing vehicles, and in the area of tractable, approximation and exact algorithms for vehicle placement and path planning problems with resource and localization constraints. Novel cutting plane, rounding, and Lagrangian dual methods are expected to provide new insights into efficient ways of decomposing the difficulties in the vehicle placement and path planning problems, and will lead to good feasible solutions with approximation bounds. The proposed large scale simulation and experimental results will provide a new understanding of the influence of the different parameters (number of landmarks/vehicles/targets, bounds on acceptable position errors, onboard sensor type, different operational environments, and the speed of each vehicle) on the performance of the vehicle localization/path planning system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This was a collabrative project between Unversity of Cincinnati and Texas A and M. . The optimization work and the simulations were performed by Texas A &amp; M while the localization work and experiments were conducted by University of Cincinnati. Vehicle routing and path planning is an important area of research. Most existing path planning algorithms for unmanned aerial or ground vehicles for applications such as package delivery, autonomous urban driving, etc. rely on Global Positioning System (GPS) data for localization. However, intentional or unintentional disruption of GPS signals can render these algorithms ineffective. In this work, we address this issue by leveraging information from suitably placed stationary features in the environment called Landmarks (LMs) to aid localization in such GPS disrupted scenarios. Given a vehicle and set of targets/waypoints (WPs), our objective was to formulate a joint optimization problem such that the total cost of routing and LM placement can be minimized.  Initially, we developed an architecture to work for a single vehicle routing problem; later, we extended our work to multi-vehicle route optimization as well by assigning the WPs to the vehicles while simultaneously solving the routing and LM selection problem. The key outcomes of our work are as follows.      Theoretical findings for single vehicle routing:      We addressed a combinatorial optimization problem to solve for the joint cost of LM placement and vehicle routing problem (TSP) simultaneously. We observed that the combined algorithm requires a large amount of time to find an optimal solution and is a function of the number of WPs. Therefore, we solved for the LM placement and vehicle route separately using heuristics and showed that the results are comparable to the optimal solution. Moreover, the heuristics require significantly less time to arrive at the suboptimal solution. So, the users can consider this trade-off in choosing which algorithm they might want to use based on their priority.           Hardware implementation for single vehicle routing:        After successfully developing a theoretical base, we tested our algorithm in simulations and then on hardware for real time navigation using the planned route and LM locations. We further improved upon our algorithm by adding Field of View (FOV) constraints on the sensor and including vehicle dimensions into consideration. Although these aren’t required for aerial vehicles with RFID based omnidirectional sensors, these constraints helped in improving the overall robustness of our algorithm by generalizing it for aerial or ground vehicles equipped with sensors that may not have circular FOV. Our results show that the vehicle could successfully travel through the desired set of WPs using the placed LMs.          Theoretical findings for multiple vehicle routing:      We also developed algorithms for multi-vehicle routing in the presence of localization constraints. In this case, a third problem was required to be solved simultaneously, i.e., partitioning problem to allocate different sets of WPs to each vehicle to optimize total travel cost. Our results show that solving for all the problems simultaneously is computationally very expensive and the cost is exponential in time with respect to the number of WPs. Therefore, we solve the individual problems separately (partitioning followed by routing and LM placement). Although this approach yields suboptimal results, we found high quality feasible solutions much faster.            Simulation results for multiple vehicle routing:      Simulation results were obtained using the map produced by the developed algorithms and estimated states for localization and navigation. We used Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for estimation using LMs for localization. The results indicate that the vehicles were able to successfully start from a depot (first WP), route through the desired sets of WPs and return to the depot while traveling through each WP exactly once. The LM placement locations were such that the vehicles were able to sense their range from at least 2 LMs at all times throughout their trajectories. The simulations and experimental validated the theoretical developments of our work.                 Last Modified: 05/08/2020       Submitted by: Rajnikant Sharma]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
