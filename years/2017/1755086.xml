<AbstractNarration>Shrimp are a key food source worldwide for fish, birds, marine mammals, and humans, and consequently, many shrimp species face strong predation and fishing pressures. Potentially aggravating these pressures is their sensitivity to changes in environmental conditions, such as those occurring seasonally or over longer time periods. The tolerance of shrimp to declining ocean pH (ocean acidification) and increasing temperature (ocean warming) will factor into population health, abundance and distributions in the future. However, limited research on crustaceans precludes understanding of the potential impacts that changing environmental climates will have on commercially important species such as shrimp. This project takes a unique approach to ocean acidification research by (1) examining multiple, closely-related shrimp species to disentangle species-specific versus general responses, and (2) studying multi-scale responses, from stress physiology to predator defenses, to establish a broader scope of impacts on shrimp (from physiological to ecological). This study will thus provide a timely, comprehensive and realistic assessment of the susceptibility of commercially and ecologically important shrimp species to future ocean conditions, with clear applications to fisheries, aquaculture and the food industry. Findings from this research will reach people of all ages and broad backgrounds through website and social media promotion, public and professional seminars, classroom activities, and hands-on workshops. In addition, this research will contribute to the scientific development of high school and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds through established research experience programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A great diversity of marine organisms are experiencing increased changes in environmental conditions associated with ocean acidification and warming. Such changes in global climate induce a variety of ecological and biological responses, including physiological stress and altered calcification. Increased stress typically affects energy storage and allocation, ultimately cascading in reactions that can impact everything from metabolism and growth to reproduction and behavior. Changes in calcification can affect the integrity and functionality of calcified structures. This outcome may be especially severe for crustaceans, because the calcified exoskeleton is crucial for nearly every aspect of their biology and ecology. A realistic understanding of the potential impacts of ocean acidification and warming on crustaceans thus requires an integrative approach. The primary objective of this project is to determine how forecasted ocean changes will affect stress levels and predator defenses of commercially important Pandalid shrimp. The specific aims will assess the effect of pH and temperature on shrimp (1) physiological oxidative stress, (2) cryptic coloration, (3) tail-flip escape behavior, and (4) exoskeleton armor. Juveniles of three closely related shrimp species with different geographical ranges will undergo long-term exposure to a combination of altered, near-term predicted conditions. The extent of oxidative stress response, exoskeleton spectral properties, tail-flip escape kinematics, and exoskeleton composition and material properties will identify how this ecologically and economically important group of shrimp responds to ocean acidification, and the potential impact of this response on their biology and ecology, but also their use as a food source supporting ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
