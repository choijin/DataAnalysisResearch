<AbstractNarration>Understanding the properties of microscopic systems made of a large number of interacting particles, particularly in the case where the system is subject to extreme conditions of temperature and density, is a fundamental challenge in physics. This project concerns a study of properties of new phases of matter, ranging from ultrahigh density (quark-gluon plasmas) formed in highly energetic collisions of atomic nuclei -- the hottest matter in the universe -- to the matter inside neutron stars, which are stars so squeezed by gravity that they are less than 20 miles across, to states of matter in trapped atomic gases -- the coldest matter in the universe. This interdisciplinary study of many-particle physics leverages a wide spectrum of research in quantum fluids, atomic, nuclear, and astrophysics. Understanding new states of matter and connections between them provides deeper insights into the laws governing the microscopic universe and the basic properties of the world we live in.  At the same time, important technological applications have the potential to flow from understanding the properties of matter under extreme conditions.  This research will build new bridges between atomic physics and condensed matter and nuclear physics and provides an excellent training opportunity for junior researchers to think and create across disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project centers on nuclear aspects of matter under extreme conditions of energy and density.  Advances in neutron star physics in recent years, from observations of neutron stars with masses ~ 2.0 solar masses, to early inferences of mass-radius relations, to an emerging understanding in quantum chromodynamics of how nuclear matter turns into deconfined quark matter at high baryon densities, set the stage for the project's research on matter in neutron star interiors. The PI and his collaborators will explore new research ideas, such as the study of optical properties of highly magnetized atoms at the surfaces of neutron stars, polarization of dileptons as a realistic probe of the anisotropies in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at early time, damping of gravitational waves by matter, and many particle effects in measurements of electric dipole moments of neutrons, protons, and electrons.  The PI's research in one area frequently generates new insights and approaches in other areas, e.g., studies of nuclear pion condensation and on dense quark matter informing work on spin-orbit coupling in cold atoms, and work on ultracold fermions informing understanding of strongly interacting quark matter.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The most exciting outcome of this project has been the development of a consistent picture of the extremely dense matter in neutron stars -- stars with one to two times the mass of the sun -- but only some 25 kilometers in diameter -- taking into account quarks in the deep interior.  We have shown how the quark liquid in the interior is capable of supporting well over twice the mass of the sun against gravitational collapse.  The (static) neutron stars we model are in very good agreement with the inferences of their properties from the remarkable observation -- as this project began -- of the merger of two neutron stars, the event GW170818,  via the gravitational radiation they emitted.  We also predict radii of neutron stars in agreement with preliminary results of the NICER observatory on the International Space Station.  In order to understand the dynamical details of such mergers it is necessary to describe the properties of extremely dense matter at elevated temperatures, comparable to temperatures in the early universe prior to the formation of neutrons, protons, and nuclei;  we are currently developing the needed description of hot nuclear matter to be used by modelers of gravitational mergers.   We have also shown how neutron stars can be used to test theories of dark matter, the elusive substance that is about one quarter of the matter in the universe.  In particular, we have shown that a proposal that ordinary neutrons might convert into dark matter particles, thus resolving the "neutron lifetime puzzle" -- that neutrons appear to decay slightly faster than one finds by counting their decay products -- is inconsistent with the known neutron stars with masses greater than that of the sun.   More generally, the properties of neutron stars are sensitive measures of the influence of dark matter, and thus neutron stars constrain possible explanations of dark matter.
