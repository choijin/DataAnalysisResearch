<AbstractNarration>The conference "Representation Theory XV" will be held June 18-25, 2017 at the Inter-University Center, Dubrovnik, Croatia. This conference will bring together about sixty junior and senior participants interested in mathematical research related to representation theory. This award will support the participation of US-based graduate students,  junior faculty, and researchers without other federal funds in the conference. The conference will provide an excellent opportunity for these US-based researchers to interact with a large cohort of international experts. Expository talks by senior researchers will introduce junior researchers to the frontiers of mathematical research in the topics of the conference and the conference will provide a focused setting for dissemination of new results and for new collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is intended to be an important occasion for deepening and expanding our understanding of representation theory. The scientific focus of the conference is representation theory, with particular emphasis on representations of vertex algebras, W-algebras, Kac-Moody Lie algebras and their quantum deformations, representations of reductive Lie groups, and Dirac operators in representation theory. More information about the conference, including invited speakers and abstracts, can be found at the conference website: https://web.math.pmf.unizg.hr/congress/Dubrovnik17/.</AbstractNarration>
