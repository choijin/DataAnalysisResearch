<AbstractNarration>This project will support the participation of graduate students, postdocs, young investigator and underrepresented groups in the third Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and the first Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Molecular Mechanisms in Evolution. The GRS and GRC will be held at Stonehill College, Easton, MA on June 10-11, and June 11-16, 2017, respectively. The GRC and GRS will bring together researchers who will present and discuss the latest findings and diverse perspectives on the molecular bases of evolutionary change. The GRS, which is primarily attended by graduate students and postdocs, will feature oral and poster presentations accompanied by informal and formal discussions with around 60 attendees. Most of the GRS participants are expected to attend the GRC. The GRC will feature invited talks by the leading scientists in the field, and a selection of short talks from the abstracts, thereby offering young scientists opportunities for visibility and idea exchange. The GRC program will also include poster presentations accompanied by informal and formal discussions. The GRC and GRS will promote international and national collaborations between physicists and biologists of diverse disciplines to promote systematic and quantitative analyses of biological processes, intensified theory building, and deeper understanding of evolution in disease and basic biology. The GRC and GRS will provide networking opportunities, inspiration and connections for young scientists, as well as mentoring and perspectives on cutting-edge new research for young participants at a critical stage in their careers. The requested funds will be used to defray the costs of a diverse group of graduate students, postdocs, new investigators, women, and minority participants in the GRC and GRS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of the GRC and GRS is to provide conditions for major advancement in our understanding of fundamental questions in evolutionary biology. To reach this goal, the organizers will bring together scientists from different disciplines: molecular and evolutionary biology, physics, mathematics and medicine, in order to create an intellectual environment which catalyses original thought, and to initiate collaborations that go beyond the means and competencies of individual groups. This will also be the place for productive discussions of researchers with controversial viewpoints. Understanding evolutionary processes lays the foundation for comprehending the history of life on earth and of the mechanisms that produce its unity and diversity. The GRC and GRS sessions address a wide range of topics: origins of life, evolution of mutation and recombination rates, stress-inducible genetic variation, non-genetic variation and inheritance, phenotypic noise, evolution of novelty, evolution of complexity, cancer, aging, experimental evolution and evolutionary contingency. The themes of the GRC and GRS have been chosen to represent the key problems in the field and to stimulate the exchange of ideas between diverse groups of scientists. This is of greatest importance: without such a community researchers may be unaware of the important recent discoveries and cutting-edge technological developments outside their respective scientific fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.</AbstractNarration>

The meeting covered a variety of scientific topics and the content presented was highly rated by participants.  Conference Participants  The Conference was well-attended with 130 participants. Scientists from academia represented 99% of the participants while attendees from government accounted for 1%. The meeting also attracted a strong mix of young investigators and senior scientists.  Students and post-docs accounted for 49% of all attendees. Approximately 35% of the participants at the 2017 meeting were women.    Seminar Participants  The Seminar was well-attended with 47 participants. Scientists from academia represented 100% of the participants. Students and post docs combined accounted for 87% of all attendees. Approximately 34% of the participants at the 2017 seminar were women.   Conference Program The 2017 Gordon Conference on Molecular Mechanisms in Evolution brought together leading experts in molecular, medical and evolutionary biology to present the latest findings and diverse perspectives on the molecular bases of evolutionary change. Understanding evolutionary processes lays the foundation for comprehending the history of life on earth and of the mechanisms that produce its unity and diversity. Therefore it is fundamental to all aspects of biology. But it is also pivotal for designing efficient strategies to deal with important human health issues like the evolution of virulence, the emergence of drug resistance and the progression of cancer. The scientific program of the conference was divided in sessions covering a wide range of topics including: origins of life, evolution of mutation and recombination rates, stress-inducible genetic variation, non-genetic variation and inheritance, phenotypic noise, evolution of novelty, evolution of complexity, cancer, aging, experimental evolution and evolutionary contingency. The main objective of this GRC was to encourage and nurture a community of researchers, across traditional disciplinary boundaries, with a shared interest in the molecular bases of evolutionary change. This is of greatest importance: without such a community researchers may be unaware of the important recent discoveries and cutting-edge technological developments outside their respective scientific fields. This conference created an engaging atmosphere for open and creative discussions in order to stimulate collaborations among scientists. We provided opportunities for junior scientists and graduate students to present their work in poster format, or in short invited talks, and exchange ideas with researchers who are at the forefront of their fields.  Conference Feedback  Participants had an opportunity to provide feedback at the end of the Conference. The feedback collected from the meeting was extremely positive. Evaluations included numerous positive remarks regarding the dynamic poster sessions, the connections made between the variety of research and attendees, and the opportunities for unstructured conversations.  Evaluations from the GRS included positive comments regarding the creative, innovative talks, the ample discussion periods between the talks, and the balance between talks, poster presenters, and unstructured periods. GRC would like to thank the NSF for its continued support of the meetings.  The contributions received have been critical to the success of the conferences and are having a measurable impact in advancing the frontiers of science worldwide.
