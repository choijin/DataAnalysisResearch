<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in leveraging past research on detecting controversy and bringing this technology to a commercial setting. The project provides actionable insights to organizations interested in securities trading, through the usage of sophisticated machine learning and information retrieval techniques for controversial topics. The project will initially explore markets in the financial services sector that derive some portion of the value for their clients from acquired data streams. Besides the financial industry, there are applications of the technology in reputation and crisis management, as well as scope for social impact by opening analysis and explanatory power of controversies to individual users. The project has the potential to help users become better informed and more capable of critically evaluating the often-overwhelming stream of content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project technology relies on sophisticated machine learning and information retrieval techniques in order to automatically detect controversial topics. The enabling NSF-supported research recognized controversy by mapping a webpage to algorithmically-identified controversial topics. The proposed commercialization effort is unique because it addresses controversy and crisis situations. The project's hypothesis is that this technology can be successfully commercialized to the financial, equity-trading industry given their revenue model and cost structure. The project will use the lean startup method to perform customer interviews and explore the viability of a scalable business model.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to understand the needs of customers ("customer discovery") for the proposed startup company, Automated Controversy Detection (AuCoDe). This company seeks to transfer technology developed by NSF-supported research into the financial technology ("fintech") sector, providing a new signal of turbulence in the market to help traders make better decisions.  The core of the project was participation in an aggressive six-week workshop to teach academics about the issues involved in creating a startup company, with the greatest focus being on developing an understanding of the market before leaping into it. Underlying that course was a requirement of interviewing at least 100 individuals familiar with likely target markets for the company. Over the course of those 102 interviews plus an additional 30 completed after the workshop was over, AuCoDe?s business thesis changed from a generic one of helping trading firms beat competition, to a better focused and more specific thesis that reflect a more nuanced understanding of the market and what was needed to sell within it.  AuCoDe has been incorporated in Massachusetts as Automated Controversy Detection, LLC, and is continuing to define its market space. Since the start of the I-Corps workshop, AuCoDe has received a small technology transfer grant and been awarded an NSF SBIR Phase I grant, both intended to support development of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to provide empirical support for the product?s accuracy in the newly identified market.
