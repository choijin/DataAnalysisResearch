<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Alexander Li of the Department of Chemistry at Washington State University is developing new classes of fluorescent molecules with novel optical properties.  These molecules are useful probes and imaging reagents that enable cutting-edge technologies in medical diagnostics and cell imaging.  The project lies at the interface of organic chemistry and photo-physics and is well suited for STEM educations at all levels.  This project closely integrates research and education and provides the highest level of educational training for students ranging from K-12 to post-graduate students, including those underrepresented in sciences.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Identifying a single molecule goes beyond single-molecule detection and represents the ultimate limit in chemical analysis.  To analyze a single molecule requires that the signals originated from this molecule must carry enough fingerprint signatures so that its molecular structural identity can be confirmed.  Current fluorescent molecules do not offer fingerprint signatures in their single-molecular data.  As a result, fluorescence can detect a single molecule, but cannot identify its molecular structure or determine whether it is due to positive signal or noise.  To address this problem, this project develops molecules with signature emission by learning the design rules for such molecules, unveiling the role of light-molecule interactions in signature emission, determining the one-photon process or two-photon process for the signature mechanism, and testing signature emission in various environments to reveal the impacts of environmental factors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project finds that current principles about light-molecule interactions are rather limited, and thus scientific scopes beyond current theoretical frames are rarely harvested due to such handicapping blindfolds produced by the limited understanding.  This is critical to technological developments and innovations, because universal laws about nature cannot be revealed under wrong guidance.  As such an example, here we demonstrated supracence phenomena, in which the emitted photons have more energy than the absorbed photons.  Up to now, this is considered impossible under the theoretical frame of molecular absorption and consequent emission without additional energy input.  The extra energy comes from molecular quantum motions, whose energy are constantly exchanging with molecular potentials and the environment.  As such supracence is a linear optical process and produces strong effects.  This makes it very useful in term of developments of new technologies because first order effects are much more sensitive than second order or higher order effects.  As supracence results in cooled molecules, behavior opposite of hot fluorescing emitters is expected.  This project has revealed a number of supracence principles while contrasting both molecular emissions: fluorescence and supracence, in high-resolution imaging.  On the broader impact front, the PI had several mechanisms to reach out to high-school students across the state and along the Washington-Idaho border.  For example, he had mentored students from Mountlake Terrace High School in their science projects.  Some students thrived under such mentorship and won the 1st place in WSSEF (Washington State Science and Engineering Fair) in their category.  Almost all the mentored students pursue STEM-related majors in prestigious universities after high school.          Last Modified: 07/12/2020       Submitted by: Alexander Li]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
