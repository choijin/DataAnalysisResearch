<AbstractNarration>This investigation will advance the understanding of how soils are mechanically moved and shaped through interaction with earthmoving tools and machinery. Humans move enormous quantities of soil for civil construction, mining, and agriculture, but our knowledge of the physical processes by which machines interact with soils is surprising limited. This project will generate a new class of computational models for simulating fundamental earthmoving processes. In parallel, an experimental program completed at small scale in the laboratory will provide physical insights and the high-quality data necessary to assess the models. This exploratory research will form the basis for future long-term studies on the optimization and automation of earthmoving machinery, enabling new, potentially radical, machine designs and techniques. Considering the scale at which humans move earth in US and the rest of the world, even the smallest breakthroughs leading to greater efficiency and increased productivity will have profound long-term effects with respect to reducing costs, improving production times, and reducing energy consumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will specifically develop and validate mechanics-based models for plowing and cutting processes in soils. As exploratory research intended to expand into broader studies examining a wide variety of machine configurations and soils types, focus is on dry granular materials, elementary tool shapes, and relatively simple tool motions. Specific research objectives are (1) to formulate a new class of theoretical models based on the kinematic approach of plasticity theory and (2) to inform and validate these models by conducting a series of preliminary experiments in a new facility at Northwestern University utilizing a fluidized bed for sample preparation and a fully instrumented 6-axis robotic armature for actuation and force measurement. The theoretical models are premised on a new paradigm for modeling processes involving large deformation, and will be the first to predict the complete history of forces and deformations rigorously and efficiently, potentially achieving the high levels of efficiency necessary for machine optimization and automation. This research will quantify, precisely and definitively, complete force and deformation histories for characteristic geometries and materials, laying the groundwork for a long-term research program aimed at exploring innovative designs and techniques for earthmoving in civil construction, mining, and agriculture.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this exploratory project was to formulate and validate theoretical models for fundamental earthmoving processes that lie at the heart of large-scale operations across the face of the Earth in civil construction, agriculture, and mining.  This project piloted an efficient simulation technique referred to as the "sequential kinematic method" and took the first steps in the development of methods for simulating three-dimensional plowing and cutting processes, an advance integral to long-term research on soil-machine interaction.  To inform and validate these theoretical models, the project produced preliminary experimental data using new facilities at Northwestern University, in particular by supporting the design and construction of a fluidized bed for rapid, repeatable reconstitution of dry, granular materials.  The research on simulation techniques for plowing and cutting processes has been enthusiastically received by industry partners, fostering collaboration on new industry-supported projects.  By formulating optimization-based computational techniques that can potentially achieve extremely high levels of efficiency, this project opened pathways for new research relating to the optimization and control of earthworking equipment.  The project also uncovered promising new research directions aimed at optimizing methods for detecting the mechanical properties of soils.  The exploratory work nucleated collaboration between researchers in civil engineering and mechanical engineering, and it broadened participation through support of two female students pursuing Ph.D. degrees in civil engineering, as well as a diverse cohort of undergraduate researchers.  The project also led to a collaboration with the Chicago Children's Museum that leveraged an existing program funded through the Institute of Museum and Library Services to create the "Robots and Dirt" tinkering program run in the summer of 2018.
