<AbstractNarration>Unrine, Jason&lt;br/&gt;1712323 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in RNA interference technology have enable the introduction of double stranded RNA (dsRNA)-based pesticides, which are currently being commercialized by the agrochemical industry.  This technology hypothetically enables the targeting of pest species with only a very specific genetic sequence using silencing of genes required for their survival, thereby potentially eliminating environmental health and safety concerns associated with chemical pesticides.  dsRNA has poor stability in the environment and is not readily absorbed by many pest species.  Using nanoparticles to deliver dsRNA can help overcome problems with stability and facilitate absorption by pests.  However, limited information on the persistence and long-term fate of these materials in soil is available and there are little established techniques for detecting and characterizing these materials in the environment.  This project will develop techniques to track these materials in soil and characterize their degradation.  The tools developed and insights gained by this project will enable the development of more benign nanocomposite pesticides.  This will aid in increasing global food security while helping to avoid unwanted environmental impacts resulting from pesticide application.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project will be to establish a set of methods to track the fate and transformations of dsRNA nanocomposites in soil and in soil organisms, to do preliminary testing of their stability in soil solutions, and to assess possible bio-uptake non-target effects in soil organisms.  It will focus on biopolymer polyplex dsRNA nanocomposites and inorganic (calcium phosphate) core with a biopolymer/dsRNA coating.  The main hypothesis that will be tested is that binding of dsRNA to a nanocomposite makes it more persistent in soil and in non-target organisms, increasing the likelihood of adverse effects. The PI will synthesize diethylaminoethyl dextran (DEAE), chitosan, poly-L-lysine and poly-L-histidine coated calcium phosphate particles loaded with dsRNA complimentary to the green fluorescent protein gene.  This gene is present within a genetically modified strain of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (PD4251) which the PI will use as a model organism. Because the gene is only expressed within cells in the body wall, silencing of this gene ensures that the dsRNA has been taken up and internalized within the worm.  Nanocomposites will then be aged in soil solutions of varying composition for varying lengths of time to determine how transformations in soil affect their bioactivity.  The PI will track the fate of the nanoparticles in soil solution and in organisms by isotopically labeling calcium phosphate with the stable 44Ca isotope and fluorescently labelling the dsRNA.  The florescence label will be tracked using asymmetrical field flow fractionation (AF4) coupled to fluorescence spectroscopy.  The isotopically labelled core will be detected using AF4 coupled to ICP-MS.  Bio-uptake of the materials will be assessed using laser confocal microscopy.  The PI will systematically characterize how soil chemistry and aging time affect aggregation, disassembly, dsRNA degradation, bio-uptake, specific bioactivity and non-target effects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ RNA technology is a new approach to biological control of insect pests in agriculture. It enables the targeting of pests based on their specific genetic sequences, avoiding adverse effects on beneficial species. It is an alternative to the use of chemical pesticides which have been documented to cause adverse ecological and human health effects.  Many anticipated applications of RNAi pest control require the use of composite nanomaterials as carriers for double stranded RNA molecules (dsRNA) to enhance their stability in the environment and help the dsRNA molecules gain entry to cells in the target species.  This project was the first of its kind to develop tools to study these materials and to gain basic information about how they interact with environmental media and organisms.  It developed transgenic strains of the soil nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, which are able to report on the bioactivity of the dsRNA nanocomposites by expressing fluorescent proteins.  It also used functional genomics to work out the mechanisms by which these materials gain entry to cells and alter biological functions. The project worked out basic mechanisms of how these materials enter organisms and cause biological effects.  It also determined what the most important environmental variables are, focusing on the soil environment, that determine their fate and biological activity.  This project provides fundamental new tools and approaches which are required if dsRNA nanocomposite materials are to be safely commercialized for use in agriculture.  Ultimately the project contributes towards the safe development of nanotechnology in agriculture for increasing the sustainability of food production and food security.
