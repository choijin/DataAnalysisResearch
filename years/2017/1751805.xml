<AbstractNarration>Upwelling zones are hotspots of photosynthesis that are very dynamic in space and time. Microsocopic algae, known as phytoplankton, bloom when deep, nutrient-rich waters are upwelled into sunlit surface layers of the ocean, providing nourishment that supports productive food webs and draws down carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere to the deep ocean. Photosynthetic microbes in these regions must constantly adapt to changes in their chemical and physical environments. For example, subsurface populations respond to changes in light as they approach the surface. When upwelled waters move offshore, cells sink out of the illuminated zone, establishing seed populations that remain inactive until the next upwelling event. This process is called the upwelling conveyor belt cycle (UCBC). How phytoplankton respond to these changes in environmental conditions and how they may influence their nutrient requirements remains unknown.  With future ocean changes predicted to alter seawater chemistry, including ocean acidification and decreased iron availability, some phytoplankton groups may be more vulnerable than others. Accompanying educational activities provide learning experiences to enhance understanding and awareness of marine microbes. The development of a research hub at UNC aims to provide infrastructure and support for scientists and students conducting research on environmental genomics. A laboratory component for an upper-level undergraduate course focused on marine phytoplankton is being developed. Educational outreach activities to broader communities include creation of a lesson plan on phytoplankton in upwelling zones and a virtual research cruise experience for middle-school students, as well as a hands-on lab activity for a local museum focused on marine phytoplankton and the important roles they play in shaping our planet.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project examines how phytoplankton respond at the molecular and physiological level to the different UCBC stages, which seed populations (i.e., surface versus subsurface) contribute most to phytoplankton blooms during upwelling events of varying intensity, how phytoplankton elemental compositions are altered throughout UCBC stages, and how future predicted ocean conditions will affect the phytoplankton responses to UCBC conditions. This project contains both laboratory and fieldwork. In the laboratory, phytoplankton isolates recently obtained from upwelling regions are exposed to simulated UCBC conditions to examine changes in gene expression, growth and photosynthetic characteristics and elemental composition.  Cultures are subjected to both current and future ocean conditions, including reduced iron availability and higher CO2. In the field, research cruises within upwelling regions study the dynamics of natural phytoplankton communities (both surface and subsurface) experiencing upwelling and relaxation and within simulated upwelling incubation experiments. Knowledge of how phytoplankton are affected by UCBC conditions at an integrated molecular, physiological and elemental level under both current and future scenarios is imperative for the proper conservation and management of these critically important ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
