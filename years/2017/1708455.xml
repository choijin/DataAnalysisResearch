<AbstractNarration>The collective behavior of societies emerges from self-organized interactions among group members. Traditionally, group members have been thought of as identical individuals, but behavioral variation is prevalent in nature. This variation can be extreme and one group member, referred to here as the keystone individual, may have a greater impact on the collective behavior of a group than all other individuals. For example, some individuals may lead a group, tutor others or function as super-spreaders of information or disease. Despite the potential impact of keystone individuals on the success of a group, little is known about how and why this influence emerges. The investigators will use social spiders that can be easily manipulated and observed at the individual and group levels to test hypotheses about the emergence of collective behavior, hypotheses that cannot be easily evaluated in more complex systems. In addition to the numerous undergraduate and graduate research projects this project will generate, the proposed work will also be translated into hands-on activities about collective behavior geared towards the education of K-12 students though established and successful outreach programs. Adult science education activities to enhance public knowledge of invertebrate biology will include public lectures, media coverage, and conversations at local communities where the field work occurs.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research aims to examine the mechanisms by which keystone individuals affect collective behavior, the effects of keystones on the development of collective behaviors and the ecological and evolutionary consequences of the presence of keystone individuals in groups. Using a model system that allows for detailed experimental manipulations, the social spider (Stegodyphus dumicola), will allow the investigators to develop a broad theory to enhance the progress of science on keystone individuals. Specifically, this work will (1) test whether keystone individuals produce tradeoffs among colony-level processes such as prey capture and disease spread, and how these tradeoffs change colony performance in different environments; (2) uncover the temporal dynamics of the effects of keystone individuals on the development of collective behaviors in the field; (3) elucidate the behavioral mechanisms that underlie the catalytic effects of keystone individuals on the behavior of other group members and collective outcomes; and (4) design versatile agent-based models that will uncover the general  mechanisms by which keystone individuals influence collective behaviors. The investigators will address these questions by combining lab and field experiments, analyzed with sophisticated image analysis technology and social network theory, with computational modeling.  Published data sets will be uploaded for use by others to Dryad.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merits:</strong> Collective behavior emerges from the coordinated actions of individuals who live in a group. In some social animals, certain group members, such as leaders, have a disproportionate influence over the collective behavior of the group. We refer to these individuals as &lsquo;keystone individuals&rsquo;. While the effect of a keystone individual on the group can often be observed directly, only little is known about what determines who becomes a keystone individual and under what environmental conditions a keystone individual emerges. Work funded by this grant uncovered the impact and the development of the keystone individual in different environmental conditions. We used the social spider, <em>Stegodyphus dumicola, </em>as our model system. These spiders live in social group of up to 1000 individuals and together they capture prey that is larger than any individual in the group, they raise their young together, and they collectively build a nest in which they live and a capture web in which to trap prey. Individuals in these spider colonies vary substantially in their boldness. Shy spiders take a long time to recover from a simulated prey attack (puffs of air) while bold spiders recover from such an attack rapidly. Most individuals in a colony are shy while a few are bold. We found that the bolder the boldest individual in the colony, the faster the collective prey attack of the colony. Thus, the boldest individual in a colony acts as a keystone individual, imparting a disproportionate influence on the behavior of the colony. The effect of the keystone individuals on its group lasts long after it is experimentally removed from the colony, and the duration of this effect is related to the amount of time the spider had spent in the colony. Interestingly, the identity of the keystone individual is immaterial. As long as there is a bold individual in the group, it doesn&rsquo;t matter who the individual is for the colony to capture prey quickly. Furthermore, boldness is a persistent behavior when spiders are isolated, but when they are in a group, their boldness changes as a function of who they interact with. When shy individuals interact with bolder ones, they will increase their boldness. However, overall, boldness slowly decreases overtime when in a group, regardless of any social interactions. We found this out through a combination of modeling and empirical experiments that tested the prediction of our theoretical work. Interestingly, if a keystone individual holds wrong information about the environment, this has negative implication for the entire society, however, when a shy individual holds misinformation about the environment, its impact on the group is minimal. A group&rsquo;s behavioral composition and size not only influences prey capture success, it also impacts disease dynamics, as we found by tracking the transmission of tagged bacteria from one spider to another. Finally, both the local and global environments influence how the keystone individual influences group dynamics. When a colony is surrounded by many other bold colonies, it will not do as well as when it is surrounded by shy colonies, but only if that colony has many bold individuals. A colony will fare well regardless of the neighbors&rsquo; behavioral composition if it is comprised of mostly shy individuals. Globally, bold individuals have a large impact on the behavior of the group in arid environments but not in wet environments, where prey is abundant. In fact, shy individuals from arid environments will follow any bold individual, whether it came from their own colony, a colony from a wet environment, or a different species altogether. However, shy individuals from wet environments will not follow any bold individuals, from wet or arid sites. Thus, the shy individuals, or &lsquo;followers&rsquo; seem to be the ones driving the interesting collective dynamics we observe.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>We used social network analysis and developed new methods to examine group behavioral composition and dynamics. These tools have broad implications for studies of sociality in animals and humans. Furthermore, this work was conducted with numerous postdocs, graduate, and undergraduate students, who were trained to become successful scientists. Our work was covered by public media, including Newsweek and NPR&rsquo;s Science Friday, reaching a broad and varied audience. Finally, through the outreach programs we conducted while supported by this grant, we worked with students from pre-school to middle school, reaching hundreds of children in southern California engaging them in activities that promote scientific thought. Thus, our work helped develop the evidence based reasoning and critical thinking in our society from its youngest to its oldest members.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/12/2019<br>      Modified by: Noa&nbsp;M&nbsp;Pinter-Wollman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1708455/1708455_10366118_1565636022447_IMG_0762--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1708455/1708455_10366118_1565636022447_IMG_0762--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Spiders attacking prey"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1708455/1708455_10366118_1565636022447_IMG_0762--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Spiders attacking prey"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Social spiders, Stegodyphus dumicola, collectively attacking prey in nature</div> <div class="imageCredit">Noa Pinter-Wollman</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Noa&nbsp;M&nbsp;Pinter-Wollman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Spiders attacking prey</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1708455/1708455_10366118_1565636139246_IMG_1110--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1708455/1708455_10366118_1565636139246_IMG_1110--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Spider nest"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1708455/1708455_10366118_1565636139246_IMG_1110--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Spider nest"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A nest of the social spiders, Stegodyphus dumicola.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Noa Pinter-Wollman</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Noa&nbsp;M&nbsp;Pinter-Wollman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Spider nest</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1708455/1708455_10366118_1565636246257_IMG_20160527_122723326--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1708455/1708455_10366118_1565636246257_IMG_20160527_122723326--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Female spiders and offspring"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1708455/1708455_10366118_1565636246257_IMG_20160527_122723326--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Female spiders and offspring"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Female social spiders, Stegodyphus dumicola, standing on their nest with their offspring in a lab colony</div> <div class="imageCredit">Noa Pinter-Wollman</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Noa&nbsp;M&nbsp;Pinter-Wollman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Female spiders and offspring</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
