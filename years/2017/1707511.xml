<AbstractNarration>Subtle quantum mechanical effects can produce unusual forces between objects. The quantum uncertainty associated with electric and magnetic field fluctuations, for example, can produce unusual forces between molecules, or between molecules and surfaces. These effects, generally known as Casimir interactions, were discovered long ago and thought to generate very tiny forces between macroscopic objects. They are now understood to be especially important for nanometer-sized objects, such as nano-machines and macro-molecules, and so are becoming the focus of much research on sensor technology and precision measurement physics. Accurate calculation of Casimir forces from first principles is a difficult challenge, as it involves delicate averaging of fluctuating fields, with strange consequences; the forces can be either attractive or repulsive, and can either contribute to or detract from the system's entropy. This project will enhance our understanding of Casimir forces through explicit calculations focused on systems of current experimental interest. Results of this research have applications to chemistry, biology, nanoscience, and atomic and nuclear physics. This work is being carried out in collaboration with researchers world-wide, including senior scientists, postdocs, graduate students, undergraduate students, and high-school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to advance our understanding of Casimir (quantum-fluctuation) energies and forces at zero and finite temperatures, for example, by using Green's function and other analytic techniques to compute Casimir self-entropies for a spherical model of an atom. This requires isolating, regulating, and renormalizing the free energy, processes that also have to be done for the energy associated with quantum fields external and internal to surfaces, either flat or curved. It has recently been discovered that the negative entropy of interaction between a perfectly conducting sphere and a perfectly conducting plate is exactly balanced by the positive self-entropy of the sphere. Negative entropies are not unrelated to repulsive forces, which can be realized between atoms and other bodies in vacuum. The nonadditivity of Casimir forces plays an important role in these phenomena. Although most work in this field has concentrated on the normal force between bodies, lateral forces are also being explored, along with Casimir torque and Casimir friction, with the hope that these latter two phenomena may be soon seen in laboratory experiments. Applications, such as to the freezing of ice on surfaces, and properties of new materials such as phosphorene, are being studied in collaboration with a diverse international group of students and advanced researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Quantum physics continues to offer surprises.  In this project we have been exploring the interactions between atoms and surfaces (metals or insulators) induced by fluctuations in the electromagnetic fields permeating all of space.  In classical (pre-quantum) physics, a neutral atom would not feel a force due to a metallic plate. Due to the fluctuations induced by the quantum mechanical uncertainty relations, as well as by thermal fluctuations, a force is generated, which was first predicted by Casimir and Polder nearly 75 years ago.    Quantum vacuum forces between distinct bodies (the atom and the plate, for example) separated by vacuum are well-defined.  However, if the bodies are immersed in a nonuniform medium, like a gas with varying density, difficulties emerge in carrying out the calculations.  We have made some progress in resolving these problems, and have shown that the expected relation between the interaction energy and force does hold rather generally.    Of interest to nanotechnology is, for example, a small nanosphere of metal.  This raises the issue of the self-stresses and energies of single bodies, such as the nanosphere, which poses unresolved difficulties theoretically.  At temperatures above absolute zero, further challenges in computing fluctuation forces appear.  This has to do with what is called entropy, the measure of disorder of the system.  In turns out this disorder can sometimes be negative, which appears to violate basic physical principles of thermodynamics.  We are continuing to make progress in understanding what is going on.  A charged particle that is now moving above a metal plate induces charges on the surface which leads to a frictional drag.  Such a classical effect does not occur for a neutral (chargeless) atom.  However, because of quantum and thermal fluctuations, such an atom also experiences a frictional force when it passes close to a metal.  A neutral atom can even feel a drag force in vacuum, due to radiation reaction.  These effects are a result of dissipation, or energy loss. The energy loss arises either because a moving charge distribution radiates electromagnetic waves (radiation reaction), or because of electrical resistance in the metal.  Such phenomena are difficult to observe, so we are studying ways to enhance the frictional effects.  Casimir forces are usually attractive, but there are various scenarios in which they can be repulsive.  Even the quantum frictional force can conceivably be accelerative. Likewise torques between unsymmetrical bodies can change in their sense (direction) depending on the separation between the bodies.  All of these surprising behaviors continue to be studied by our group.  We have also examined fluctuational Casimir forces in the context of real-world phenomena, such as the freezing of ice on water droplets or the formation of hailstones.  Related effects may well be relevant extraterrestrially, such as possibly affecting life-influencing processes occurring on moons and planets.  All these effects that we are investigating reflect the surprises still being discovered in quantum mechanics, which is usually thought to be relevant only at the atomic scale; instead, quantum forces are important in the macroscopic world we can experience with our senses.  The work in this project was carried out in collaboration with undergraduate and graduate students (and previously including even high-school students), as well as with a variety of senior researchers around the world.  One student received his Ph.D. under the direction of the PI in May 2020, while another will be getting her Master's degree from Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, supported by a Fulbright award.  The collaborative nature of the work carried out by our group, facilitated by nearly daily hours-long (Zoom) research meetings, effectively fosters development of research skills in diverse students at all degrees of preparation.
