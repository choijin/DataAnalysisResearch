<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a significant increase in the efficiency of hospital operations.  The project focuses on the sources of inefficiencies in the planning, staffing, coordination, and execution of surgical procedures.  Preliminary analysis of hospital data shows that the throughput of perioperative units can be increased significantly with the same staffing while reducing the delays that patients experience and improving the working conditions of the personnel.  Such improvements have the potential of saving upwards of $1B per year. Delays in obtaining and communicating updates on the status of surgeries and on actions that personnel should perform are major causes of inefficiency, as is the randomness of the tasks' duration. The timing of those messages depends on the knowledge of the state of the system and a prediction about its future evolution. Delays in gathering information and incorrect predictions of the effect of actions result in reduced efficiency.  The proposed innovation improves the selection and timing of messages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is based on a machine learning approach for the optimization of real-time messaging using actual hospital data. The approach combines new parametric models of real-time scheduling, stochastic gradient descent, and infinitesimal perturbation analysis. In this formulation, perturbation analysis computes the gradient of the objective function with respect to the timing of messages and results in an efficient algorithm.  The algorithm discovers the best time to send messages to optimize a combination of operating room efficiency and patient waiting times. The methodology is able to evaluate the complex cascading impact of scheduling decisions and to identify the best course of action when dealing with contingencies. Timely situation awareness will contribute to improved patient flow in the hospital.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       Hospitals cost about $1B per year, and improving their efficiency could have a significant impact on the cost of Healthcare.  The initial vision is a Waze-like system for hospitals where historical data is used for predicting schedules and selecting a good plan. The software tool is motivated by the observed difficulties that surgery managers face in planning and coordinating surgeries. Our team participated in the Fall 2016 national I-Corps program and interviewed 100 hospital personnel to confirm the importance of these difficulties and refine our understanding.  The basic approach is to start with the planned schedule and to replace the surgery durations and turnover times that the scheduling staff used for the schedule with values obtained from historical data.         The first question is whether the errors in the estimates are significant. We performed a detailed statistical analysis of the predicted versus actual durations. The conclusion is that the actual and predicted durations differ by a significant amount.           How should one correct these prediction errors? A first idea is to replace the predicted durations by their mean historical values. It turns out that this is not a good idea, even if one uses the most similar historical cases to compute the mean values. After trying this approach on thousands of cases, we observed that the schedule corrected with this approach failed to predict well the actual schedule. This finding is significant, because all the scheduling algorithms implemented in commercial systems use this approach.        We developed a new approach to estimate more accurately the start times of surgeries.

The key point is that this data-driven simulation automatically captures the cascades that may occur as a result of duration fluctuations and precedence constraints in the schedule.
