<AbstractNarration>This project will examine the impact on mathematics learning of an initiative to provide kindergartners in an urban school district with personal tablet devices that include free, widely available digital mathematics resources. An important question for schools as tablet devices become more accessible is how to effectively use them in primary grades, especially kindergarten. In addition, since the devices are portable, how children use the resources such as games for mathematics learning at home is also important to understand. This project is set in a high-needs school district with a large number of low-income children. The project provides an opportunity to learn about the potential role of tables and digital resources in early grades through the analysis of assessment data, user analytic data documenting how the resources were used, and survey data from teachers and families. The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most studies of digital learning resources have been small-scale or focused on engagement. This study offers the opportunity to investigate the relationship between the use of these resources and learning outcomes using a quasi-experimental design. The research questions examine how teachers use table-based mathematics resources during instruction, how caregivers and children engage with table-based mathematics resources and how the resources then relate to kindergartners mathematics learning. Assessments of students' learning will focus on number, geometry and measurement concepts. The learner analytic data from the tablets will document the use of the resources on the tablets. Surveys and demographic data will also be collected to document how the tablets were used. Results of the study should inform implementation of tablet use by schools with particular attention to how they are used across in-class and at-home settings.</AbstractNarration>

For this study, we were particularly interested in documenting the perceptions of the donation effort by multiple stakeholders as well as any impacts on children?s learning in mathematics. The focus on mathematics was chosen for pragmatic reasons because the tablet?s designers loaded the device with mathematics applications that allowed usage data of these games to be tracked remotely using the school?s internet connection.

The Test of Early Literacy included two subtests that were administered at both time points: Letter Naming and Letter Sounds. Each tablet assigned to a student in the treatment group was given a unique ID number and data on the use of the PBS math games was tracked remotely.  Usage was measured in terms of the total amount of time the child spent playing the games in minutes between the distribution of the tablets (end of 2017) and the end of the school year (June 2018).  The goal of the qualitative side of the study was to use surveys and interviews to understand the perceptions (both positive and negative) of the tablets project from a variety of perspectives, including administrators, teachers, and family members.  Overall, this study found that while teachers enjoyed the tablets and reported using them frequently and outside partners in the project appreciated the opportunities for collaboration, research and marketing, engagement with the mathematics games did not lead to greater achievement in tested math skills. There are several possible explanations for this lack of effect, several of which may be operating in tandem.

In addition, the use of the games was not integrated into instruction or assigned to particular children based on their needs. Instead, children were often allowed to operate the tablets independently and "find their learning" which may explain while even children who could have benefitted from extended practice on basic mathematical skills did not demonstrate increased learning.
