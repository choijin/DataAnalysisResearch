<AbstractNarration>The University of Southern California will hold an international workshop focused on convergence education where representatives from multiple stakeholder communities will share insights about the impact of the evolving nature of STEM education and workforce development.  The workshop will assess the status and importance of convergence education on all levels globally, describe how convergence and responsible science are being developed in other countries, propose strategies to address emerging convergence education topics and changing workforce needs, and discuss how convergence education can broaden participation in the Stem workforce. The workshop will be used to produce a report with actionable recommendations and prioritization for stakeholder responses that respond to recent national policy and research reports. The workshop supports the National Science Foundation Big Idea "Growing Convergent Research".</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The U.S. National Science Foundation defines convergence as the deep integration of knowledge, techniques, and expertise from multiple fields to form new and expanded frameworks for addressing scientific and societal challenges and opportunities.  Because convergence research is progressing at a rapid clip, the evolution of non-traditional perspectives that it engenders presents a number of challenges/opportunities to education.  The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), and the University of Southern California (USC) sponsored a workshop "Global Perspectives in Convergence Education," with global participation, to explore actions that would facilitate convergence in education.  The workshop was held at the U.S. National Academy in Washington D.C. on 2-3 November 2017.  The participants heard presentations from some 20 invited speakers who addressed various aspects of the challenges associated with convergence education.  The participants were then challenged to identify actionable items for the each of the various stages in education: K-12, community college/technical college, undergraduate, graduate, and continuing education.  They were also challenged to identify overarching opportunities associated with the creation of a convergence education ecosystem, teaching aides/technology, teaming, international collaboration, and funding.  A key action item for each of those topics is included in the workshop report, which can be found at: www.nsf.gov/nano/ConvergenceEducation.
