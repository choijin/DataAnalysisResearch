<AbstractNarration>The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce will open a new research-grade astronomical observatory at a site near their campus.  The observatory will feature a 0.7-meter diameter reflecting telescope with a CCD imaging detector, along with hardware and control software to allow both on-site and remote semi-autonomous observing.  The new observatory will be used for multiple purposes:  scientific research involving college students, improvement of astronomy classes, training of local school teachers in astronomy, and outreach to the local community.   The project will serve the national interest by making a significant impact on the education of students in the region and beyond and creating an exceptionally well prepared generation of scientists and leaders. The primary service area of the university is extremely diverse and made up of a large percentage of economically disadvantaged communities with diverse demographics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program will be led by Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce astronomy faculty and will involve undergraduate and masters-level students from the university, as well as students from community colleges participating in summer programs.  The university researchers will also collaborate with astronomers both nationally and internationally.  The large and varied observational research program will emphasize bright, time-variable astronomical objects such as rotating asteroids, cataclysmic variable stars and pulsating white dwarf stars.  The team will also help characterize newly-discovered exoplanets by making extended follow-up observations of exoplanet candidates from satellite missions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We acquired a PlaneWave  CDK-700 telescope, Andor iKon-L 936 CCD camera, and other ancillary equipment to that is housed in an AstroHaven 12' clamshell dome.   With a cloud sensor, weather station, and all-sky camera, we operate the telescope -- which is located on the University Farm about 5 miles south of Commerce -- remotely from our offices or from our students' Peer Learning Lab.  The facility is allowing our undergraduate and Masters' students to pursue significant research projects that require long-term time series monitoring of photometrically variable astronomical targets, as well as allowing meaningful collaborations with national and international astronomers.  We began regular observations during  July of 2019, and since then the telescope has been used about 60 nights (we lost many nights due to weather, and our time-series projects are not well suited to full moon).   Intellectual merit: Six students are currently using the telescope for research projects, and three presented at the 16th Annual Texas A\&amp;M University System Pathways Symposium November 7-8, 2019, at Texas A\&amp;M International University in Laredo, Texas (see Figure). Four manuscripts with student first authors have been accepted or submitted for publication. Broader Impacts:  The new facility is helping us recruit undergraduate and Masters' students who are interested in astronomy and astrophysics.  A&amp;M-Commerce is the largest university in the region east of Dallas, Texas. The primary service area of the university is extremely diverse with 13 rural counties to the east of the sprawling urban and suburban Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.  Our university undergraduate enrollment is about 60% women, and 46% underrepresented minorities, including 20% African American and 20% Hispanic.  In recent years, some 26% of our degrees went to underrepresented minorities, and 20% to women.   Students trained to use the telescope and in the related time-series analysis methods will be competitive for acceptance to REU Summer Intern programs as well as to graduate programs.
