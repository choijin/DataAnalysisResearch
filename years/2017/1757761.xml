<AbstractNarration>This funding renews a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the Florida International University.  This REU Site will host a diverse group of students from universities across the nation who will spend their summer working on research related to the security and privacy of smart things.  Smart devices are found in our homes and daily environment in many places such as appliances, phones, cameras, and cars as well as many other common applications.  Since these devices can communicate and process data, they are vulnerable to various networking and software attacks such as malware, unauthorized access, impersonation, data modification, and denial of service.  The research is led by an experienced faculty team that plans to offer a balance of theory, applications, and practical skills as well as mentoring and professional development opportunities for the students.  The students will learn how to design, implement, and assess research projects in areas that are becoming crucial for the safety and privacy of all citizens. The site will focus on recruiting under-represented minorities, particularly drawing on the surrounding universities with large Hispanic populations. This site is co-funded by the CISE Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will introduce practical innovations and mechanisms for maintaining the privacy and security of smart devices such as wearable technologies, appliances, and mobile devices as well as smart homes and cities that deploy these devices.  This will be achieved through the use of state-of-the art facilities run by faculty members with significant expertise in the security of smart things.  The goals of the project include providing a quality research experience for undergraduates, increasing participation of female and under-represented minorities in computing fields, preparing students to pursue graduate studies in cyber security fields, and building a community of security of smart things researchers.  By the end of the program, the students should acquire skills that will lead to rewarding professional careers that are vital for preserving our national security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
