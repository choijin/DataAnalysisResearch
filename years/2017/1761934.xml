<AbstractNarration>Does exposure to ethnic violence generate effects that persist for decades? Are victims of violence, including forcibly displaced persons, more or less likely to participate in politics and are they more likely to hold negative attitudes toward out-groups? Are recurrences of conflict more likely to trigger negative reactions among people who have experienced violence in the past? We propose to study these questions in a "frozen" conflict in Cyprus, where ethnic violence more than 40 years ago created a de facto partition of the island. We build on research conducted during the summer of 2016 to explore consequences of violence exposure in the context of a recently terminated (failed) peace process. Via a second wave of a nationally-representative survey, we can measure changes in attitudes as a function of the recent failure of an internationally-mediated peacemaking process. Our survey covers Greek Cypriots' experiences with violence, social backgrounds, social and political values, perceptions of and attitudes toward different ethnic groups, opinions on the reunification of Cyprus, and participation in civic and political life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the aftermath of the failure of reunification talks, we are in the unique position to do a second round (panel) survey of Greek Cypriots. Our study will be the first social-scientific analysis of determinants of Greek Cypriot attitudes toward each other andtoward Turkish Cypriots, testing hypotheses about how the failure of peace talks and the violence of 1974 affect their political views and their proclivity to support reunification. Combined with the data previously collected, these data could help us to better understand how social preferences respond to ethnic antagonism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project entitled "Violence and the Persistence of Ethnic Identification," funded by an NSF Rapid grant, measures the persistence of the effects of violence exposure after ethnic war and displacement in Cyprus.[1]  The key objective was to test whether wartime experiences shape individuals’ social identification (ingroup bias and outgroup prejudice).   Cyprus has been divided since a brief war in 1974 that resulted in the territorial partition of the island and an ongoing occupation of 40% of the country by Turkey.  The (Greek) Cypriot government controls territory in the South and is the only internationally recognized government of the country.  Turkey, via a surrogate government, controls territory in the North and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus declared its independence in 1983.  The de facto partition of the island has not been internationally recognized and United Nations (UN) troops monitor the border between the two entities, having established a "green line" that serves as a buffer zone to reduce the risk of renewed violent conflict.  There have been several rounds of negotiations since 1974 with the intent of reunifying the island.  The last round of negotiations, which appeared promising but resulted in failure, took place in 2017.   The war of 1974 caused a high number of deaths (relative to the size of the population) and displaced one third of the Greek Cypriot population.  This project tests whether GCs’ wartime experiences have persistent effects and whether these effects are passed on inter-generationally.  Also of key interest was to test whether any political developments that affect the prospect of reunification (e.g. electoral outcomes; failures in peace-making initiatives) affect on social preferences (ingroup bias/outgroup prejudice) differently for people who have been displaced or who have individual or family experiences of violence.  The NSF-funded surveys built on a prior nationally representative survey in 2016 that collected a first wave of data.  Two new surveys were fielded from November 2018 to August 2019.  The first survey consists of face-to-face interviews of a random sample of 1,400 individuals from the four largest metropolitan areas of Cyprus (with an embedded conjoint experiment).  The second survey consists of a telephone survey of nationally representative sample of 1,500 Greek Cypriots (with an embedded list experiment and salience treatment to identify the effects of wartime experiences on attitudes).  The two surveys share common sections on wartime experiences and socio-demographic information, so they can be combined for some of the analyses.  Part of the data was collected prior to the Euro-parliament elections of 2019 and part was collected after the elections, so we can study the effects of political debates in the lead-up to elections as well as the effect of the outcome of the elections (specifically, targeting the effects of a peace-making overture by a major GC political party that promoted a TC as a candidate for the elections).  The main questions the surveys are designed to address are the following:  (a) Is there persistence in the effects of violence exposure on social preferences over a very long period?  (b) Do different forms of violence (physical harm to self/family vs internal displacement) have different effects on social preferences?    (c) Is there evidence of an inter-generational transmission of effects of violence exposure/displacement?    Data analysis has not yet been completed.  Preliminary analysis tests whether GCs who have had individual or family experiences with displacement exhibit different degree of attachment to the ethnic/national in-group relative to other GCs.  We test whether a new ingroup identity was formed among displaced persons, how wartime experiences affect attitudes toward the out-group (TCs) and whether these attitudes are passed on inter-generationally.  While several prior studies have conducted analyses of the effects of wartime violence on attitudes toward out-groups, few have explored the persistence of such effects over such a long period and even fewer have considered changes in in-group attachment as an outcome of displacement.  We put forth a new theoretical argument concerning the formation of refugee identity as a hybrid identity that shares commonalities to both ethnicity and social class.  This argument has not been previously made in the literature though the data analysis that will shed light on the strength of ingroup identification among refugees remains to be completed. At the moment, both data collection endeavors have been completed.  The data have not yet been fully processed; a final analysis and report of findings from this project will be submitted by the end of summer 2020 via an update to the present "project outcomes" report.       [1] The original proposal was submitted with Anna Schultz, as co-PI.  Schultz was a post-doctoral fellow at my lab (Penn Identity and Conflict Lab) at the time whose primary responsibilities in this project included data management, programming the survey, and data analysis.  As we have discontinued our collaboration, this report is single-authored by the PI (Nicholas Sambanis).         Last Modified: 12/30/2019       Submitted by: Nicholas Sambanis]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
