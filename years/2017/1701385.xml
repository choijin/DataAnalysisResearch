<AbstractNarration>The Conference "Beyond Uniform Hyperbolicity" will take place in Provo, Utah from June 5 to June 16, 2017. This will be the eighth such conference, and first in the United States since 2006. As with the previous conferences on the subject, the planned workshop will focus on disseminating new results and training researchers. This conference will host from 100 to 120 participants.  Leading researchers investigating smooth dynamical systems, promising junior researchers, and graduate students will participate.  There will be mini-courses and a small number of invited talks which will allow ample time for informal collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will focus on the global qualitative study (topological and ergodic) of differentiable dynamical systems. Topics related to hyperbolicity include partial hyperbolicity, nonuniform hyperbolicity, singular hyperbolicity, Lyapunov exponents, dimension, and statistical properties. The conference will also investigate global and semi-local dynamics. Other topics include connections to hyperbolicity such as symbolic extensions, interval dynamics, foliations, actions of discrete groups on manifolds, and holomorphic systems.

In the last 20 years, the body of research regarding what is referred to as smooth dynamical systems beyond the uniformly hyperbolic setting has grown rapidly and substantially.

This conference also advanced the development of the field throughout the United States, as stated above by training junior mathematicians, students, and those from underrepresented groups for the aforementioned research. Throughout the conference each of these tree groups were given opportunities to present their research to a broad audience.   The grant was used to support the local housing expenses for 65 attendees.  Most of these were graduate students, Post Docs, and junior faculty who otherwise would not have been able to attend the conference.
