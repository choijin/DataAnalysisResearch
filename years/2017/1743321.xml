<AbstractNarration>Heliophysics is in the core of the Geospace science because the solar activity directly determines the conditions of the Earth space environment and atmosphere. For understanding the physical mechanisms of the complex multi-scale processes on the Sun and developing Space Weather forecasting techniques, it is critical to develop a common cyberinfrastructure to collect, access, analyze, share and visualize all forms of data from ground-based and space observatories, as well as from data-driven numerical simulations and modeling, and develop capabilities for their efficient analysis using advanced computer science techniques. The main goal of this project is to create a Research Coordination Network (RCN) that will foster new collaborations between heliophysics and computer scientists, which will result in ideas and concrete plans for developing building blocks supporting the goals of the EarthCube initiative. This RCN will actively encourage involvement of a diverse pool of community members and will provide an organized virtual structure that will promote a science transforming open source knowledge collaboration. This collaboration will enhance the science return from individual research projects run by the RCN participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activities of the RCN will be overseen by a steering committee composed of academic Heliophysicists and computer scientists from leading universities and research centers in the field. The steering committee will organize three topical working groups led by the members of the principal investigator (PI) team, which will address specific challenges related to: 1) Finding data and discovering knowledge, 2) Working with data and cross-disciplinary data, and 3) Simulations and modeling. The steering committee will organize topical working groups that will have as primary goals to build and strengthen the partnership between heliopyhsicists and cyber/computer scientists, foster new collaborations that will lead to better science outcomes, develop and discuss new ideas, methodologies and tools for efficient integration and analysis of the existing and upcoming large databases generated by space and ground-based observatories and supercomputer modeling centers. The RCN working groups will be led by the members of the PI Team, who will organize virtual seminars, as well as special sessions during general conferences in the field (such as the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union and the Solar Heliospheric and Interplanetary Environment conference). In addition, the PI team will organize annual plenary technical interchange meetings attended by all working groups. The RCN steering committee will closely work with the EarthCube Governance and participate in the annual EarthCube meetings. The RCN will actively involve students and young researchers in its working groups and promote and support their participations in the EarthCube meetings. The project outcomes will be published in regular project reports, scholarly articles, and presented at the EarthCube meetings and scientific conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
