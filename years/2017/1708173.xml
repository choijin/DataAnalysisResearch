<AbstractNarration>This award is funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry.  Professor C. Daniel Frisbie of the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities is supported to develops techniques both for making ultrathin films (1-10 nm, a tiny fraction of a human hair in width) of organic semiconductors and for sensitively measuring their conduction properties using an atomic force microscope (AFM). The organic films are made in such a way that molecular orientation is precisely controlled so that electrical conduction is measured in the most favorable direction. These methods advance the frontiers of organic semiconductor science that underpin display technology by providing new knowledge about how charges move in oriented molecules.  Organic semiconductors belong to a new class of functional molecular materials that have achieved widespread commercial success in organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) employed in smart phone displays and televisions. Understanding the electrical conduction properties of these molecular semiconductors on microscopic "even nanoscopic" length scales is vital to their continued improvement.  Integrating the research with education provides research opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, training them to be the next generation of experts in molecular synthesis and characterization, electrical conductance measurements, and nanotechnology.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The plan leverages unique experimental approaches developed by the PI and his students over the last 15 years including (i) conducting probe atomic force microscopy (CP-AFM) for forming metal-molecule-metal junctions and (ii) oligoimine click chemistry for building surface-anchored pi-conjugated wires with monomer-by-monomer control over chain architecture. There are four project goals: (1) to use isotopic labeling to understand the nature of polarons and polaron hopping transition states in pi-conjugated molecular wires; (2) to investigate polaron size effects on hopping transport; (3) to measure spin transport as a function of both molecular wire length and tailored architecture using CP-AFM spin valve junctions with ferromagnetic (FM) contacts; (4) to demonstrate electronic structure control and current switching.  The team collaborates with two quantum chemistry groups that provide theoretical and computational support for the project. Overall, the research plan balances lower risk experiments that are certain to yield important results with higher risk ideas that open up new directions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Under this award, the Principal Investigator and his research team investigated electrical transport in metal-molecule-metal nanostructures, termed "molecular junctions". Molecular junctions, only a few nanometers in dimension, may one day serve as tiny switches for electronics applications but many of their fundamental properties are not currently understood.  In terms of Intellectual Merit of the work, the team demonstrated (i) that the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics could be predictably controlled by manipulating the chemical structure of molecules in the junctions and (ii) that the I-V behavior could be accurately modeled using a simple equation derived from first principles. The ability to model the experiments turned out to be especially important because it allowed the I-V behavior to be related to more fundamental parameters of the molecular junctions, especially the electron energies. This information can then be used in future work to design molecules that yield improved performance. Importantly, the team also resolved a long-stand controversy over which molecular orbitals (or energy states) participate in conduction through two different benchmark molecules.  In terms of Broader Impacts, this award resulted in the training of students and postdoctoral scholars in methods of molecular synthesis, molecular electronics, surface chemical analysis, and atomic force microscopy. This training prepared the individuals for careers in academia and industry.       Last Modified: 10/21/2020       Submitted by: C. Daniel Frisbie]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
