<AbstractNarration>The large-scale storage of electricity from intermittent sources such as solar and wind power is a key challenge in the development of renewable energy. One promising approach to this challenge is the use renewable electricity to produce energy-rich chemical fuels that can be stored, transported, and used whenever necessary. This approach requires catalysts that are capable of efficiently converting inert molecules such as water and carbon dioxide into chemical fuels like hydrogen and methanol. Currently, such catalysts are typically derived from expensive, rare metals such as platinum. To make the electrochemical production of fuels more economically feasible new catalysts that are based on inexpensive and abundant elements are needed. In this project supported by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. William Harman, Chemistry Department, University of California - Riverside, is exploring platforms based on carbon and boron that mimic many of the important features of commonly used metals catalysts. Their ability to reduce carbon dioxide to fuels and fuel precursors is being developed and inexpensive catalysts are being designed. In addition to providing a vehicle for the training of graduate and undergraduate students at UCR, this research program incorporates outreach to community colleges in the inland southern California area with a focus on promoting opportunities for study in STEM fields among underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Due to their intrinsic redox activity and unique modes of reactivity, transition metals have dominated the field of electrochemical small molecule activation.  Recently, materials based on graphitic carbon, often doped with heteroatoms, have emerged for applications in electrocatalysis. This project is preparing carbene-supported and zwitterionic diboraanthrancenes and diboraanthracenes with tethered metal ions. These species are redox active and are capable of coupling electron transfer and small molecule activation. Based on this behavior, catalysts are designed for the electrochemical synthesis of energy rich species, such as methanol, from small molecules, such as carbon dioxide. This research program incorporates a summer research experience for undergraduates at local community colleges as well as outreach to this community regarding opportunities for advanced study in chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
