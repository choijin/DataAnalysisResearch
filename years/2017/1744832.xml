<AbstractNarration>Bubbles of ancient air trapped in ice cores have been used to directly reconstruct atmospheric composition, and its links to Antarctic and global climate, over the last 800,000 years. Previous field expeditions to the Allan Hills Blue Ice Area, Antarctica, have recovered ice cores that extend as far back as 2.7 million years, by far the oldest polar ice samples yet recovered.  These ice cores extend direct observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane concentrations and indirect records of Antarctic climate into a period of Earth's climate history that represents a plausible geologic analogue to future anthropogenic climate change. The results demonstrate a smaller glacial-interglacial variability of climate and greenhouse gases, and a persistent linkage between Antarctic climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide, between 1 and 2 million years ago. Through this project, the team will return to the Allan Hills Blue Ice Area to recover additional ice cores that date to 2 million years or older.  The climate records developed from these ice cores will provide new insights into the chemical composition of the atmosphere and Antarctic climate during times of comparable or even greater warmth than the present day.  Project results will help answer questions about issues associated with anthropogenic change including the relationship between temperature change and the mass balance of Antarctic ice and the relationship between atmospheric greenhouse gases and global climate change.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Earth has been cooling, and ice sheets expanding, over the past ~52 million years. Superimposed on this cooling are periodic changes in Earth's climate system driven by variations in the eccentricity, precession, and obliquity of Earth's orbit around the Sun. Climate reconstructions based on measurements of oxygen isotopes in foraminiferal calcite indicate that, from ~2.8 to 1.2 million years before present (Ma), Earth's climate system oscillated between glacial and interglacial states every ~40,000 years (the "40k world"). Between 1.2-0.8 Ma and continuing to the present, the period of glacial cycles increased in amplitude and lengthened to ~100,000 years (the "100k world"). Ice cores preserve ancient air that allows direct reconstructions of atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane. They also archive proxy records of regional climate, mean ocean temperature, global oxygen cycling, and the aridity of nearby continents. Studies of stratigraphically continuous ice cores, extending to 800,000 years before present, have demonstrated that atmospheric carbon dioxide is strongly linked to climate, and it is of great interest to extend the ice-core record into the 40k world. Recent discoveries of well-preserved ice dating from 1.0 to 2.7 Ma from ice cores drilled in the Allan Hills Blue Ice Area (BIA), Antarctica, demonstrate the potential to retrieve stratigraphically discontinuous old ice at shallow depths (&lt;200 meters). This project will continue this work by retrieving new large-volume ice cores and measuring paleoclimate properties in both new and existing ice from the Allan Hills BIA. The experimental objectives are to more fully characterize fundamental properties of the climate system and the carbon cycle during the 40k world. Project results will have implications for Pleistocene climate change, and will provide new constraints on the processes that regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide, methane, and oxygen on geologic timescales. Given a demonstrated age of the ice at the Allan Hills BIA of at least 2 million years, the team will drill additional cores to prospect for ice that predates the initiation of Northern Hemisphere glaciation at the Plio-Pleistocene transition (~2.8 Ma).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
