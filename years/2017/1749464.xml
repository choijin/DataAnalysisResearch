<AbstractNarration>Phase change heat transfer is desirable in many industrial processes including water desalination, solar thermal energy storage, electrochemical energy storage, and electronics cooling. Over the last several decades, nanoscience has played a crucial role in the development of novel engineered surfaces for improving the thermodynamic efficiency of phase change heat transfer processes. While nanoengineered surfaces has become a critical technology for energy storage, nanoscience education is new and relatively underdeveloped. It is therefore important to develop novel and effective methods for teaching the concepts of nanoscience to students to continue the advancement of nanotechnology. The project seeks to address these issues with exploring the concepts of wettability characteristics of engineered surfaces and effects on multiphase systems. Through a workshop format, K-12 students will learn about the concepts of nanoengineered surfaces and multi-phase heat transfer. During the workshop, students will also participate in seminars and laboratory tours and conduct laboratory experiments. The goal is to inspire the students to pursue education and careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields as well as convey the importance of surface engineering in solving future problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An anticipated outcome of the project is to increase the awareness of novel evaporative cooling technology in development of chips and corresponding cooling challenges as one proceeds to make systems such as servers or power electronics devices. The project team will work with local outreach programs from Washington University including the Academic Pipeline programs to recruit students with few financial resources to participate in the workshop. The focus of this workshop is to address broadening participation in STEM fields by exposing underrepresented minorities and women to the interdisciplinary field of nanotechnology. An additional outcome of the workshop is the creation of a classroom module for teachers to use to experimentally demonstrate the importance of nanoengineered surfaces on thermal transport. Further, the project will collaborate with the Institute for School Partnership (ISP), is Washington University's signature effort to improve teaching and learning strategically within the K-12 education community, to develop and deliver the classroom module.</AbstractNarration>

The participants were members of Washington University&rsquo;s innovative College Prep Program, a multiyear initiative that prepares high-achieving students with limited financial resources for college. The demographics of the workshop were: 54% African American/Black, 20% White, 11% Asian, 10% Hispanic/Latin, and 5% other; while 63% of students were female. The workshop comprises the following activities: <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On the first day, </span></em></strong>the students are first introduced with the fundamental concepts in heat transfer and learnt the different modes in heat transfer through simple conduction and convection experiments. <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On the second day</span></em></strong>, the students prepared a &ldquo;simulated chip&rdquo; using thin copper plate and a thin film heater, and furthermore assembled their own air-cooling modules on the simulated chip using the necessary accessories provided to the students. They then experimentally evaluated the thermal performance of the air-cooling module, validated the function of heat sink with fin structure, and evaluated the impact of heat sink on the air-cooling performance. <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On the third day,</span></em></strong> the students built a simple liquid-cooling module on the same &ldquo;simulated chip&rdquo; that has been used in the previous day. The core part of the liquid-cooling module is a heat exchanger allowing liquid to flow in and out, therefore transferring excessive heat away from the &ldquo;simulated chip&rdquo;. The bulk part of the heat exchanger (i.e., the liquid routing manifold) is fabricated from 3D printing while the bottom substrate of the heat exchanger is a copper plate allowing good thermal contact with the heat source. <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On the last day,</span></em></strong> the students learnt multiphase heat transfer phenomena by assembling a customized boiling chamber on the &ldquo;simulated chip&rdquo;. Meanwhile, they also nanocoated a copper plate exhibiting hydrophilic or hydrophobic characteristics, using a simple solution coating and spray coating technique. The students first examined the wetting characteristics of the nanocoated surface by visually observing the contact angle of water droplets on the coated plate, and subsequently explored the effects of surface characteristic on multiphase heat transfer performances by placing the coated metal sample in the pool boiling chamber and observing the difference in bubble nucleation and formation.</p> <p>The workshop provided an integrated research and education approach of nanoscience to at-risk-underrepresented minorities K-12 students.

The sentiment and experience of the participants were examined via an anonymous survey which showed that over 80 percent of participating high school students identified as having a better understanding of electronics cooling and heat transfer after the completion of the 4-day workshop. These positive sentiments are also reflected in the qualitative feedback expressing themselves enjoying the hands-on learning experiences conducting the experiments during this workshop.
