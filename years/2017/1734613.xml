<AbstractNarration>This award supports a three-day conference that will occur in the Washington DC area in spring 2018. Its goal is to address unprecedented challenges and opportunities in creating and preserving the history of space exploration. It will bring members of the historical and archival communities together with representatives of the space industry, records management, digital humanities, and libraries to examine the critical issues in creating, collecting, preserving, and accessing space archives worldwide. Conference organizers will disseminate these strategies and practices, encourage space stakeholders (especially international organizations) to incorporate these recommendations, and encourage underrepresented minorities and communities to create and archive their contributions to space history. Strategies for developing better archives that are broadly accessible will increase public interest in space science and technology. In addition, they will benefit the larger historical profession by promoting accessible tools and techniques together with best practices for their use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is both timely and important. Creating and preserving the history of space exploration face unprecedented challenges and opportunities. As early generations of researchers, engineers, administrators and users retire, the number of countries, organizations, and companies involved in space is sharply expanding. In addition, new forms of electronic communication and data including oral histories and social media are changing the nature of historical records. If historians, archivists and the space community do not act soon to encourage the creation and preservation of space archives, the future record will be incomplete, inaccessible, and possibly incomprehensible. If successful, this conference will develop data management strategies and toolboxes of exemplary best practices that greatly assist in preserving humanity's heritage. Outreach efforts will provide guidelines, promote support networks, and engage with both domestic and international space actors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Collecting and preserving the history of space exploration face unprecedented major challenges and opportunities.  As early generations of researchers, engineers, technicians, administrators, and users retire, they form a disappearing treasure of untapped personal histories about the first decades of spaceflight. How can historians and archivists work with these people as individuals and groups to record their stories?      Meanwhile the number of countries, organizations, and companies involved in space is sharply expanding. How can historians and archivists convince these actors about the importance of collecting and preserving their history? What tools can reduce their barriers to capturing their history?     Finally, new forms of electronic communication and data including oral histories and social media are changing the nature of historical records. How can historians and archivists harness these evolving tools to capture contemporary events and ensure they can be accessed in the future?     To explore these issues, "To Boldly Preserve" (TBP) brought nearly 100 historians, archivists, and museum curators together with representatives of the space industry, records management, digital humanities, and libraries to examine the critical issues in creating, collecting, preserving, and accessing space archives.  We met March 1-2, 2018 at the Center for the History of Physics, American Institute of Physics in College Park, Maryland.      To maximize its value, the conference was organized to encourage interaction among attendees and thinking about post-conference action. Speakers submitted short summaries (2-3 pages) to the website for participants to read before the conference.  The organizers read the summaries and suggested where the speakers could focus more on the conference goals.  Wrap-up sessions at the end of both days pushed participants to think about future actions and goals.  To maximize time together, breakfast and lunch were provided both days and an optional dinner was offered the first night.  To encourage mixing, people were randomly assigned tables by their profession for the first day?s lunch.     TBP addressed issues faced by all areas of history &ndash; encouraging high quality "history from below," effectively using new digital technologies, preserving the widest possible range of materials, and educating a new generation of stakeholders about importance of collecting their history.  While demonstrating great interest in and a wide range of approaches for preserving and collecting space history, the conference revealed a more diverse and fragmented community than the organizers realized.      Consequently, post-conference efforts are moving in three basic directions:  coordinating the community, collecting information on useful tools and reaching out to space actors.  A newsletter, occasional virtual conferences, and sessions at professional meetings will keep the TBP community informed.      The conference demonstrated that the computer and information history community has much to teach the space history community. One specific task is to encourage local and decentralized high quality "do-it-yourself" oral history by providing training to interested individuals and groups based on the Computer History Museum model.  To use a medical analogy, these men and women are nurse practitioners compared with the professional historians who are the surgeons.     TBP will reach out to space actors with an online toolkit of best practices, standards, models, and principles for our professional communities and for the different audiences of space actors. To maximize our limited resources and avoid reinventing the wheel, we will take advantage of what already exists on other websites as well as create materials to address specific concerns of the space community such as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).      Many people became active in space exploration and exploitation because they wanted to make history.  Over the next years, TBP?s goal is to help both active and retired space actors and institutions collect and preserve their history.      Archiving and accessibility face unprecedented technical, intellectual and practical challenges in the digital age &mdash; and space history can serve as an exemplary field to tackle those challenges and take advantage of those opportunities.
