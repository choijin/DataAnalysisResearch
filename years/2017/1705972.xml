<AbstractNarration>This project constitutes a rapid-response effort to investigate the effects of the extreme flooding event of Hurricane Matthew on coastal cycling of carbon and nutrient elements. The investigators aim to improve our understanding of how estuaries and coastal systems respond to extreme events by measuring carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus loading into the Neuse River Estuary-Pamlico Sound (NRE-PS) coastal ecosystem. The NRE-PS is the urgent study site to examine resulting effects of Hurricane Matthew on coastal environments because it is downstream of the most intense flooding that occurred, and it is located on the North Atlantic "hurricane track", likely to be impacted by future extreme events. Furthermore, it is the focus of a long-term monitoring program in that system, the Neuse River Estuary Modeling and Monitoring Program (ModMon), which was initiated in 1993. That date is significant because it preceded a recent rise in Atlantic tropical cyclone activity and has been able to capture the biogeochemical and ecological effects of major storms that have impacted the NC coast, including Hurricanes Fran (1996), Floyd (1999), Isabel (2003), and Irene (2011). Incorporating intensive sampling of the Hurricane Matthew flooding in the context of these ongoing observations will enable a comparison of the material fluxes into this coastal environment resulting from a major tropical storm and provide a comparison with other coastal environments. Outcomes of this work will be communicated widely via existing outreach efforts of each investigator's research programs to local and regional resource managers, regulators, and other stakeholders. Nutrient loading will be critical information for stakeholders because the Neuse Estuary is an EPA 303(d) listed waterway impaired for nitrogen. Project results can aid in understanding the effects of extreme weather events on ecosystem disturbances and inform coastal carbon flux estimates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific questions to be addressed in the context of this project include: 1) How do coastal carbon and nitrogen budgets respond to floodwaters from tropical storms and hurricanes? 2) What is the biological and photochemical reactivity of this material? The first question can be answered via a relatively short, yet intense, period of observations, such as is proposed here. The second question, which has potential teleconnections to climate in terms of carbon fluxes, food web responses, and other ecosystems processes, requires a longer duration study. However, Question 2 could be answered by further study of samples collected during a short and intense period of sampling proposed to answer Question 1. Work proposed in this project will result in estimates of fluxes and reservoirs of key constituents such as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved and particulate organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC, POC, DON, PON), and N and P nutrients, as well as chlorophyll biomass and pigment analyses.</AbstractNarration>

In this RAPID project, we quantified the short-term (several months) response of carbon and nutrient cycling in the Neuse River Estuary-Pamlico Sound (NRE-PS) ecosystem to floodwaters associated with Hurricane Matthew, which occurred in October 2016. Sampling was conducted weekly in both the NRE-PS (October 2016 to January 2017), the Neuse River (NR) (October to December 2016) and in freshwater wetlands of the Neuse River above head of tides in March and October of 2017. We measured the light-absorbing properties and isotopic composition of river, estuary, and sound water, as well as the amount of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in those waters. The Intellectual Merit of this project was that we found the storm increased the amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the estuary and the sound by 55% and particulate organic carbon (POC) by 120% for the estuary and about 50% for the sound. The color of the DOC can be seen clearly in satellite imagery. Organic nitrogen (N) loading was similarly increased. While floodwater decreased the inorganic carbon concentrations by roughly 30%, we found the decrease in alkalinity meant that more CO2 was released from floodwaters reaching the NRE-PS after the storm. Chemical measurements of DOC indicated that the increased concentrations originated from wetlands adjacent to the river channel but situated above the head of tides. Our results demonstrate the remarkable changes to coastal ecosystems caused by extreme weather events such as tropical storms and hurricanes. Some of these changes involve stimulating the degradation of organic carbon to CO2 in coastal waters with long water residence times. Our discovery suggests that floodplain wetlands may be &ldquo;primed&rdquo; to release DOC which is then degraded to CO2 and released back into the atmosphere.
