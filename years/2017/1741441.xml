<AbstractNarration>The Internet has enabled new kinds of interaction among people at a wide variety of scales, ranging from small groups to global social networks. The data arising from these new forms of interaction have been challenging to integrate because of how they span this wide range of scales; yet without this integration, we cannot understand how micro-level group interactions build up to macro-scale behavior or how macro-level factors shape small group interaction. A key data-science challenge is to bridge this gap between the micro- and macro-levels; and a crucial but relatively unexplored part of this challenge resides in the lack of conceptually useful models and techniques at the intermediate scales in between. This project investigates online social interaction data at different levels of scale, and develops methods for bridging the extremes by taking into account not just the global scales but also the intermediate meso-scale interaction (constituting interactions among hundreds or thousands of participants). Developing methods for handling the meso-level of data not only poses scientifically rich questions in its own right but also allows for transformative theory building across micro- and macro-level phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project brings together researchers from a wide range of backgrounds to develop new ways of understanding and designing online interaction across different levels of scale. The research seeks to identify new forms of sub-structure that arise as the scale of the group increases to meso-scale and on to global scale; to identify new ways of maintaining an effective flow of ideas and processes for reaching consensus when the number of participants in a discussion grows signi&amp;#64257;cantly; and to develop techniques for addressing the increased potential for conflict and polarization when people can participate at a boundary between recognizability and anonymity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team combines multiple research perspectives, with broad expertise in analyzing social interaction data and developing models of social network dynamics; opinion extraction, summarization and argument mining; modeling conversational behavior; large-scale data analysis of pragmatics of language, including persuasion and information spread; and computer-mediated communication, social computing and human-computer interaction. In addition to the underlying research questions, the project also seeks to provide new knowledge that companies and organizations building meso-scale platforms can adopt to maximize the effectiveness of their sites; to add to research infrastructure through the release of datasets, code, and working applications; to impact education through the interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups; and more generally to create mechanisms that can make online interactions more productive.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project's goals were to (i) identify and navigate new kinds of sub-structure in on-line interaction, particularly expressed through text; (ii)  develop new methods for formulation and analyzing notions of persuasion, deliberation, and interaction in groups that are too large for small-group principles to apply;  (iii)  detect and mitigate counter-productive and negative behavior in on-line groups; and (iv) explore interface designs to improve conversational dynamics in online groups.  The intellectual merit of the project has included advances in analyzing and improving interactions in groups. Network structure has one been a focus of our research.  In one project, we show how diffusion protocols --- the social exchanges that enable information transmission --- affect cascade growth (such as a piece of information going viral), analogous to the way communication protocols define how information is transmitted from one point to another. Studying 98 of the largest information cascades on Facebook, we find recurring classes of diffusion protocols, and identify two key counterbalancing factors in the construction of these protocols, with implications for a cascade's growth: the effort required to participate in the cascade, and the social cost of staying on the sidelines.  Additionally, we have developed network-based methods for analyzing the interaction of viewpoints that operate on the ways in which users share content.  When locating Web domains on a political spectrum induced from the data, we obtain an embedded graph showing how these interaction links span different distances on the spectrum.  Another theme has been in the realm of disagreement and controversy.  We have looked in the domain of medical diagnosis, predicting when multiple doctors will disagree in their diagnosis of the same case, and in social media domains of Reddit and Wikipedia editor discussions.The team has used natural-language processing techniques anddeveloped a framework for capturing pragmatic devices, such as politeness strategies, to predict early warning signs of anti-social behavior. A third research theme has been the investigation of persuasion.  In studying which factors are associated with success in on-line debates/argumentation, we discover that patterns in the social interactions with other users is more important than the prior beliefs and personal traits of the debater as well as the particular language style they employ. We also study undecided voters *with* vs. *without* a pre-declared stance on a controversial topic. We find that different combinations of linguistic features are critical for predicting which voters will be persuaded --- either to take a stance (in the case of undecided voters) or to flip their stance (in the case of decided members of the audience);  additionally, we find that user-level factors have more influence on the persuasion of undecided voters than for decided voters.   A final theme has been to investigate moderation effects.  We have developed a methodology for estimating the effect of comment removal on the behavior of the comment’s author from observational data, and explored lexical indicators of perceived fairness of moderation actions, such as deleting a comment.    The project has had several broader impacts. The project has had an impact on the design of mechanisms through which people share information over social media, which is important because improvements in such mechanisms can help mitigate the risks that arise from information-sharing on-line.  The project has also worked to reduce the effects of counter-productive behavior on-line, which can help mitigate the negative effects of anti-social on-line interactions. Through the project, the research team has produced code and datasets that have been shared publicly and in this way have formed the basis for a number of further lines of research by other groups.Graduate students supported by the project have gone on to positions in institutions of higher learning and to the engineering and data-science groups of some of the main companies in the social media space.
