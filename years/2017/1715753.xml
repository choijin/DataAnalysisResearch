<AbstractNarration>1715753&lt;br/&gt;Tabak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator develops a methodology for the explanation of variability in data attributable to known and unknown external factors.  This has applications in all data-intensive fields, including public health, economics, and environmental studies.  It provides a natural tool for personalized medicine, as it can both filter from data the influence of each patient's characteristics, such as age and sex, and particularize the predictions to account for the specifics of each patient.  It also permits the analysis of meteorological data taken at different locations and times and with different instruments, and of unstructured time series depending on known and unknown external factors.  Graduate and postdoctoral students participate in the work of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The problems of amalgamating datasets and removing external factors of variability find a very natural formulation in an extension of the mathematical theory of optimal transport: both problems concern normalizing (i.e. transporting) the original data so that no signal is left that points to the dataset of provenance or the values of the confounding variables.  On the other hand, the transport needs to be optimized, minimizing the removal of variability associated to other sources.  This project extends the theory of optimal transport to handle these problems.  The extensions include problems such as finding the barycenter of a continuum of probability densities of which only a finite amount of samples are known.  Graduate and postdoctoral students participate in the work of the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed a general methodology for estimating outcomes  that depend on factors. Two examples are the effect of a medical  treatment on a patient, which depends on treatment-related factors such  as dosages and on patient-related factors such as age and prior  conditions, and weather forecast, which depends on the time and location  of the desired forecast and on the current global weather conditions.  Denoting  by x the outcome variables and by z the correspoinding factors, the  data available from prior observations consists of a set of pairs (x,  z). The methodology proposed, based on the mathematical theory of  optimal transport, can be summarized as follows. We first perform a map  that eliminates from x the variability attributable to z, yielding a new  variable y, independent of z and with smaller variability than x. For  instance, we may eliminate from a temperature measurement the effect  attributable to the time of the day.

This permits extrapolating measurements perfomed under  heterogeoeous conditions to the specific case for which the estimated  outcome is required. These conditional maps are computed as solutions to the optimal transport barycenter problem.  This project included the following components:  1)  Conceptualizing explanation of variability as an optimal transport  barycenter problem and formulating the problem mathematically.  2)  Extending the optimal transport problem to situations where the data  consists not of probability distributions but of samples thereof, as  provided by the available observations.  3) Developing an effective methodology for solving the problem numerically.  4) Testing the methodology on synthetic and real data.  5)  Extending it to broader scenarios, such as factor discovery, where some  of the factors z are unobserved latent variables.
