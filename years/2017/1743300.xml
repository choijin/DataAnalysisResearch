<AbstractNarration>The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from the dynamics &amp; control, acoustics, and metamaterials communities with the purpose of identifying promising future research directions focusing on the use of dynamical systems and control theory to address problems at the nexus of acoustic metamaterials and system theory. The workshop will be held in Alexandria, Virginia, in October 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acoustics permeates our daily life in far more ways than we normally think, and the related research is far from having achieved maturity. Several emerging concepts hold significant promise for practical application, and have the potential for important societal impact. Progress in these topics would greatly benefit from exposure to, and interaction with, disciplines that traditionally do not focus on acoustics as an application area. The goal of the workshop is to bring together experts from selected, emerging topics in acoustics and metamaterials with researchers from the controls community in order to identify opportunities for collaboration, new research questions, specific needs, and, most of all, promising applications that may be enabled by the control of new properties of acoustic systems. The workshop is expected to define promising investigation areas and their path to application.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The NSF-sponsored workshop on Acoustics: New Fundamentals and Applications. The workshop was held October 25-27, 2017, at the National Science Foundation (NSF) in Alexandria, VA. This single session event included 21 presentations by invited speakers from academia and government, along with 2 breakout sessions devoted to the identification of open research questions, application opportunities, and long-term vision for the field of acoustics. Approximately 50 participants were in attendance and actively participated to discussions during and following the presentations, and to the breakout sessions. Attendees from government agencies included representatives from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Office of Naval Research (ONR), the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), the Airforce Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and Sandia National Laboratory (SNL).     The objective of the workshop was to define the state-of-the-art in a subset of acoustic related areas, and to identify fundamental research needs that would lead to a renewed interest in this area, while providing the stimulus for potential future investment and program solicitations.  In the planning stages, the following were identified as areas of focus:  &bull; metamaterials    &bull; acoustic devices for sensing and manipulation   &bull; thermoacoustic systems, and  &bull; systems and control theory.        The workshop activities led to the following outcomes and observations:  The field of acoustics is extremely broad. Advances and new findings are very likely to continue to engage a significant number of researchers operating both in basic and applied research.   There is renewed need for interdisciplinary interaction that brings together expertise in solid and fluid mechanics, manufacturing, control, system science, material science, physiology, medicine.    There is an ongoing challenge in transferring concepts across the scales. This leads to com- putational and fabrication challenges that are current roadblocks and that need significant advancements in order to promote promising discoveries into engineering applications.    Based on the discussion, there is a grand vision that in a 10-year time frame, researchers will be able to control sound across unprecedented frequency ranges, and scales.    Such ability to manipulate sound is expected to transform our lives in the terms of how we communicate, how computing is done, how drugs are delivered, how we travel and how we interact with our environment.    The pursuit of this vision will require multidisciplinary research and large scale projects that enable interaction of highly diverse teams of investigators.
