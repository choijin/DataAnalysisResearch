<AbstractNarration>This instrument acquisition grant supports purchase of a state-of-the-art Fourier transform infrared spectrometer at Kenyon College. The spectrometer uses infrared waves to study a host of novel materials with potential applications in energy and optoelectronic fields. The research work is performed by undergraduate students in a liberal arts setting. The spectrometer strengthens the research infrastructure at Kenyon College, complementing the existing optical spectroscopic tools on campus. Together, these instruments provide an optical materials characterization facility aimed at serving regional campuses nearby. To enhance educational goals, the principal investigator incorporates experimental activities into existing courses in the curriculum. Additionally, to broaden the interest in sciences, several outreach activities for high school students are initiated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fourier transform infrared spectrometer purchased through this grant covers a wide spectral range, extending into the far-infrared region, and has the ability to perform temperature dependent measurements. The spectrometer allows researchers to explore the physics related to free carriers, phonons, electron-phonon interaction and band phenomena (including band inversion) of solid materials. Research projects enabled by the instrument explore novel materials, including nanocrystals, narrow band gap semiconductors, epitaxial double perovskites films and optoelectronic films. Specifically, the following important issues are addressed: (i) phonon characteristics of nanoparticles are investigated in order to understand how phonon modes are influenced by the nanoparticle geometry; (ii) several narrow band gap semiconductors are examined in order to probe the band inversion characteristics; (iii) evaluating the reflectivity spectra as a function of temperature, systematic studies are performed to explore how phonons influence various properties of epitaxial double perovskites; and (iv) phonon modes and the electron-phonon interaction in optoelectronic films are studied in order to understand their dependence on the quality of films.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The acquisition of a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, using the funds from the NSF award, has impacted both research and teaching at Kenyon College, an exclusive undergraduate liberal arts institute.  During the past decade, several novel materials, which are potential candidates to enhance technological advances as well as to further our understanding of fundamental physics, have been discovered. Extensive experimental techniques need to be developed in order to study these novel materials systematically. The FTIR technique has allowed us to study several novel materials and to gain insights on the physics of these systems more comprehensively.  This FTIR technique allows us to map out the dielectric functions of materials by measuring the reflection from these layers. Using another optical technique called ellipsometry, we were able to extend the spectral range of our measurements. The advantage in determining the dielectric function of a material is that the contributions of free electrons, phonons and bound electrons are stamped on this parameter. Since our measurements were performed at multiple temperatures, by monitoring the temperature-dependence of the dielectric function, we were able to understand how the electron-phonon coupling impacted the characteristics of materials.  After the FTIR-spectrometer was installed at Kenyon College in March of 2018, several undergraduate students have been able to use the instrument to explore interesting projects related various semiconductors, including Hg1-xCdxSe, Bi2(Te1-xSbx)3, Pb1-xSnxSe, Bi2Se3, and hafnium oxide films. The first four systems (i.e., Hg1-xCdxSe, Bi2(Te1-xSbx)3, Pb1-xSnxSe, Bi2Se3) are termed narrow bandgap semiconductors, and hence their optical activity is dictated by electronic transitions that occur in the far-infrared region.
