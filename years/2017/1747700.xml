<AbstractNarration>A region of charge separation, known as the electrical double layer, forms at the surface of most solids that are immersed in an aqueous solution. As the surface of most solids bares a slight charge, ions dissolved in the aqueous solution segregate to the surface to counterbalance this charge.  The ions closest to the surface are in close proximity to the counter charge, and then a secondary layer forms to gradually diffuse the charge formed in this layer.  When an external electric field is applied, these charged particles move in response, in a process known as electrophoresis. Electrophoretic motion can be used to separate and purify macromolecules, as different types of particles have different charges associated with them.  Electrophoresis can be used to identify or isolate target cells or biological compounds for diagnostic purposes. There is growing interest in the application of a nonlinear electric field to manipulate biological particles in microfluidic devices, as well as enabling other separations and material assembly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide travel funds for twelve students to attend and participate in the 2017 Electrophoresis Society Annual Meeting of the American Electrochemical Society in Minneapolis, MN. This meeting unites academic, industry, and government researchers working in all aspects of electrokinetics. The focus of this meeting is on electrokinetics, including subtopics on use in cellular analysis and separation, applicability to particles, drops, adn bubbles, use in microfluidics and other miomolecular analysis, and a number of other topics.  The society is proactively working to increase student participation.  To this end, several activities have been incorporated in this meeting to engage students, including training workshops, an interactive poster session, and a Lunch with Leaders program to facilitate student/faculty interaction.  Students receiving travel awards resulting from this grant will serve as co-chairs for the various technical sessions and contribute to a journal article in Electrophoresis summarizing the meeting.  This opportunity provides a key resource to facilitate student training and professional development.</AbstractNarration>
