<AbstractNarration>This project will study how public officials, regulatory scientists, and concerned publics understand the safety of drinking water supplies over time. This case study will identify insights within knowledge conflicts involving experts, regulators, citizens and scientists about emerging contaminants. It will provide useful lessons for more effective governance of emerging contaminants. The findings of this study will be of interest to policy makers, local and regional governments, community members and scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will examine the case of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) contamination of drinking water. The research will involve interviews, participant observation, and analysis of policy documents. These sources will be used document a history of New York State drinking water policy, to examine how regulators and elected officials have addressed the unknowns about PFOA, and to analyze how affected residents have worked to engage and critique the production of knowledge (and ignorance) by regulatory authorities. This study contributes to a body of social research that illuminates variation in national and regional approaches to chemical regulation. This case study makes a novel contribution by showing how state level policies interact with federal regulatory systems, on one hand, and local-level crises, on the other. Furthermore, the research will attend to theoretical questions about the maintenance of authority in the context of social crisis and scientific unknowns.</AbstractNarration>

Using historical analysis, policy analysis, and discourse analysis, this research examined three questions about the contamination in Hoosick Falls:   1) Why was there no enforceable drinking water standard for PFOA at the federal or state level at the time the contamination came to light? 2) How did residents affected by the contamination work to understand, engage and contest official actions and knowledge production about the contamination? 3) How did state policy makers respond to the contamination and maintain their authority through a crisis of public trust?   That the contamination became apparent in the case of Hoosick Falls, and that a crisis ensued, was in spite, and not as a consequence, of the regular functioning of regulatory systems and cultures. This study found that three primary factors contributed to the absence of federal or state regulation for PFOA in drinking water prior to this crisis. First, the industry produced unseen science, research that was not revealed to regulators or the public for many decades. Second, federal regulatory systems produced incommensurate science, science that is produced at scales, speeds, or in forms that cannot possibly address the scales, speeds or forms of its subject matter. And third, there was a state regulatory culture of minimization and inaction, despite regulators' knowledge of the widespread prevalence of PFOA in surface and wastewater systems water systems across the state. Regulators' public statements and knowledge production about Hoosick Falls generally worked to delimit and minimize the extent of the contamination as well as the appearance of harm.   Hoosick Falls residents and their allies challenged the state's claims about PFOA contamination.

These strategies helped residents share knowledge, contest official statements, gain commitments from officials for funding, infrastructure, and research, and achieve legislative priorities.   The conflict in Hoosick Falls not only challenged the authority of particular officials, it reflected a legitimation crisis in which public trust in regulatory officials and systems, and their ability to protect people from harm, was ruptured. State officials deflected challenges to the regulatory system by using several layered rhetorical, political, legislative, and epistemic strategies. These included: (re)framing the temporal and geographic scale of the crisis, reassigning blame across scale, and preserving the privileged position of industry as necessary for 'progress.'
