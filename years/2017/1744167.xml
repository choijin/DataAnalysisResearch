<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of mathematicians based in the United States in the program "Model Theory, Combinatorics, and Valued Fields" at the Insitut Henri Poincare during the period 8 January 2018 to 6 April 2018.    The program includes four specialized week-long conferences, "Model Theory, Combinatorics, and Valued Fields" at CIRM 8 - 12 January 2018; "Model Theory and Combinatorics" at IHP 29 January 2018 - 2 February 2018; "Model Theory and Valued Fields" at IHP 5 - 9 March 2018; and "Model Theory and Applications" at IHP 26 - 30 March 2018.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main themes of this program are model theory and its applications to combinatorics (including such topics as additive combinatorics, variations of the Szemeredi regularity and density theorems, Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory, NIP theories and tame structures), model theory of valued fields (including such topics as henselian fields, motivic integration, Berkovich spaces, and transseries), and applications of model theory in geometry, analysis and number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details about the program may be found at http://modvac18.math.ens.fr/ .</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported the participation of US-based researchers in the special trimester on Model Theory, Combinatorics, and Valued Fields during the Spring of 2018 at the Institut Henri Poincar&eacute; in Paris.     The trimester included three major week-long conferences, on Model theory and combinatorics, Model theory of valued fields, and Model theory and applications.  During the other weeks of the trimester, there were lecture series, seminar presentations, and working groups on topics under the umbrella of model theory, combinatorics, and valued fields.   This grant supported the collaboative research work carried out during the trimester.  Some highlights of the results produced or presented during the trimester include the stable regularity theorems for groups of Conant-Pillay-Terry, the Bays-Breuillard higher dimensional Elekes-Szab&oacute; theorem, and the work of Peterzil-Starchenko on o-minimal homogeneous dynamics.      This project directly supported the participation of thirty researchers.  Of these people, many were students or early career researchers and the supported researchers were associated with a wide range of academic institutions.  In this way, this project has broaded access to high level research mathematics and has strengthened the training of the future cadre of reseach mathematicians in the United States.   Details about the program may be found at http://www.ihp.fr/en/CEB/T1-2018 and http://modvac18.math.ens.fr/ .          Last Modified: 04/23/2019       Submitted by: Thomas W Scanlon]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
