<AbstractNarration>1726216 Michelsen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to request partial support for the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Laser Diagnostics in Combustion. The meeting will be held at West Dover, Vermont, August 5 to 11, 2017. The requested fund will be used for supporting students and postdocs who will attend the meetings. Particularly, the GRS is specifically aimed at young scientists. The meeting will be focused on the most recent scientific advances in optical diagnostics and their demonstrated or expected impact, in addition to diagnostic needs. Topics will include precise and accurate measurements of fluid motion and temperature, chemical composition, and transient and multi-phase phenomena under a wide range of conditions, including high pressure. The 2017 program also includes discussion of combustion diagnostics relevant to atmospheric emissions and impact of combustion on air quality and climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combustion is responsible for providing the majority of global energy needs but generating a large fraction of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gases. Combustion processes are complex in that they involve multiphase, chemically reacting flows at high temperatures. Combustion diagnostics requires advanced instrumentation and scientific knowledge. This conference will bring together scientists and engineers with a strong interest in laser-based combustion diagnostics to discuss current approaches, latest developments, promising opportunities, and unaddressed needs for measurement techniques for probing combustion processes. This conference is unique because it is not focused on reviewing previous research; instead it highlights novel, bold, and often controversial advances of today and tomorrow. This conference will contribute significantly to the understanding of the state-of-the-art technology in laser diagnostics in combustion.</AbstractNarration>
