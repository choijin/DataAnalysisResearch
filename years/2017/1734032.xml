<AbstractNarration>In the study of planets around other stars, telescopic observations called radial velocity measurements are needed for two reasons:  First, these observations are one of the best methods for finding planets that are located very close to their stars.  Second, for planets that move in front of their stars in their orbits, these observations tell astronomers the weight of the planets. The Third Workshop on Extremely Precise Radial Velocities will bring together 150 - 200 astronomers, engineers, and mathematicians to discuss ways to improve instruments and computing methods so that they can find and study the smallest Earth-like planets around other stars. This conference will serve the national interest by promoting the progress of science when successes, challenges, and plans to improve the precision of the telescopic observations needed to find these Earth-like planets are discussed and shared. The conference will last four days, and have talks and posters mixed with group discussions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator requests support for a conference entitled "The Third Workshop on Extremely Precise Radial Velocities (EPRV III)."  This international workshop will emphasize the discipline of extremely precise (&lt;1 m/s) Doppler velocimetry of stars, focusing on specific challenges toward achieving the 10 cm/s radial velocity precision needed to detect and characterize Earth analogs around G and K dwarf stars.  The conference will assemble 150 to 200 instrument team participants, including observational and theoretical astronomers, statisticians, engineers, practitioners in high performance computing, heliophysicists, and others bridging these categories. The participants will address the significant hardware challenges specific to building EPRV instruments, the successes and lessons learned from the latest generation of EPRV instrumentation, new statistical and computational methods for signal extraction, analysis and jitter mitigation, and physical models and spectral diagnostics of stellar granulation and other sources of jitter.  One planned outcome is a white paper directed at the role of EPRV instruments for the upcoming astronomy and astrophysics Decadal Survey. The conference is planned to last four days and will consist of invited plenary talks with time allocated for discussion between talks, breakout sessions on more specialized topics, and posters that will be displayed for the entire meeting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Third Worshop on Extremely Precise Radial Velocities (EPRVIII) was held 14-17 August, 2017 in State College, Pennsylvania.  This international conference addressed the technical challenges in the special area of extremely precise (&lt; 1 meter per second) measurements of motions of stars, as used to discover and characterize exoplanets.  This award provided travel support and registration fee waivers that allowed several key participants to attend, and covered many of the costs of the conference that kept the registration fee low. It also provided funds for on-site child care for participants. The success of the conference is the primary outcome of this award.  Two primary outcomes of the conference are publications describing it.  The first is a Research Note of the American Astronomical Society (RNAAS 1, 51, doi:10.3847/2515-5172/aaa12e) describing its format, session chairs, content, and a table listing the 23 new precise Doppler instruments that were presented at the conference.  The second is a manuscript (still in preparation as of this writing but nearly complete) to be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal describing the outcome of the EPRVIII Evidence Challenge, where nine research groups attending the workshop computed evidence and Bayes factors for simulated radial velocity data sets.  These calculations are common ways to quantify the stastistical significance of purported discoveries of exoplanets, and the EPRVIII Evidence Challange provided an important validation and cross-check of different approaches to performing these calculations.
