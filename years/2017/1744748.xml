<AbstractNarration>This award funds Student Travel Fellowships for US students attending a workshop on the intersection of Security and Privacy with Computer Vision at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR). It helps cover the travel expenses and conference registration fees for these students, making it possible for them to attend the workshop and the conference, and to discuss their work or recent advances in the field with other attendees of the workshop or conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop brings together privacy, security and computer vision experts to discuss how to better understand the potential threats of computer vision to people's security and privacy, as well as the potential opportunities and applications for enhancing them.  The workshop also helps spark interest among young researchers in the important emerging intersection between privacy and security and computer vision.</AbstractNarration>
