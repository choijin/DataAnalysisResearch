<AbstractNarration>This award supports a linguistic anthropological investigation into the relationship between language proficiency and women's economic and social empowerment in multi-language environments. Social scientists have found that even when women have increased access to education and economic opportunities, their mobility may be limited. They may be held back not only by general social and cultural norms but also more particularly by the lack of access to key mobility infrastructures, such as the ability to communicate in a world language, that these norms produce. Without these language skills, they are unable to reach their full potential in globalized economies. This project will look at how women negotiate multi-language situations and under what conditions they are successful in obtaining world language competencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) because it provides a super-diverse multinational setting where English is the crucial conduit for communication and business transactions.  The research will be conducted by University of Texas anthropology doctoral student Deina A. Rabie, who is supervised by linguistic anthropologist Dr. Elizabeth L. Keating. Rabie will collect data in domestic, social, educational, and commercial settings, including daily market and service transactions, formal corporate contexts of international business and communication, family gatherings, religious meetings, and classrooms. She will sample and analyze naturally occurring speech; conduct semi-structured interviews; carry out linguistic, spatial, and sonic mappings; analyze relevant media; and consult materials collected in the national oral history of the National Archives of the United Arab Emirates. Findings from this research will contribute to theorizing new dimensions of gender in globalized contexts.</AbstractNarration>

Emiratis, the UAE?s 15% native minority, have elite status as its only citizens and recipients of welfare subsidies from oil income. Since the creation of the UAE nation state in 1971, these welfare benefits from oil income have been channeled to families solely through Emirati men, who have also been the primary beneficiaries of growth in state employment while holding only secondary school diplomas. Prior to fieldwork, the researcher hypothesized that as oil welfare subsidies channeled to male family members have begun to decrease amid a shifting post-oil company, Emirati women have had a greater stake in pursuing the country?s English-medium higher education to gain positions in corporate multinationals alongside Emirati men and other expatriates. Through ethnographic and linguistic research methods, the researcher used her fieldwork tenure to examine the types of mobility English-mediated modes of circulation--or linguistic infrastructures--especially in the domains of higher education, the work place, and media, enable for Emirati women and the implications of such mobility on relational and gender ideologies in domestic, social, and professional domains.   Rabie?s Emirati female interlocutors were employed at educational and corporate multinationals and ranged in age from twenty-two to forty-five years old.

However, older participants demonstrated compartmentalized usage of English as the language of the workplace and their professional lives while maintaining distinct and segregated lives with extended patriarchal family networks where Arabic is the dominant language of interaction and religious practice. Younger interlocutors exhibited a more fluid relationship with the language and its attendant social networks, identifying as fluent or bilingual in English.
