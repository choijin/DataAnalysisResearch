<AbstractNarration>The understanding and eventual control of complicated phenomena is a primary goal of scientific research.  "Universality" refers to robustness of certain phenomena and to the counterintuitive prevalence of the same phenomena across a wide array of different physical situations and models.  For example, waves in the ocean can organize themselves into "trains" transporting energy, and analogous trains are also observed in laser beams propagating in optical fibers;  statistical fluctuations in nuclear experiments led to a new type of universality that subsequently has been observed in a wide variety of situations modeled with randomness, as far-flung as the statistics of spacings between parked cars!  This research project involves the detailed rigorous analysis of canonical models for a wide variety of physical settings whose singular behavior is a guide for the understanding of some complicated phenomena in nature.  The project aims to develop methods to understand, predict, and control system behavior.  The potential long-term impacts of this research program stem from the emergence of universality as a new paradigm in science: probing its range of applicability is fundamental in emerging areas as well as established ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project concerns the development of new methods for the asymptotic analysis of Riemann-Hilbert problems and d-bar problems and application of these techniques to problems in a range of fields including random matrix theory, nonlinear partial differential equations, orthogonal polynomials, and asymptotic combinatorics.  In each of these areas, the overarching goal is to provide a complete description of the system (be it the eigenvalues of a random matrix, or the solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation).  Two examples under study are: (1) Eigenvalue statistics in the normal matrix model. The quest for universal behavior when the eigenvalues are accumulating in a two-dimensional region is in its infancy; this project aims to create connections between rigorous mathematical analysis and physical intuition developed over the last 20 years. (2) The asymptotic behavior of the partition function in the two-cut regime, for which ideas and conjectural formulae have existed for some time.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of McLaughlin's research is to discover and completely understand phenomena arising in nonlinear systems - outside the scope of what can be expalined by existing mathematics and physics.  He studies violent oscillations in solutions of nonlinear partial differenatial equations, and the behavior of matrices (and related quantities)  in the presence of randomness.   The equations McLaughlin studies are used to model the evolution of fluid interfaces in idealized situations, as well as the evolution of laser pulses as they propagate down fiber optic networks in theoretical communications systems of the future.  The random matrices that McLaughln studies are used in practice to model many, many different situations in which our access to data is limited by noise and randomness.  The work supported by this funding has created new analytical and computational techniques that have helped McLaughlin and collaborators discover new features of the mathematical models which they have studied, leading to 9 new reseaerch publications, and 3 doctoral theses over the period of the award.   The questions of analysis and computation which McLaughlin and collaborators consider are quite fundamental, and this is the primary source of intellectual merit of therse activities:  The methods are applicable to a large collection of physically natural settings.  In addition, the research has extended the reach of universality as a new paradigm in nonlinear science: new universality classes are critical in emerging statistical areas as well as established ones.  The broader impacts of McLaughlin's work includes (1) the development of explicit computational and asymptotic approximations may yield applications in the broad field of inverse problems, which helps scientists create images from data (as in medical imaging, as well as in the defense industries). and (2) McLaughlin has supervised 2 postdoctoral researchers and 3 graudate students (who completed their PhDs during the award period), contributing to a skilled workforce for the future.
