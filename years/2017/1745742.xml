<AbstractNarration>This is an NSF support for increasing the diversity of speakers and enhancing student participation at the 11th International Symposium on Semiconductor Light Emitting Devices (ISSLED). The ISSLED is a specialized biannual international meeting covering current challenges in semiconductor light emitting devices. This year meeting will be in Banff (Canada). The ISSLED and the LED research community as a whole stands to benefit from an increase in the invited speakers and attendees at the symposium that are underrepresented minorities. &lt;br/&gt;The ISSLED Symposium is a specialized biannual international meeting covering current challenges in semiconductor light emitting devices. The participants are researchers from academia, national institutes, and industry and travel from all parts of the world. To continue this trend, speakers are invited from various research fields and ethnic/cultural backgrounds in an effort to improve the diversity of symposium attendees. A great deal of attention is given to involve students and young researcher who are just beginning their research careers.&lt;br/&gt;The funds will enable the organizers to offer travel support for invited speakers who are underrepresented minorities in the LED device research community. The technical program will provide student participants the opportunity to gain exposure to new materials and devices, their basic physics, and their engineering applications.</AbstractNarration>
