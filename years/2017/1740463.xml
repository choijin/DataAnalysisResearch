<AbstractNarration>1740463&lt;br/&gt;Clark&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presently, less than 1% of all the water on earth is freshwater readily available for human use.  With increased human activities resulting in water contamination from industrial effluent, urban runoff, contaminated spills, and wastewater treatment discharges, there is a need for the development of more innovative and feasible solutions to provide sustainable methods to treat various types of contaminated water sources. This proposal seeks to develop controlled release biodegradable polymers for treatment of surface water, groundwater, and wastewater systems. The polymers will treat contaminated waters without the need for external power, equipment, or additional chemicals while only producing minimal biodegradable by-products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused on the fundamental understanding of controlled release chemical-oxidant polymers to treat various source waters. Furthermore, new oxidants will be investigated for their ability to improve and optimize this treatment delivery mechanism. The ease of implementation would be transformative for those who maintain water quality in the fields of engineering, water resources, sustainability, environmental science, and public health. The proposed research plan explores both disinfection of microorganisms and oxidation of contaminants collected in the state of Florida. The development of the controlled release biodegradable polymer will be based on a patent developed by the Co-PI and modified for treatment of physical, chemical, and biological contamination of water sources. The novelty of this method is not only in sustainable remediation and treatment of various water contaminants; but also adding to the knowledge base to provide a more comprehensive understanding of oxidant release in water treatment. The research will be a collaboration between two leading Historically Black College &amp; Universities (HBCUs), Florida AM University and North Carolina A&amp;T, and run by students and faculty from groups traditionally underrepresented in the engineering research field. The proposed work will not only support graduate students who are traditionally underrepresented in the STEM fields, especially engineering, but it would also provide opportunity to help inspire undergraduates to purse both graduate studies and careers in these fields.</AbstractNarration>

The project supported two African American females from North Carolina A&amp;T State University, one progressed from undergraduate to graduate work in engineering; the other published one peer-reviewed publication on the research topic, and has at least two more prepared submission, and will graduate with her Doctorate in Environmental Engineering in Summer 2021 from Florida A&amp;M University.  In addition, six other URM Doctoral students from Florida A&amp;M University were provided some funding support to continue research on different aspects of this project at that campus.  Overall, the project was successful in adding knowledge to the field of Environmental Engineering, as evidenced by the article publication and pending submissions with regards to the technical work of the research.  In addition, the project also broadened participation in Engineering by supporting approximately eight URM Doctoral students who are all on schedule to graduate before the end of 2023.
