<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate emergent community actions to prepare and respond to Hurricane Harvey and to explore the ability of groups to choose different strategies in reacting to a disaster. By studying how and when people engage in evolving instances of collective actions, the project will document the behavior of people in disasters, what tools and technologies are being used, who becomes neglected during a disaster and how this marginalization happens. The project will also train graduate students in qualitative research methods and community engagement. Research findings will be of interest to policymakers at the local and federal levels, scholars and communities preparing for or responding to disaster.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This rapid proposal will use auto-ethnography and participatory action research to interview, observe and collect data from homeland security institutions, citizen responders and affected publics. Findings will be co-constructed by the two PIs in consort with a variety of participants that are either affected by response and recovery, or engaged in preparing, responding or studying it. Interview, observational, and other data will be analyzed both individually and collaboratively using the traditions of autoethnography and participatory action research. The research will study the homeland security regimes that include socio-technical outlets,security technology infrastructures and the relations between community swarming and expertise.  A question central to the project is how do processes and structures of security regimes marginalize people in evolving disaster contexts. The findings from the empirical work will problematize how preparedness, response, and resilience may exacerbate social marginalization in disaster. In addition, the findings will be of interest to policymakers using practice-centric approaches wanting to broaden their work through theoretical, humanistic, and critical lenses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have an active and ongoing engagement with Charity Productions, a grassroots activist organization targeted to mitigating disaster impacts for Black populations in Houston, Texas as well as with CrowdSource Rescue (CSR), an organization that emerged after Harvey whereby its creators designed an application designed to help connect people needing rescue with those who had watercraft in the immediate aftermath.

It has also worked to influence Texas State policy, in the form of a law passed to help those who volunteer during disaster to avoid litigation.   At the grass root level, Magdalena Denhamâ€™s work on the grant helped contribute to disaster mitigation in terms of land use in the River Parish community of North Houston, an area highly impacted by Harvey. Instead of the sale of land for commercial construction (200 homes), the owner of the golf course section lost litigation and is compelled to sell it as imminent domain to our MUD/community for greenbelt.  She also engaged informal educational talks with community members since Harvey on risks related to building in watershed zones in order to support community action.  Further, the book Natalie Baker is set to publish in 2020 is intended for global audiences that include both academics and interested members of the public. This will have a wide, international reach and is intended to transform the course of research in the area of disasters, both in terms of scientific understandings as well as practice on the ground.
