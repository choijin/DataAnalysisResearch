<AbstractNarration>The Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing will organize three workshops at UC Berkeley as part of the Simons Institute program on The Brain and Computation. The conceptual affinity between the brain and the computer dates back to the mid-20th century, as the pioneering theoreticians of both fields (von Neumann, Turing, McCulloch, Pitts, Barlow) were beginning to leverage their interests in the other field to gain a better understanding of their own. Both fields have exploded in the past decades in terms of new knowledge, methodology, and prestige. But as they have become more technical and sophisticated, they have also grown further apart. These workshops aim to rekindle the affinity between these two fields, recognizing the enormous potential for what could be achieved in a unified research effort. They will bring together groups of outstanding researchers in both Brain Science and Theoretical Computer Science to attack some of the most important current problems in Brain Science that particularly require joint scrutiny and collaboration: Representation, Coding, and Computation in Neural Circuits; Targeted Discovery in Brain Data; and Computational Theories of the Brain.  Each of the three workshops will bring together a group of outstanding researchers in both Brain Science and Theoretical Computer Science. These workshops will be open to all potential participants, and video recordings of presentations will be distributed to the public for comment and engagement. The organizers will welcome students to attend the workshop, and will actively recruit scientists from a diversity of backgrounds to participate.</AbstractNarration>

The program brought together an international, highly distinguished group of investigators spanning four main disciplines:  1. Experimental neuroscientists who either record directly from neurons in the brain or conduct behavioral experiments including non-invasive physiological studies such as EEG and fMRI. This group was in the minority since it is difficult for laboratory scientists be away from their labs for an extended period of time.  2. Computational neuroscientists who aim to develop mathematical and computational models of brain function. This group is already quite multidisciplinary in itself and constituted the majority of participants.  3. Theoretical computer scientists who develop algorithms and formal theories for what can be computed and the complexity of computation. This group constituted roughly 1/4 of the group.  4. Engineers who build devices, especially those inspired by neural computation in the brain (e.g., neuromorphic engineering). This group was a small minority.  In addition to the investigators, there were numerous students and postdocs who accompanied their advisors, in addition to the Simons-Berkeley Research Fellows.  The main activities of the program consisted of the boot camp, three NSF-funded thematic workshops, and special interest group discussions held throughout the term. The goals of each of the NSF-funded workshops are presented here:  Workshop 1 (Representation, Coding and Computation in Neural Circuits): The aim of this workshop was to shed light, at the level of cortical circuits, on issues of representation and coding such as sparsity and high-dimensionality, spikes and coding capacity in the presence of noise. It also addressed questions related to how neurons compute: the role of dendritic nonlinearities and clustered plasticity, recurrent circuits, excitatory-inhibitory balance and models of cooperative computation (as opposed to single neuron computation).  Workshop 2 (Targeted Discovery in Brain Data): This workshop focused on the problem of inferring structure from neuroscience data, including the following specific themes:  Algorithms to help collect and analyze data; Finding low-dimensional or sparse structure in data using techniques from machine learning; Algorithms for data fusion, i.e., how to combine and integrate data from different sources and scales; Algebraic topological methods for neuroscience data.   Workshop 3 (Computational Theories of the Brain): This workshop&#8203; &#8203;was about general computational principles &#8203;for &#8203;networks of neurons that help us understand experimental data, about principles that enable us to reproduce aspects of the brain's astounding computational capability in models and neuromorphic hardware, and about the connections between computational neuroscience and machine learning.
