<AbstractNarration>This project aims to examine the disparate records of past fire activity as a means to improve the understanding of variation in fire activity over time and climatic conditions. Wildfires have a large influence on regional and global climate change. Fires affect carbon storage, biogeochemical cycling, local hydrology, land albedo, ocean fertilization, and emissions of radiatively important gases and aerosols. Deposition of fire black carbon (BC) on snow and ice covered surfaces, for example, decreases albedo and leads to snow- and ice-melt, further loss of albedo, and subsequent warming. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the importance of fires to the earth-atmosphere system, knowledge of past fire activity is relatively scant. Ice-core records of carbon monoxide (CO) and BC in Antarctic ice cores do not show consistent trends over the last150 years, while trends in charcoal records and ice-core BC are sometimes at odds over longer timescales. Charcoal and BC records from the last glacial period reveal large variations tied to Dansgaard/Oeschger (D-O) events, but the climate implications of these variations are unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first phase of the project involves the rigorous validation of a 250-year simulation of wildfire activity and climate feedbacks since 1750.  After gaining confidence in model performance, the researchers will simulate wildfire activity and subsequent radiative forcing during selected phases of an idealized D-O event.  The second phase of the project includes analyzing the variability in BC size distributions as a potential marker of BC sources and transport processes in existing ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives of the project are: 1) Validate model simulations of wildfire activity in the last glacial and preindustrial eras; 2) Quantify the impacts of wildfires on regional and global climate on glacial-to-interglacial and preindustrial-to-present-day timescales. The researchers aim to calculate the effects of changing fires on aerosol radiative forcing, snow/ice albedo effects, ocean fertilization, and the atmospheric oxidative capacity; and 3) Examine observed trends in BC particle size in the ice core record to assess changes in transport processes and hence large-scale meteorological processes over abrupt climate change during the glacial period.   The main tool for this analysis will be the Ice-age Chemistry And Proxies (ICECAP) model, which was developed with prior NSF funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential broader impacts include an enhanced understanding of fire activity in warm climates to help reduce uncertainties in future climate trajectory predictions. The project will support high school teachers during two summers at Harvard through the NSF Research Experience for Teachers (RET).  Participants in RET will develop a hands-on curriculum on wildfires and climate. The project will also support a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow.</AbstractNarration>

In our research, we have taken advantage of the aerosol record in ice cores to better understand the drivers of abrupt climate shifts and fire activity in the past.</p> <p>&nbsp;<strong>Intellectual merit.</strong></p> <p>We examined high-resolution ice core proxies of wildfire activity during two very different past climate periods: (A) Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events during the last glacial period, and (B) preindustrial to the present day (1750 to 2000 CE).

We also applied models to interpret the observed trends and variability of aerosols in the ice-core record.</p> <p>In Liu et al. (in review), we examined BC records in 14 Antarctic ice cores and one central Andean ice core, which suggested that historical fire activity in the Southern Hemisphere significantly exceeded present-day levels. This finding challenges the conventional view that fire activity during the preindustrial era was less than that of the present-day. To understand this observation, we used a global fire model to show that fire emissions in the Southern Hemisphere could have declined by 30% over the 20th century, possibly because of the rapid expansion of land use for agriculture and animal production. &nbsp;Radiative forcing calculations suggest that the decreasing trend in Southern Hemisphere fire emissions over the last century largely compensated for the cooling effect of increasing aerosols from fossil fuel and biofuel sources. Our results show that improved estimates of biomass burning emissions during the preindustrial era reduce the magnitude of aerosol climate forcing in the Southern Hemisphere from the preindustrial to the present-day.</p> <p>In ongoing work examining aerosol variability during D-O events, we find that changes in the particle concentration and particle between warm and cold D-O stages are the result of changes in transport, not emissions as might be expected. Preliminary work using positive matrix factorization reveals the evolution of aerosol sources during abrupt climate shifts.</p> <p><strong>Broader impacts. <br /></strong></p> <p>Accurate estimates of aerosol radiative forcing are crucial for better understanding the transient climate response and equilibrium climate sensitivity of increasing CO<sub>2</sub>, and lead to more accurate projection of climate change. Negative aerosol radiative forcing can, in part, cancel out positive forcing from increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and contribute to uncertainty in total radiative forcing. Our research shows that the SH aerosol burden increased less than thought from the preindustrial to the present, implying less cooling from aerosol trends. Thus, in an effort to reproduce historical temperature trends, climate models may overestimate the transient climate response and equilibrium climate sensitivity.</p> <p>In addition, our ongoing work on aerosol variations during D-O events promises to enhance understanding of the drivers of abrupt climate change.
