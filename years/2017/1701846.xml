<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;Proteins and nucleic acids often act like small machines, carrying out functions in the cell such as the synthesis of additional molecules, communication/'signaling' among systems in the cell, and locomotion.  Such functions typically involve significant changes to the shapes of the molecules.  Computer simulation methodology for studying such molecular motions will be developed in the current project.  The new methodology will combine advances in software and hardware.  For example, new software is being developed to exploit the 99.9% of computer memory that goes unused in typical current simulations.  The importance of this type of research can be understood in terms of biomolecular timescales: although cutting-edge simulations on special computers today can reach the microsecond scale or even beyond for small systems, it is widely appreciated that key biochemical phenomena occur at timescales of even seconds and longer - that is, one million times longer than computational capacity.  Until this computing gap is bridged, it will be extremely difficult to systematically study the full range of biomolecular motions which keep cells working.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;Besides research, the proposal targets science pedagogy in two ways.  First, the principal investigator will prepare a significantly expanded second edition of his textbook, Statistical Physics of Biomolecules: An Introduction.  This book is written for modern interdisciplinary graduate students (e.g., in biophysics or computational biology) who come from diverse semi-quantitative backgrounds.  It explains the physical principles underlying biomolecular behavior.  Second, the principal investigator will target a significant deficiency in modern science education: science writing.  A new course and auxiliary web materials will be developed, geared toward modern students saturated with "new media".  The complexities of today's world demand that science writing should be both informative and appealing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Despite the widely known advances in computing hardware, including the availability of supercomputers, most biomolecular simulations of interest to scientists remain out of reach.  Current computers simply aren?t powerful enough.    What systems are of interest?  Much of the work of the cell is carried out by protein "machines" which participate in processes such as sensing, signaling, and transport.  Although such processes typically require less than a second to occur, and sometimes less than a millisecond, molecular dynamics computer simulations can only reach the microsecond timescale for most systems of interest.  That is, simulation of the true biological behavior would require a thousand to a million times more computing!  The project "Complementary Methods for Equilibrium Sampling of Biomolecules" was aimed at breaking through this barrier - at permitting simulations of processes that could not previously be performed - using advanced algorithms.  The main research goal was to use physics-based algorithms to develop accelerated simulation methods.  The project was a significant success, leading to advances in simulations, analysis methods, biophysical understanding of protein behavior, and to the development of an online cell biophysics book.  Most notably, the principal investigator and coworkers were able to push the limits of sampling.  They relied primarily on the "weighted ensemble" (WE) strategy for orchestrating a large number of parallel simulations which can exchange information and leads to pruning or replication of simulations.  The pruning and replication processes can lead to significant performance improvements compared to ordinary parallel simulation by enabling estimation of critical quantities using much less computing time.  Project scientists were able to apply this technology at the molecular scale (calculating the time for protein-ligand association), at the cell-scale (calculating the probability for neurotransmitter vesicle release at a neuromuscular junction under low-calcium conditions), and to viruses (calculating mechanisms for the final stages of capsid assembly).  These are just some examples of research supported by the project.  The project also supported critical research into what can be termed the "theory of simulation."  That is, once raw simulation data is obtained, how should it be analyzed to generate physically meaningful quantities comparable to what can be measured in the laboratory?  Project scientists showed that conventional analyses based on "Markov models" can lead to significant bias, but that the bias can be corrected by more fundamental non-Markovian analyses.  Originally developed to analyze WE data, the non-Markov approach applies equally to data generated by more conventional simulations.  Project scientists also investigated the biophysical mechanism of ATP synthesis.  Called the fuel of the cell because it stores so much free energy, ATP is synthesized by a rather elaborate Rube Goldberg-like process although simpler pathways are available.  The investigators undertook a comparison of a wide array of synthesis mechanisms and showed that the process used in the cell leads to faster synthesis, particularly under conditions where there is only a small amount of excess free energy available.  Last but not least, the project supported the developed of a free online cell biophysics textbook, "Physical Lens on the Cell" (website: PhysicalLensOnTheCell.org) geared toward advancing interdisciplinary education.  Designed and written by the principal investigator, the site covers material at the interface of cell biology and physics/physical chemistry.  Geared toward the advanced-undergraduate level, the site is suitable for students and scientists from either field and is unique in focusing on elementary chemical physics (physical chemistry) that can be used to understand a wide variety of cell biology phenomena, ranging from transport of molecules into and out of the cell or organelles to the mechanism by which the cell reduces errors when reading from mRNA to synthesize proteins.  Dozens of pedagogical sections are already part of the site.  In sum, the project led to a substantive body of research advancing computing methodology and biophysical understanding, in addition to a timely addition to interdisciplinary education.
