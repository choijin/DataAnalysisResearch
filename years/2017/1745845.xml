<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop a new approach for Additive Manufacturing (AM) of objects made from ceramics, metals, and polymers. Developed a generation ago, AM had the potential to transform the design and manufacture of products. However, legacy AM approaches have failed primarily because of the high cost of inputs, and because output lacks precision, quality and durability. Our proposed approach has broad industry potential. The broader societal impact is to change the entire competitive stance of US manufacturing by revolutionizing industrial design and enhancing local manufacturing. This project has the potential to advance science and the prosperity of US manufacturing industries. Its commercial impact may span industries from product design to aerospace, space, defense, and human health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the integrated production of objects made from ceramics, metals, and polymers additively at room temperature from stock inputs such as rods and discs. Over 95% of metallic AM output today uses metallic powders as inputs. These inputs are costly, explosive, and harmful to human health if ingested. Furthermore, current AM output suffers from imprecision, poor quality, inconsistency, and lack of durability. Additionally, legacy Metallic AM platforms are large, expensive, operate at high temperatures, and are isolated from the engineers who rely on them. The key objectives of this project are (1) to demonstrate the feasibility of a room-temperature fabrication approach and (2) to achieve several crucial milestones involving the precision of location, thickness, strength, uniformity and reliability of AM output.</AbstractNarration>

The field of metal and ceramic based 3d printing has been lagging behind significantly other than a few notable sucesses in aerospace and prosthetic applications. The cost of powders and the lasers used in these powder based machines make extrememly expensive for most small and medium businesses and limits innovation as well as large scale adoption of 3d metal and ceramic based printing for production uses. Hence current machines are mainly employed by either large corporations or in centres where resources can be pooled.  As part of the NSF SBIR Phase 1 grant Obsidian moved away from using powders and high power lasers and instead used standard wire feedstock from industrial suppliers and off the shelf power supplies to demonstrate the ability to print both highly refractory materials like titanium as well as common industrial materials like copper and aluminium.  The second major outcome was the ability to print both metals and ceramics using the same printhead which will be agame changer for a number of industries including satellites and antennas (including but limited to 5G) , direct printing of small satellites (cubesats and nanosats), sensors in high temperature, high pressure and high stress environments. In particular, since ceramics are printed without the use of powders, the shrinkage that happens during the sintering process is avoided.  Another important outcome was the ability to change the rate of material deposition by changing the power source from either DC or AC to a Radiofrequency one since for some applications like the spiral antenna ( as shown in the image) we require a slow and steady deposition but for printing a waveguide as faster deposition is required in which case we can use a Radiofrequency source.   The initial demonstrations generated enough interest that a number of private customers and federal agencies asked us about the availability of a beta version of the printer which according to our current estimates is about three quarters away.
