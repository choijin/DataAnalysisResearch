<AbstractNarration>Multilingualism is increasingly important in our diverse society, although relatively little is known about what makes someone a 'good' second language learner. While children acquire language with relative ease, adults show persistent difficulty becoming proficient in a second language. It has been hypothesized that individuals with increased cognitive abilities are better able to process and comprehend language, suggesting that individual differences in cognitive abilities may be related to successful language processing. This dissertation uses electroencephalography (EEG) to examine how individual differences in cognitive abilities influence second language comprehension, focusing on how native English speakers and Chinese-speaking learners of English comprehend complex sentences in real time. Using the brain imaging technique EEG to examine the processing of a second language has the potential to advance our understanding of the extent to which the brain is able to reorganize itself to accommodate a new language in adulthood. Thus, this project holds promise for providing new insights regarding the nature of brain plasticity more broadly.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project examines the extent to which processing in native and non-native speakers is qualitatively similar, testing the predictions of alternative theories in language learning and language processing. When a participant reads a sentence like "I wonder who the editor interviewed Dave with," they must search for the position in the sentence from which the word "who" originated, a relationship that is referred to as a wh- dependency. Participants will read sentences such as these as their brain activity is recorded using EEG in order to track the processing of the wh- dependency throughout the sentence. The project examines the extent to which the processing of wh-dependencies in both learners and native speakers involves predicting parts of the structure that have not yet been encountered and whether both groups only attempt to complete the dependency in positions in the sentence that the grammar allows. All participants will also be assessed on a battery of cognitive tests, in order to determine how individual differences in cognitive abilities impact native and non-native processing. Using EEG allows for an examination of whether natives and learners use qualitatively similar processing mechanisms and whether processing unfolds on a similar time-course, providing a more precise comparison between the two populations and shedding new light on the possibilities and limitations of adult second language (L2) acquisition.</AbstractNarration>

Specifically, this project investigated how Chinese-speaking learners of English comprehend highly complex English sentences, and compared second language learners&rsquo; performance with native English speakers. By comparing how native and non-native speakers comprehend difficult sentences in real-time using the brain-imaging technique electroencephalography (EEG), this project examined whether natives and learners use qualitatively similar processing mechanisms and whether processing unfolds on a similar time-course, providing a precise comparison between the two populations and shedding new light on the possibilities and limitations of adult second language (L2) acquisition.</p> <p>This study examined the processing of <em>wh</em>-dependencies, which involve a long-distance relationship between a fronted <em>wh</em>-word (e.g., <em>who</em>) and the position in the sentence where it originated, called a gap site. When reading a sentence like (1b), a reader must search for the part of the sentence that links to the word &lsquo;who&rsquo;. Upon reading the word &lsquo;interviewed&rsquo;, a reader may initially expect that &lsquo;who&rsquo; plays the role of the interviewee, a process referred to as prediction. However, upon reading &lsquo;Dave&rsquo;, the reader must reconsider this analysis to correctly link &lsquo;who&rsquo; and &lsquo;with&rsquo; and to analyze &lsquo;Dave&rsquo; as the interviewee. The second type of sentence in this experiment involves a different linking process. In the sentence (1d), the word &lsquo;that&rsquo; following &lsquo;the editor&rsquo; signals that it is grammatically impossible for &lsquo;who&rsquo; to play the role of the interviewee. If a reader&rsquo;s grammar guides their processing of the sentence, they should never attempt to link &lsquo;who&rsquo; with &lsquo;interviewed&rsquo;. By tracking readers&rsquo; brain activity across sentences such as (1a-d), this experiment examined whether adult L2 learners processed these sentences differently from native speakers, testing whether learners attempted to link words like &lsquo;who&rsquo; at ungrammatical positions.

For example, native English speakers (N=79) showed evidence of a prediction-related brain response, known as the N400, at multiple positions across the sentence, indicating that the search for the site of <em>wh</em>-dependency resolution involves an active prediction process. In contrast, the Mandarin Chinese-speaking L2 English learners (N=36) did not yield an N400 response at these same regions, suggesting that they did not engage in prediction similarly to native speakers.

In contrast, native English speakers showed evidence of attempting to link the <em>wh</em>-item &lsquo;who&rsquo; within the relative clause in (1d), yielding an N400 response. This suggested that natives engaged in prediction in an ungrammatical position, although there were individual differences in how native English speakers processed these sentences, which varied based on their scores on a number Stroop test measuring the cognitive resource &lsquo;attentional control&rsquo;. Specifically, native speakers with greater attentional control resources showed greater prediction effects in a grammatical position (&lsquo;Dave&rsquo; in 1b), whereas higher attentional control was associated with smaller prediction effects in the ungrammatical position in the relative clause (&lsquo;Dave&rsquo; in 1d).</p> <p>Finally, we examined native and non-native processing at the actual gap site in the sentence, where the <em>wh</em>-dependency can be resolved (e.g., &lsquo;with&rsquo; in 1a-b, &lsquo;kissed&rsquo; in 1c-d). This region is where the fronted <em>wh</em>-word can ultimately be integrated into the sentence representation. Native English speakers showed evidence of successful integration in both sentences, whereas a more complex pattern emerged for the Mandarin-speaking learners, suggesting that they were only able to resolve the <em>wh</em>-dependency in sentences that do not have relative clauses (1a-b), with no evidence of successful resolution in sentences (1c-d).</p> <p>In sum, this dissertation project utilized an innovative and rigorous approach using brain-based measurements to investigate native and non-native processing, and our results revealed that natives and adult L2 learners utilized different mechanisms during the processing of complex sentences involving <em>wh</em>-dependencies.
