<AbstractNarration>Big Data have become one of the key challenges in many research areas. Big Data Computing, Applications and Technologies, BDCAT 2017, serves as a platform for researchers to share with the community their discoveries in various aspects of big data computing, including big data science, infrastructures and platforms, big data applications, big data trends and challenges, as well as visualization of big data. The conference will also provide an education opportunity for students participants, where they will be exposed to novel techniques and learn state-of- the-art methodologies. In addition, the travel award recipients will have opportunities to closely interact with a group of faculty mentors, who will provide constructive feedback on their research projects, as well as career guidance.</AbstractNarration>
