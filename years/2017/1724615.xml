<AbstractNarration>Fine-scale mapping of the underwater world is currently elusive because of a fundamental property of aquatic environments--they are in constant motion. Three-Dimensional mapping of the underwater world in an ecologically relevant way requires mapping not only the physical limits of a specific arena but also the biology within it. Here, the researchers propose to revolutionize the way scientists build near-scale (5-10m) underwater maps by the construction of a UV-Multispectral-Polarization imager with complete multilevel imaging features enabling 3D mapping and full optical characterization of underwater environments. The proposed 3D imager will overcome the challenge of a moving and scattering medium; overcome the problems that cripple conventional scanning devices (e.g. co-registration); while simultaneously filling in the 3D map with biologically meaningful information with images and complete characterization of the light field. With such a device, one will have the capability to map the physical footprint of the underwater world, but also extract species identification from optical characteristics, movement characteristics of organisms within it, health/condition status of biological organisms (e.g. coral reefs, oil spills, plastic contaminants), and comprehensive optical characterization.  In addition to providing fine scale mapping of underwater worlds that will serve both biological and conservation missions, the researchers will also use this technology to engage STEM programs in both the Austin and St. Louis areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Collaborative OTIC award to develop a state-of-the-art 3D imaging device whose purpose is to transform the way researchers map underwater environments and biologically characterize the features within it. The principle investigators propose to develop a high spatial and temporal resolution multispectral polarimeter capable of measuring polarization information in RGB bandwidths combined with three separate and distinct narrow spectral bandwidth channels, one of which being in the UV spectrum.  This will produce 12 distinct optical channels that are inherently co-registered, with polarization detection allowing for dehazing capabilities to greatly increase the effectiveness of visual simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms (VSLAM) for obtaining 3D map reconstruction. The co-registered channels will overlay maps with optical information for identifying and measuring benthic characteristics. This next generation underwater mapping device will provide scientists with simultaneous information on (i) physical dimensional space (3D depth), (ii) surface characteristics that identify benthos and organisms within the environment (imaging), (iii) optical characterization of the water column and benthos, as well as (iv) allow for fine-scale tracking of organisms within these underwater environments.  This device will enable broad ranges of research questions from oceanographers and marine scientists interested in monitoring coral reefs, animal behaviorists studying 3D camouflage and communication properties, to conservation scientists interested in monitoring environmental degradation (oil and plastic contaminants).  This collaborative effort will (a) produce a polarization imaging sensor that captures multispectral polarization information in real-time (~20fps), with low power dissipation and with high spatial resolution, (b) provide dynamic multispectral information on underwater features that were previously unattainable due to scanning technologies with low temporal resolution (~1min), (c) develop software to map and track underwater environments modifying currently developed open source VSLAM software, and (d) test emerging biological hypotheses on camouflage, communication and coral reef monitoring.</AbstractNarration>
