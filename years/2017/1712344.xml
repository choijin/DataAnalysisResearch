<AbstractNarration>One of the major difficulties in understanding how autocracy arises in electoral democracies is the limited data that exist on citizen participation in and support for autocratic moves. Such moves often arise suddenly, making them difficult for analysts to anticipate and study. One such move was the successful effort by President Daniel Ortega to void the participation of his major opponents in Nicaragua's recent and upcoming elections. This case provides us a unique opportunity to examine an effort to install electorally-validated autocracy. By closely examining this case, the findings can impact foreign policy and domestic organizations that support democracy and its development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses a multi-wave survey design. An initial national public opinion survey gauges citizen vote support for Ortega, and then two subsequent national public opinion surveys trace the evolution of citizen attitudes in the months following the initial survey. These surveys will be used to examine the following question: Is citizen support for autocracy truly broad-gauged and sustained, as elected autocrats claim, or is it more limited and subject to rapid decay as the oppressive reality of strong-man rule emerges?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has allowed us to understand the circumstances under which the general public will support an authoritarian leader who, once elected, acts to break down democracy.  The project also reveals the extent to which support for an authoritarian leader is limited and can evaporate quickly when circumstances change.  These findings have broad relevance elsewhere in the world.  Daniel Ortega was elected president of Nicaragua in 2006 in a free and fair election.  However, 2006 became the last free election Nicaragua had.  Subsequent to being elected Ortega broke down democracy by undermining the independence of the legislature, the judiciary and the Supreme Electoral Council, which is responsible for conducting fair elections.  Ortega also undermined all opposition leaders, using intimidation or bribery.  Finally, Ortega conducted fraudulent national and municipal elections in 2011, 2012, 2016 and 2017. He used fraud to ensure his own "victory."  As Ortega undermined Nicaraguan democracy, his support among the public actually rose.  Whereas he had won in 2006 with a 38% plurality, our study shows that by 2016 more than half of the public supported him.  The growth in support for Ortega is owing to two factors:  1) a high level of public spending on social support programs and infrastructure and 2) the use of clientelism to bolster supporters and increase the number of voters who supported Ortega.  Through clientelism, Ortega rewarded his supporters and attempted to buy new votes.  Ortega used extensive funds from Venezuela to fund these social support programs, infrastructure and clientelism.  These findings show that when public support can be purchased by a favorable economic climate and by extensive spending programs, the public can be induced to support an elected leader who has become an authoritarian and who has destroyed democracy.  However, these are not our final conclusions.  Scrutiny of our data shows that while a majority of citizens supported Ortega in 2016, his support was both limited and conditional.  It was limited because a significant minority of 30-40% of the public did not support Ortega despite his social spending programs and clientelism.  These Ortega opponents expressed their opposition to Ortega by voting in fraudulent elections for the opposition, despite the fact that the opposition would never be allowed to win or they expressed their opposition simply by staying home and refusing to vote at all.  Ortega's support was conditional because it was based upon the expectation that Ortega would continue a very high level of spending on infrastructure and social programs.    In point of fact, by early 2017 those conditions had begun to evaporate.  The Venezuelan economy was in crisis and Venezuela was no longer able to supply extensive funds to Ortega's regime in Nicaragua.  As the Nicaraguan economy began to fail in 2017, our data indicate declining support for Ortega.  Then, in early 2018, Ortega cut social programs for a large segment of the population.  In response the public turned out in protest.  Ortega used violent repression against the protesters which only cause more protest.  By late summer of 2018 Ortega had achieved a reduction in protest through repression, killing many protesters and forcing thousands of others into exile abroad or into hiding inside Nicaragua.  Our data in 2018 show that the vast majority of Nicaraguans now oppose Ortega and 20% say they have engaged in some form of protest against him.  The Civic Alliance, which represents Ortega’s opponents, and the Catholic Church are calling for a fair election to remove him from office and replace him with an elected leader.  Most recently the secondary city of Masaya has declared itself autonomous from the Ortega regime, no longer recognizing Ortega as the leader of the country.  In sum, our study shows the conditions under which the population can be convinced to support an authoritarian leader and the tenuousness of that support.  Once the economic benefits of the regime fell away, the public moved rapidly to oppose the regime and is still working today to remove Ortega from power.  These findings are relevant for other countries where the public has been convinced to elect a leader who is not loyal to democracy and who becomes an authoritarian once in power.  The project is relevant to events in Venezuela, Bolivia, Mexico and Brazil in Latin America.  It also holds relevance for events in other countries elsewhere in the world.
