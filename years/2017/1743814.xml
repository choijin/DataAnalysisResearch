<AbstractNarration>In this Award from the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows Program) Dr. Posy Busby from the University of Idaho will investigate the use of naturally-occurring plant endophytes in the cultivation of cottonwood trees for use as feedstock for biofuels.  This award has support from: the Directorate for Biological Sciences, the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and the Office of Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will investigate the potential that application of plant endophytes to cottonwood trees can help to protect the trees from a major rust pathogen (Melampsora) in biofuel plantations in the Pacific Northwest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of studies like that supported in this award is to develop sustainable agricultural methods for biofuel production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Busby will be working with collaborators Prof. George Newcombe of the Department of Forest, Rangeland and Fire Sciences at the University of Idaho and Dr. Brian Stanton at "Greenwood Resources," and additional collaborators at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Luc Hoffmann Institute (Switzerland) and the Yakama Nation Wildlife Resource  Management Program.  Dr. Busby will also be working with graduate and undergraduate students in this project, including students from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows) program, with the goal of helping to enable discoveries needed to inform actions that lead to environmental, energy and societal sustainability while creating the necessary workforce to address these challenges. With SEES Fellows support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish themselves in an independent research career related to sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary objective of the study was to identify leaf fungi that antagonize pathogens &ndash; "endophytes" &ndash; and to test whether endophytes can be harnessed for sustainable disease management in feedstock production for biofuels. In particular, the study focused on leaf endophytes that reduce rust disease severity in the woody feedstock crop, Populus trichocarpa. I worked in close collaboration with GreenWood Resources, a timber company specializing in poplar production and aligned with efforts to establish a poplar-based biofuel industry in the Pacific Northwest.  The study achieved its primary objective. I identified a suite of naturally occurring leaf endophytes that can reduce rust disease severity in poplar feedstock production for biofuels. The specific, major accomplishments of the study include: 1) demonstrating that commonly occurring leaf endophytes of P. trichocarpa can reduce the severity of rust disease in both greenhouse experiments and field trials, 2) identifying additional biotic modifiers of disease in P. trichocarpa, and creating a "defense hierarchy" to characterize multiple lines of defense against plant pathogens, 3) leading an international meeting on the role of plant microbiomes in sustainable agriculture, 4) furthering efforts to advance the interdisciplinary study of agricultural microbiomes by establishing an NSF Research Coordination Network.  Overall, this project has been influential in establishing the importance of plant microbiomes in plant defense, in creating a roadmap for integrating microbiome management into sustainable agriculture, and for raising public awareness of plant microbiomes.
