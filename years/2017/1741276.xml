<AbstractNarration>This workshop on using design thinking for assessment and evaluation will advance the knowledge of the field in its understanding of ways to engage various stakeholder groups in using evaluative thinking  from the beginning of an initiative.  It specifically supports education and diversity through the audience of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) and the nature of the NSF INCLUDES context with its focus on broadening participation in the STEM enterprise (particularly higher education).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope is a workshop for approximately 100 APLU members to advance the use of evidence-based approaches to foster career pathways towards the professoriate by broadening participation pf underrepresented groups .  The workshop will include plenary presentations, small group sessions and extensive opportunity for networking, reflection and consensus building.</AbstractNarration>

The Summits were designed to leverage the content and context expertise of APLU's members and national partners and to engage participants in the collective impact of the NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilot (NSF #1649214).   The objectives of the Summit were two-fold: 1) to leverage the collective intelligence of APLU members and national partners regarding assessment, evaluation, and longer-term accountability; and, 2) test, iterate, and refine a design thinking and modeling concept?s impact upon the project?s collective impact approach. The summits were work-based and deployed design-thinking strategies to accelerate the rate at which participants understand the scope of the project and to assist key project leads as they developed implementation plans.    The Value of Design-Thinking  Post-summit surveys demonstrated that participants believed they learned more from the use of design-thinking approaches (90% of respondents agreed or higher) but also described feeling more deeply engaged within APLU's network to address diversity and inclusion within STEM.    Post-Summit surveys were designed to measure:   What next steps were identified as a result of attending the summit;   The value of attending and knowledge gained;   The impact of design thinking on the agenda and ways of working; and,    What topics should be considered for future summits?       Key Results Included:           81%   of respondents felt able to address challenges faced in improving undergraduate STEM education as it applies to broadening participation to a Great to Some Extent      91%   of respondent felt able to address challenges faced in diversifying the professoriate to Great to Some Extent      90%   of respondents got new ideas that will be useful after the workshop to a Great to Some Extent      82%   of respondents were Very Likely to extend this discussion among colleagues at their institutions     65%   of respondents were Very Likely to review draft tools     55%   of respondents agreed they were better equipped to create or sustain change at their institution as a result of attending the summit     71%   of respondents agreed they were more committed to diversifying the STEM pathway as a result of attending the summit     71%   of respondents agreed they are more committed to diversifying STEM Faculty as a result of attending the summit     87%   of respondents agreed they developed new connections with colleagues in the field as a result of attending the summit     68%   of respondents agreed they strengthened connections with colleagues in the field as a result of attending the summit     75%   of respondents agreed they are better able to identify the challenges their institution is facing as a result of attending the summit     83%   of respondents plan on attending the next APLU INCLUDES Summit         "I really liked the design thinking format to engage more participant input and feedback." - Summit Participant    Respondents appreciate the design thinking approach for developing the agenda for critical issues in higher education. They would like to see more facilitation of networking opportunities to build community, encouraging of cross-institutional collaborations and partnerships, the curating of more success story examples and best practices, and finally, an articulated INCLUDES value proposition to start the conversation at their institutions.
