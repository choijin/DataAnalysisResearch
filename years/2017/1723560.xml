ICSE 2017 was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Many US universities have successfully recruited students from South American countries. Given the visibility of the ICSE conference and its attraction for the top students to attend, either as participants in workshops, main conference, the many satellite events, and/or as a student volunteer, supporting travel for new faculty and students will facilitate recruitment and dissemination of research to a broad South American community. Based on a survey of the participants, they all benefited from events before and after the main conference. They participated in technical briefings on the current state of timely topics related to software engineering, a Doctoral Symposium, a New Faculty Symposium, and a variety of ICSE workshops and co-located events, which engaged attendees in discussion of topical concerns in software engineering and provided networking opportunities &ndash; a high priority for the NSF travel awardees. Our priority was to support diverse students and early-career faculty who could benefit from such participation with travel awards.
