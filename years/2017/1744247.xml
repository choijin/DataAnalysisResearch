<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in a two day conference entitled "An Upper Midwest Commutative Algebra Conference" at the University of Minnesota on September 22-23, 2017. This is one in a series of meetings designed to bring together faculty and students from the Universities of Minnesota and Wisconsin, as well as from nearby collegiate institutions to discuss topics in and around commutative algebra. Besides promoting scientific discovery and dissemination, the conferences seek to build a stronger regional community of researchers and promote the training and education of graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting will consist of six plenary talks by invited speakers from around the country. While a majority of the faculty in commutative algebra at the Universities of Minnesota and Wisconsin are relatively junior, both institutions have broad and deep communities of researchers whose work interacts with commutative algebra, but who primarily work in other fields including algebraic geometry, combinatorics, number theory, applied algebra, representation theory, computational algebra, and more.  Thus this meeting is well positioned to lead to collaborations across different areas of algebra.  Attendees will consist of a mix of professors, postdocs and students from the two hosting institutions plus other nearby institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funding in this grant was used to fund a conference in commutative algebra, held on September 22-23, 2017 at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.  There were 66 attendees, the vast majority of whom were graduate students or postdocs.  The specific goals of this conference were to:  1.  Showcase the depth and breadth of research connected to commutative algebra,  2.  Build a regional community among faculty and students and across algebraic disciplines, and  3.  To assist graduate students in launching research careers.   The conference succeeded in these goals.  There were 6 speakers who covered a collection of emerging research topics in and around commutative algebra and who gave colloquium level talks that were accessible to our broad audience.   41 of the 66 attendees came from the University of Wisconsin or the University of Minnesota, thus bolstering the collaborative research communities in these regions.  In addition to benefitting from the talks, graduate students had the opportunity to ask research questions of one of the speakers, in a structured, small group setting.    The conference has been a big hit, and another local institution (Iowa State) has recently requested to join in, further expanding our regional community.  Future meetings will likely include all three of these institutions.           Last Modified: 11/02/2018       Submitted by: Daniel M Erman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
