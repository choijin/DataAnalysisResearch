<AbstractNarration>The Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) has established itself as a leading institution for studying the biological responses to a changing climate.  RMBL's ability to support year-round research will be transformed by building the laboratory's first fully four season housing dedicated to scientists and students.  A changing climate, combined with rapid technological advancements, including in genomics, the microbiome, and sensing, has significantly increased demand for RMBL facilities outside summer.  RMBL is intensively used; more than 175 scientists from 76 institutions have had research projects at the laboratory during the last 6 years.  Year-round housing will allow scientists to track important biological activity that now happens outside summer, as well as applying the full range of genomic, microbiome, and sensing tools available to understanding and predicting biological systems.  The new cabin will also create unique opportunities for winter programming.  RMBL works with the Crested Butte Adaptive Sports Center, whose mission is to enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities through exceptional outdoor adventure activities, to provide unique opportunities to individuals with disabilities.  Additionally, RMBL works with a local school to provide K-12 science education in the backcountry.  Finally, this project will relieve housing pressure in the summer, which will support our undergraduate research program, as well as the scientists' research programs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant would fund the first fully four season housing dedicated to scientists year-round. Construction of this cabin would reflect the need of the nation's scientific infrastructure to adapt to a changing climate.  Over the last 35 years mean temperature has increased approximately 0.73Â° C and snow melt date has advanced approximately 11 days.  This has translated into biological activity over longer parts of the year.   Marmots are emerging almost 40 days earlier than they were in the 1970's, first flowering has advanced 11 days over the last 35 years while last flowering is happening 5 days later over the same time period.  Changes in science are also driving increased demand for RMBL outside summer.  Field scientists have access to a rapidly expanding range of techniques and tools, many of which are best utilized outside summer.  We now have fall and spring visitation associated with maintaining sensors, conducting experiments involving the microbiome, and applying genomic techniques.  RMBL's scientific community, and our governing Board, have identified adding year-round housing as a top priority.  Despite growing demand, RMBL currently has no four-season living facilities that provide all basic amenities to scientists.  Construction of the cabin will transform RMBL's ability to support science outside summer, leverage a large existing investment in science by increasing access to research equipment, and enhance RMBL's sustainability by allowing it to generate revenue outside summer.  Numerous federally funded research groups would be supported by this project covering questions on plant population genomics, fungal-plant associations, and biogeochemistry. These teams have struggled to maintain productivity outside summer because of housing.  This project would also support a unique collection of long-term research and the insights they offer into a changing world.  RMBL hosts 17 long-term research programs, several extending 50+ years, which RMBL supports.  Year-round housing will allow scientists to take full advantage of this wealth of knowledge, tracking important biological activity that now happens outside summer, as well as applying the full range of genomic, microbiome, and sensing tools available to understanding and predicting biological systems.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Organized as a nonprofit, RMBL is a field station located in the central Rockies of Colorado at 3000+ meters in elevation.  With a National Science Foundation grant through the National Science Foundation RMBL built a year-round, 7 bedroom cabin with 2 full bathrooms. The facility opened in the fall of 2019 and supports increased summer demand by scientists for RMBL facilities, as well as increasing winter research.  Due to operational restrictions stemming from the coronavirus, the cabin was critical to meeting scientific demand in the summer of 2020 and supported research teams studying bees and pollination. RMBL also provides research training and the facility supports housing for research teams involved in training undergraduates.  Additionally, with RMBL snowed in half the year because of its unique location in the mountains, in the winter of 2019/2020 the facility hosted college classes from Colorado College and Western Colorado University, as well as supported avalanche training courses.  Research supported by the facility will help support improved weather prediction and water management, through the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Facility that will be deployed 2021-2023 as well as food security throgh NSF-funded research on bees and pollination.  In 2020 RMBL research on hummingbirds and microplastics was featured nationally in media outlets such as the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.
