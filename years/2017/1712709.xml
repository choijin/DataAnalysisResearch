<AbstractNarration>The problem of variable clustering is a corner stone in a multitude of areas such as genetics, neuroscience, sociology, macroeconomics, to name a few. In neuroscience, it aids in finding new functionally connected areas. In genetics, it helps advance the discovery of genes with under-explored or unknown functions. In macro-economics it can assist with the creation of new economic indices. Despite its wide-spread importance and potential impact, this problem has not received a systematic methodological and theoretical treatment in the literature. Although clustering algorithms abound, and have a very long history, assessing the validity of their input is somewhat arbitrary. A probabilistic, model-based approach is put forward in this project. This will enable the development of a unified framework for principled statistical variable clustering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project will introduce and investigate classes of latent variable models for overlapping and non-overlapping variable clustering. The focal points are: (I) The introduction of identifiable latent variable models for clustering. This will provide well defined targets for estimation, and will facilitate the scientific interpretation of the clusters. (II) The development of polynomial time algorithms tailored to these models. (III) The creation of a unifying framework for the theoretical analysis of clustering algorithms, with emphasis on minimax  optimality and high dimensional inference. (IV) The study of the impact of model based clustering algorithms on downstream analyses, with emphasis on graphical models, regression and classification.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The findings of this project add  new elements to the foundational work in  latent factor models, and broaden their scope. Unknown groups of variables that cluster together, possibly with overlap,  as a result of a common, but unobserved, mechanism can be discovered by formulating the problem as one of hidden pattern  recovery in  factor models. A major outcome of this proposal consists in establishing this connection, and in the  provision of scalable methodology for the estimation of the unknown sparse structure of a factor model loading matrix. The resulting overlapping clustering algorithms are fast and  valid across a large array of data generating mechanisms. Theoretical guarantees accompany the procedure, and show that the number of clusters, as well as the cluster membership,  can be consistently estimated from the  data, even when the number of variables is much larger than the available sample size.  Clusters of variables  are instrumental in  understanding the un-observable mechanism  that generated them, and can be used for downstream analyses. As a first  application of this nature,  this project addresses an  under-explored, but fundamental problem in latent clustering: that of  determining the conditional independence relationship among  the latent centers. This proposal  develops  new  inferential tools that can be deployed to construct confidence intervals for the edge strength of a latent Gaussian graphical model. The new methodology scales well with the number of observed  features, and the width of the confidence intervals takes into account the variability induced by the clustering step.  Another major outcome of this proposal is the development of an integrated framework for inference on the effect of  un-measurable mechanisms, viewed as latent cluster centers of a large vector of measured features, on a response of interest.
