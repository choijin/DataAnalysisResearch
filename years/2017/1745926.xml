<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funds to support student travel to the European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming (ECOOP 2018) and the ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2018), which will take place in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, July 16-23, 2018. ECOOP is a major conference for programming language and software engineering research. This year, as it happens, ECOOP will be co-located with another major conference, ISSTA, which is the top conference in software testing and analysis. The combined event is a very worthwhile event for students to attend. The funds requested from NSF will help support the large number of students that are expected to attend ECOOP/ISSTA 2018. The requested funding would be used only to support the conference attendance of students who are (i) US citizens or US permanent residents and/or (ii) enrolled in undergraduate or graduate programs at accredited US universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds support advancing the field through technical discussions and presentations, and the building of a workforce that pursues careers in research for programming languages and software engineering areas.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The 2018 European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming (ECOOP 2018) and the 2018 International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2018) were held at the Moevenpick Hotel in Amsterdam, The Netherlands from July 15-21, 2018. ECOOP is the premier conference on the design and implementation of object-oriented programming languages. Since its inception in 1987, the ECOOP conference series has focused on object orientation and its role in programming language design and implementation, but the scope of the ECOOP conference has grown to include various topics in programming languages and compiler technology. ISSTA is the premier &ldquo;specialist&rdquo; research conference in software testing and analysis, complementary to wider &ldquo;generalist&rdquo; research conferences in the broader field of Software Engineering. ISSTA has been held as a ACM conference series since 1993 (annually since 2006), and was preceded by the TAV conference series since 1986 and several workshops before that time. Throughout this time, ISSTA and its predecessors have been instrumental in establishing software testing and analysis as a major specialty within software engineering.<br /><br />The goal of this project was to enable broader student participation at ECOOP/ISSTA 2018, especially by those that may not have adequate support at their educational institution. Additional goals were to expand participation by women and underrepresented minorities, and to help strengthen the ties between the US and local student communities in Programming Languages and Software Engineering, which will have benefits in both research and education.<br /><br />The funding provided by NSF was used primarily to support conference attendance and travel by students. Additionally, part of the funding was used for supporting student-oriented activities at the conference, which included a Posters Reception and a dinner for the student volunteers who assisted with organizing the event. A total of 79 applications of funding was received. Of these, 15 applications were from students at US universities. Most applications included requests for reimbursement of registration fees, transportation, and hotel costs. Funding decisions were made by a committee consisting of the General Chair, Comfy Chair, and Finance Chair for ECOOP/ISSTA 2018, with input from Student Volunteer Chairs. In allocating Student Travel Grants from the NSF funds, priority was given to: students who were co-authors of a paper published in ECOOP or ISSTA 2018, students who were attending the ECOOP/ISSTA 2018 Summer School, students who were attending the ECOOP/ISSTA 2018 Doctoral Symposium, and students who presented at one of the affiliated workshops. Within each of these groups, priority was given to students who served as student volunteers, and to students in groups typically underrepresented in the ECOOP/ISSTA communities and in the broader Programming Languages and Software Engineering communities. The total amount of funding requested by all applicants exceeded the available funds. After due consideration, 8 of the 15 US-based applications were selected to receive travel support from NSF&rsquo;s funds. Three of these eight students (37.5%) are female.<br /><br />This broader impacts of the project were twofold. First, the ECOOP/ISSTA 2018 conference was strengthened as a result of the greater attendance that this travel support has enabled. Second, as numerous testimonials attest, those students receiving travel support personally benefited from the opportunity to interact with peers and experts, as well as by establishing connections that will help their professional careers.
