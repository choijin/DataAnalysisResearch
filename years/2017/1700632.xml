<AbstractNarration>The United States economy is increasingly reliant on highly skilled information technology professionals who not only have excellent foundational computer knowledge, skills, and abilities, but also possess the cybersecurity skills required to protect and defend the critical national cyber resources on which business and industry rely. To address the demand of business and industry for these professionals, North Arkansas College (Northark) has designed this project to increase the number of skilled technicians who are trained in network technology with a cybersecurity focus. The project team will enhance and expand their program by infusing the existing Information Technology/Network Systems Administration curricula with cyber security components. The Business/Industry Leadership Team (BILT) at the college will play an active role in setting the direction of the IT program as they have an increased need for more highly trained skilled technicians in IT/Cyber. The project will assist in diversifying the workforce and growing the economy in rural areas by providing access to high-tech jobs for low income students. The results of this project will be life changing and will provide a pathway out of poverty for many students and their families. Northark will share all aspects of the project, including newly developed methods of engaging Business and Industry (the BILT model), methods to offer course materials remotely, strategies to recruit and provide access to rural students, and curricular improvements, on a website devoted to this project and at in-state, regional, and national conferences. A comprehensive evaluation will determine which components of the project are most effective and where modifications are needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because many residents in the service area of the college and other parts of Arkansas, especially those in rural areas, do not have access to the resources required, Northark will utilize technology to support remote delivery of course content through web and virtual options, as well as expanded face to face opportunities at satellite locations and high schools. It will also create a concurrent credit track to allow high school students to complete an IT/Cyber Certificate of Proficiency, actively recruit rural and high school students to enter this high tech field, and add an Academic/Career coach who will provide support that will increase retention, degree completion, and job placement. Using available NSF-ATE curriculum and open source materials, faculty at the college will adapt and enhance the existing IT program with Cybersecurity topics and adapt all curricula for distance delivery. Northark will pilot test distance delivery of this high tech coursework to rural students who do not otherwise have access to such curricular opportunities. The program will be promoted by BILT members and current students and the college will utilize recruiting strategies adapted from other ATE projects to attract more students to this updated flexibly-delivered program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF ATE funding for this project allowed Northark faculty to enhance the existing IT program with Network Security topics, to adapt the curricula for remote delivery, and to successfully deliver the hands-on high-tech coursework to rural residents who would not otherwise have access to this program.  The project has resulted in transformative changes for the IT and other Northark programs:      The use of an active Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT) helps ensure that the program stays relevant while allowing collaboration between Northark faculty and area employers.  The use of teleconferencing tools for this project created the foundation for a relatively seamless transition to remote delivery when Northark closed due to the pandemic.  Because of the skills, tools, and techniques developed through this project, IT faculty were able to provide assistance and mentoring to faculty in other disciplines as plans for the pandemic were put in place.  The academic IT program and the administrative IT Services department now benefit from a much more collaborative relationship than was present prior to this project.       Northark set five goals for this project, as follows.      Goal 1.  Modify the Curriculum    Faculty modified the degree plan to better align the curriculum with needs identified by the BILT and to better package the program's content for remote delivery. Changes included the development of a new stackable Certificate of Proficiency that leads seamlessly to a Technical Certificate and then to an Associate of Applied Science degree; creation of three new courses, IT Internship, Virtualization Fundamentals, and Cloud Technology Fundamentals; and modification of the IT Essentials course.   Thirteen students participated in the new internship course during the three-year project. The Internships were paused during the spring and summer terms of 2020 due to Covid-19.     Goal 2.  Expand the BILT    Northark's BILT, relatively new at the start of the grant, now functions as an actively engaged team that meets with Northark faculty at least three times each year to identify and discuss needs, issues, trends, and knowledge, skills, and abilities needed by entry level workers. BILT members also visit classes, donate equipment and expertise, and communicate with Northark to recruit job applicants.  Northark expanded the BILT from 14 industry members at the beginning of the project to 16 members at the end.  Two of the new members brought expertise in security to the team.      Goal 3.  Upskill Northark faculty    Northark faculty participated in numerous training activities during this project to ensure they were prepared to teach the content required by the BILT.  At the beginning of the project a single instructor had a master's degree in IT and was credentialled to teach CCNA 1 through 4.  That instructor retired during the project and the program was led for a year by part-time faculty, including the Director of Northark's administrative IT Services department who had a master?s degree but no Cisco certifications.  As of the end of the project Northark has:     two instructors accredited to teach CCNA 1 and CCNA 2,   one instructor accredited to teach CCNA 3 and CCNA 4,  two instructors who are certified in CompTIA A+,   one instructor who completed the Cisco CyberOpstraining.     Faculty and students also participated in multiple professional development opportunities, including the National Convergence Technology Center?s Summer Working Connections, NSF ATE Conferences, and Hi-Tec Conferences.       Goal 4.  Expand Delivery    Northark began delivering IT courses to the remote Carroll County Center in fall 2018. Courses delivered remotely have included IT Essentials, CCNA 1, CCNA 2, and CCNA 3.  Due to the pandemic in Spring 2020 all classes were delivered remotely.      An additional classroom was designed to support the IT Essentials courses on the main Northark campus. This change provides greater flexibility in course scheduling and an improved learning environment by providing more efficient use of workspace for the IT program.     Goal 5.  Recruit and Retain    Course enrollment, success, and progression have improved for all students in the IT program, but especially for females and Hispanics. Improvement in Total Student Semester Credit Hours (SSCH) earned by women and Hispanics from the two years prior to the start of the grant and the two years after were compared.  Although the numbers were small,   SSCH from females almost tripled and their course success rate increased from 48% to 75% while the success rate of Hispanics was 85%, outpacing the overall success rate of 76%.       Information about the project is available on a website devoted to this project:    https://atecentral.net/msites/northark_nsf/home      Information about the BILT process and details of remote delivery have already been shared at the Arkansas Community College?s Annual Conference, the 2019 and 2020 Hi-Tec Annual Conferences and at the ATE-PI Conference.
