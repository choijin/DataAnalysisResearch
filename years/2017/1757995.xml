<AbstractNarration>The REU program in Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science at Oregon State University, run by members of the Mathematics Department and the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, will provide an 8-week summer research experience to 10 undergraduate students during each year of the program.  We aim to broaden participation in the mathematical sciences by recruiting and encouraging women, members of underrepresented groups, and students at institutions with limited research opportunities to pursue careers in mathematics.  We also aim to advance undergraduate research in mathematics and theoretical computer science, with a particular focus on number theory, probability, and cryptography.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will include presentations by students, a colloquium series by local faculty, panel discussions on topics such as conducting research and applying to graduate school, and detailed publishing guidance.  The students will work in groups of two or three on a research project supervised by a faculty mentor.  The projects are designed to be at the forefront of modern research in their respective areas, but also at a level which is reasonable to expect significant progress by undergraduates in 8 weeks.  Successful progress on these research problems will advance mathematical knowledge and will further the role of undergraduates in modern mathematical research.  Our program is designed to provide a glimpse into the life of a research mathematician, and to provide support and guidance for students interested in careers in mathematics.  Through our recruitment, we hope to increase the numbers of women and underrepresented groups who pursue careers in mathematics and computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
