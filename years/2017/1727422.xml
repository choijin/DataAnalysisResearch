<AbstractNarration>Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is an acute physical injury of the brain suffered by millions of Americans every year. Such injuries are largely invisible, poorly understood, and almost always lead to extensive and life-long consequences for survivors, their caregivers, families, friends, and wider communities. In the research supported by this award, University of Arizona doctoral student Austin W. Duncan, under the supervision of Dr. Eric Plemons and Dr. Susan J Shaw, will investigate the shifting meaning and sociocultural ramifications of the injury in the contemporary United States. The goal is to understand how the meaning is created and how it changes and is changed by bodily experiences and social interactions of individual survivors with those around them, including governmental and non-governmental (NGO) policymakers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher will trace how TBI becomes a chronic condition at three distinct but inter-related levels: 1) individual TBI survivors; 2) caregivers, families, friends, and associates; and 3) governmental and non-governmental policies and programs. Data will be collected through intensive fieldwork  in Seattle, Washington. The researcher will employ a mixed methods approach, including:  participant-observation with community, organizations, and TBI support groups; open-ended stakeholder interviews; focus groups; case studies with individual survivors and those closest to them; and semi-structured interviews with state and civil society staff and policymakers. Taken together, these data sources will allow the researcher to access and assess the post-treatment and rehabilitation consequences of the injury across individual, social, and political realms. Finally, by investigating a concrete example of the social effects of physical brain damage, findings from the research will contribute to new theoretical understanding of the role that the brain plays in the functioning of the physical, social, and political bodies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Austin Duncan has completed ethnographic research for his dissertation, "The Social Life of TBI: The Embodied and Constructed Meaning of Moderate-Severe Traumatic Brain Injury in the United States" supported by the NSF's Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant. During the funding period, he spent 12 months collecting data with TBI survivors, their families and friends, and civil servants in and around the city of Seattle, Washington.  The research sought to understand how survivors? social lives are tied up in and linked to others? lives, actions, and the social policies and services that directly concern them.  During data collection, Mr. Duncan conducted extensive participant observation in and around the city. He gained permission to attend and observe many local Support Groups throughout the city at least once per week over the entire 12 month period.  He attended 4 periodic official state TBI Council meetings and the WA State TBI Council meeting.  He also participated in monthly community activities intended specifically for survivors and their caregivers, 2 annual fundraising galas for local NGOs, many more informal survivor-organized events, and was invited to present at 2 survivor-organized seminars, a national podcast for survivors, and at the Association of University Centers on Disability conference in Washington, D.C.    Throughout fieldwork, Mr. Duncan conducted narrative and semi-structured interviews with 28 individual survivors that were recruited from the Support Groups and through the University of  Washington?s TBI Model System.  He later conducted more intensive Case Studies with 8 of these survivors.  These consisted of a further two unstructured interviews and &frac12; day observations spaced at least 3 months apart, as well as semi-structured interviews with up to 4 of their family members/caregivers and friends at later times and locations. Finally, he completed semi-structured interviews with 20 WA state employees and NGO staff whose work directly concerns the injury.    Mr. Duncan initially hypothesized that survivors? lives and experiences would be affected by their interactions with significant others such that these interactions would have a determinative impact on their lives and well-being.  He found that this was true ,but it was equally true of those with many friends and relations and those who were socially isolated.  He also discovered that there were multiple meanings of "TBI" used by survivors, those they interact with, and state and city policymakers. Mr. Duncan?s fieldwork concluded by detailing how each of these groups at specific times and locations define TBI variously as, but not limited to: personal injury, chronic impairment and disability, family history, community identity, and object of social policies and administration.  His research explored how this confusing multiplicity of definitions are often used interchangeably, leading both directly and indirectly to the numerous health and social problems other research has identified, including poverty and homelessness.  Mr. Duncan?s research forms the basis of his dissertation which will make important contributions to anthropology.  It will do so by using ethnographic data and observations to harmonize subjects that frequently oppose each other, namely the anthropology of phenomenology and embodiment, performativity and enactment, Disability Studies, and public policy. This work will also contribute to more effective administration of programs and policies for the millions of TBI survivors living in the US, many of whom are heavily dependent on state and federal services for the rest of their lives. Moreover it will also add to our growing understanding of the human brain, specifically tracing the social impact of brain injury, one of the most frequent causes of death and disability in the contemporary United States.
