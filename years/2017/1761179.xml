<AbstractNarration>The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that will generate foundational knowledge in the field. This study will add to foundational knowledge by building theory about broadening participation of underrepresented minority groups (students of color, young women, students from low SES families, students with disabilities, English language learners), and intersections among them, in STEM education. The study will use data from the National Study of Learning Mindsets (NSLM), the largest (to date) national randomized-controlled trial of a psychological intervention conducted with a national probability sample of public high schools and an over-sample of urban district schools, including over 18,000 students from 83 schools. The goal of the NSLM was to gain insights about ways to retain underrepresented students in the STEM pipeline. Through the intervention students were taught the concept of a growth mindset (the idea that the struggles in school are opportunities to learn, and do not mean you lack intelligence), and how to apply this concept in their schoolwork. Surveys assessed the growth mindset climates in math classrooms.  The present study will analyze NSLM data to investigate if 9th grade math classroom climates and students? use of a growth mindsets worked together to help students successfully complete advanced math and science courses in the early high school years. The four main objectives of the study include: (1) Coding 8th to 10th grade STEM course-taking patterns among students who participated in the NSLM and describing the extent to which minority groups are under-represented in advanced STEM coursework; (2) Testing whether a 9th grade math class with a strong growth mindset climate predicts higher rates of persistence in 10th grade STEM courses among students from under-represented groups; (3) Identifying the growth-oriented teacher practices that best create a growth mindset climate and increase STEM course persistence; and (4) Testing whether the effect on 10th grade STEM course persistence of a growth mindset intervention given directly to students in 9th grade depends on the 9th grade math classroom climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analyses of NSLM data will present a unique opportunity to study why 9th grade math continues to be a gatekeeper course for many underrepresented students. The study will move beyond research that focused on letter grades (i.e. A, B, etc.) and instead focus on course taking patterns (i.e. taking Algebra II in 10th grade or not). Thus, it will advance knowledge about reducing attrition of underrepresented groups in rigorous math pathways. The combined use of quantitative techniques and an integrative theory will help address the ongoing national goal for diversifying the future STEM workforce. Intersectional analyses?which look at groups that have multiple disadvantages, such as students who are both in a racial minority group and who are learning English?are essential to uncovering a deeper understanding of inequities faced by these groups. To do so, the study will build a database that links student and teacher records to validate novel, efficient, and scalable assessments of math classroom climates and math teacher practices useful for improving instructional climates that narrow achievement gaps in high school trajectories. Last, this study will advance knowledge about scalable, low-cost interventions, and identify classrooms where such interventions are most or least effective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
