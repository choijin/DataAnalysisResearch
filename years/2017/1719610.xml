<AbstractNarration>This project provides travel support for US scientists to participate in the 38th International Congress of Physiological Sciences in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, August 1-5, 2017.  The meeting is organized by the International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS) and the travel awards will be administered by the American Physiological Society (APS).  The meeting assembles approximately 3,000 of the top comparative animal physiologists in the world, including many established scientists from the United States. The travel awards will be given to qualified scientists interested in comparative organismal physiology, and special emphasis will be given to early career investigators (within 15 years of receiving their doctoral degree) and to women and under-represented minority scientists. The project therefore broadens the participation of young scientists with an emphasis on women and under-represented minorities; exposes new investigators and students to cutting edge research designed to understand physiological processes and traits; and provides unique opportunities for the development of international collaborations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS) will hold the 38th International Congress of Physiological Sciences in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, August 1-5, 2017. The American Physiological Society (APS) has administered a travel grant program to assist U.S. scientists engaged in physiological research and its applications to attend Congresses every four years since the IUPS Congress was held in Buenos Aires in 1959. Special emphasis will be given to investigators within 15 years of receiving their doctoral degree and to women and under-represented minority scientists. Travel awards resulting from this proposal will be directed to individuals working in the research areas supported by the NSF Division of Integrative Organismal Systems. An internal program committee developed the scientific program for the 38th Congress with representatives from the host society, Brazilian Society of Physiology, and the IUPS. The program is organized around a number of IUPS Commissions. Traditionally, the one most relevant to NSF is associated with the Commission Comparative Physiology: Evolution, Adaptation &amp; Environment. The specific aims of this proposal include:  1) to promote widespread participation of young scientists with an emphasis on women and under-represented minorities, through a travel award program; 2) to engage new investigators and students in pursuing research designed to understand physiological processes and traits; and, 3) to provide opportunities for the development of collaborative interactions with scientists from the United States and those working outside of the United States.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project was to administer a travel award program to support the attendance of US researchers at the 38th International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS) Congress, which was held August 1-5, 2017 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Special emphasis was placed on supporting trainees, early career investigators, women, and underrepresented minorities to attend the meeting. The specific objectives of the travel award program were to: 1) promote widespread participation of young scientists with an emphasis on women and under-represented minorities, through a travel award program; 2) interest early career investigators and trainees in pursuing research designed to understand physiological processes and traits; and, 3) provide opportunities for the development of collaborative interactions with scientists from the United States and those working outside of the United States.  Through the program, APS made 28 awards to US researchers to help defray the cost of their attendance at the Congress. Of those awarded 32 percent were made to early career investigators, 36 percent to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and 32 percent to senior/established investigators. Fifty-seven percent of NSF-funded travel awardees were women, 18 percent Hispanic/Latino and 7 percent Black/African American. Six of the awardees participated as speakers in the IUPS meeting program.  Because of the support they received to attend the meeting, travel award recipients were able to participate in 6 plenary lectures with two given by Nobel laureates, 21 keynote lectures, 59 symposia, and 2 workshops; with sessions focused on a broad range of themes in the physiological sciences from molecular and cellular physiology to organ systems to whole animal physiology. The awardees were able to learn about the research efforts of a globally diverse set of speakers and interact with thousands of fellow researchers from the US and 63 other countries. Surveys demonstrate that  awardees overwhelmingly felt that the content and networking opportunities of the meeting were beneficial to their research careers, helping them to learn about unique research areas to which they otherwise would not have been exposed and to develop relationships and collaborations with researchers from other countries.   Overall, the 2017 IUPS Congress Travel Award Program achieved one of its intended broader impacts to significantly advance knowledge about the integrative physiology of organisms by providing a group of US-based researchers&mdash;the majority of whom were trainees, early career investigators, and women&mdash;with the opportunity to 1) present their newest and most innovative research discoveries related to the integrative physiology of organisms at an international meeting and 2) gain knowledge about discoveries across a broad range of themes in physiology from a globally diverse group of researchers and, 3) use their newfound knowledge to improve and expand their own research programs. The travel award program also increased the participation of US-based trainees, early career investigators, women, and underrepresented minorities in the meeting and helped them to establish professional relationships with more senior researchers from the US and many other countries. Thus, the travel award program achieved its intended broader impacts to 1) foster participation of trainees, early career investigators and underrepresented minorities in the meeting and physiology research more broadly and 2) develop a more globally diverse and collaborative physiology research workforce.
