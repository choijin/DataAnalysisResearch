<AbstractNarration>The rapid growth of user generated content in online social networks forms an abundant source of big graph data. This project will develop efficient techniques for extracting information from such graph data. Specifically, this EAGER project will develop efficient algorithms for the following tasks: (1) machine learning and sentiment analysis, such as large vocabulary conversational speech recognition, multi-label learning, and multi-polarity sentiment analysis, and (2) effector detection and related issues, such as business expansion and rumor blocking. The advanced optimization techniques developed in this project will significantly improve the performance of the existing data mining algorithms and the theoretical study of efficient approximation techniques. In addition, this project will provide an excellent platform for educating students with hands-on experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To develop the efficient algorithms described, the project will take advantage of recent development in nonlinear combinatorial optimization, and will formulate new methodologies using discrete convex analysis for submodular functions and duality theory for the discrete DC (different of convex) programming, as well as reverse sampling techniques for probabilistic objective functions. These new methodologies will enrich the throughput of machine learning and sentiment analysis. Since nonlinear combinatorial optimization is still in its early stages, exploratory and innovative research on efficient approximation algorithm will be performed based on fresh fundamental theoretical developments. A detailed evaluation will be conducted based on several real world data sets.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Main outcomes are contributed to three objectives as follows.  (1)  Text Mining. As language corpora have been playing an increasingly important role in the field of Artificial Intelligence, such as data training for machine learning, and text mining, we studied a language corpora subset selection problem and design new algorithmic solutions for the problem, with theoretical analysis and computational experiment evaluation. Multi-document summarization problem deals with extracting main information and ideas from a set of related documents, which aims to find a small subset of sentences (summary) that isable to cover most information about the whole document set.  The summary can also provide high-quality training data for machine learning. Inspired by distancedynamics based community detection mechanism and underlying semantic relations, we proposea simple iteration based content attention method with theoretical analysis and good performance in computational experiments. Those outcomes have applications in business decision making and political election (Fig1) analysis.   (2) Social Network Analysis. Social influence is an important research subject in study of social networks (Fig2). For positive information, such as product advertisement, we expect to increase its influence. For negative information or misinformation, such as rumor, we expect to decrease or block its influence. Motivated from the former expectation, we have put our efforts on Budgeted Coupon Advertisement Problem, Maximum Total Revenue problem in A k-Hop Collaborate Game Model, Profit Maximization problem, Adaptive Influence Maximization, etc. and obtained several efficient algorithms for them together with various types of theoretical analysis, such as robust analysis and continuous analysis, as well as computational experimental evaluations..Thos works have applications in viral marketing.   (3) Rumor Detection and Rumor Blocking. How should we know an information is a rumor? An important approach is to find its source, whether the information comes from a trustable source or not. In this project, we continued our research on the infector detection problem and obtained new algorithmic results.  Meanwhile, we have done a sequence of research works on rumor blocking, such as blocking rumor by blocker, Targeted Protection Maximization, rumor blocking in multi-feature diffusion model, etc. Each work consists of an efficient algorithm design, a theoretical analysis, and some computational experimental evaluation.
