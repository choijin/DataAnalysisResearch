<AbstractNarration>This award would support the continued operations of the Na wind-temperature lidar at Andes Lidar Observatory (ALO) in Cerro Pach√≥n, Chile (30.26S, 70.74W, elev. 2530 m) to study the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) dynamics and ion-neutral coupling processes. The lidar at ALO is a state-of-the-art Na resonance-fluorescence Doppler lidar, capable of measuring 3D wind, neutral temperature and Na density profiles at high vertical (500 m) and temporal (1 min) resolutions in the 80-105 km altitude range with high accuracy. Two key advancements of ALO lidar capabilities featuring the extension of lidar observing profile into the lower thermosphere, with wind and temperature measurements up to 140 km altitude, and the ability to detect turbulence scale perturbations in temperature and wind would enable investigations focused on scientific topics that are at the forefront of MLT science. The physical processes that define the dynamics, structure, and variability in the MLT also operate throughout the atmosphere and in all stratified and sheared geophysical fluids, e.g., oceans, lakes, other planetary atmospheres and stellar interiors. This project would provide opportunities for a postdoc researcher, graduate and undergraduate students to participate in the science, engineering and observations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data acquired with the Na lidar at ALO will serve a broad community interested in research from the lower atmosphere to the upper thermosphere. Possible science goals that would be studied through the application of the measurements collected are: determination of turbulence fluxes and eddy diffusion coefficients of heat and momentum and the Prandtl number; investigation of the vertical transport of heat and energy caused by dissipating gravity waves at various scales,quantification of the interactions among gravity waves, tides, and planetary waves at different seasons;analysis and modeling of gravity wave evolution process through variable background atmosphere; and understanding the ion-neutral coupling processes underlying the formation of thermospheric Na layers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This report covers a portion of the transitional period between 5 year missions to perform operations and science discovery from the Andes Lidar Observatory (ALO), in La Serena, Chile.  The observatory is located on Cerro Pachon, at an astronomy observatory compound, where engineering and support services are available.     During this period, we have collected more than 1400 hours of lidar and imaging data from the mesosphere region, 80-110 km altitude. A Chilean engineer has now been trained to operate the lidar, with support from Illinois via computer communications.  This is a big step to help reduce the cost of operations and to increase operational time.  We also have a graduate student at the U of La Serena, Chile who is accomplishing his studies with guidance and data support from the ALO.    This has been an important time period for the perspective of the data we gather in understanding the vertical transport of constituent and heat by turbulence and dissipating gravity waves in the mesospheric region. One study used data from the ALO and another location near Albuquerque, NM.  That study shows that for long term trends, the effect from dissipating waves is a factor of 3-4 larger than for turbulence in the 85-95 km region.  Another study by published from satellite data by observatory scientists has established improved understanding of the global mean transport due to all processes including turbulence and dissipating waves.  These are important findings in establishing the understanding of processes useful in modelling the atmosphere.   We are preparing for the solar eclipse, early July, 2019!  During the eclipse, the solar effects are removed from the upper atmosphere quickly, enabling unique studies of chemical and dynamic processes in the region.  A special daytime sodium filter is being prepared to enable these studies.    We are excited with the capabiliies developed at ALO to measure the fluctuations in temperature and density which establish the spectrum of turbulence and gravity wave transport in the upper atmosphere.  These are new capabilities, and to our knowledge, unique to the ALO.  We will be installing a new mirror to gather additional signal (a factor of 2.7 larger signal) to better explore the upper atmosphere at higher altitudes than we are currently able to. These capabilities are key to the accomplish our objectives to study transport and also to study the processes producing the high altitude sodium streaks observed above the core Na region in the mesosphere, to 150-170 km altitude.
