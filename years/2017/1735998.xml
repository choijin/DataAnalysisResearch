<AbstractNarration>This project aims to give scientists more of the knowledge and tools they need to produce robust and reliable research. By providing a forum to engage with national colleagues renowned for their expertise in research design, methodology and public impact, this project will enhance both the quality and relevance of future research efforts. The workshop provides a platform for scientific collaboration, the results of which will benefit those working to develop more effective methodologies and avenues for the dissemination of findings from anthropological research to promote public scientific understanding. Products from the workshop (in both written and video form) will be made publicly available. The project also contributes to the training of graduate students in methods of scientifically-grounded and empirical data collection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Eileen Anderson-Fye of Case Western Reserve University will organize and oversee a workshop at the biennial meeting of the Society for Psychological Anthropology in New Orleans, LA, from March 9-12, 2017. The workshop will focus on four themes: (1) conducting multi-site collaborative research; (2) effectively communicating scientific research findings; (3) person-centered interviewing; and (4) cultural consensus analysis. Based on two separate surveys that were previously conducted, these areas were identified as most likely to have a sustained impact on methodological development, as respondents identified them as subjects lacking systematic mechanisms to gain knowledge and training. The workshop will advance psychological and cultural anthropology through advancements and innovations in research design and methodology. Because concepts that have been extensively developed and theorized in the subfield of psychological anthropology have been increasingly abstracted more widely in the behavioral and social sciences, a strong multiplier effect beyond the specific subfield is expected. It is anticipated that more than 100 scholars will participate in person in these workshops.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through pre-conference workshops, this project provided professional development for scholars of psychological and cultural anthropology and related fields in three areas critical to their work: research design, methodology, and public impact. The program aimed to improve scholars? understanding of fundamental and advanced elements of the most meaningful and effective research projects&mdash;all with an ultimate goal of strengthening the quality and influence of their subsequent endeavors. In turn, this outcome contributed to increased understanding of the value and relevance of such scholarship. It continues to enhance awareness of the results of such research among the public overall and, more specifically, those involved in the development and implementation of policies at the local, state, national and international levels.     The intellectual merit of this project was in strengthening research design, methodology and public impact of work in psychological and cultural anthropology. These outcomes would be valuable in any context, but are even more relevant in the current historical moment. In recent years, concepts long of interest to psychological anthropology&mdash;self, subjectivity, emotion and mental health, among others&mdash;have experienced a resurgence in cultural anthropological theory and empirical research. As a result, psychological anthropology is uniquely positioned to contribute to the increasing scholarship centered on these concepts. These workshops helped scholars at all career stages be even better prepared to inform and affect work on subjects now garnering wider anthropological and pan-social-science interest, as well as those key to national interests.     The pre-conference training workshops were held successfully, as anticipated.  Thanks to the support of this grant, we were able to recruit stellar scholars to present in four workshops that offered content aimed to enhance national-level training in research design, methods, and policy and practical relevance.  As expected, the workshops drew very strong attendance, and attracted graduate students, postdocs, and early- and mid-career scholars in psychological anthropology and neighboring fields. Such a strong and diverse turnout was particularly gratifying given this was a first-time addition to the program that involved coming early to the meeting.     Thirty-one scholars at various career levels were directly supported, and nearly 100 directly participated in the workshops.  All objectives were met or exceeded as evidenced by exit survey data.  The feedback was overwhelmingly positive toward these pre-conference workshops.  Participants felt they gained effective training unavailable in other venues.  Participating scholars are all involved in research aimed at improving the human condition and human well-being.
