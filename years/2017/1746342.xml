<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the lives of over 500,000 patients with end stage renal disease receiving thrice-weekly hemodialysis treatments in the US each year.  Hemodialysis requires the blood of a patient to be removed and passed through a filter for cleaning prior to returning it to the patient. Oftentimes patients receive insufficient dialysis treatments because the traditional blood pathways cannot be effectively sustained. This leads to increased infections, hospitalization rates and deaths. In addition to the unnecessary suffering of patients, the cost of maintaining these blood pathways is over $2B annually. This implantable device will improve our technical and scientific understanding of hemodialysis shortcomings and may lead to advancing the knowledge in medical fields related to arterial and venous access.  This innovation will allow enhanced hemodialysis treatments for this vulnerable patient population by maintaining blood pathways and lowering infection rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is to create a vascular access device which ensures that end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients have reliable vascular access without the need for an arterialized venous system. AV fistulas and AV grafts often fail to mature and are associated with suboptimal long-term patency rates resulting in a loss of the patient?s life line to dialysis. The objective would be to create a completely subcutaneous device which can be anastomosed to an artery and a separate vein such that the arterial device can obtain a blood flow of at least 400ml/min and the venous device can return the dialyzed blood at a rate of at least 400 ml/min.  The device must allow blood flow through its lumen only when needed and return the native vasculature to its normal flow state after each use. The technical difficulty is how to configure the mechanics of the device and its anastomosis to blood vessels in a manner which allows it to be opened and closed on demand without causing thromboses to form within the native vessels or device. We will be using computational fluid dynamic modeling and an iterative design process to achieve our prototype.</AbstractNarration>

With the exception of kidney transplantation, ESRD patients must undergo dialysis to remain alive. Hemodialysis relies on tapping into the blood circulation and running the patients? blood through a dialysis machine, removing toxins, excess fluid and returning the blood back to the patient.  Vascular access for the hemodialysis process is critical. The loss of vascular access and its associated complications costs the US healthcare system over $2 billion annually. The loss of vascular access is a significant issue because it requires immediate attention as patients can only live a matter of days without dialysis. Even the gold standard for vascular access, the Arterial Venous fistula (AVF), fails to initially mature in 30 to 50% of cases, causing it to be unusable for dialysis. An entire industry of vascular access centers has arisen over the years to address the recurrent issues associated with maintaining access for the hemodialysis population.   During the NSF SBIR research grant a unique approach to vascular access using two identical but independent elements that allow hemodialysis without permanently connecting an artery and a vein was developed (Figure 1).  The Pharmateck vascular access device (PVV) contains a needle entry section connected to a clamping mechanism using a flexible blood lumen that allows each element to be opened during dialysis and closed the remaining 90% of a hemodialysis patients life.  By keeping the elements independent, the PVV should allow for hemodialysis without the complications associated with high flow continuous arterial-venous connection including; permanent thickening of the attached vein, chronically increased cardiac workload and persistent arterial steal syndrome.  In addition, the PVV resides completely beneath the skin and has limited contact with the artery or vein in the closed position which should lead to reduced infection rates.   The technical challenge undertaken as part of the SBIR Phase I was how to configure the mechanics of the device and its anastomosis to blood vessels in a manner which allows it to be opened and closed on demand without causing thromboses to form within the native vessels or device.

The clamping mechanism was able to clamp the blood lumen for extended periods of time at pressures in excess of 225mmHg with failure of the lumen not occurring until reaching pressures greater than 700mmHg.  During the SBIR Phase I grant, Pharmateck was able to build and successfully test a functional PVV prototype which will form the basis for a technology that has the potential to improve the lives of hemodialysis patients by providing a much-improved vascular access option.
