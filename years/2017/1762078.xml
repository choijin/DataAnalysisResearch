<AbstractNarration>The 5th Lake Michigan Workshop on Combinatorics and Graph Theory will&lt;br/&gt;be held at the University of Notre Dame on April 21--22 2018.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will benefit graduate students and junior researchers in&lt;br/&gt;the field of discrete mathematics, working at institutions in the Great Lakes area. &lt;br/&gt;It is built around two sets of three tutorial lectures, focusing on state-of-the-art techniques and results that the speakers feel are underrepresented in typical graduate sequences, and&lt;br/&gt;on emerging techniques on which the speakers are particularly&lt;br/&gt;qualified to expound. There will also be short talks by students&lt;br/&gt;and younger faculty members. There will be ample unscheduled time&lt;br/&gt;during the weekend, allowing new research collaborations to&lt;br/&gt;commence and active collaborations to be continued. Junior&lt;br/&gt;participants will establish valuable connections with more senior&lt;br/&gt;colleagues, and receive guidance from them in a relaxed and informal&lt;br/&gt;environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tutorial speakers for the 2018 workshop will talk about "Connections&lt;br/&gt;between Coxeter systems, permutation patterns and reduced words", and "Edit distance in graphs". The website for the conference is https://www3.nd.edu/~conf/lmwcgt18/.</AbstractNarration>
