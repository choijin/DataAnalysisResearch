<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a disk jockey (DJ) musician's instrument for synchronizing digital media data to a specific location on a device and using this technology for inspiring and educating middle and high school students in Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics (STEAM). Global expanding markets for DJ gear, a $1.587B dollar growth industry, over the past 3 years grew in sales by 21%. As technology and entertainment converge, DJs represent the new "Superstar" for today's youth. Thus, this research represents an incentivizing gateway for students to learn how math, engineering and science intellectual assets can contribute to musical and artistic innovation. Additionally, middle and/or junior high school students' analysis of the data derived from a performance and entertainment-related technology can be an incentivizing and engaging entrance into STEM academic subjects such as systems design, acoustics, and computer coding.  Given the DJ tool's relation to these topics as well as music's inherent link with physics and math, its integration into the curriculum of after-school programming options are expected to foster more interdisciplinary STEM learning. Afterschool turntable academies as thematic contexts for STEM learning function as supportive and assistive educational venues. Collectively, the broader impact of this project should produce economic competitiveness in the music/technology industry for the U.S. overall and, specifically for youth, enhanced engagement in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project stems from the necessity for individuals to seamlessly interface with the digital world without losing creativity, artistry or individuality. The technical innovation emerges from determining the coordinate location of an analog audio occurrence, tracking the change in occurrences, and matching it to a digital counterpart to follow the changes created. The sensor data points are utilized to metamorphose the turntable, the musical instrument of the DJ, into a complete analog/digital educational tool. This technology can offer critical insights to STEM learning and educational opportunities to students who may feel that STEM concepts or careers are separate from their personal interests and cultural context. Anticipated outcomes include advancements in the arts, sciences and education by contributing to entertainment's most recent and broadly recognized musical instrument and making it more available in middle and high school STEM educational curricula and after school activities. The proposed research intends to investigate, identify and resolve current liabilities connected with the transient acoustic degradation, deleterious latency introduction, and physical performance loss by systems intended to mimic the analog turntable. The research objective will be to create novel interface models to analyze the elements captured from the DJ musician and translate these into a commercially and educationally viable platform.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The broader impact of the SBIR Phase I project achieved the development of a novel physical music media platform designed to promote deeper engagement in STEM learning for underrepresented youths.  The initial results and findings from our platform proved to increase student participation at three times the rate reported previously for the Midwestern school system. Although education software lessons are being developed and modeled for Phase II, our unit as a facilitator of student engagement, program participation and STEM programming attendance has proved to meet a highly-needed response to a serious problem in systems throughout the nation:  Chronically absent and under-engaged students.  By incentivizing STEM engagement for youth from economically challenged families, and scaffolding academic persistence through use of their own musical interests, an increase in the pipeline of diverse STEM learners is expected.    As a result of Phase I, multiple outcomes have been achieved: a) 20 test units were created (i.e., being assembled at the time of this Outcomes Report); b) multiple Beta Tests were completed to test software and curriculum, thus, proving technical feasibility; and, c) successes were achieved in making the hardware data more accessible to third-party developers for use in various software applications.  Beta Test initial results overview:  Summer 2019 enrollment demonstrated more than a three- fold increase over the documented rate for Summer 2018.   In comparison to the prior year, students were fully engaged as learners as evidenced by daily attendance averaging over 90%.  Students were unusually engaged in the lessons and activities and demonstrated "learning risk taking." Intellectual risk-taking also implies emotional health and, thus, suggests well-being.  Both teachers and the district's curriculum director noted these as "firsts" for middle school summer programming participants. Following statistical analyses underway and given the level of student engagement and "on-task" behaviors observed, administrators expect significant empirical gains.   www.TLiveInc.com       Last Modified: 07/08/2019       Submitted by: Charles Spencer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
