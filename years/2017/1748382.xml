<AbstractNarration>The proposed project will bring together researchers in a workshop to be held in November 13-15, 2017 at the Days Inn Penn State in State College, PA. The Workshop will address research areas of a wide range of non-graphene 2D atomic layers such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), transition metal di-chalcogenides, tertiary compounds of carbo-nitrides and complex oxides, as well as their applications in various devices. The Workshop will bring the NSF EFRI Two- Dimensional Atomic-Layer Research and Engineering (2-DARE) supported researchers together with those supported by the Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) and Materials Innovation Platform (MIP) programs. By bringing together researchers to discuss cutting-edge research in the above areas the Workshop will catalyze important collaborations. It will also impact training of a globally engaged workforce which will help promoting science and engineering breakthroughs. Graduate students, postdoctoral scholars and junior faculty will comprise a significant portion of the attendees and will benefit from exposure to cutting-edge research in 2D materials and devices and the application of theory/simulation/data analytics to materials discovery.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview:  The Grantees Meeting brought together NSF-supported researchers associated with the Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation in 2D Atomic-Layer Research and Engineering (EFRI 2-DARE), Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) and Materials Innovation Platform (MIP) projects with common interests and focus on 2D materials. The participants included faculty, postdoctoral scholars and graduate students associated with the NSF-supported projects as well as researchers from academia and industry with expertise in data analytics as applied to materials research. The meeting was a follow-on to the previous EFRI 2-DARE Grantees Meeting held in December 2016 in San Francisco, CA and was expanded to include DMREF-2D and MIP researchers to coordinate scientific research in 2D materials and devices and promote the integration of theory, simulation and data analytics in these efforts.   Intellectual Merit: The Grantees meeting provided opportunities for researchers working on 2D materials and device-focused projects under the EFRI 2-DARE program to interact with researchers working on theory/simulation-focused research under the DMREF and MIP programs and discuss breakthroughs, challenges and new avenues for research.  In addition to oral presentations and posters from all of the grantee teams, the meeting also included invited talks and a panel discussion from experts in industry and academia focused on application of data-enabled science in materials research.  Participants were encouraged to consider ways to integrate data analytics into their research through multi-disciplinary collaborations between current EFRI, DMREF and MIP researchers.  The collaborative teams were invited to give short overviews of their proposed projects in a white paper session that was held on the final day of the meeting.  The format of the meeting coupled with the opportunity for supplemental funding for data science research fostered robust discussions and interactions among all participants. It is anticipated that the interactive team-focused approach of this meeting will generate new research concepts and collaborations which will further advance the field of 2D materials and devices.  Broader Impacts: The Grantees Meeting was attended by 43 graduate students and 28 postdoctoral scholars/research associates as well as a number of early-career faculty representing the EFRI 2-DARE, DMREF and MIP projects.  The small size of the meeting combined with the events promoting discussion and interaction among participants provided a unique networking and professional development activity for graduate students and early-career researchers.  The sessions on data-enabled science enhanced the broader impact of the meeting by providing an introduction to this topic for many of the attendees who may not have otherwise considered ways to implement these methods in their research.
