<AbstractNarration>Community-based traumas are pandemic and recurring, profoundly taxing individual well-being and societal resources. Hurricane Harvey, followed by Hurricane Irma, represent stunning examples of such community-based traumas.  Yet surprisingly few studies have considered how cumulative exposure to collective and individual stressors such as these may contribute to patterns of adjustment over time. The effects of community traumas can span physical boundaries as well as temporal boundaries, with widespread media coverage transmitting a trauma's impact far beyond the directly exposed population, and challenging the traditional view of trauma exposure. Designing and implementing research on collective traumas requires overcoming formidable scientific and logistical challenges resulting from the fundamental unpredictability of these events. Previous studies that have examined adjustment to community traumas usually involve recalling events long after they have occurred, making it difficult to disambiguate the effects of trauma on subsequent adjustment. Drawing more solid conclusions about long-term trauma reactions requires having a large sample in which information about pre-event mental and physical health, and baseline assessments of psychological responses have been collected during the acute period of trauma responses.  The investigators in this project have been at the forefront in developing and maintaining such a sample (with prior NSF support), and are able to utilize the sample and extend data collection in the context of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project presents an unprecedented opportunity to document predictors of variability in response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, as well as to examine several questions relevant to risk assessment and community response to a natural disaster. The unparalleled media attention to these hurricanes, coupled with the preexisting large representative sample on which a great deal of data has been collected prospectively (with prior NSF support), provides the opportunity to examine adjustment processes, risk assessments, disaster preparedness, and behavior change without the methodological limitations that have plagued prior research (e.g., lack of pre-data, retrospective data collection, small or demographically homogeneous samples). The research will advance future conceptual work on coping with highly stressful events by (a) furthering our understanding of the extent to which traditional and non-traditional media coverage of the hurricanes may play a role in individuals' risk perceptions and acute stress responses to it; (b) providing information to facilitate early identification of individuals at risk for subsequent difficulties following potential natural disasters; (c) providing information critical to communicating to the public during large-scale threats; (d) informing intervention efforts to encourage disaster-mitigation behaviors (before, during, and after threats); and (e) explicitly integrating the stress and coping literature with the literature on decision making.</AbstractNarration>

This design has afforded the research team a unique opportunity to know a great deal about who people were before the hurricane season, and enabled examination of both general and specific responses to large-scale community crises.  Early findings from this study reveal that:  In the context of an approaching disaster, individuals who anticipated that they would be experiencing posttraumatic stress after the storm were more likely to consume media in advance of the storm and had more negative post-storm mental health outcomes. Pre-storm predictions about post-storm posttraumatic stress were more strongly associated with media consumption and subsequent adjustment to the storm than perceived evacuation status or direct hurricane exposure.   The strongest predictor of evacuation in Florida was pre-landfall perceptions of risk; significant predictors of pre-hurricane risk perceptions included the amount of media individuals attended to before the hurricane and having experienced prior loss in a hurricane, among other factors.   In Florida, about one-quarter of the sample reported evacuating their homes and about one-quarter of the sample reported living in an evacuation zone but not evacuating. However, it appears that individuals' reports of their evacuation risk may not have been accurate. That is, preliminary analysis of perceived and actual evacuation orders suggest widespread misinformation or misunderstanding by respondents in the sample.   In Texas, about 10% of the sample evacuated their homes and about 10% reported living in an evacuation zone but not evacuating.   Frequent reasons for not evacuating included wanting to take care of one's home, having pets that could not be taken during the evacuation, and having nowhere to go.   This project has presented an unprecedented opportunity to document how people differ in response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, to answer questions about who evacuates as a hurricane is approaching (and why), and to further our understanding of the extent to which media coverage of hurricanes plays a role in risk perceptions and early stress responses to a natural disaster.
