<AbstractNarration>Most university classrooms feature either a traditional lecture-style layout with tables and chairs arranged in front-facing rows or round tables permanently arranged in groups. Some universities, though, are building classrooms of the future that have highly flexible furniture and integrated technology. These innovative classrooms can be reconfigured for multiple uses, such as lecture-style teaching, having students work together in groups, and engaging in a whole-class discussion. People assume that these flexible classrooms automatically result in better teaching and learning, but there has been little research into their effect on faculty pedagogy and student behavior. During this project, five undergraduate engineering instructors at the University of Michigan will be supported as they transition from teaching in a traditional classroom to a new flexible classroom.  These instructors will be supported to learn about teaching practices that leverage the classroom flexibility and allow them to be more responsive to students. The impact of classroom flexibility on both faculty pedagogy and student behavior will be a key research focus of this project. Such research will generate evidence to inform the design of flexible classrooms, to support instructors using new pedagogies in these flexible classrooms, and ultimately to improve student learning and behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, this project will rigorously examine faculty pedagogy (including use of both active learning and responsive teaching, in which instructors elicit and respond to students' thinking) and student behavior in five undergraduate engineering courses. These courses will all be taught in a traditional lecture hall during the first year of the project and in a flexible classroom during the second year. Before and throughout the second year of the project, professional development will take place to support faculty in using the flexible classrooms. The research team will investigate changes in faculty pedagogy through a new classroom observation protocol that captures instances of active learning and responsive teaching, through instructor interviews that investigate how an instructor enacts responsive teaching, and through a survey for students to report their perceptions of responsive teaching. The research team will also examine students' interpretation (framing) of group learning activities by analyzing students' discourse during such activities in both the traditional and flexible classrooms. This project will further the nascent field of responsive teaching in engineering by providing future researchers with a standardized responsive teaching observation protocol. It will also provide engineering faculty, professional developers, and classroom designers with evidence-based ways to enact responsive teaching, implement group learning activities, and effectively design and use flexible classrooms.</AbstractNarration>

We recommend that instructors:  Think about ways in which they can rearrange the classroom into layouts where students sit in small groups for group learning activities, as these layouts facilitate increased and improved student-student and student-instructor interaction. Clearly show students the classroom layouts that they will use at the beginning of the semester, and help the students learn how to rearrange the tables and chairs to reduce the time needed to reconfigure the classroom. Ask students to use the whiteboards or wall-mounted monitors during collaborative group work to keep them accountable and allow instructors to easily assess students? progress.     We have also developed recommendations for how classroom designers and university administrators can best support instructors in using flexible classrooms. We recommend that administrators:  Design flexible classrooms with more space per person than a standard lecture hall, as it is difficult to rearrange the furniture when there is no free space in which to move around. Provide instructors with a ?map? of the flexible classroom and furniture on an electronic slide that they can use to create room layouts that direct students in rearranging the classroom.  Give scheduling priority for instructors who want to use the flexible classroom for active learning. Make flexible classrooms available for students outside of class to use for group homework and student project team meetings. Create a formal policy describing whether instructors need to set the classroom in a particular layout at the end of their class so that instructors know what layout to expect at the beginning of their class and can leave time to rearrange the classroom when it will be necessary. Include wall-mounted monitors in all flexible classrooms and encourage instructors to write notes on a tablet computer and project their screen to the monitors, as this allows students sitting at the back of the room to see the material on the monitors without being blocked by students in front of them given the flat floor. Offer professional development to instructors who use the flexible classroom.        Last Modified: 09/20/2019       Submitted by: Cynthia J Finelli]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
