<AbstractNarration>General purpose robots are poised to enter the home and workplace in unprecedented numbers in coming years, but face the significant challenge of customization - the ability to perform user-specified tasks in many different unstructured environments. In response to this need, robot learning from demonstration (LfD) has emerged as a paradigm that allows users to quickly and naturally program robots by simply showing them how to perform a task, rather than by writing code. This methodology aims to allow non-expert users to program robots, as well as communicate embodied knowledge that is difficult to translate into formal code. However, current state-of-the-art LfD algorithms are not yet ready for widespread deployment, as they are often unreliable, need too much data, and are designed to learn in a single session in a laboratory setting.  This work addresses these issues to help enable future robots to perform important tasks ranging from in-home elderly care to reconfigurable manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this work identifies three significant technical improvements to current LfD algorithms that are needed before they can be deployed in the real world: the need for safety guarantees, the ability to learn from very limited amounts of data, and the ability to continually improve in an ongoing, life-long fashion.  A formal theory of safe LfD is developed, along with practical algorithms that provide strong probabilistic lower bounds on agent performance.  Algorithmic efficiency is addressed via a re-examining of common statistical assumptions (such as independent and identically distributed data) and through the use of multimodal side-information, such as natural language and gaze.  Finally, active learning strategies and modeling of human beliefs are used to enable interactive, continual learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
