<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to significantly increase the efficiency and reduce operating costs for water produced by membrane-based desalination.  Water scarcity is an increasingly important global-scale issue that has significant negative impacts on health, security and economies.  Recent forecasts show a dramatic increase in the number of countries that will soon be affected by water scarcity given that global water consumption is expected to significantly increase due to population growth.  Membrane-based water desalination, which at large scale requires a huge capital investment, is recognized as a primary technology that can significantly improve supply to meaningfully offset scarcity and its impacts.  A critical factor in desalination plant operations is energy consumption, which increases due to membrane fouling, thus making fouling one of the most significant factors controlling the efficiency of these plants.  The proposed in-situ, real-time sensing system can be the enabling technology to allow implementation of advanced plant control algorithms based upon accurate detection of fouling at its earliest stages.  Such active detection capability will enable the most effective implementation of fouling mitigation strategies that can be optimized to save energy and reduce cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel time-reversal waveguide sensor for detection of early-stage (ES) fouling in reverse osmosis (RO) membrane desalination, which is the dominant technology for desalinating brackish water and seawater.  Fouling in RO systems has inorganic (scaling) and organic (biofouling) components and can be a highly variable process that depends on operational parameters as well as environmental conditions.  Efficient implementation of real-time control of RO desalination for fouling mitigation requires real-time sensing.  The overall objective of the proposed work is to develop sophisticated ultrasonic sensor technology that can reliably detect scaling and biofouling in the challenging multi-layer, spiral-wound (SW) geometry of commercial-scale RO systems.  The proposed work will make use of time-reversal mirrors to produce a simple signal from a multi-mode waveguide independent of the geometry of the waveguide configuration, thus overcoming the exceedingly complex and difficult to interpret signals associated with the use of a standalone waveguide.  The goals of the project are to demonstrate the capability to detect both early-stage inorganic and organic fouling under realistic operating conditions, the reliability and the robustness of the technology, and the ability to adapt the technology to the larger size modules that are increasingly important for commercial operation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report     SBIR Phase I: Commercial Scale Separation Modules with Integrated Sensors for Cost-Effective, Real-time Detection of Membrane Fouling  SepSense Racing Testing LLC , Award Number: 1746358   Water scarcity is becoming increasingly important on a global scale with significant impacts on health, security, and economics. Climate change and increases in population are expected to further increase the portion of the world?s population affected by water scarcity. Water desalination in general and membrane reverse osmosis (RO) in particular are recognized as the primary technologies that can improve the supply of fresh water. Energy consumption is a critical factor in operation of RO desalination plants and increases as a result of membrane fouling.  Even efficient RO plants may consume more than five kilowatt-hours of electricity for every cubic meter of freshwater produced so any increase in energy usage is significant. Fouling of RO membranes also requires that larger less efficient plants be constructed which increases construction costs. Therefore any improvements to optimize plant productivity and reduce energy consumption are critical to providing low cost water from RO desalination. The focus of this project was on the development of an in-situ real-time sensing system to be used for advanced RO plant control algorithms.  Modern controls used in RO facilities have significantly increased yield, with the potential for active sensing to result in significant additional efficiency gains.  The development of a novel sensor for detection of early-stage (ES) fouling in RO membrane desalination was the primary project goal. The well-recognized phenomenon of fouling in RO systems is associated with such membrane-based separations results in blockage of the membranes, which results in reduced productivity and higher costs. Fouling in RO systems has inorganic (scaling) and organic (biofouling) components and can be a highly variable process that depends on operational parameters as well as environmental conditions. Ultrasonic methods to detect scaling on flat-sheet membranes have been demonstrated for a broad range of operational conditions.  This project was focused on developing a sensor that can reliably detect scaling and biofouling in the more challenging multi-layer, spiral-wound (SW) geometry of commercial-scale RO systems. SW membranes are housed inside composite pressure vessels. A waveguide sensor was used to propagate ultrasonic energy in a manner that produces a signal that is amenable to real-time signal processing.  The resulting short-duration high- energy waveguide signal was explored for use in the detection of ES fouling in SW modules.   As anticipated in the proposal ES detection was easier for scaling than for biofouling. This project demonstrated effective detection of ES scaling with a detection process that was robust under typical commercial plant operating conditions.  Even when used with lower cost pulse excitation of the ultrasonic sensor the ES scaling was detected under the full range of operating conditions by using signal processing that could be implemented in real time. In contrast the results from biofouling was not separable using the current sensor system.  While the range of options explored for the signal processing was limited, the same range of variation in operating conditions encountered in an operational RO facility produced changes in the response that were greater than the effect of ES biofouling.  The primary challenge is associated with the thickness and acoustic properties of the biofilm which causes the fouling.  The properties of the biofilm which covers the membrane is sufficiently similar to the acoustic properties of the RO membrane at the ultrasonic frequencies used that the change in a normally incident ultrasonic signal cannot be reliably detected.  Future work will require more basic research on the acoustic properties of the biofilm which forms on the surface of the membrane.  These properties can then be integrated into a model of wave proposition through a multi-layer system to determine the optimal operational conditions for the detector including non-normal incident waves and various wave forming techniques.    The result of this SBIR is a sensor that is effective for the detection of scaling in SW RO membranes under operational conditions.  Work was also begun as a part of the project which will enable the new sensor to be integrated within a larger framework using new hardware which is being developed for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).  The scaling sensor and some auxiliary systems sensors such as the flow meters used on the system have been integrated into the IIoT hardware and will be a part of future projects which can impact the desalination industry as well as other IIoT applications.  By integrating the waveguide sensor into the existing sensing network and improving connectivity within the plant will result in a significant step forward in RO plant control.  At the same time the inability to detect ES fouling suggest that more basic research is needed in the area of in-situ sensing and sensor development to address needs in this critical area.
