<AbstractNarration>This Noyce Capacity Building project at the University of St. Mary aims to address the well-documented national shortage of qualified STEM teachers by increasing the local pool of potential secondary STEM teacher candidates. Project partners will include three high-need school districts, two community colleges, and Ft. Leavenworth military base in the Kansas City metropolitan area. With these partnerships, the project will implement a four-pronged recruitment strategy that will enhance pathways into STEM teaching. Pathways will be available for students from local high schools and community colleges; undergraduate STEM majors at the University of St. Mary who have not previously considered teaching as a career; and second career seekers/career changers, including military affiliates. The project will incorporate strategies aimed at attracting women and underrepresented minorities to become STEM teachers. Such efforts have the potential to diversify the population of undergraduates who pursue science careers. The expectation is that, with more highly qualified and diverse STEM teachers, area students will be more likely to pursue careers in STEM. Such an increase in STEM interest has the potential to boost local and regional economies, which is relevant to the country's global competitiveness. The project team will disseminate evaluation results, sharing key findings with other educational institutions and communities that seek to attract and prepare high-quality, diverse STEM teachers in schools and districts where the teacher shortages more acutely affect poor children and children of color.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project aims to accomplish the following objectives: (1) create a process for introducing high school students to teaching as a career option; (2) improve pathways for students transferring from community colleges into the University of St. Mary STEM majors and secondary teaching certificate programs; (3) increase the number of University of St. Mary students who major in a STEM discipline and concurrently enroll in the secondary teacher certification program; and (4) develop the capacity for ongoing outreach to military-connected candidates/career changers. Project results have the potential to advance knowledge and understanding of (i) how to recruit traditionally hard-to-reach populations, such as military-connected individuals; (ii) how to leverage existing partnerships, including those with school districts, community colleges, and military bases; and (ii) strategies that are particularly effective in attracting STEM students and graduates to careers in teaching. Findings will be relevant for many communities and educational institutions seeking to attract more highly qualified candidates into STEM teacher education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The main goal of this capacity-building project was to develop pathways to recruit a diverse pool of potential candidates for teaching STEM in grades 6-12. The focus of recruitment for STEM teaching candidates included high schools, community colleges, current students who have not yet declared a major, and career changers, including retired military. In order to develop outreach for these different pools of potential candidates, several initiatives were enacted.</p> <p>Among USM's goals: increase awareness of STEM teaching careers among area high school students. To that end, the university provided recruitment materials to over 150 Kansas schools, and launched social media advertising that reached nearly 20,000 high school-aged students in our area, and over 15,000 parents of high school students. Those outreach efforts were funded by the project, and showed results: One targeted high school, for example, sent 30 students to a related event in November 2018.</p> <p>A second effort focused on drawing up to 45 students to the university's Future Teachers Academy a five-day residential experience that immersed these students in STEM teaching activities while they learned about related career options all while being able to experience dorm life.</p> <p>Recruitment for FTA began in March for an early June 2018 experience. Ten high school students and two community college students enrolled. In June of 2019, a second cohort of 12, 10 high school and 2 college students participated. Outreach to these participants continue from the education department&nbsp; to encourage considering USM as a college choice. Plans are underway to continue offering a summer experience for Future Teachers through the education department.</p> <p>Another objective was to improve pathways into USM STEM and secondary teaching certificate programs for transfer students.</p> <p>In November 2018, USM hired a Director of Partnerships who was able to develop three formal agreements between community colleges and USM. Two more agreements are underway. At all 5 community colleges, faculty are working with USM faculty to develop pathways that allows students to complete an Associate's degree at the community college and then transfer to USM for the four-year degree and teacher certification.</p> <p>In 2016-17, USM had 6 students who transferred from a community college as a STEM major. During the 2017-18 academic year, there were 14 students transferring in with a STEM major and in Fall 2019, there were 9 additional students transferring in as STEM majors. Currently, none of the STEM transfer students have declared secondary teaching as an interest but it is expected those numbers will increase with the agreements in place and more intentional discussions between advising personnel at the community colleges and USM.</p> <p>As part of the project, USM also sought to grow the number of students who major in STEM (biology, chemistry, or math) and concurrently enroll in the secondary teacher certification program from 3 in 2017 to at least 10 at the end of the grant period. In 2018, there were 6 math teacher education&nbsp; and 1 biology teacher education candidates. As of Fall 2019, there are 6 math teacher education candidates, 1 biology teacher education candidate and 2 chemistry teacher education candidates who all plan to teach at the secondary level. The Education Department and Division of Natural Sciences and Math have been more intentional in recruitment of their own STEM majors to increase the overall numbers of students seeking teaching certification through lunch- and-learns, advising sessions and guest speakers who are currently STEM teachers.</p> <p>The final objective was to develop ongoing outreach to military-connected candidates/career changers who possess a STEM degree and may be interested in teaching. The goal was to annually reach a minimum of 100 military-connected candidates and career changers who possess a STEM degree with information about careers in teaching and to increase enrollment in the fast-track master's program from 3 in 2017 to at least 10 at the end of the grant period. Ultimately, 2500 postcards and 35,000 emails were sent to career changers with information about the MA in secondary education opportunity. Over 46,000 career changers were targeted through social media advertising. Recruiters attended military career fairs and a networking event was held on campus to grow awareness about the Masters program. The Innovative Secondary Education Masters degree program is seeing growth from the initial cohort of 3 with 7 total candidates currently enrolled. Of those 7, 2 candidates seeking teacher certification in secondary math. Outreach to career changers, especially military connected personnel will continue.</p> <p>Overall, our project was successful, as we developed processes to better recruit STEM teaching candidates. As we recognize that there several methods to recruitment of STEM teachers, we seek out multiple pathways including partnerships with high schools and community colleges to recruit quality STEM teaching candidates. Information from the project will be shared with Kansas State Department of Education and publicly through the USM Education Department website.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/26/2019<br>      Modified by: Gwen&nbsp;Landever</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1758499/1758499_10534598_1574802179855_USMlogo--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1758499/1758499_10534598_1574802179855_USMlogo--rgov-800width.jpg" title="University of Saint Mary Logo"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1758499/1758499_10534598_1574802179855_USMlogo--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="University of Saint Mary Logo"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">University of Saint Mary Logo</div> <div class="imageCredit">John Shultz</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Gwen&nbsp;Landever</div> <div class="imageTitle">University of Saint Mary Logo</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
