<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to make quiet products and systems that have pipe and duct sound transmission.  Systems like automobile exhausts and intakes, building heating and ventilation systems, and fluid flow piping all transmit sound from power generating equipment to human receivers. In order to reduce the amount of noise to which people are exposed, passive and active noise control systems are incorporated in pipe and duct systems. These systems are currently large, heavy and inefficient. The application of a compact and lightweight coaxial active noise control system has potential implications on many industries where size of noise control elements constrain design. More importantly, the reduction of noise in the environment has potential health and wellness benefits for all members of society through environmental stress reduction. Reducing noise emitted from mechanical pipe and duct systems is an important step in reducing overall environmental noise exposure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project explores the market need for coaxial thermophones (or heat-driven solid state speaker), particularly those manufactured using carbon nanotube (CNT) thin films. The idea of a thermophone was developed as early as 1898. However, practical applications of the thermophone have not been realized. This is mainly due to lack of low heat capacity material to manufacture the thermophone. CNT thin-films enable an efficient thermophone due to their low heat capacity per unit area as well as their relatively low production cost. Current active noise control technologies rely on outdated moving coil transducer design, which limits their widespread implementation due to size, weight, cost, and performance restrictions. A coaxial thermophone transducer design reduces size and weight significantly while increasing potential noise control performance. This I-Corps national program will lead to better understanding of customer segments, value propositions, customer pain points, value chains, delivery methods, partnerships, and a minimum viable product.</AbstractNarration>
