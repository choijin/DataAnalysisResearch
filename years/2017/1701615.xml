<AbstractNarration>The IEEE Security &amp; Privacy Symposium is a top-tier venue for cybersecurity and privacy research, and has been for much of its 36-plus-year history. Student attendance at S&amp;P is an important part of graduate education in cybersecurity. The 2017 Symposium will consist of approximately 60 technical papers and  Systematization of Knowledge papers, which provide valuable background to students who are learning the literature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides travel support to encourage participation in this IEEE Symposium and its Student Program Committee by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience. Organizers encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project is to support U.S.-based students or U.S. citizens studying abroad who are interested in attending the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, but which will not be able to attend without the support from a travel award.  For many years, we have been using donations to help support travel costs for highly talented students who otherwise may not be able to participate in the Symposium. In particular this travel award is supporting two events: student attendance to the Student PC meeting in New York (in Google's offices in Manhattan), and student attendance to the main symposium and the associated workshops.  This award was able to support the travel expenses of 23 and 19 US-based students for the 2017 and 2018 (respectively) IEEE S&amp;P  Student PC meetings in New York city, and 24 US-based students to attend the 2017 IEEE S&amp;P conference and workshops.  Participation in symposia like this is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work in the field.  The support requested in this proposal enabled the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy.
