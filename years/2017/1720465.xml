<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports collaborative research and education on the collective quantum mechanical behavior of electrons in materials and of solid helium-4. The project is using and further developing two state-of-the-art computational approaches suitable for the study of quantum mechanical systems consisting of many interacting particles, the Worm Algorithm (WA) and Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC), which were both introduced by the research team. With WA the team expects to advance understanding of striking properties demonstrated by imperfect crystals of helium-4 at low temperatures near the absolute zero of temperature, such as the frictionless transport of helium-4 atoms through the crystal, called supertransport, and an almost liquid-like response to an arbitrarily weak stress, called quantum plasticity. With DiagMC the team will address certain notoriously difficult problems concerning the behavior of many-electron systems, including the problem of how electrons develop the cooperative quantum mechanical state to become superconductors. Superconductors can conduct electricity without resistance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding quantum plasticity, supertransport, and the interplay between them in solid helium-4 is a major challenge for modern low-temperature physics. More generally, there is an urgent need for universal methods suitable for describing the collective quantum behavior of electrons across all fields of physics, quantum chemistry, and materials science. The simulations at the core of the project provide crucial information about quantitative and qualitative properties of these systems, test analytical predictions, help establish the proper theoretical framework, and provide foundation for the unambiguous analysis of experimental data and the further development of measuring techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An integral part of the project is the training of graduate students in advanced theoretical and numerical techniques, as well as in  parallel computing. The project involves developing and maintaining a tutorial website on the numerical methods used, and the PIs plan to edit a book on the same, targeting a broad scientific audience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports collaborative research and education on the collective quantum behavior of electrons in materials and of solid helium-4. The PIs will use and further develop two state-of-the-art Monte Carlo methods introduced by the research team: the Worm Algorithm (WA), and Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC). The main goals of the project are: i) to use DiagMC for studying notoriously difficult condensed-matter problems such as: the Cooper instability in the fermionic repulsive Hubbard model including the possibility of high critical temperatures, modeling electronic systems with controlled ab initio treatment of long-range Coulomb and electron-phonon interactions, creating alternative formulations for strongly correlated models, and understanding the quantum-to-classical correspondence in frustrated spin models; ii) to carry out WA studies of disorder-induced quantum physics in solid He-4, such as supertransport and quantum plasticity associated with generic (tilted) dislocations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding quantum plasticity, supertransport, and the interplay between them in solid helium-4 is a major challenge for modern low-temperature physics.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 1. New applications of Diagrammatic Monte Carlo   The method of Diagrammatic Monte Carlo applies to any problem where the answer is specified in terms of either convergent or re-summable series of integrals/sums, with Feynman diagrams being a typical and the most important example.  With this method, we successfully addressed a number of important systems relevant to the first-principles description of strongly interacting electrons: resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, mobility of electrons in semiconductors, Fermi-Hubbard model ("standard model" of strong local correlations), frustrated quantum magnets, and fermions with resonant (infinite scattering length) interactions.      2. Implicit renormalization approach to the problem of superconductivity  Superconductivity is a physical phenomenon observed in certain materials where electrical resistance vanishes. Unlike an ordinary metal, a superconductor has a characteristic critical temperature Tc below which the resistance drops abruptly to zero; an electric current through a loop of superconducting wire can persist indefinitely with no power source. These properties make superconductors some of the most fascinating and desirable materials, especially with high Tc. Being able to predict Tc for new materials reliably is a grand challenge for theory.  In the vast majority of cases, brute-force Diagrammatic Monte Carlo simulations at temperatures of the order of Tc are virtually impossible. It is of crucial importance to find a way of extracting Tc from simulations at temperatures much higher than Tc. Determining Tc from known system properties at temperatures much higher than Tc cannot be done reliably by following existing numeric protocols. We developed the so-called implicit renormalization approach that allows one to achieve this goal. The implicit renormalization approach can be naturally combined with the Diagrammatic Monte Carlo techniques.      3. Homotopic action: a pathway to convergent diagrammatic theories   The major obstacle preventing Feynman diagrammatic expansions from accurately solving many-fermion systems in strongly correlated regimes is the series slow convergence/divergence problem. Several techniques that have been proposed to address this issue emerge as dissimilar mathematical procedures aimed at different aspects of the problem. We developed a new general approach that we call "homotopic action."  Our approach offers a universal and systematic framework for unifying the existing&mdash;and generating new&mdash;methods and ideas to formulate a physical system in terms of a convergent diagrammatic series. The approach can lead to a breakthrough in numerically solving quantum many-body problems.     4. Establishing annual International Summer School on Recent Advances in Quantum Phenomena  With an international team lead by nobelist Frank Wilczek, we established the annual International Summer School on Recent Advances in Quantum Phenomena (NORDITA, Stockholm, since 2018).      5. Establishing Precision Many Body Physics (PMBP) Initiative at UMass, Amherst   The mission of the initiative is to facilitate international collaboration in cutting edge research directed toward controlled understanding of collective properties of quantum and classical matter.  Members:  Robert Hallock, Nikolay Prokof’ev, Tigran Sedrakyan, Boris Svistunov, and Romain Vasseur, (UMass, Physics), Panayotis Kevrekidis (UMass, Mathematics and Statistics), David Hall (Amherst College).   N. Prokof’ev and R. Vasseur are current co-directors.  Activities:   (i) PMBP International Workshop (50+ participants) at UMass, October 2018: https://blogs.umass.edu/pmbp/    (ii) PMBP Seminar Series: 2 seminars per month during the academic year.
