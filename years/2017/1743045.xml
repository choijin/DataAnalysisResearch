<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the 2017 Joint Conference on Electronic Properties of 2D Systems &amp; Modulated Semiconductor Systems to be held at the Pennsylvania State University. The award is jointly funded by the CMP and CMMT programs in the Division of Materials Research. This conference will bring together leading scientists from a variety of fields in a collegial atmosphere that supports open discussion to discuss issues at the cutting edge of two dimensional materials and systems.  This meeting will focus on topics at the forefront of  Condensed Matter Physics such as topological phases and the development of new devices. It will bring together senior and junior researchers from around the world.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant was intended as financial support for junior participants to attend two International conferences.  The conferences are "Electronic Properties of Two-Dimensional Systems -22 (EP2DS-22)" and "Modulaed Semiconductor Structures -18 (MSS-18)", both held jointly at Penn State during the period of July 31 - August 4, 2017.   EP2DS features fundamental physics arising in two-dimensional systems &ndash; such as semiconductor quantum wells, graphene, topological insulators, oxide heterostructures, and transition metal dichalcogenides &ndash; as well as in quantum wires and quantum dots. More specifically, it includes  Electronic, optical and magnetic properties Fractional quantum Hall effect Majorana fermions Spin related phenomena Quantum information Superconductivity and metal-insulator transitions Novel probes and experimental techniques   MSS places greater emphasis on synthesis, processing, characterization, and applications of modulated systems. A broader range of novel materials is included. The specific topics are:  Semiconductor heterostructures and superlattices Electronic and optical properties of quantum dots and nanowires Physics of excitons, optomechanics, and terahertz-related phenomena Nanophotonic structures including photonic crystals and metamaterials Spintronics and spin phenomena in modulated structures Physics and devices for quantum information processing Carbon nanotubes, graphene, and other carbon-based materials Novel modulated and hybrid structures, including MEMS/NEMS, 2D crystals, organic and bio-based structures Advances in growth, processing, and probing of modulated structures   Further information about the conference can be found at https://sites.psu.edu/ep2ds2017/.   The grant was used to fund travel for six junior female participants and registration for local students.        Last Modified: 06/01/2018       Submitted by: Jainendra K Jain]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
