<AbstractNarration>This research project aims to demonstrate the physical principles underlying a new type of electron accelerator that would be thousands of times smaller and less expensive than the best modern accelerators.  Since the 1930s, scientists have built ever bigger and more expensive machines, called accelerators, to accelerate electrons to more than 99% of the speed of light, which Einstein discovered to be the speed limit of the universe.  At such enormous speeds, electrons can probe into nature's deepest subatomic secrets, irradiate cancerous tumors, and generate powerful x-rays that measure the structure of molecules essential to life.  One of America's biggest electron accelerators, a 2-mile-long machine called "SLAC" (which originally stood for "Stanford Linear Accelerator Center") accelerates electrons to 99.99999999% of the speed of light.  The energy carried by such an electron, at 30 giga-electronvolts (GeV), is less than a mosquito uses to flap its wings once, but it's a lot of energy for one electron.   The goal of this research project is to enable tabletop electron accelerators that are thousands of times smaller and less expensive than SLAC, but which can nevertheless accelerate electrons to the same energy as SLAC does.  The new technology is a long, narrow pipe made of plasma, or ionized gas (the same state of matter one finds inside fluorescent light bulbs and stars).  This pipe is a "racetrack" that is intended ultimately to confine and guide electrons, and a powerful laser pulse that fuels their acceleration, until they reach 30 GeV. A separate powerful laser will be used to shape the fluid-like plasma into a pipe.  Computer calculations will be used to understand how the plasma pipe forms, and a model version of the pipe will be demonstrated in the laboratory.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-year project will elucidate the science underlying the formation of cylindrical plasma waveguides with axial electron density in the range between 1 and 3 times 10^17 particles per cm^3 and radius of ~50 Âµm.  Such waveguides can ultimately guide 100 J, 150 fs drive pulses from the Texas Petawatt (PW) Laser in a low-order mode at relativistic intensity up to the pump depletion limit, in order to extend the performance of a single-stage 2 GeV laser-plasma electron accelerator to the tens-of-GeV level.  The channel formation method is based upon physical principles developed during the 1990s, but is being extended to ~20x lower plasma density.  Formation of short (~1 cm) channels in tenuous He plasma will be demonstrated, using 2J, 80-300 ps drive pulses available in the laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin.  This prototype setup will enable the duration, energy and focus of channel-forming pulse, and the pre-ionization and doping conditions that optimize plasma heating and channel formation at low plasma density to be discovered.  Simulations of channel formation in tenuous helium, and channeled propagation of relativistic laser pulses, by the research group at the University of Colorado Boulder will guide experiments.  The intellectual merit lies in discovering laser-plasma conditions that optimize formation of high quality, single-mode plasma channels of lower density than ever previously demonstrated.  The broader impacts include developing plasma waveguide technology that may ultimately extend single-stage energy gain of future laser-plasma accelerators to levels typical of SLAC; advancing the careers of three doctoral students from historically under-represented groups; and introducing an undergraduate student to professional research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Energetic particles from accelerators probe into Nature's deepest subatomic secrets, irradiate cancerous tumors, and generate powerful x-rays that measure the structure of molecules essential to life.  Nearly all of the worldâs 30,000 particle accelerators, which serve industry, hospitals and discovery science, are based on radio-frequency technology developed in the 1930s.  The escalating cost of scaling this technology to meet todayâs industrial and scientific needs is now prompting a worldwide search for new concepts for accelerating particles to high energy more cheaply, and with smaller machines, than conventional approaches.  Accelerators based on pliable, microscopic structures made of ionized gas, or "plasma", have emerged as the most promising candidates.  Recently several laboratories, including the P.I.âs, have accelerated electrons to several giga-electron-volts (GeV) in a laser-driven plasma cell only a few inches long, a task that requires a conventional accelerator a third-of-a-mile-long.   In this project, a research scientist Dr. Rafal Zgadzaj and two Ph.D. students Jason Brooks and Isabella Pagano from U. Texas-Austin carried out laboratory experiments and computer simulations aimed at expanding the capabilities of GeV plasma accelerators in 3 specific ways:  1) They developed a strategy for lengthening them.  If a few-inch-long laser-driven plasma cell accelerates electrons to a few GeV, a few-foot-long cell could potentially accelerate them to a few tens of GeV, equivalent to the two-mile long SLAC accelerator in California.  But there are two catches.  First, plasma denser than 1/100 atmosphere scatters away the laser drive pulse after a few inches.  Secondly, even in plasma less dense than 1/100 atmosphere, the tightly focused laser driver spreads out after a few inches, rendering it ineffective. Through simulations in collaboration with Prof. J. Cary (U. Colorado-Boulder), and experiments at U. Texas-Austin, we figured out a way to coax 1/100-atmosphere helium plasma into temporarily forming a narrow, hollow pipe through a process called optical field ionization.  Such a pipe can guide the intense laser drive pulse, like an optical fiber, preventing it from spreading out.  Since itâs made of plasma, the intense light doesnât damage it.  Although we lacked equipment to scale the plasma pipe to several feet in length --- that may be our next proposal --- we worked out the basic physics of how to form it.  2) They developed a method for injecting tiny electron bunches into them.  All accelerators need injectors, i.e. devices to insert electrons (or other charged particles) into the accelerator so that it has something to accelerate.  The injected nugget must be tiny and dense, so that the accelerated electron bunch has high peak current at its destination. It must also be injected at exactly the right location, so that it doesnât veer out of control in the acceleratorâs powerful fields. In a conventional accelerator, the injection target is the size of a shoebox.  In a plasma accelerator itâs the size of a small speck of dust.  Working with a team of two-dozen collaborators at SLAC, which has built a dedicated facility to study plasma accelerators, we helped work out a way to inject an electron nugget into a plasma accelerator with the required pinpoint precision: we used a laser pulse to ionize electrons from background helium gas inside the plasma accelerator cavity as it raced by at nearly the speed of light.  Itâs like suddenly creating a passenger in the backseat of a light-speed convertible. The team demonstrated that the "passenger" survived injection and acceleration without injury:  i.e. the electron bunch remained tiny and dense, as needed for it to discover new particles, irradiate tumors or create powerful x-ray pulses.   3) They developed understanding of limits to their repetition rate.  To do their many jobs efficiently, accelerators must deliver charged particle bunches to a target as frequently as possible.  But like any machine pushed to its limits, a plasma accelerator can overheat.  SLACâs plasma accelerator facility was well suited for measuring how this happens.  Dr. Zgadzaj carried out pioneering experiments that measured how fast a 1/100-atmosphere lithium plasma expanded after SLACâs electron bunches (rather than a laser pulse) drove a plasma accelerator inside of it.  The answer:  600 miles per second, unabated for over one nanosecond.  For a physicist, that took the plasmaâs temperature.  Working with an international team of computer simulation experts, Zgadzaj worked out detailed atomic physics of how the enormous electrical energy stored in the plasma accelerator transformed into hot expanding plasma.  While this didnât yet solve the engineering problem of how to manage and remove heat to achieve higher repetition rate, it discovered the basic thermal physics on which such a solution must ultimately be based.   In summary, this project advanced the science of GeV plasma accelerators, currently the best candidate for miniaturizing particle accelerator technology.  It also advanced the career of a young research scientist, and contributed to the PhD projects of two graduate students.
