<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this I-Corps project involves a novel probiotic, which potentially treats gut problems including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), weight gain, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).  Many key mechanisms of the human body are in part control by the microbes that live in our gut. The way that we currently view, diagnose, and treat many diseases is fundamentally changing with this knowledge. While dozens of diseases are now intrinsically tied with dysbiosis in the gut, of which 1000s of species of microbes reside, we currently have few probiotics as treatment despite the fact that the number of human clinical trials on probiotics in the past 10 years has increased 20-fold. When developed, this technology can potentially be applied to supplements and drugs to help counter noncompliance, and therefore have a significant commercial impact in other fields as well. This is, in addition, to the broad reaching impact on helping individuals with gut problems, which is estimated to be over 50 million. This product also provides an irritant free alternative for those desiring a regular probiotic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project surrounds the bacteria, Paenibacillus 79-R4 (Pb 79-R4), which has been isolated and characterized.  In vitro trials show very encouraging results that indicated that this strain drastically reduces enteric methane and hydrogen production, which could be transferred to a commercial product.  Pb 79-R4 eliminates the gases that are positively correlated with gut problems in humans- in animal models the supplemental-Pb strain decreased methane-producing activity by over 50%. This technology will also include a prebiotic and a novel beverage-based interactive mode of delivery, which will work in synergy with the bacteria and lets the user know it is working allowing the effects of the probiotic to work faster and decrease the abandonment period in first-time users. In addition, results from in vitro simulations have resulted in significant reductions in certain pathogens.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>During the I-Corps reporting period a total of 255 customer discovery interviews were conducted, we formed a company (Bezoar Laboratories LLC), entered 3 pitch competitions, established a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the USDA-ARS, and are now part of MassChallenge in Austin, Texas. Interviews were split into three main markets: human probiotics, livestock probiotics, and pet probiotics. A total of 120 interviews were done for the human probiotic sector. Customer segments for this market include probiotic consumers, probiotic manufacturermanagers, nutritionists and gastroenterologists, sales/marketing directors of probiotic companies, managers of probiotic mixing companies,CEO/leaders in probiotic R&amp;D companies, and retailers such as Whole Foods, Walmart, GNC, etc. A total of 130 interviews for the livestock sector were done and customer segments include feedlot manufacturer managers, feed coop managers, ranchers, dairy farmers, animal scientists, CEO/leaders infeed R&amp;D companies. Initial interviews were conducted in the human probiotic sector because this seemed like the most attractive market and we were excited to make aproduct for human consumers. Customer segments hypothesized under this include millennial women who are proactive about their health, seniors whoare irregular, and probiotic companies interested in expanding their selection. The most interesting learning was that almost all the people who took probiotics did not feel a noticeable difference, but continued to take the supplements because they believed probiotics are good for their health even if they do not feel the effects. While most said they were interested in a new probiotic, few mentioned a need for new strains of probiotics. There also appeared to be large misunderstandings about what probiotics are and what they do, so introducing new products to the market would need to heavily educate the public to be competitive and point out what is unique about our probiotic.The probiotic was originally developed and patented to decrease ruminant methane emissions, improve cattle health via reduction in pathogens, and increase their meat and dairy product through better feed efficiency, so the second market segment was for livestock probiotics. Customer segments in this sector include: ranchers and dairy farmers, feed lot manufacturer acquisitions managers, CEOs of feedlots, probiotic manufacturer staff, feed coop managers, animal scientists, and environmental agency leaders. Nearly everyone we spoke to from feed lot manufacturer staff to ranchers naturally mentioned one or more of the three issues Pb 79R4 tackles. Value propositions were especially strong as there is no product that can decrease methane that is economically viable. Current solutions include red seaweed, nitrate, and 3-NOP that are either too expensive to produce or unsafe for cattle. As such, the increased meat and dairy product that would mean overall increase in revenue for the rancher or farmer, was significant valueadded, along with greater methane reduction (50% using our probiotic vs. 30% using competing inventions). While people were interested and pledged funding or non-monetary help and resources, many were concerned about the safety and regulatory pathway, and wanted to see a larger-scale production study to back in vitro studies, which is what we are currently working on. Through these interviews, we established that although human probiotics are attractive in the market, our probiotic does not address a great pain point for these consumers. The true pain point is the use of the probiotic for methane mitigation in cattle, which ranchers, dairy farmers, environmentalists,and many in the general public are concerned about, and for which there is no product in the market.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/25/2020<br>      Modified by: Charles&nbsp;Hinton</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
