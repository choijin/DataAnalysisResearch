<AbstractNarration>This project investigates how the external environment shapes the immune system. Seahorses provide an ideal model for studying host-microbe interactions for three reasons. The genetic structure of their immune system is simple. Also, their dispersal capability is limited, and their geographic distribution is broad. Previous research on the pot-bellied seahorse across its range in New Zealand and southeastern Australia found striking differences between the pattern of genetic diversity in those parts of the genome related to immune response versus those parts of the genome that are not under selection. This proposal aims to experimentally test field observations of host-microbe associations. It will address a key question in host-microbial co-evolutionary theory: Are host-microbe associations in natural populations a type of local adaptation for immunity? Marine environments provide an essential economic engine for food, transportation, commerce and recreation, but we still have a poor understanding of how human activities impact resident organisms and influence ecosystem health. The results of this research will be incorporated into the NSF-funded Authentic Research Experience in Microbiology program serving students at ten City University of New York campuses, and will inform marine conservation planning and management through the Ministry of Primary Industries, FishServe Commercial Fisheries Services, and the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Host-microbe interactions are an underappreciated driver of adaptation. This project will evaluate a potential mechanism of local adaptation at the major histocompatibility class II locus (MHII) by testing the fitness consequences of host-microbe associations in the marine species Hippocampus abdominalis (the pot-bellied seahorse). Previous research on wild H. abdominalis across its geographic range detected enhanced levels of MHII variability at the population level relative to neutral loci. Sequencing of the host gut microbiome indicates that the local environment (urban, agricultural, or pristine) has a significant effect on the microbial composition of hosts collected from these sites. Experimental populations of H. abdominalis will be exposed to microbes showing positive, negative, or neutral associations with hosts in natural populations, and effects of MHII genotype on growth, condition, immune response and survival will be measured. The research proposed here represents an exciting opportunity to explicitly test field observations of host-microbe associations and targets a key evolutionary concept, microbe-mediated local adaptation, using an experimental protocol reflecting natural pathways of microbial exposure</AbstractNarration>

The microbial local adaptation hypothesis proposes that <em>H. abdominalis</em> hosts that survive to breeding age have inherited major histocompatibility class II (MHII) alleles that 1) protect the host from harmful ?human-associated? microbe species and/or 2) ignore benign or beneficial ?pristine-associated? microbe species that could protect the host. The experiment was designed to explicitly test the fitness benefits of host-microbe associations identified by field research. Human-associated microbes were identified from wild breeding adult guts living in nearshore environments exposed within 1 km to human wastewater. Pristine-associated microbes were identified from wild breeding adult guts living in nearshore environments &gt;100 km from human activity or agriculture. Major goals included 1) the acquisition and genetic analysis of research subjects; 2) the construction of an experimental aquatic system; 3) the execution of the microbial exposure experiment; and 4) data analyses and presentation.</p> <p>&nbsp;Goal 1: Experimental animals with adequate genetic diversity were obtained allowing the project to move forward to completion. Experimental microbes were obtained and successfully cultured for use in this project. Goal 2: Aquatic experimental tanks were constructed in September 2018. Following successful construction of the aquatic system, <em>H. abdominalis</em> breeding and rearing were performed to test all aspects of the experimental design from September to December 2018. Goal 3: An initial experiment was carried out to completion from January to April 2019. Experimental details were optimized during and following this initial experiment. Improvements were implemented from March to July 2019 in a second experiment, which proved successful. A third and final experiment was carried out from July to September 2019.

Students presented their contributions as scientific posters at Science Day 2019, which is a one-day STEM conference for the education community of Brooklyn hosted by our institution, Brooklyn College. Doctoral candidate and Co-PI Jimiane Ashe successfully designed and executed a multi-discipline series of research experiments critical for progress as an early career scientist. Ms. Ashe personally mentored all STEM undergraduate and post-baccalaureate students participating in this research, which is important for pedagogical development of an instructor and course material derived from these scientific results.</p> <p>&nbsp;Juvenile <em>H. abdominalis</em> (starting at ~31 days old) were exposed to one of four experimental microbe conditions for 28 days: a human-associated microbe, a pristine-associated microbe, a ?mixed? combination of the human- and pristine-associated microbes, and no microbe exposure as a negative control. Weight and standard body length (SL) were collected for each juvenile before and after microbial exposure. Mortality was also recorded. Juveniles exposed to the human-associated microbe on average weighed 61% less, were 24% shorter, and had a 35% lower survival than the control group. Juveniles exposed to the pristine-associated microbe on average weighed 8% more, were 58% longer, and had a 21% higher survival than the control group. Juveniles exposed to the mixed microbe condition on average weighed 12% less, were 27% longer, and had a 12% higher survival than the control group. Statistical t-tests revealed that the SL of juveniles exposed to the pristine-associated microbe was the only metric significantly different from the control group.
