<AbstractNarration>Current engineering practices and regulatory approaches on the use of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum are too antiquated to meet the ever&lt;br/&gt;surging demand on the RF spectrum. A promising new solution to tackle this spectrum scarcity problem is to equip radio networks with artificial intelligence so that they can learn and predict the RF environment, as well as be social by interacting with other radio networks, leading to more collaborative use of the RF spectrum. This project will develop a software-defined radio system that can intelligently sense and adapt to others' use of the radio spectrum and collaborate with other radio networks in sharing the common RF spectrum. The developed system will be characterized by its flexibility to quickly and agile adaptability to changes in how others are using the RF spectrum. It will be also be characterized by how it uses machine-learning techniques to both extract the most relevant information about how the RF spectrum is being used and to adapt the communication strategies based on this information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dynamically reconfigurable system architecture will be developed in this project to make most efficient use of all the available computational resources in order to support all radio and ML functionalities. This highly flexible software-defined structure takes advantage of the learned knowledge about the RF environment by adapting the physical and medium access control layers use of spectrum and coordinating this utilization through carefully designed network protocols. A machine learning system is developed to identify the key information about the evolution of the communication scenario, and autonomously learn the state of the model.  Reinforcement learning will be used to generate appropriate adaptive communication strategies based on the system state.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project enables Team GatorWings' participation in the DARPA Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2) and research efforts in collaborative spectrum intelligence. In this project, we aim to develop a software-defined radio network that can autonomously sense and adapt to others' use of the radio spectrum and collaborate with other radio networks in sharing the common radio frequency (RF) spectrum. The system we develop is characterized by its flexibility to quickly and agilely adapt to changes in how others are using the RF spectrum, as well as by how it uses machine-learning techniques to both extract the most relevant information about how the RF spectrum is being used and to adapt the communication strategies based on this information.  Our approach to SC2 is to design a radio network that is fundamentally sound in communication techniques, adaptable to different channel environments. In particular, multiple modulation and coding options in the the physical layer (PHY), different channelization and medium-access control (MAC) mechanisms, and flexible link-layer automatic repeat request (ARQ) schemes were developed. These radio functionalities support dynamic reconfiguration of the waveform and MAC protocol to adapt to the wide range of potential SC2 scenarios. In addition, we judicially allocate different resources from the CPU, GPU, and FPGA fabrics to different radio functions so as to maximize the implementation efficiency, leaving sufficient computational resources for artificial intellence algorithms to make system decisions most suitable for each channel scenario.  Our radio network placed among the top ten teams in the Preliminary Event #1 (PE1) and Preliminary Event #2 (PE2) of SC2. We are also a finalist entering into the SC2 Championship Event (SCE) to be held in October 2019.    Four graduate students and four undergraduate students from the University of Florida have participated in Phases 1 and 2 of SC2. Through the SC2 competition, the students have received training on many topics, including software-defined radio research and development, machine learning, and etc. In addition, our team has contributed to the testing and debugging of Colosseum as an active user of the RF emulation system.
