<AbstractNarration>This award will support students, postdoctoral researchers and early career investigators at the American Society of Microbiology(ASM) Conference on Cell-Cell Communication in Bacteria (CCCB6) to be held in Athens, Georgia in October, 2017.  The conference showcases innovative new multi-disciplinary and theory-driven research to garner a deeper understanding of the cell-cell communication underpinning coordinated group behaviors in bacteria.  Such signaling within and between species of microbes, often termed ?quorum sensing?, controls a range of microbial behaviors and processes with enormous consequences for human and animal health, agriculture, energy, and the environment.  The budget requested will be used to support travel of early-career investigators, as well as postdoctoral and student researchers, several of whom will be selected for oral presentations based on their submitted conference abstracts. The organizers of the conference have made a particular effort to be broadly inclusive in terms of gender balance and minority participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will bring together leading researchers in the field including international participants.  The organizers present a forward-thinking agenda at this conference, complementing the microbiological focus with presentations by theorists, synthetic biologists, computational biologists, engineers, chemists and physicists.  Sessions cover such topics as the role of bacterial cell-cell communication in disease, the chemical diversity of signals, the evolution of microbial social behavior, bacterial group behaviors, computational modeling of regulatory circuits, ecological perspectives on cell-cell signaling, and applied aspects of signal disruption.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported the American Society for Microbiology Conference on Cell-Cell Communication in Bacteria (CCCB), which was held in Athens, Georgia, October 16-19, 2017.  The program showcased innovative new research based on theory-driven, multi-disciplinary approaches and the use of novel technologies to garner a deeper understanding of the cell-cell communication underpinning coordinated group behaviors in bacteria.  Sessions and talks included applied areas of research, such as the subversion of undesired signaling-dependent bacterial behaviors and the synthesis of rationally designed signaling circuits.      This international meeting gathered 123 registered scientists from 18 countries, with over a quarter of the attendees and a similar percentage of the speakers coming from outside the United States.  A post-meeting survey returned by 41% of attendees indicated a high level of satisfaction.  Including an overall satisfaction score of 4.40 on a 5-point scale.  Among respondents, 97% either agreed (31%) or strongly agreed (66%) that they would recommend this meeting to a colleague.     The budget from this NSF award provided supplemental travel support for three invited speakers and fourteen other presenters chosen from abstracts.  Overall, this NSF grant supported travel for four early-career faculty (assistant professors), six postdocs, and seven students. The scientists receiving this support represented a demographic mix that reflected the diversity of attendees at the meeting.  For example, over half of those applying for and receiving travel support were women.  Travel grant awardees included those with research in areas NSF has emphasized for interdisciplinary integration with the biological sciences.
