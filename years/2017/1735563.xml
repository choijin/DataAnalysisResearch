<AbstractNarration>Far too many talented students are not pursuing graduate school, or a career in higher education and research.  We believe this is because students do not understand what to expect in graduate school, or what such a career entails. To address this problem, University of Maryland, in collaboration with faculty at Cornell University and the Max Planck Society in Germany are starting a series of research summer schools.  The goal of the school is to introduce world-class research to top quality students, and engage them, one-on-one and in small groups, with leading researchers in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for approximately 25 students from the United States to attend the first iteration of the school, which will be held on the premises of the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, in Saarbruecken Germany, from August 8-13th, 2017.  Students have applied online, and are evaluated based on grades, a statement and recommendation letters.  Our central thesis is that short, hands-on experience with leaders from a wide range of interesting areas of Computer Science will effectively entice many undergraduates to  commit to longer-term Research Experience for Undergraduates (REUs), graduate school, and ultimately careers in research.  To evaluate this, we will track participants' progress and trajectory, both during and after the research school, using questionnaires, one-on-one advising sessions, and post-school research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research school is designed around the belief that exposing students, especially women and minorities, to the breadth and diversity of Computer Science research, especially early in their careers, will make them more likely to pursue REUs and, eventually, careers in research.  Being exposed to high quality research and being able to work with leaders in their fields will make the option of a research career "real", and have a transformative impact for the positive in the attendee's academic careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have started a new series of annual summer research schools aimed at giving students a brief but intensive exposure to research. The school website is available at  https://cmmrs.mpi-sws.org   The high-level idea is to provide an engaging environment in which students can interact with preeminent researchers from multiple areas of Computer Science, but to do so in a short enough amount of time (on the order of a week) so as to appeal to students who may be skeptical of what research has to offer.   This proposal funded supporting the travel and accommodations for students from the United States to attend the summer school.  In 2018, the NSF grant funded 46 students from the US, of which 17 were female.   The goal of this project was for these talented students to get a sense of what it is like to pursue a research career in computer science.  In addition to lectures, currently scheduled for approximately thirty hours over the week, the school hosts panels on research careers, applying to graduate school, etc.  Along with faculty, students also interact with industry representatives to get a balanced view of their future options.   As part of attendance, we surveyed students about their willingness to pursue research, define career goals, and overcome obstacles.  We conducted a survey before the school began, and followed up with a post-school survey, which had similar questions in order to understand how (or if) the school had changed students' outlook.  Along with the surveys, the students were also given a questionnaire where they could provide anonymous feedback.    By and large, the survey indicates that students very much enjoyed their experience.  We also tried to understand what factors contribute to a young researcher's decision to attend---or not attend---graduate school?  Our survey asked students this question upon entrance and exit from the summer school.  79 students responded (28 women, 51 men), using free text to describe factors in their decision.  We then manually aggregated the free text responses into nine categories: ability to do research; improving the prospects for their future career; ability to find the right advisor or university; financial concerns (ability to get funding or to improve financial prospects); climate change (desire to help the environment through computer science research); interest in gaining teaching experience; and the desire to get industrial experience before graduate school.   Our summary of the survey indicates that:   - There appears to be a strong correlation between students who wish   to attend graduate school and those who are excited about the   ability to do research.   - In our relatively small sample, female students emphasized research   quality and career opportunity as the primary factors affecting   their decision to attend graduate school.  The responses from male   students included more of an emphasis on financial concerns.            Last Modified: 10/02/2019       Submitted by: Samrat Bhattacharjee]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
