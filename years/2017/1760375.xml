<AbstractNarration>The research supported by this award will develop comparative cases of disaster recovery outcomes to assess best strategies for fostering adaptive resilience in at-risk communities. All proposed sites are located in southeastern Texas and were affected by Hurricane Harvey. They include low-lying coastal and rural agricultural and ranching areas, towns around Beaumont exposed to petrochemicals and flooding, and core urban areas of Houston that were flooded and exposed to contaminated waste waters and industrial refuse. These sites were chosen to represent a range of socioeconomic statuses, ethnic compositions, livelihoods, and exposure risk. The project is innovative in adapting formal decision-making techniques from agricultural contexts to identify factors situated within stories of recovery experiences and overall wellbeing, especially related to risk and the many interdependent factors that produce decisions in the real world. The research will identify variations and similarities in the clusters of salient factors impinging on  decisions in order to locate critical points in the recovery process that can support or create barriers to recovery and long term wellbeing. These will begin with the initial big decisions, such as whether or not to evacuate and will progress over the year as new choices arise. Findings from this research will contribute insights into the science of disaster recovery management in the United States, which can lead to more robust, humane, and sustainable recoveries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will employ a combination of anthropological qualitative and quantitative methods. Through interviews and participant observation, they will track pivotal moments and everyday life in survivor households, visiting ten households in each of six communities four times over twelve months. In addition to the ethnographic data collection, the investigators will carry out two quantitative household livelihood and well-being surveys at the beginning and the end of the study, and track changes in household and occupational finances. They will  also collect biosocial data, including water quality testing to detect the presence or arrival of industrial pollutants, oil or gas residues, and unusual microbial activity. The sum of these household-level data will position this research to develop a series of decision-making models for different categories of choices made by individual survivors and scaled up to model decision-making made by communities, livelihood groups, and other categories of analysis such as class and ethnicity, over the course of the first year of recovery. The project will also provide field-based research experience for two graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This NSF collaborative award began in October 2017 and ended October 2019, enabling Browne, PI, and collaborating PI, OConnell,&nbsp;to conduct two years of research following Hurricane Harvey. The big-frame goal of this research entailed moving beyond the narrative of *social vulnerability* that has dominated disaster studies for at least 25 years. By researching a wider spectrum of people and the social, economic, and environmental circumstances of their lives, we could generate data that promised new analytical insights and possibilities for new theoretical frameworks.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>The relevance of Hurricane Harvey for our research goals</strong></p> <p>People commonly associate Hurricane Harvey with the epic downpour of up to 60 inches of rain on greater Houston. This historic *rain bomb* created massive damage in the metropolitan areas. But Harvey*s impact spanned a diameter of 280 miles and 22 counties in Southeast Texas, including rural towns with family farms and ranches, semi-rural areas with oil and gas industries, and coastal towns dependent on tourism. Harvey presented the ideal research site for our goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Methods and data collection</strong></p> <p>We made seven field visits to collect data across six impacted counties including Harris County where Houston is located. The counties we targeted varied in geography and exposure to risk, population densities, types of livelihoods, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Our in-depth interviews represent a small but varied sample of people, including family farmers and ranchers, coastal townspeople working in tourism or service fields, residents of peri-urban and suburban communities employed in the nearby oil, gas, or chemical industries, urban dwellers living in modest communities pursuing clerical or service support jobs or work as semi-skilled laborers, and urban dwellers in prosperous neighborhoods living on higher, professional salaries.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The interviews occurred at three points in time with 30 household heads, for a total of more than 100 interviews.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Decision making method and data collection</strong></p> <p>We devised a novel methodology for capturing the complexity of factors that may impinge on a decision.&nbsp;Respondents chose the influences shaping decisions from a selection of 50 tiles related to social, economic, psychological, environmental, and bureaucratic-related issues. For each decision, respondents built their unique *assemblage* of relevant tiles. The process elicited their stories, providing holistic data we will distill and compare across the sample.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our preliminary results point to the richness of our methodology for helping probe a new frontier in the study of post-disaster experiences and decisions.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p> <p>Our final fieldwork visit occurred in September 2019, prompted by Tropical Storm Imelda which caused newly rebuilt homes of respondents to flood and get ruined all over again. This unexpected return to the field delayed the start of our analysis, so project outcomes are not yet known. We have, however, moved well past data collection, transcribing 100+ respondent interviews and interviews with county extension agents, scholars, and scientists working in the area. We have developed protocols for coding data and by the end of 2020, expect to prepare a book prospectus and begin writing. By the end of 2021, we expect to have a draft of a book-length manuscript.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Outcomes to date: we presented our work at five national and international conferences. In addition, Browne&rsquo;s engagement in mentoring activities include:</p> <ul> <li>Shadi Azadegan, a Nicaraguan student who received REG funding for conducting MA thesis work in a community of Latinx residents near the ship channel in Houston. She is scheduled to defend her thesis this spring, 2020.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>In Browne&rsquo;s new Public Anthropology course on Global Environmental Challenges (Fall 2018), she introduced her Harvey research. Several students wrote opinion pieces about Harvey that got published including Lucy Shepherd who grew up in Houston and got published in the nonprofit, news source,&nbsp;<em>Texas Tribune</em>:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tribtalk.org/author/lucy-shepherd/">https://www.tribtalk.org/author/lucy-shepherd/</a></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>This research also inspired Browne to develop the Ethnographic Field School for Risk and Disaster, the first immersion program of its kind, located on the island campus of Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi. This 2019 four-week program is detailed in the Final Report. Students researched residents of Rockport and presented findings to the community. The full analysis got released in a 45-page research report, disseminated to research participants, city officials, emergency managers, the Public Library, and scholars:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7kenou6rrklcfoo/Field%20School%20Research%20Report%20FINAL.pdf?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/7kenou6rrklcfoo/Field%20School%20Research%20Report%20FINAL.pdf?dl=0</a></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Background, intellectual merit and broader impacts potential</strong></p> <p>The intellectual merit and broader impacts of this study arise from our critique of how social scientists approach the study of disaster. In particular, several patterns of research limit our view of the social landscape after disaster: the short time-depth of study, the understudied rural context, and the dominance of research focused on people considered *vulnerable.* By generating portraits of people who encounter disaster with their own life circumstances, our research captures the variations in and dynamic quality of social vulnerability inherent in disaster impacts.
