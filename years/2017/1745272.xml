<AbstractNarration>Part 1: This Award will support 5 additional years of operation of the Science Support Office for the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP), an international collaboration of 24+ nations supporting proposal-driven, scientific ocean drilling. Three drilling platforms operate in the IODP: the JOIDES Resolution, an all-purpose light drillship provided by the United States to IODP for approximately 10 months operations per year; Chikyu, a heavy drillship provided by Japan to IODP for approximately 2 months per year, and Mission Specific Platforms, various drilling platforms provided approximately 2 months per year by the European Consortium for Ocean Drilling, and used primarily in shallow water or high latitudes with ice present. The Science Support Office manages drilling proposal submitted by the scientific community to IODP, supporting proposal review by the Science Evaluation Panel, the Environmental Protection and Safety Panel, and external reviewers. It also supports the JOIDES Resolution Facility Board, a scientist-led Board that oversees scheduling and operation of the JOIDES Resolution, and also supports the IODP Forum, an executive-level group that is the custodian of the IODP Science Plan, monitoring its progress. It also manages the IODP.org website, serving as the interface of IODP to the science community and general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2: Part 1: This Award will support 5 additional years of operation of the Science Support Office for the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP).
