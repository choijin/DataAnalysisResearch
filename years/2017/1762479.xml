<AbstractNarration>Newer faculty often find the process of writing their first grant proposals to be quite challenging. Professors Matthew Whited of Carlton College and Gordana Dukovic of the University of Colorado are organizing a workshop that seeks to provide new faculty with insight about proposal writing and reviewing processes.  The workshop also seeks to position newer faculty to write more competitive proposals to federal funding agencies. Participants have the opportunity to network with successful grant recipients and program officers. They engage in mock panels, speed coaching sessions, and other activities designed to provide them with a better understanding of how to put together a research plan that is ambitious, yet realistic. Broader impact criteria is also discussed in terms of educational activities, outreach, and applications to societal problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop, supported by the Division of Chemistry, is entitled, "Chemistry Early Career Investigator Workshop," will be held on March 26-27, 2018 in Alexandria, Virginia. This workshop will bring together 100 junior faculty from a broad range of institutions and demographics to discuss steps in strategically crafting research ideas, planning educational and outreach activities, and assessing and evaluating project aims.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF-CHE Early Career Investigator Workshop was held March 26-27, 2018 in Alexandria, VA. The workshop brought together 100 early-career chemistry investigators from a variety of institutions and disciplinary perspectives. Attendees had extensive opportunities to network with other junior faculty, meet more experienced research mentors, and interact with NSF program officers and administrative staff, both in group and one-on-one settings.  Much of the workshop was focused around group activities facilitated by NSF staff and experienced researchers to work on mock panel review of NSF proposals, practice describing their research to the general public, and discuss strategies for integrating education and research plans in NSF-CAREER proposals, inter alia.  Overall, attendees reported increased confidence in determining which federal funders are most appropriate for each of their research projects (97%).  They were also enthusiastic that the workshop helped them feel more comfortable communicating with relevant program officers (99%).  Perhaps most significantly, attendees were unanimous in asserting that they had gained valuable skills for better identifying the key features of a good research proposal (100%).  Taken together, these findings show that attendees found the workshop quite effective, especially with respect to helping them prepare and submit stronger research proposals.  Materials generated from the workshop, including slides from talks by NSF staff and experienced researchers as well as prompts for group discussion, are available through the conference website: http://blogs.carleton.edu/nsf2018/materials/       Last Modified: 12/17/2018       Submitted by: Matthew T Whited]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
