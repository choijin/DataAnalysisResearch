<AbstractNarration>This work will provide new understanding of how evolution can result in the coexistence of similar species that compete strongly for resources. When species compete for the same resource the weaker competitor can be eliminated from the community. Nonetheless, there are many communities that contain competing species. One hypothesis is that competing species diverge so as to reduce competition, a phenomenon known as character displacement. This work focuses on closely related lizard species that have been introduced to southern Florida. Their recent co-occurrence provides an opportunity to study how species respond to novel competition, and what traits in each species diverge as a result. Observed shifts in both ecology and morphology may ultimately contribute to their long-term coexistence. The result of this study will be a better understanding of the role of character displacement in the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. This project also creates a framework for teaching students and the public about the processes that enhance biodiversity. This framework will be implemented via an Ecology Club and an information webpage, as well as by engaging undergraduates in the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Populations of two non-native Anolis lizards, that have had no prior evolutionary interactions, will be studied to quantify the progression of character displacement. These species, the Cuban brown anole (Anolis sagrei) and the Puerto Rican crested anole (A. cristatellus), are ecologically and morphologically similar. Throughout Miami FL, they exist in multiple spatially-independent communities that consist of either both species (sympatric populations) or only one species (allopatric populations). These communities are analogous to the early stages of adaptive radiation, whereby ecomorphologically similar species that have speciated in allopatry come into contact and adaptively diverge as a result of interspecific competition. The project will investigate the ecological relationship between these two species to test the following hypotheses: (H1) In the presence of each other, both species will experience a divergence in resource use to minimize interspecific interactions. This hypothesis will be tested through detailed analyses of the ecology and behavior of both species across multiple replicates of both allopatric and sympatric populations. (H2) Divergence in resource use leads to changes in the phenotype of both species ? this is the process of character displacement. This hypothesis will be tested by detailed phenotypic assessments of both species across the populations. (H3) Shifts in phenotypic traits are heritable. This hypothesis will be tested by measuring trait heritability with laboratory breeding experiments. Taken together this case study will provide a more detailed understanding of the role of competition in evolutionary divergence.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Character displacement describes the process by which interspecific interactions lead to divergent changes in behavior and ecology. This process is widely thought to be important to evolutionary diversification and may be responsible for much of the phenotypic disparity observable on Earth. However, few conclusive case studies of character displacement exist which assess how divergence in behavior in two similar species affects both ecologically and sexually-important traits. In this study I explored a case of complex character displacement between two species of Caribbean <em>Anolis </em>lizards which have been recently introduced to Miami, Florida USA. These two species, Cuban brown anoles (<em>A. sagrei</em>) and Puerto Rican crested anoles (<em>A. cristatellus</em>), are highly ecologically-similar and interact strongly when they live together in Miami. As a result of these interactions, these two species diverge in their habitat use &ndash; brown anoles become more terrestrial and spend more time on the ground, while crested anoles become more arboreal and spend less time on the ground. Brown anoles which live with crested anoles exhibit longer limbs and less-developed subdigital toepads. Long limbs are important for running fast on flat surfaces like the ground, while toepads are more important for an arboreal lifestyle. However, I did not observe crested anoles having larger toepads when living with brown anoles, as expected due to their increased arboreality. Instead, I observed that these crested anoles had smaller heads than those that did not live with brown anoles. I suggest that this is driven by increased social isolation of crested anoles when in the presence of brown anoles, which has relaxed selection on head size &ndash; a feature important for winning aggressive social interactions when competing against members of your own species in anoles. In this study, simple ecological character displacement can lead to phenotypic divergence much more complex than anticipated, and therefore may be responsible for a greater volume of observed phenotypic variation than previously recognized.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/22/2018<br>      Modified by: James&nbsp;T&nbsp;Stroud</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
