<AbstractNarration>This award supports a workshop to provide a networking platform bringing additive manufacturing researchers and industrial partners together. Discussions among workshop participants will accelerate technology advancement leading to further market expansion in a large variety of business ventures. The workshop will help bridge the gap between fundamental research and industrial applications through strengthening connections between different stakeholders. This will serve to further advance additive manufacturing techniques through identifying technical and practical challenges that require more in-depth fundamental investigations. The outcomes of the workshop will pave the path forward for a streamlined transition from fundamental research to industrial applications. This workshop will benefit many industrial sectors, including aerospace, automotive, biomedical, defense, energy, environmental, manufacturing, materials, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Pittsburgh will host the workshop on August 17-18, 2017 in collaboration with Texas A&amp;M University, to foster the interaction between NSF-funded researchers and industrial professionals associated with America Makes, the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute. The workshop will consist of three sessions, in which about 20 NSF-funded researchers will highlight their additive manufacturing research progress through presentations and posters, along with ample opportunity for networking. The workshop will be organized in coordination with America Makes for broad industrial participation. It will ultimately lead to the identification of synergistic activities between academic and industrial stakeholders and facilitate productive academic-industrial partnerships.</AbstractNarration>
