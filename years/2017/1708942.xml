<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2017, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Specifically, this proposal examines an often-noted, but virtually unstudied phenomenon: a great many plants entrap sand or other substrate with sticky trichomes. Sand entrapment traits are well-preserved in herbarium specimens, but the distribution and evolution of such traits in plants is poorly-known. Entrapped sand and dust have negative effects on insect and mammalian herbivores, wearing down their mandibles and teeth, and the presence of this substrate lessens herbivory on plants. During this experiment, the fellow and undergraduate researchers will use herbaria, insect collections, and laboratory experiments to further explore this interesting phenomenon.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research supported by this award has four primary goals. (1) To determine the extent of sand-entrapment across the plants, utilizing herbarium collections and compiled floras for desert and dune regions. (2) To determine whether plants trade-off this effective physical defense with chemical defenses, using a live collection of sand verbenas (Abronia species) and a common pest caterpillar (Hyles lineata). (3) To determine whether sand-entrapment dictates which insects can eat these sand-covered plants. Lastly [4] to determine whether insects feeding on these and other gritty plants have evolved similar "tooth" morphology to herbivorous mammals - the ability to wear down their grinding surfaces. These projects will be conducted with several undergraduate assistants, and will be incorporated into lessons for elementary through high school students.  Results form the studies will be distributed in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings and symposia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PRFB #1708942 &ndash; Research using biological collections  Summary  At the conclusion of this postdoctoral fellowship, I have completed two of the projected scientific aims and, with funding from my postdoctoral adviser, I am continuing work on the unfinished components. During the duration of the fellowship, I mentored four undergraduate students (two of which have authorship on published papers) and contributed extensively to an initiative to create teaching tools designed to increase inclusivity in STEM classrooms (Project Biodiversify: projectbiodiversify.org).  Scientific merit and outcomes  Despite stickiness being a ubiquitous trait in plants, including many economically important crops (e.g. tobacco, potato), expressing it, it is not well understood. However, it is very ecologically and economically important as this trait protects plants against insect and mammalian herbivores in several ways. The primary aim of this project was to create a comprehensive list of sticky plants, using herbarium specimens and published literature. At the outset of the project, our extrapolations from initial data were that we would find ~2000 species with this trait; surprisingly, this trait is far more common than we ever expected, with the current list over 5000 species!  Secondly, we used a living collection of a particular plant clade, the sand verbenas (Nyctaginaceae: Abronia &amp; Tripterocalyx), to examine the evolution of stickiness and related defensive traits. I collected specimens and seeds, assembled a phylogeny, and grew the plants in a greenhouse common garden for trait analysis. Unfortunately, a greenhouse power outage killed the collection in the summer of 2018, partway through data collection. However, this work continues as proposed, currently funded by Dr. Marjorie Weber and Michigan State University, and the full project proposed in the fellowship will be completed, likely by summer 2020.  Thirdly, we sought to examine the insect herbivore communities on sticky plants and specifically, how they are able to circumvent or deal with the plant defenses on these plants. This work is intrinsically tied to the living collection of sand verbenas for its experimental component and is also ongoing.  Data dissemination:  The first paper from this work was published in 2019 (LoPresti et al., Ecology, doi: 10.1002/ecy.2809) and includes all data in the supplementary material. In 2020, we expect that two additional papers will be published &ndash; both will include data in supplementary material or in a Data Dryad/FigShare repository.
