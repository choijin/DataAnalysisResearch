<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the Southwest Local Algebra Meeting 2017, held at University of New Mexico on March 4-5, 2017. This conference will facilitate interactions between students and faculty with interests in ring theory, broadly interpreted, from institutions in the Southwest. Algebraists in the Southwest region pursue research on a variety of topics under the umbrella of pure and applied ring theory. The geographical distances in the region are such that interactions between people at different institutions rarely happen spontaneously. The meeting will bring together students and faculty from a variety of institutions for inspiring talks, with ample time for scientific interaction, providing opportunities for participants to begin new collaborations and catalyzing new research projects. About 80 participants are expected, including students and both junior and senior faculty from throughout the Southwest and South. The participation of students from underrepresented minority groups, women, untenured faculty, and faculty at non-PhD granting institutions is particularly encouraged. Six experts will deliver hour-long talks on topics within their areas of specialty; the lectures will be accessible to graduate students. The meeting will also feature three hour-long poster sessions in which the participating students will present their research. More information can be found at the conference webpage: http://www.math.ttu.edu/~lchriste/slam2017.html.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of rings, in the broadest sense, is crucial to many branches of mathematics, including commutative and non-commutative geometry, group representations, number theory, coding theory, and cryptography.  Our speakers are specialists in characteristics p techniques in commutative algebra and geometry, arithmetic geometry and number theory, numerical algebraic geometry, combinatorial commutative algebra, Lie Theory and Rees Algebras.   This wide variety of interests among our speakers should bolster new algebraic interactions between all participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2017 Southwest Local Algebra Meeting took place at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque on March 4-5, 2017.  This was the eighth annual Southwest Local Algebra Meeting.  The first seven meetings took place at the University of Texas-Arlington in 2010, New Mexico State University in 2011, Texas Tech University in 2012, the University of Arizona in 2013, Texas A&amp;M University in 2014, Oklahoma State University in 2015, and Texas State University in 2016.  The purpose of the meeting was to facilitate interactions between young and senior mathematicians, with interests in ring theory, broadly interpreted, from institutions in the Southwest.  Participants met at UNM for talks, graduate student poster sessions, and discussions.  The six speakers were Dan Bates (Colorado State University), Alexandru Buium (University of New Mexico), Youngsu Kim (University of California, Riverside), Susana Salamanca-Riba (New Mexico State University), Karl Schwede (University of Utah), and Jay Schweig (Oklahoma State University) who surveyed topics at the intersection of commutative algebra, combinatorics, algebraic geometry and arithmetic geometry.  Each speaker gave a talk that was accessible to the graduate students in the audience, often illustrating connections between basic material learned in graduate school with the latest research in the field.   Eight graduate student from seven different institutions presented posters durring the three hours of poster sessions, explaining their research to other students and faculty.  The posters were entitled "The frame of the p-adic numbers" (Francisco Avila, New Mexico State University), "Arithmetic differential geometry" (Malik Barrettt, University of New Mexico), "The weak Lefschetz property for a graded module" (Zachary Flores, Colorado State University), "Rees rings of artinian Gorenstein ideals" (Whitney Liske, Notre Dame Univeristy), "Minimal reductions of edge ideals" (Raymond Paulino, New Mexico State University), "Existence of totally reflexive modules in local graded rings with Hilbert series (1+et+(e-1)t2)" (Basanti Sharma Poudyal, University of Texas-Arlington), "Interpolating between Hilbert-Samuel and Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity" (William Taylor, University of Arkansas), and "Free fusion rings arising from Lusztig's asymptotic Hecke algebras" (Tianyuan Xu, University of Oregon).  In addition there was a conference dinner, sponsored by the UNM math department in which students and faculty discussed mathematics and got to know each other.  The total attendance was 47.  Participants came from throughout the region and a few additional states including Arkansas, California, Colorado, Indiana, Louisiana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas and Utah.  The participants included students from underrepresented minority groups, women, and faculty at all career stages and from different types of institutions.  Most of the NSF support was used from travel and lodging for students and faculty with limited access to travel funds.  Intellectual merit:  The study of rings, in the broadest sense, is crucial to many branches of mathematics including commutative and non-commutative geometry, group representations, number theory, coding theory and cryptography, and touches on even more, such as combinatorics, homotopy theory and statistics.  Algebraists in the Southwest region pursue research on a variety of topics under the umbrella of pure and applied ring theory.  The geographical distances in the region are such that interations between people at different institutions rarely happen spontaneously.  The meeting brought together students and faculty from a variety of institutions for inspired talks with ample time for scientific interaction.  In addition, at the meeting, several faculty members who study similar problems from different perspectives began conversations about common interests and we expect that weveral collaborations resulted.  Broader impacts:  The Southwest region is home to several non-Ph.D. granting institutions. Faculty at these institutions have limited travel funds.  The relative proximity of the meeting venue and the availability of participant support offered them an opportunity to connect or reconnect with research groups in their geographical region.  For students who have yet to attend their first scientific meeting, this one served as a smooth introduction to professional circles.  The modest size of the meeting helped to create a relaxed atmosphere, and presentaitons in the poster session helped the graduate students break the ice and interact with faculty members from other institutions.  As an outcome of such interacctions, some students landed their first invitations to speak at departmental seminars or other professional meetings.  In addition, a number of graduate students from non-Ph.D. granting institutions spoke with faculty at doctoral institutions and were able assess their doctoral possibilities in the region.  We anticipate that these connections will help students in their academic pursuits.       Last Modified: 12/07/2017       Submitted by: Janet Vassilev]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
