<AbstractNarration>The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network will conduct a proposal development workshop for STEM faculty at 2-year and 4-year Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to advance their knowledge of and improve their competitiveness in the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program. MSIs play an essential role in the production of baccalaureate degree recipients of underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines as well as in the disproportionate production of underrepresented undergraduate students who go on to receive advanced degrees in STEM. Increasing S-STEM awards at MSIs will assist MSIs in developing and sustaining student enrolment and matriculation in STEM majors. Furthermore, ensuring the competitiveness of faculty and students will enhance diversity in STEM education and STEM workforce, which in turn, will contribute to America's global competitiveness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will support two-person faculty teams from 20 MSIs interested in developing competitive S-STEM proposals. Participants will also engage in a series of post-workshop individualized sessions that will provide additional proposal guidance. The workshop content and post-workshop technical assistance will be delivered by a team of consultants with expertise in STEM and STEM education, including NSF grantee PIs and education researchers. To enhance individual and cross-institutional capacity and collaborations, QEM will create and facilitate a community of practice comprised of S-STEM workshop participants and require them to connect with each other and with QEM staff, consultants, and NSF program officers. The online platform will allow the project to offer additional support beyond the workshop including engaging in discussions related to S-STEM program priority-areas and providing relevant feedback. Project-related materials will be made available online to ensure broader dissemination of information that will be beneficial to participating institutions as well as other MSIs in relation to the S-STEM program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2018, with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Award #1757143, the Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network conducted a workshop to provide technical assistance to minority-serving institutions (MSIs) to increase their participation and competitiveness in NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program.  The two-day workshop assisted two-person teams from 23 MSIs (13 Historically Black Colleges and Universities; 6 Hispanic-Serving Institutions; 2 Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions; and 2 Tribal Colleges and Universities) in further developing their ideas for S-STEM proposals for the FY 2018 competition.Forty-five (45) STEM faculty at twenty-three (23) MSIs in thirteen (13) states and the District of Columbia, attended the workshop.    Plenary sessions included presentations by various NSF Program Directors and QEM consultants. Key topics discussed at the workshops included: overview of NSF and the S-STEM program tracks; NSF's merit review process and preparation of competitive proposals;description of the knowledge generation component of S-STEM projects; significance and rationale of S-STEMprojects; data management; assessment and evaluation plans; and project sustainability and the impact of institutional infrastructure.  At the end of the workshop, participants received an evaluation questionnaire to solicit feedback regarding their overall experience at the workshop. Forty-three of the 45 workshop participants responded to the questionnaire (96% response rate). Over 90% of respondents rated the clarity of goals, materials and assistance offered, and overall experience as excellentor very good.  Following the workshop, teams were provided with additional support through consultant-led post-workshop technical assistance activities. Five QEM consultants facilitated the post workshop activities with institutional teams receiving an average of six hours of support. Eighteen teams participated in the post-workshop sessions, the general consensus was that the assistance provided was beneficial to their proposal development and refinement of ideas. In particular, timely and constructive feedback were cited as key characteristics in strengthening their S-STEM proposals.  Participants were encouraged to share information and materials from the workshop with colleagues at their institutions. Following the workshop, the agenda and links to presentations were posted on QEM's website to augment notes taken by participants at the workshop and facilitate sharing with a broader audience. Data collected through follow-up surveys showed that participants shared workshop materials with colleagues using the following avenues: 68% shared links to presentations and E-Resource list, respectively: and 64% shared workshop packets.  The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network was established in 1990 as a non-profit organization in Washington, DC, dedicated to improving education for marginalized groups throughout the nation. QEM works with minority and non-minority individuals, organizations, and institutions to help coordinate and energize efforts to improve the education of minorities, particularly in STEM.
