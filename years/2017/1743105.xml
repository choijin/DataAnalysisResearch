<AbstractNarration>The 10th World Soybean Research Congress will be held in Savannah, GA in conjunction with the 17th Biennial Molecular and Cellular Biology of Soybean Conference from September 10th - 15th 2017. The shared conference provides unprecedented opportunity for researchers, breeders and industry to convene and share cutting edge information about basic soybean research that can be translated to practical outcomes. Early stage scientists supported by this project will be exposed to networks of international researchers, thus encouraging training and exchange of ideas across borders and disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important goal of the conference is to share cutting-edge science from an interdisciplinary perspective. The program includes topics at the frontier of research in pest and diseases, genetics and genomics, seed composition and nutrition and biotic interactions.  By supporting 25 early stage scientists, including graduate students, post-doctoral researchers and early career faculty, the conference will promote long-term training and will serve as an incubator for new ideas and collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
