<AbstractNarration>This project, acquiring a computer cluster (mini-supercomputer) to replace the old one, aims to serve the computational needs facilitating scientific research and education in multiple areas. The machine includes 120 node Infiniband interconnected cluster for efficient message passing interface (MPI) parallel processing, four shared memory "fat nodes" with 1 Terabyte (TB) of memory/node, four graphic processing unit (GPU) nodes built around NVIDIA Tesla P100 1 Gigabyte (GB) GPUs, and four Intel Knight's Landing nodes. This blended system will serve the computational needs of the vast majority of campus researchers. This system will also service users needing large-scale resources by allowing development, prototyping, and benchmarking calculations locally, prior to production runs at supercomputer centers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research enabled spans multiple departments and supports research in many campus centers including AlloSphere Research Facility, the California Nanosystems Institute, the Center of Polymers and Organic Solids, the Earth Research Institute, the Kavli Institute of Theoretical Physics, the Marine Science Institute, the Materials Research Laboratory, and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis. This interdisciplinary and mainly collaborative research will be facilitated by the presence of an available local facility, without the administrative hurdles and delays associated with application to supercomputing centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The cluster is expected to play a prominent role in educating the next generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians. The NSF Integrated Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program in Network Science and Big Data will also employ the cluster that will additionally be utilized by undergraduates, high school, and community college students and K-12 teachers via existing sponsored programs. It will also contribute to attract others students and researchers. Furthermore the facility will service graduate participants in the University of California Leadership Excellence through Advanced Degrees (UCLEADS) and the Bridges to Doctorate programs. These programs help increase the number of under-represented students involved.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF award CNS-1725797 was used to purchase "Pod",  a high performance  computing (HPC) cluster for use in scientific research and education on  the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB).  Over  300 faculty, students and staff have used and continue to use  Pod. These users span the departments of Chemical Engineering,   Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry, Computer Science, Earth Science, Ecology   Evolution &amp; Marine Biology, Economics, Electrical &amp; Computer   Engineering, Geography, Materials, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering,   Molecular Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology, Physics and Psychology   as well as the following campus research institutes: the California  NanoSystems Institute, the Center for Polymers and Organic Solids, the  Earth Research Institute, the Kavli Institiute for Theoretical Physics,  the Materials Research Laboratory, the  National Center for Ecological  Analysis and Synthesis and the Neuroscience Research Institute.  Over  130 peer reviewed scientific publications  have resulted from  computational studies carried out on Pod and it is  anticipated many more  will be completed before Pod is eventually  retired, years from now.  Pod also serves an important role in education, in addition to its  primary role as a research tool.  Approximately three quarters of the  cluster users are either undergraduate students, graduate students or postdoctoral scholars.  In many cases, Pod is the primary tool used by these students in preparation of their thesis work.  Pod has been used in advanced graduate level  courses/laboratories in the Chemistry and Materials Departments at  UCSB.  In February of 2020, the faculty and staff participants on this  award hosted the "Southern California Simulations in Science Conference"  to expose students (undergraduates, graduates and postdocs) to the wide  breath of research carried out on Pod and to introduce students to the  opportunities to pursue computational science in an industrial setting  following their time in academia.  The conference was attended by  students from throughout Southern California and the California Central  Coast regions, in addition to the local UCSB participants.
