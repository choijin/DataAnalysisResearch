<AbstractNarration>The Valentine Eastern Sierra Reserve (VESR) comprises 2 of 39 field stations in the University of California Natural Reserve System, and is located at the base of the eastern escarpment of the Sierra Nevada mountains. VESR attracts researchers from throughout the US to study many wide-ranging issues, from aquatic ecosystem ecology to ecological responses to climate change, and is well known for its active outreach programs.  To best serve the growing VESR constituency while perpetuating VESR as a resource, this project will develop a long-term (five to ten year) strategic plan for VESR research, education, outreach programs, and facilities. The strategic plan will articulate a scientific vision for research and educational use, and an evaluation of the programs, facility needs and resources necessary to support that vision. The goal of the strategic plan is to enhance research and education activities at VESR as well as the regional coordination of research, education and outreach activities across the Sierra Nevada region through a network of regional agency, non-profit, academic and field station partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning process involves engaging with key stakeholders through virtual and in-person workshops to identify regional coordination opportunities. The strategic plan will direct the prioritization of facilities and programs enhancements, and access for researchers, students, educators and natural resource managers in the eastern Sierra Nevada. The involvement of an Environmental Science Masters level student in this process will provide graduate student level training in biological research, environmental management and related fields. Engaging with regional coordinators at workshops supported by the proposed planning process represents a formalized step in establishing a regionally coordinated node representing the Eastern Sierra Nevada that can more effectively participate in larger scale global observatory or climate change research efforts. The strategic plan and planning process will contribute to ongoing dialogue, and directly benefit several land and wildlife management agencies with jurisdiction over the Sierra Nevada, whose need for information to inform land management has increased markedly in recent years due to persistent drought conditions and other environmental stressors.</AbstractNarration>

As part of the planning process we have articulated VESR?s mission, vision and six main goals in support of the VESR mission: Mission  VESR?s mission is to advance knowledge and promote stewardship of the Eastern Sierra region through science, education and outreach.  Vision  An environmentally sustainable Eastern Sierra region with an engaged and scientifically literate community of stewards. Goals  Research excellence: VESR provides functional, safe and user-friendly facilities, technologies and expertise that support cutting-edge research for faculty and students from the University of California, and across the globe. Field-based education: VESR facilitates programs that enhance university-level, field, experimental and laboratory-based teaching in the Eastern Sierra. VESR strives to create an environment of diversity and inclusion in its support of university level education. Public Engagement: With an array of science communication and educational programs, VESR engages the surrounding communities on scientific issues of societal relevance, and provides science and outdoor learning opportunities for students of all ages and backgrounds.  Diversity &amp; Inclusion: VESR maintains a socially responsible environment in support of a body of users that reflect the diverse population of the state of California and the communities that the University of California serves. Land Stewardship: VESR utilizes the resources of the field-based research endeavors to steward the lands and natural resources owned or managed by the University of California. VESR seeks to achieve science-based and responsible stewardship of the regional biodiversity for the purposes of supporting both social and ecological well-being.  Sustainability: VESR works towards environmental sustainability by decreasing electricity usage, incorporating new technology to reduce the carbon footprint, and reducing consumption and waste of all resources (e.g., fuel, water, materials)      Through the strategic planning process VESR has identified priorities for strategic investments in the broad areas of Programs, People and Infrastructure.  This plan is a living document, and we intend to be flexible and adaptive as new priorities arise or as ongoing pursuits require new approaches.

A final version of the plan is available on our website (https://vesr.nrs.ucsb.edu/about/resources/strategic-plan).     Intellectual Merit:  The VESR strategic plan will direct the prioritization of facilities and programs enhancements, and access for researchers, students, educators and natural resource managers in the eastern Sierra Nevada.
