<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project resides in motivating cross-disciplinary innovations for more efficient, smarter, and safer technologies.  These benefits will be realized by empowering the next generation workforce with knowledge of a phenomenon that is revolutionizing the modern day innovation ecosystem.  This marvel is called "self-assembly", and is used by nature to build structures ranging from protein complexes to living organisms.  Researchers are harnessing this natural phenomenon to drive scientific advancements including nanowires with increased computing power and pharmaceuticals with greater therapeutic potential, demonstrating that self-assembly holds the potential to seed disruptive technologies across multiple disciplines.  To unlock the full innovative potential of this phenomenon, self-assembly must be taught to the upcoming generation of scientists and engineers in an engaging and insightful manner.  This SBIR Phase I project aims to integrate self-assembly into the teaching curriculum of undergraduate science courses.  By educating students about the intricacies and applications of self-assembly, this project will inspire future breakthroughs and accrue compounding societal and commercial benefits. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims to prototype a consumer-focused minimum viable product (MVP) that assists undergraduate instructors in teaching the emerging phenomenon of selfassembly.  The absence of such a product to date is likely attributable to the technical hurdles that challenge the ability to demonstrate self-assembly in a cross-disciplinary yet straightforward manner.  The research objectives incorporate proof-of-concept experimentation and reiterative product builds to design a prototype that efficiently caters to undergraduate instructors and their teaching practices.  More specifically, the objectives are to:  1. Design components that demonstrate self-assembly across multiple scales and disciplines. 2. Create educational content that effectively disseminates knowledge of self-assembly and its applications. 3. Field-test and optimize the prototype in response to end user experiences. The resulting MVP will provide materials and instructions to conduct various self-assembly demonstrations in a cost-effective and readily deployable manner.  The product would be the first educational tool to address self-assembly in this manner.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[STEM teachers require engaging, hands-on materials to help educate the modern student, who has grown up in an increasingly connected and interactive world.  However, there is inherent difficulty in developing effective educational resources for teachers in the life sciences.  Fundamental biology and chemistry ideas can be extraordinarily difficult to conceptualize at the microscopic level, and hands-on molecular experiments are prohibitively complex, expensive, toxic, and exacting.  We used this market pull to develop new teaching materials for life science teachers that cater to modern teaching pedagogies and student learning methods.   In this SBIR Phase I project, we developed an educational laboratory module focused on self-assembly, a fundamental biology and chemistry concept that is driving modern innovation across science, medicine, and technology disciplines. The highest technical risk to the project was in distilling a complex, research-grade molecular experiment to be classroom-ready.  We successfully modified an experimental system historically used for cancer drug discovery to be non-toxic, cost-effective, and shelf stable, and tested its performance in the hands of students with overwhelmingly positive results.  We developed additional materials and content, including tactile 3D models, data analysis tools, and educational guides, to support this experimental system as a comprehensive educational module that promotes student learning. The outcome of our Phase I project is a prototyped Self-Assembly Module that helps teachers connect fundamental learning standards with real-world, cross-disciplinary applications.  Our prototype represents an industry first in bringing microtubules to the classroom, and showcases how scientists are harnessing fundamental biological principles to drive cutting-edge advancements in research, medicine, and industry.  The Self-Assembly Module not only introduces novel materials to the classroom, but represents a paradigm shift in the traditional laboratory kit that caters to the modern-day student.  The module leverages integrated instructional approaches and modern teaching pedagogies to promote student learning in an era shaped by information technology.  Moreover, the module pairs fundamental principles with emerging scientific phenomena to convey real-world relevancy and promote cross-disciplinary connections.  As evidenced by direct customer interactions and end-user experiences, this work lays the foundation for increasing student learning and promoting enthusiasm for STEM careers.    The broader impacts of this project reside in preparing the next generation STEM workforce with enhanced educational opportunities. The STEM workforce is well recognized as having an outsized impact on the nation's competitiveness, economic growth, and overall standard of living, with over 2 million new jobs created in STEM fields over the last decade.  By training students in the scientific method, teaching applicable laboratory skills, and promoting enthusiasm for STEM careers, this project promises to unlock the innovative potential of future scientists and engineers.  Likewise, this project will help realize the full commercial potential of self-assembly as a phenomenon that is seeding disruptive technologies across fields as diverse as medicine, nanotechnology, and materials science.
