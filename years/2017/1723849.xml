<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The Smart Grid is among the most important and ambitious engineering endeavors of our time. Deep integration of renewable electricity generation is a key driver of the Smart Grid vision. A fundamental challenge is that these energy sources are highly variable ? they are not dispatchable, experience large and rapid changes, and are difficult to predict. The electricity grid must absorb this variability through a portfolio of solutions that include improved forecasts, demand shaping, electricity storage, optimal grid operations, and new market instruments. Our objective is to analyze this portfolio for wind energy integration. We will develop an analytical framework to study how wind variability can be addressed in competitive electricity markets at deep penetration levels. We will investigate market based wind curtailment, aggregation, matching of variable generation and flexible loads, and novel contract instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The societal impact of our research comes from the fact that renewable electricity generation is critical for energy security and environmental sustainability. Our research directly addresses the obstacles that must be overcome to significantly increase the penetration of renewable generation. The technological impact of our research will stem from our novel framework to analyze existing options and design novel mechanisms for renewable integration. This will offer new insights and analysis methods which will guide the design of optimal portfolios of technology components and coordination mechanisms.  The educational impact of our research is derived from our serious efforts at integrating education at all levels with our research. We will equip our students with the multi-disciplinary training in power systems operations, optimization, control, and economics to become leaders in making the Smart Grid vision a reality.</AbstractNarration>

As a result, there are  myriad challenges in integrating these production sources into the electricity grid, especially in the context of competitive electricity markets. New smart grid technologies sensing, communication, computation, and control offer new mechanisms to deal with the uncertainty and variability of renewable electricity production.  Intellectual Merit  Wind energy is a rapidly growing source of renewable energy generation. However, the current approach, that is outside the normal market mechanisms, to its assimilation into the electric grid will not scale at deep penetration levels. We analyze how an independent wind power producer might optimally offer its variable power into a competitive electricity market for energy. Our approach starts with a stochastic model for wind power production and a model for a perfectly competitive twosettlement market. We obtain mathematical formulae for optimal contracts and the corresponding optimal profit. We also examined the role of forecast information on wind production. An important effect of the inherent variability and uncertainty of renewable energyresources, specially wind power, is the allocation of the costs generated by these variable resources in a just and reasonable manner. This is crucial for economic efficiency. We have developed an axiomatic framework for allocating the deviation costs generated by wind and solar electric generation using the cost causation based principles. We investigated the minimization of the total energy cost ofmultiple residential households in a smart grid neighborhood sharing a load servingentity. Specifically, each household may have renewable generation, energy storage aswell as inelastic and elastic energy loads, and the load serving entity attempts tocoordinate the energy consumption of these households in order to minimize the total energy cost within this neighborhood.  We have investigated how large IT companies can utilize the green energy fromrenewable energy sources in data centers. Cybersecurity is a critically important risk in smart grid solutions to electricity grid problems. In the setting of phasor measurement units which are a relatively new measurement device for electric grid, we were able to obtain new results on cybersecurity properties. Two students who were partially supported on this grant received their PhD degrees.  Broader Impacts We developed a new course on smart electric grid at the University of Florida for graduate students in engineering and computer science. Taking a cyber-physical systems approach, it attracted more than 50 students. All the course materials were shared with faculty members at other universities.
