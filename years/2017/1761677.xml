<AbstractNarration>Understanding how natural systems change and recover from a catastrophic disturbance, such as a major hurricane, is important to help society respond effectively to these events. Natural systems, like streams, can provide a buffer to lessen storm impacts and quicken recovery of natural processes that benefit humans.  This research aims to understand how streams along the Gulf Coast of Texas responded to flooding and strong winds after Hurricane Harvey made landfall in August 2017.  The enormous amount of rainfall and associated storm surges are likely to change the number and kinds of organisms that live in nearby streams.  Although the 'community' of microbes, plants and animals in streams is expected to change, it is also expected to recover over time to pre-storm conditions.  The time to recovery is thought to differ in predictable ways between streams and between kinds of organisms.  To test this idea, it is necessary to have data on stream flows, physical stream characteristics, and community composition before and after the storm.  Researchers supported by this award developed and implemented a stream monitoring program prior to Harvey's landfall in south Texas.  This award will allow the researchers to collect data immediately after the storm and over the expected recovery period.  They will explore if the recovery period depends on whether a stream occurs in a typically wet or typically dry area. Results of this project will help urban planners and natural resource managers understand responses of streams to hurricanes.  In addition, the research will directly support faculty to train a diverse group of local scientists and managers who can help their communities respond effectively to future hurricanes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses how climate regime mediates community response to disturbance. Specifically, it tests predictions about which biotic communities and associated ecosystem processes are most or least resilient to climate-related disturbances.  These predictions provide an important test of disturbance theory and are of great relevance to forecasting the ecological impacts of climate variation. A major disturbance event, Hurricane Harvey, affected a region with a sharp climate gradient from semi-arid to sub-humid. The research team, including faculty and students at a Hispanic-serving institution, will use a series of stream ecosystems along the climate gradient, with pre-storm community and ecosystem data, as a model system. In each stream, the research team will conduct high frequency repeated surveys of communities (e.g., microbial, invertebrates), ecosystem components (nutrients, benthic algae, organic matter, habitat), and collect continuous high-frequency data using automated loggers (DO, light, temperature, discharge, depth). These data will track temporal changes in community composition, basal resources, and ecosystem processes that collectively provide measurement of the immediate response and longer-term impacts of the disturbance. It is expected that community resistance to the disturbance will be higher in drier systems with greater stochasticity in abiotic conditions.  Likewise, it is expected that communities with higher annual precipitation and more riparian vegetation will experience a positive response driven by organic matter inputs and increased light and primary production. These general functional responses will vary in rate among trophic groups as a function of generation time.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Hurricanes are one of the most significant types of disturbance world-wide.  As the global climate changes, it is becoming increasingly important to understand how the effects of these severe coastal disturbances on local ecosystems are modified by local climate.  The goals of this project were to evaluate the impact of Hurricane Harvey on coastal stream ecosystems along an aridity gradient on the Texas coastal prairie ecoregion.  We conducted monitoring of water quality, habitat, microbial communities, invertebrate communities, and fish communities in nine streams impacted by the storm that range from semi-arid climate conditions to mesic-climate conditions.  Significantly, this gradient is driven primarily by changes in annual rainfall alone, allowing us to isolate the effect of precipitation regime on the ecosystem disturbance response.      In our investigation of differences between the study sites, we found that all of the different types of organisms (microbes, invertebrates, fish) exhibited significant spatial turnover among streams that was well explained by changes in annual rainfall.  Furthermore, there was a general pattern of increasing diversity and food web complexity with increasing annual rainfall.  We also observed that seasonal variation in community composition throughout the year became more pronounced and predictable as annual rainfall increased, whereas temporal variation of fauna in the more arid streams was primarily driven by individual floods and dry periods rather than season.      In our investigation of the effects of hurricane Harvey on the stream ecosystems, we observed a variety of responses.  All of the response variables we measured returned to baseline conditions within the year of sampling, but return time differed among classes of variables.  Nitrate remained elevated in arid sites for nearly 10 months but returned to baseline within a few months in the more mesic streams.  Fish returned to baseline within 2-3 months whereas invertebrates took 1-6 months.  Overall effect of the storm on invertebrates was less in the more arid sites, however, we observed a pulse in abundance months after the storm in the more mesic streams, likely driven by increased food availability.  Together, these results demonstrate that the immediate and extended (months) effects of hurricanes on streams and rivers is predictably influenced by local climate.  The implications of this are that as the global climate changes, the resistance and resilience of streams to storms will shift as well.  Additionally, these results suggest that observations made in hurricane affected regions may not be indicative of how hurricanes occurring in different climates at higher latitudes (a prediction of global climate change) will impact stream ecosystems.  More broadly, the principles explained here may be transferrable to our understanding of how climate interacts with disturbance in other ecosystems.     The project has provided training opportunities for 1 post-doc, 3 graduate students (2 masters, 1 PhD), 2 REU students, 7 undergraduate technicians, 6 undergraduate volunteers.  The work was also incorporated into an undergraduate limnology class taught by the Lead PI in Fall 2017, Fall 2018, and Fall 2019.  The project team has given 18 professional presentations (9 graduate student presentations, 2 undergraduate), 1 outreach presentation, and contributed to 4 media stories (print and local news).  We have two publications in print, one in revision, three in review, and several more in preparation.          Last Modified: 07/30/2021       Submitted by: Christopher J Patrick]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
