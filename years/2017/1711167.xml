<AbstractNarration>This is an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology, under the program Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellow, Theresa Wei Ying Ong, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow is being mentored by the following sponsoring scientists: Simon Levin (Princeton University), Stacy Philpott (University of California Santa Cruz), and Brenda Lin (CSIRO- Australia). Urban agriculture provides food security, biodiversity, greenspace and educational opportunities to underrepresented groups in science, yet urban landscapes are in constant flux, with parcels frequently transitioning between vacant lots, urban gardens and developed land. This research explores past and future patterns of land-use change in urban areas, the role of socio-economic and ecological factors in driving change, and how land-use change influences biodiversity and ecosystem function. The fellow is participating in multidisciplinary collaborations that will advance her work at the intersection of theoretical, landscape and urban ecology. The project addresses why transitions to urban agriculture are more permanent in some cases than others, and results will be shared with community members who are seeking land-tenure for urban gardens in gentrifying neighborhoods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fellow is receiving training in socio-ecological theory through collaborations with the sponsoring scientists, and is developing a spatially-explicit dynamic model of land-use transitions as a function of the net socio-ecological costs associated with the direction and frequency of transitions between land-use states. The model is also being fit with socio-ecological data from urban gardens, future land-use changes are being predicted, and results are compared to past patterns observed for large, urban counties of California using historical aerial imagery. Historical land-use change is being categorized into dynamic types ranging from critical to smooth, and transition type regressed against data on pest and natural enemy biodiversity in urban gardens to understand its impact on biological control. Broader impacts and broadening participation efforts target youth from working-class families that use urban agriculture for food subsistence and are directly influenced by the land-use change resulting from gentrification of their neighborhoods. These individuals are participating in workshops focused on the socio-ecological drivers and consequences of land-use transitions for biological control services in their own neighborhoods. The results of this research are being further disseminated through policy pamphlets designed for relevance to urban gardeners and city planners.</AbstractNarration>

They also have a history of recurrence following harsh economic times, ie. the victory gardens of World Wars I and II.

The model results were then compared to a land-use history dataset compiled by the fellow by assessing historical satellite images of land-use change in Salinas, Santa Cruz and San Jose, CA. The fellow also combined land-use history data with temporal U.S. home ownership and household income data from the American Community Survey to assess the effects of land insecurity and wealth on the stability of urban gardens.

The fellow assessed how urban landscape characteristics and garden management strategies contribute to species rarity of crops, ornamentals, ladybird beetles, birds and bees. Age of garden significantly impacts species rarity, suggesting that frequent land-use transitions could benefit biodiversity in urban gardens. This project is ongoing, with a manuscript currently submitted.&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition, the fellow conducted two workshops with high school students in Growing Justice, a group of children of farmworkers that use urban gardens as subsistence agriculture in California. The fellow collaborated with the students and their umbrella organization, the Community Agroecology Network (CAN), to develop and execute (i) a biodiversity survey of two community gardens and (ii) a computer workshop analyzing the history of land-use using Google Earth historical aerial imagery in and surrounding the two gardens where biodiversity was surveyed. These results were combined with oral histories of students in an interactive flash animation that recounts the history of land-use change from the perspective of young people growing up within it.
