<AbstractNarration>Visualization, or the use of interactive graphic representations to support data analysis and understanding, has become an integral part in a wide array of application areas. This grant provides support for about 18 U.S.-based graduate students to participate in the Doctoral Colloquium to be held in conjunction with the IEEE Visualization Conference (VIS 2017), October 1- 6, 2017, Phoenix, AZ (http://ieeevis.org/).  The Doctoral Colloquium (DC) was initiated in 2006, and has been highly successful in providing mentorship opportunities from senior researchers to new ones.  DC provides an opportunity to the students to present their doctoral dissertation research and receive feedback from a key group of their peer professionals that will enable them to further shape and improve their work. The VIS Doctoral Colloquium brings together the most promising of the next generation of visualization researchers.  This event allows the participants to create a professional network both among themselves and with senior researchers. This professional network plays a major role in their professional and educational career development.  Since the students and mentors are a diverse group on several dimensions (nationality, gender, ethnicity, scientific discipline, and research specialization), the students' horizons are broadened at a critical stage in their professional development. Supporting participation of U.S. students in DC VIS 2017 is important for the development of researchers, practitioners and educators in the important area of visual analytics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IEEE VIS (formerly known as IEEE VisWeek) is the premier forum for visualization advances in science and engineering for academia, government, and industry, bringing together researchers and practitioners with a shared interest in techniques, tools, and technology for data analysis. VIS 2017 will take place in Phoenix, Arizona, during October 1-6. The event is composed of three main conferences: the 28th Annual IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis), the 23rd Annual IEEE Information Visualization Conference (InfoVis), and the 12th Annual IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology Conference (VAST). It will also include the 14th International Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security (VizSec), the 7th Symposium on Large Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV), and the 3rd Symposium on Visualization on Data Science (VDS). Papers in the InfoVis conference are rigorously refereed and are published in a special conference issue of IEEE Transactions of Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). Select papers from the proceedings of the SciVis and VAST conferences arealso published in IEEE TVCG, while the remaining proceedings papers are published by the IEEE.  Student research will be disseminated via extended abstracts published in the VIS 2017 Extended Abstracts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This award has supported a visualization research colloquium for promising doctoral students and distinguished researchers, held in conjunction with the IEEE VIS 2017 conference. The goal of this doctoral colloquium (DC) was to help young researchers receive feedback on their work and career plans from established and experienced experts in the field. This project has provided the young researchers with a community, guidance, research topics, post&shy;-PhD insight, and an accessible experience while attending the conference. 18 doctoral students were selected for participation, and the NSF award paid for just the 12 participants coming from US institutions.  The participants were evenly distributed across research fields: 6 from the Scientific Visualization community, 6 from Information Visualization, 6 from Visual Analytics. The students were equitably distributed across research groups and institutions; for the most part, no more than one student was selected from each institution, although some exceptions were made to increase diversity among presenters. Six senior mentors, in addition to the three Doctoral Colloquium Chairs of the IEEE VIS conference, were invited to the colloquium (three for each of InfoVis, SciVis and VAST). The mentors spanned a wide range of backgrounds, experience and interests, from academia to research labs and industry. The selected students have given formal presentations of their research plans, followed by extensive and targeted feedback from the mentors. The students were required to take notes for each other, to foster a community spirit. The colloquium was further used for networking.  For the first time, lightning talks were added at the beginning of the day, and these talks were attended by all student participants, all panelists, and even the overall conference chair.  Further, a panel discussion took place at the end of the day, where the students asked and received answers to a multitude of career-related questions.
