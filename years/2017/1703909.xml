<AbstractNarration>PI: Sievers, Carsten&lt;br/&gt;Proposal ID:  1703909&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award provides travel expenses for U.S. researchers to attend the International Young Scientist Symposium on Catalytic Biomass Conversion (IYCBC) that will be held at the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP), Chinese Academy of Sciences, China, on July 11-13, 2017.  The symposium will provide the U.S. researchers the opportunity to share research experiences in the biomass conversion area with peers from Europe and Asia, thus ensuring continued worldwide competitiveness of U.S. catalytic science and technology in biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IYCBC will include topics like preparation and characterization of novel catalyst materials, conversion of cellulose and lignin model compounds, design of catalysts and processes, and life-cycle analysis and carbon footprint tracking for biomass-derived chemicals.  The U.S. researchers will be exposed to the different biomass research and technology practices of their European and Asian counterparts in an environment that will promote long term collaboration.  Such international collaborations are vital for finding sustainable solutions for the production of fuels and chemicals via catalytic approaches that have minimal impact on the environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The International Young Scientist Symposium on Catalytic Biomass Conversion was held in Dalian, China on July 11-13, 2017. It brought together young but independent researcher from Asia, Europe, and North America who have already established a record of accomplishments in the field.     Intellectual Merit:   The main goal of the International Young Scientist Symposium on Catalytic Biomass Conversion was to generate an environment, in which researchers can learn about each other?s work and develop collaborative networks that can last for several decades. A key outcome was the understanding that the approach to catalytic biomass conversion varies strongly between the research communities from different continents. While American catalysis researchers are typically chemical engineers with strong backgrounds in reaction engineering and kinetics, most Europeans working in this area are chemists with expertise in inorganic and organic chemistry, and in many cases spectroscopy. Asian catalysis researchers are often very skilled in the preparation of novel catalytic materials, and there is a strong drive to commercialize catalytic processes developed by academic groups. Since all of these skills are needed to solve pressing problems associated with sustainability, exchange of researchers from different parts of the world is critical. At the end of the symposium, the concept for a perspective article was developed that will be submitted in summer of 2018.     Broader Impact:  The funds from the present conference grant were used to support the travel expenses of seven professors from U.S. universities who are within the first ten years of their independent research career.
