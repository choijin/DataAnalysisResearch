<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests support for the Citizen Central-America Telescope Eclipse (CATE) experiment.  Citizen CATE is a program to observe the total solar eclipse that will track across the United States on August 21, 2017 from 60 locations distributed along the path of totality.  Total solar eclipse crossings of the United States are relatively rare events; the last time a total solar eclipse crossed the Continental U.S. from the Atlantic to the Pacific was June 18, 1918.  While a total solar eclipse lasts only a few minutes at any one particular location, Citizen CATE will have 60 identical sites manned by trained citizen-science volunteers. The goal of the experiment is to produce a continuous white-light movie of the inner solar corona for a period of about 90 minutes.  The resulting data set will provide a scientific resource to further study the dynamics of the corona, and an educational resource for the training of future researchers and for outreach to the general public.   The academic partners that will be involved in the Citizen CATE experiment are drawn from a geographically and demographically diverse set of institutions.  These diverse partners will, in turn, reach out to an even broader audience from small rural events to international broadcasts viewed by thousands.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Never before have the continuous observations of the inner solar corona like those proposed by the Citizen CATE project been performed.  Some of the areas of solar research that will be addressed by such a data set include:  the study of polar plume dynamics, measurement of the coronal potential field, examination of the relationship between coronal smoke rings and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, the search for active-region loop oscillations, and the search for the signatures of coronal inflows.  After the eclipse, the CATE data will be transmitted back to a central location at the PIs institution, the National Solar Observatory in Boulder, CO, for further processing and distribution to the scientific community for further research.  A quick-look movie of the Citizen CATE results will also be made available to the general public on the day of the eclipse.  The CATE data will open a new window on the inner solar corona and will provide valuable context data for future eclipse studies.  Because the equipment that is used by the volunteers for the eclipse observations will stay with the institutions, the project will have lasting effects on STEM education well beyond the 2017 event.  Students from across the country will be engaged in solar physics and astronomy research and education.  The project will, thus, serve to inspire and train the next generation of astronomers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Citizen Continental-America Telescopic Eclipse (CATE) Experiment  A nervous shiver traveled down my spine as I stood on the track at Weiser High School.  There on our CATE computer display we could see that a small chunk of the Sun was blocked by the disk of the moon.  After years of practice, more than 200 volunteers were lined up across the country with 68 sets of identical equipment, about to put their training to use on this special day, 21 August 2017.  At any one spot during a total solar eclipse, you can see the inner corona of the Sun for a few minutes.  But since the Sun is so big, it?s difficult to see changes in the solar atmosphere during such a short time.  For many years leading up to 2017, my colleagues had pointed out that during the August eclipse the moon?s shadow spent more than 90 minutes crossing the country, and with the right type of experiment, this event would allow us to study the inner solar corona in a new way.  Several citizen science programs were launched for this eclipse, and I?m thrilled to have led one of them, the Citizen CATE Experiment.  Eclipse day was amazing!  CATE volunteers collected images of the solar corona for 83 of the 93 minutes that were available, and CATE has produced a completely new type of science data set.  The training program that we established using state coordinators and student teams had worked, and our groups succeeded.  In the words of one site leader:  "After practicing on our own for four months, it was exciting to get to share our experience on eclipse day with three teams of dedicated and experienced scientists. My students and I will never forget our efforts and satisfaction of doing a good job preparing for and producing our image data."  Because of the private, corporate and federal support for this project, each volunteer group has kept their CATE equipment.  Many groups are using them for public outreach activities, education work, and some for science research.  The Citizen CATE Experiment will continue to have an impact with these groups and others, long after the 2017 eclipse is over.
