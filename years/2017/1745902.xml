<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is an efficacious alternative for antibiotics and in treating antibiotic resistant bacteria in a number of fields, including, healthcare, self-care, agriculture, sanitation, animal health, and research. The CDC estimates that in 2013 more than 2 million people had an antibiotic resistant infection, and 23,000 people died due to antibiotic resistance. The costs to society of antibiotic resistance are $20 billion in direct medical costs, and as much as $35 billion in lost productivity-these are the savings in healthcare alone. The potential impact on self-care is a competitive and safe alternative to OTC treatments for bacterial related issues, such as acne, which affects more than 80% of the population at some point in their lives, and has a market size of $644 million. The potential impact on the animal health industry would be a replacement for growth-promoting antibiotics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project core technology is a software and hardware platform that combines a method for creating precision disease models with a novel solution for the discovery of a narrow band lytic bacteriophage. This discovery platform enables the elimination of many of the bottlenecks and short falls of traditional phage and antibiotic product discovery to improve isolation rates of unique, diverse anti-infective candidates. When used in conjunction with regular metagenomic monitoring of a target environment, the technology is able to model a custom phage cocktail to ensure a specific functional profile using combinatorics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since completion of the I-Corps program, SmartPhage, Inc. dba Faye Face, has focused on development of its bacteriophage-based acne treatment product.  With its seed financing, the Company has completed a 12-week clinical trial in which 20 female acne sufferers used the product.  Results showed superior efficacy (in terms of the % reduction in the # of inflammatory acne lesions) and no side effects.  These results compare favorably to a current OTC acne product or a prescription antibiotic/retinoid combination product studied in similar clinical trial designs.   Faye Face has also developed a proprietary serum formulation which meets consumer aesthetics preferences and maintains the stability of its 3-phage cocktail at room temperature.  The Company has also developed intellectual property around optimizing its phage production process.  It has transferred that proprietary process to its contract manufacturer, which has now produced the Company's phages at commercial scale and at a cost that enables a commercial product with an acceptable profit margin.   As part of its MVP development, SmartPhage has engaged a local contract manufacturer who has produced the serum, and is conducting the safety tests required prior to launch of a topical consumer product.    The Company has also developed its initial branding for the consumer acne product, and launched a pre-launch, consumer-facing website in August, 2018.  It has engaged a digital marketing agency, developed its launch marketing plan, and tested several different consumer messages in Facebook and Instagram ads, in order to guide its acne product launch as a digitally native OTC brand in 2Q19.
