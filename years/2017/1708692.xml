<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Quantum computers have the potential to solve certain problems that are intractable on any classical computer.  A quantum computer takes advantage of the unique properties of quantum systems, such as interference and entanglement, to process information.  The information stored and processed in a quantum computer is very delicate and can easily be corrupted by fluctuations of uncontrolled external environmental elements.  Many physical systems are being investigated as potential qubits, the processing elements of quantum computers.  This project focuses on exploring the viability of molecular nanomagnets as qubits.  One of the project's main goals is to make use of so-called atomic-clock transitions to help isolate the magnets from external fluctuations.  Using microwave photons to probe and manipulate the magnetic states of these molecules, the research team is endeavoring to learn how long quantum information can be stored in these systems before becoming degraded and how to chemically engineer the molecules to improve that benchmark.  In addition, the researchers aim to implement basic quantum-computing operations on coupled molecules and assess the suitability of these nanomagnets for potential integration into a large-scale quantum processor.  In tandem with these goals, the research team is investigating related fundamental quantum properties of these magnets that involve coupling them to a microwave radiation field.  The research is being conducted at a primarily undergraduate institution with the participation of undergraduate student-scholars, a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student, all working under the supervision of the PI.  These researchers are all gaining valuable research skills that further the development of their careers in scientific and technical fields.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Many physical systems are being investigated as potential qubits.  Typically, microscopic (e.g. atomic-scale) systems have long coherence times but are difficult to control and address while macroscopic systems offer greater control but less coherence.  The project focuses on exploring the viability of molecular nanomagnets as qubits.  These systems occupy a middle ground in which they have qubit properties that can be tuned (through, e.g., chemical engineering) while maintaining the long coherence times of microscopic systems.  The molecules under investigation exhibit so-called atomic-clock transitions, which make them less susceptible to the decohering effects of dipole or hyperfine fields.  The researchers use pulsed electron-spin resonance to measure the decoherence times for these nanomagnets near atomic-clock transitions.  In addition, the researchers aim to perform quantum gates (such as CNOT) on supramolecular dimers with coupled states built from clock transitions of the magnets.  Such experiments may herald the development of a molecule-based, solid-state quantum processor that exploits atomic-clock transitions to limit decoherence.  In tandem with these goals, the research team is investigating related fundamental quantum properties of these magnets involving coupling the magnets to a microwave resonator.  The research is being conducted at a primarily undergraduate institution with the participation of undergraduate student-scholars, a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student, all working under the supervision of the PI.  These researchers are all gaining valuable research skills that further the development of their careers in scientific and technical fields.</AbstractNarration>
