<AbstractNarration>Hampton University and the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) will continue to manage a program with the goal of increasing the numbers of under-represented minorities and under-served students electing careers in aquatic sciences. This program is known as the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography Multicultural Program or ASLOMP. Applications for the program are encouraged from diverse students, some of whom are nominated by OCE REU PIs, and professionals interested in mentoring these students.  Participants receive a free membership in ASLO and support to attend the annual ASLO Winter meeting and special pre-meeting workshops. ASLOMP will support about 60 to 80 students and faculty each year for an additional three years (2019-2021). The project leaders will cultivate the development of past participants as they incorporate new cohorts of students.  The objectives of the program are to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Expose more diverse undergraduates from the full spectrum of ethnicities and backgrounds, and beginning graduate students to cutting edge aquatic science through fully supporting their active participation in ASLO meetings where they also present their own research.&lt;br/&gt;2. Link diverse students to opportunities for internships, advanced studies, special programs and potential employment through interactions at ASLO meetings.&lt;br/&gt;3. Continue to bring new cohorts of diverse students into the networks of aquatic scientists.&lt;br/&gt;4. Strengthen the significant presence of diverse scientists in ASLO that will form a mentor core for the ongoing recruitment of more underrepresented students into the field, and continue to be a source of diverse candidates for ASLO leadership positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2013 the program embraced a broader meaning for multicultural, inviting all types of students to participate, while retaining an emphasis on building diversity through expanding participation of students from under-represented groups. This expanded approach goes beyond ethnicity and race, and includes those with disabilities, first generation college students, those from underserved rural and urban areas, veterans and non-traditional learners. These are not rigid categories and students that demonstrate other ways of bringing diversity are also welcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ASLOMP program has received much attention and many accolades.  Dr. Cuker received the ASLO Excellence in Education Award presented in 2009 for his work with this program. Feature stories on the program have been included in a variety of journals, and results of an evaluation of the ASLOMP program were published in 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
