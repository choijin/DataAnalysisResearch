<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2017 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Oliver A. Pechenik is "Advances in K-Theoretic Schubert Calculus." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Michigan, and the sponsoring scientist is David Speyer.</AbstractNarration>
