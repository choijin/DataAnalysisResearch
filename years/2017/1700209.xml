<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of US participants in the "Conference in Geometry, Analysis, and Probability" that will be held May 8-12, 2017, at the Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS) in Seoul, South Korea. For additional information see the conference website: http://newton.kias.re.kr/~namgyu/index.html/PJ2017/ .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching theme of this conference is the exploration of the relationship between analytic objects (e.g., analytic capacity, harmonic measure) and geometric concepts (e.g., rectifiability, Hausdorff dimension). The long list of speakers includes the names of a host of the world's leading researchers in harmonic analysis, complex analysis, geometric measure theory, and geometric combinatorics. The program provides ample opportunity for early-career mathematicians to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
