<AbstractNarration>Parking is a growing problem in dense urban areas. To many, finding a parking space in these areas is an unpleasant experience of uncertainty and frustration. Cruising for parking makes traffic on already-congested urban streets even worse and leads to significant waste in time and fuel. In transportation, smartphone-based parking management applications have emerged. These applications help drivers find parking spaces by allowing them to use smartphones to view real-time availability and prices of parking spaces and guide them to open parking spaces, reserved or otherwise. This award develops theoretical foundations and methodologies for analyzing these emerging parking management services. Results from this research provide a better understanding of the impacts of advanced parking management services on parking competition and travel patterns. The research develops policies to reduce traffic congestion and emissions in dense urban areas. This award positively impacts engineering education by offering new materials and case studies and engaging underrepresented student groups in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using game-theoretic, dynamic and stochastic programming approaches to investigate both temporal and spatial travel patterns with advanced parking management, this project generates a set of analytical tools that explain the underlying working mechanisms of advanced parking management services and gauge their potential for reducing traffic congestion. The theoretical efforts in this research are complemented by an agent-based simulation, which tests the validity and applicability of the theories, and unveils complex outcomes of parking competition under realistic parking search behaviors. This work advances the knowledge and analysis of parking management and enriches the literature of modeling morning commute and vehicle routing.</AbstractNarration>

The research team at University of Michigan have designed and analyzed advanced parking pricing, information provision, reservation and navigation for managing downtown curbside parking. The research has generated a set of analytical tools that explain the underlying working mechanism of advanced parking management services with much enhanced representation of traffic and behavioral realism, and laid out a blueprint for optimizing their implementation and designs.&nbsp;</p> <p>The investigation yielded seven journal publications that appear in leading transportation journals. One of them won the 2016 Stella Dafermos Best Paper Award and the 2016 Ryuichi Kitamura Paper Award from Transportation Research Board. Another was one of three finalists for the 2015 Stella Dafermos Best Paper Award. The results have been further disseminated through a variety of media. These results formed the basis for one doctoral dissertation. The project also involved another three PhD students, providing them training on transportation modeling, economics, and operations research. The project will influence the education programs at University of Michigan and elsewhere by offering fresh materials and case studies to expand their curricula. The findings from this project provide timely support for government agencies to better understand the impacts and implications of advanced parking management services and develop policies to guide and aid their development and deployment.&nbsp;</p> <p>Specific research outcomes are summarized as follows.</p> <p>Parking pricing. We have analyzed and priced a parking game where a finite number of drivers compete for curbside parking spaces in a downtown area. We formulated a model to depict potential outcomes of the parking competition, which most likely are not system optimum assignments of parking spaces to vehicles. We then determined optimal parking pricing strategies to achieve a system optimum assignment. Numerical experiments demonstrated the potential of parking pricing for solving real-world parking problems.</p> <p>Parking reservation. We have designed a smartphone-based parking reservation scheme to manage downtown curbside parking. We illustrated the need for designing such a reservation scheme to minimize the total parking cost. Given that the parking cost is closely related to a private information of drivers, their final destinations, we showed that drivers have incentive to misreport this information to the reservation system. Consequently, we designed parking fees to ensure all drivers to provide truthful information and allocate parking spaces optimally. Our simulation demonstrated the proposed reservation system could benefit both the society and individual drivers.</p> <p>Parking navigation. We have designed a smartphone-based parking navigation system that guides drivers to open parking spaces appropriate for them. The system receives status updates from sensors installed in parking facilities. Given drivers&rsquo; real-time locations and their preferences on parking spaces, the system applies a two-side matching algorithm to achieve a stable driver-optimal matching. Under such a stable matching, drivers will be assigned to their most appropriate spaces at all times, and thus no driver can benefit from disobeying the guidance system. Moreover, the proposed matching algorithm will be strategy proof, implying that drivers will have no incentive to misreport their private information.</p> <p>Comparison of parking management schemes. Based on theoretical analyses and simulation, we have compared the effectiveness of parking information and reservation services. Results show that, compared with the status quo, the reservation service can improve the performance of the parking system, while providing information may not. The former is proved a better policy than the latter for the parking competition setting and search behaviors considered in our analyses.&nbsp;</p> <p>Parking simulation. We have developed an agent-based parking simulation tool based on AnyLogic. The tool realistically represents drivers&rsquo; parking search behaviors and capture how parking cruising affects traffic condition and how advanced parking management services help reduce such adverse impacts. The simulation tool is flexible and can be further enhanced by a third party to evaluate another parking management strategy of interest to the party.</p> <p>Parking under emerging mobility services. We have investigated parking provision for emerging mobility services such as crowd-sourced taxi services and automated mobility. Our analyses show that for a given road system, time-varying parking provision can be determined to optimize the system performance, by balancing the impacts of empty vehicle-miles-traveled by shared or automated vehicles and the allocation of urban space between parking and road capacity.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/23/2018<br>      Modified by: Yafeng&nbsp;Yin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1724168/1724168_10325755_1537714879990_Fig1(1)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1724168/1724168_10325755_1537714879990_Fig1(1)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Parking navigation system"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1724168/1724168_10325755_1537714879990_Fig1(1)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Parking navigation system"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Architecture of smartphone-based parking navigation system</div> <div class="imageCredit">Zhibin Chen and Yafeng Yin</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yafeng&nbsp;Yin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Parking navigation system</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1724168/1724168_10325755_1537715001712_ParkingSimulation--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1724168/1724168_10325755_1537715001712_ParkingSimulation--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Parking simulation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1724168/1724168_10325755_1537715001712_ParkingSimulation--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Parking simulation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A screenshot of parking simulation of San Francisco Downtown</div> <div class="imageCredit">Zhibin Chen and Yafeng Yin</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yafeng&nbsp;Yin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Parking simulation</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
