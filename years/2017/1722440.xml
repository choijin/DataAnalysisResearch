<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a high throughput, imagery-based single cell analysis system.  The system will be used to characterize high cell density polymicrobial samples captured during biological research.  Initially, the technology will be applied to the problem of quantifying extremely low levels of microbial contamination in biological samples.  The quantification and control of microbial contamination is an important challenge in industrial fermentation and in the manufacturing of biologics.  Methods for rapid and sensitive detection of microbial contaminants do not exist.  Traditional contamination detection methods involve time-consuming culturing of cells or manual and imprecise checks with a microscope.  The proposed technology will provide automated and rapid sample characterization, allowing a speed of analysis that is 1000 times faster than current systems.  This increased throughput will additionally allow lower levels of contamination to be quantified.  While initially applied to research, the technology can also be used as an analytical and diagnostic tool in the medical field.  For example, this analysis system could be used to search for malformed red blood cells in a human sample that might arise due to a disease like sickle cell anemia, or to determine the relative abundance and morphology of immune cells, an analysis that would help identify certain leukemias.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will create a hardware platform and a parallelized computer vision system that is capable of fully characterizing each cell in a 1mL biological sample in under five minutes.  To analyze samples taken from a fermentation process with high cell densities requires the micrography system to be capable of processing over one billion cells in the analysis window.  The project aims to develop four subsystems: a high pressure microfluidic system for separating and isolating cells, an imaging system, a set of high throughput algorithms to classify the cellular imagery data and a horizontally-scalable computing platform on which to run the classifying code.  The project will begin by developing a low throughput, fully functioning prototype.  The efforts will then focus on developing the four primary subsystems in parallel, using knowledge gained in the prototyping efforts to guide the later work.  Additional phases will focus on the integration of high throughput versions of the subsystems.  The fully realized single cell micrography system will represent a leap forward in speed and specificity compared to traditional cytometry systems.  With no manual intervention and in an open-ended, label-free manner, researchers will be able to conduct parts per billion-level inspection of a biological sample.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This NSF SBIR award funded the Culture Biosciences team in their creation of a high throughput, automated system for growing and testing cells.  Researchers can use this instrument to study how differences in the genetic makeup of a cell impact growth.  The effects of media, chemical additives, cellular consortia and other environmental parameters can also be studied. The cell culturing system is able to automatically control the flow of growth media and monitor the density of the cells as they proliferate.  During the multi-hour process, samples may be extracted and analyzed for cell viability and the presence of certain metabolites.  At the protocol's end, samples are transferred to a location for further processing and long term storage. This project was executed by members of the Culture Biosciences team with a diverse set of backgrounds in biomedical engineering, computer science, user interface design and mechanical engineering.  This is one component in the Culture Biosciences set of cell culture automation systems. We have been able to demonstrate that the system can carry out cell growth experiments and be useful for teams conducting biological research.  We believe this system advances the state of the art in the field of cell culture and will help accelerate the research efforts in the industries of medicine, materials research, the production of new foods and agricultural research.
