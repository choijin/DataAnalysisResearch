<AbstractNarration>Project SYSTEMIC (A Systems Thinking Approach to STEM Ecosystem Development in Chicago) will apply systems thinking to a community-level STEM ecosystem development effort in one of Chicago's largest and most distressed neighborhoods. The project aims to broaden participation of African American and low-income Chicago Public School students (preK-12) in STEM learning opportunities. The proposed model of collaborative change for this project builds on the work of two coordinated collective impact initiatives--the Chicago STEM Pathways Cooperative and Austin Coming Together, a network of local organizations committed to improving educational and economic outcomes for the community. A key feature of this project is that it adds innovative, interactive, visual problem structuring and solving strategies to highlight and uncover the systemic interdependencies that contribute to the BP challenge for African American youth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will convene a series of workshops to engage community stakeholders in the mapping of the STEM ecosystem. A broad and representative cross-section of community stakeholders will design and develop evidence-based STEM ecosystem organizing and implementation strategies. Key outcomes anticipated from this project are the development of a shared understanding, agenda, activities, and commitment to collectively address the underlying challenges of STEM access and participation for African American youth. The goal of this community-driven project is to develop a viable system model that elevates neighborhood voices, historically excluded from the problem-solving table and decision-making processes, to leverage existing assets, build local capacity, increase messaging and awareness of the value of STEM, identify needed new programs, and develop coordination/resource sharing mechanisms across partners to support implementation. The evaluation of this project will be grounded in systems thinking and culturally-responsive approaches that seek to understand the diverse perspectives of stakeholders while measuring progress toward project goals. Evaluation data will be used to assess the problem structuring process, to evaluate the organizational strategy designed to address the structured problem, and to support adaptive learning among stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>

Intentional, strategic, and systemic efforts are necessary to address the challenges faced by these populations such as academic prerequisites, program fees, physical access to programming, or even basic support systems to encourage engagement. Rather than create new programs, Project SYSTEMIC leveraged two novel approaches: application of systems thinking concepts and active engagement of community members and cross-sector stakeholders at the problem-solving table. The project aimed to provide a structure through which stakeholders with varying degrees of power and influence in the community could share their perspectives on the neighborhood?s STEM learning ecosystem, engage in a systems-thinking approach to structuring the wicked problem of broadening participation for Black youth in Austin, identifying systemic interventions, and organizing to develop recommendations for systemic change.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The project included four major activities over two years:</span></p> <ol> <li><strong>Community systemic problem structuring.</strong> In this initial phase, 128 community members from different sectors of the Austin neighborhood created 22 maps of the STEM learning ecosystem according to their perspective.

A second principle relates to the importance of allowing adequate time between project activities for reflection and for acting on insights that emerge from the systemic thinking process. Engaging community members in systems thinking is a dynamic process that must be grounded in a deep, nuanced understanding of community strengths and needs. Since implementation is likely to vary considerably from one community to the next, project teams will likely need to engage in adaptive learning by gathering and reflecting on evidence about the character and progress of the project.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Natasha&nbsp;Smith-Walker</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1744523/1744523_10527875_1590781741439_042618PM_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1744523/1744523_10527875_1590781741439_042618PM_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="PSM Session -

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Project SYSTEMIC Outcomes Report NSF INCLUDES Award #1744523  Project SYSTEMIC (A Systems-Thinking Approach to STEM Ecosystem Development in Chicago) was a research project designed to broaden participation of K-12 African American youth in Chicago?s Austin neighborhood by co-developing a systemic intervention plan with local stakeholders. Austin is located on the West Side of Chicago and is the largest of the city?s seventy-seven officially designated community areas, as well as one of the most economically depressed. The project posited the challenge to broadening participation as a ?wicked problem,? with multiple stakeholders, no clear solution, and deep interconnections with other social issues such as housing and employment opportunities. The two-year project was led by Project Exploration, a science education nonprofit organization that provides out-of-school time STEM programming for Chicago youth, particularly students of color and girls, in collaboration with a systems scientist and university-based advisors. Project SYSTEMIC was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Inclusion across the Nation of Community of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in the Engineering and Sciences (INCLUDES) initiative.  During the past decade, there have been numerous attempts to increase the engagement of underrepresented groups in STEM learning opportunities. Intentional, strategic, and systemic efforts are necessary to address the challenges faced by these populations such as academic prerequisites, program fees, physical access to programming, or even basic support systems to encourage engagement. Rather than create new programs, Project SYSTEMIC leveraged two novel approaches: application of systems thinking concepts and active engagement of community members and cross-sector stakeholders at the problem-solving table. The project aimed to provide a structure through which stakeholders with varying degrees of power and influence in the community could share their perspectives on the neighborhood?s STEM learning ecosystem, engage in a systems-thinking approach to structuring the wicked problem of broadening participation for Black youth in Austin, identifying systemic interventions, and organizing to develop recommendations for systemic change. The project included four major activities over two years:  Community systemic problem structuring. In this initial phase, 128 community members from different sectors of the Austin neighborhood created 22 maps of the STEM learning ecosystem according to their perspective. Each of these maps identified the elements of the ecosystem and the relationships between these elements. Creating a common systems map. Each stakeholder map was digitized and merged to create a common systems map of Austin?s STEM learning ecosystem. Engaging leaders in designing a systemic management plan. Local leaders and organizations were engaged to review the community-developed systems map and design an organizational system tailored directly to the problem as defined by the community.  Cross-community systemic map review. Representatives from the initial problem structuring sessions gathered to review the map, collectively resolve differences, and create boundaries around the structured wicked problem of broadening participation. Through this collective work, community members identified seven high-priority systemic interventions. These included:    Support student emotional &amp; mental health. Build awareness of the wide variety of STEM careers. Generate excitement about STEM through engaging youth &amp; caregiver/parent programs. Provide support services, such as nutritious meals. Link businesses &amp; higher education institutions to support local STEM services for youth. Train and certify early childhood STEM educators. Develop high quality mentoring programs for youth.  Lessons Learned: Project SYSTEMIC uniquely situated community members at the center of identifying and designing strategies to systemically address the pervasive challenge of broadening participation of Black youth. The project demonstrates the importance of leveraging and honoring the assets, expertise, and existing relationships in a community. Rather than having an outside institution develop and implement an intervention, Project SYSTEMIC used systems thinking as a methodology to identify and document the perspectives of a broad range of community members. These perspectives produced a common systems map that was then used by community members to identify systemic interventions. Two principles have emerged from Project SYSTEMIC?s work that can impact future NSF projects that engage community members. The first principle is the importance of grounding the systemic thinking process in the local community. This includes (a) positioning community expertise on an equal footing with systems science and other expertise, (b) leveraging existing networks for communication and engagement, and (c) focusing activities on the lived experience of stakeholders with the greatest ?stake? in the problem. A second principle relates to the importance of allowing adequate time between project activities for reflection and for acting on insights that emerge from the systemic thinking process. Engaging community members in systems thinking is a dynamic process that must be grounded in a deep, nuanced understanding of community strengths and needs. Since implementation is likely to vary considerably from one community to the next, project teams will likely need to engage in adaptive learning by gathering and reflecting on evidence about the character and progress of the project.
