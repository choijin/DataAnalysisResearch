<AbstractNarration>This award funds theoretical research in several different topics in relativistic astrophysics and general relativity.  One focus is on tests of general relativity and on sources of gravitational radiation that might be detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and by future space based detectors. Theoretical studies of sources of gravitational waves funded by this award will be useful to aid detection of signals from black holes and other sources, and also to aid in their interpretation. Gravitational wave studies can tell us about the nature of gravity, properties of black holes, and properties of the early Universe. A second focus is the exploration of newly discovered conservation laws involving black holes, and their implications for deep and poorly understood issues in quantum gravity such as the information loss paradox discovered by Stephen Hawking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the principal research topics of this award are: (i) The development of methods to compute the gravitational waveforms from point particles inspiraling into spinning black holes, using a combination of analytical and numerical approaches; (ii) Generalizing the mathematical formalism of Wald and Zoupas to develop a comprehensive description and understanding of conservation laws involving soft hair on black holes, and studying their physical consequences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed mathematical tools to further our understanding of the properties of black holes, and of gravitational radiation. We derived new conservation laws and new conserved quantities for processes involving black holes, and for processes where objects scatter off one another under the influence of their gravitational fields.  These quantities include energy, momentum and angular momentum, but also include additional quantities that are specific to relativistic gravitation and gauge theories.  These results will be relevant for the interpretation of current and future detections of gravitational wave systems from astrophysical sources, such as neutron star and black hole binaries in distant galaxies.   The results are also relevant for current efforts to use black holes as testing grounds in attempts to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics, such as string theory.  In that context an outstanding puzzle is the so-called black hole information loss paradox, discovered by Stephen Hawking over forty years ago.  New properties and charges (generalizations of electric charge and energy) of black holes discovered over the past several years are likely relevant to this paradox, and the study of their properties and implications is ongoing.  We also discovered a major correction to Hawking's computation in the 1970s of the quantum radiation emitted by black holes as they gradually shrink and eventually disappear. The implications of this correction for the paradox are not yet clear.     Another focus of the project was the development of mathematical tools to allow the computation of the gravitational waves emitted by a system of two black holes in general relativity, in the regime where one black hole is much smaller than the other.  In this regime existing tools such as numerical general relativity are not practical to use, and the gravitational wave signals may be detected by future space based gravitational wave detectors.  Together with our collaborators we developed some new approximation methods that will eventually allow computation of these signals with sufficient accuracy to be useful in comparing with the future observations.     Education and training of graduate students and postdocs are integrated into the research program. Outreach activities by the research group contributed to the appreciation of astronomy and general relativity by the general public, and the principal investigator is active in service roles in the gravitational research community.
