<AbstractNarration>One of the most damaging natural hazards, flooding annually causes billions of dollars in damage, response, and recovery losses for U.S. communities. As populations increase in flood prone areas, communities are becoming more vulnerable to floods. The responsibility for flood management has shifted from the federal to the local level and communities are now responsible for making decisions about if, how, and where to rebuild. Because of their potentially recurring nature, floods offer an opportunity for communities to learn from and adapt to these experiences with the goal of increasing resiliency through reflection, modification of former policies, and adoption of new policies. By following the response to the September 2013 floods in Colorado communities, this study will investigate how communities successfully learn from extreme events to increase resilience and decrease vulnerability to future floods. The project seeks to contribute to the fields of public policy and natural hazards research with the following objectives: to advance knowledge of policy learning in the aftermath of extreme events; to advance knowledge of disaster recovery, specifically as it relates to the role that community processes, citizens, and other stakeholders play in promoting long-term recovery and resilience; and to inform governments of lessons from flood responses to the September 2013 floods, with the goal of contributing to the effectiveness of governance in flood-affected communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will conduct longitudinal comparative case studies of seven Colorado communities, located in Colorado's three most severely impacted counties from the September 2013 floods. This study will follow communities through their recovery and planning process over a period of three years. Four types of data will be used to examine flood recovery processes and outcomes. First, in-depth interviews will be conducted of participants in the planning and decision process of the community at three intervals during the recovery process. Second, surveys will be conducted with a larger sample of recovery process participants than those interviewed. Third, periodic surveys of community residents will be conducted. Finally, documents related to flood recovery and demographic data will also be gathered. Combined, these data will enable both qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery processes and stakeholder participation, extent of damage, coalition beliefs and behavior, political context, and resource availability in communities.</AbstractNarration>

Major findings with regard to processes and outcomes in recovery focused on both individuals and local government organizations. The following summary highlights major findings from the research (through 2018) with continued analysis and publication of findings expected.  Individuals:  Individuals in higher-wealth neighborhoods      perceive greater future risks of flooding, compared to individuals in lower-resourced neighborhoods. Males      perceived lower risk of future flooding than females. Individual      perception of community-level damage is linked with perception of future      flood risk. Perceptions of future flood risk are also linked with      respondents? understanding of the underlying causes of the flooding.  The      extent of damage experienced at the neighborhood and community levels can      have a powerful effect on the perceptions of climate change held by the      public. In turn, these beliefs about climate change are positively      associated with perceptions of risks of future flooding.   Governments:  A      greater openness in post-flood decision processes is associated with more      in-depth deliberation, learning, and more substantive and frequent policy      change. Coalitions      of stakeholders working to advocate for post-flood policy change are      likely to form after emergency response is concluded, and more likely to      form in communities with prior political participation and homogenous      populations. Additionally, state government entities created collaborative      coalitions seemingly to encourage social capital production, but these      top-down coalitions do not appear to achieve the same type of      policy-oriented activity and success as the organic coalitions that emerged      where residents seek to advocate for policy solutions. Local      governments are most likely to see financial policy change focused on      improving tools and processes for recovery reimbursement, construction,      and intergovernmental relationships. There is not significant evidence of      longer-term change towards becoming more financially resilient to disaster      events.  Communities changed policies after the      flood to varying degrees. Communities that engaged in greater depth of      civic capacity-building also saw greater breadth and depth of policy      change. Intergovernmental      relationships between state and local governments play significant roles in      policy learning within local governments. States work with local      governments in different capacities which result in different outcomes for      local governments.   The PIs worked to disseminate project findings within academic publications and conferences as well as to the relevant stakeholders and decision-makers, thereby increasing the utility of the research findings.
