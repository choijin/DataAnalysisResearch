<AbstractNarration>The PI proposes to use geometric methods to attack problems in representation theory and number theory.  Recently the PI has found a way to construct motives with exceptional Galois groups using automorphic forms and the geometric Langlands correspondence.  This idea will be systematically developed in the following years and will have applications to the classical inverse Galois problem.  The PI will also use moduli spaces of Hitchin type to study representations of rational Cherednik algebras, enumeration of Galois representations, and global analogs of Lusztig's character sheaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In mathematics, it is a general rule that the most interesting symmetries should arise geometrically.  For example, the ancient classification of Platonic solids is seen nowadays as an instance of finding all 'finite symmetries' in three-dimensional space.  With the revolution of algebraic geometry in the second half of the 20th century, we now have powerful geometric tools available to solve classical and new problems in number theory and group theory. The PI will use these geometric tools to attack problems in the Langlands program.  In the 70s, Langlands made a series of conjectures which links arithmetic invariants (e.g., solutions to Diophantine equations) to analytic invariants (e.g., modular forms).  The predictions that Langlands made, if proved, will be extremely powerful in solving classical problems (including the Fermat Problem which was solved in this way).  Through this project, the PI hopes to shed light on some problems in the Langlands program and to discover more symmetries that appear in geometry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The main theme of research supported by this award is the interplay of three central subjects in modern mathematics: algebraic geometry, number theory and representation theory. These subjects are connected through the Langlands program, whose ultimate goal is to build bridges between two seemingly very different kinds of symmetries. The PI is interested in applying geometric ideas to solve problems in number theory or representation theory. The main results during the period of the award are:   1. The theory and applications of rigid automorphic forms.  In the work "Motives with exceptional Galois groups and the inverse Galois problem" (published in Inventiones Mathematicae), examples of rigid automorphic forms are used to construct motives over number fields with exceptional motivic Galois groups (solving a conjecture of Serre) and to prove new instances of the inverse Galois problem.   With this work and previous joint work with J.Heinloth and B-C.Ngo, the PI realized that it would be fruitful to develop a general theory of rigid objects in automorphic representations and in the Langlands correspondence for function fields. In the work "Rigidity in automorphic representations and local systems" (appeared in the book "Current Development in Mathematics 2013"), the foundations of the theory of rigid Langlands correspondence have been laid down.  In the work "Epipelagic Representations and rigid local systems" (published in Selecta Mathematica),  a new class of examples were constructed using Vinberg's invariant theory.  In another work "Galois representations attached to moments of Kloosterman sums and conjectures of Evans" (published in Compositio Math),  techniques from rigid automorphic forms were used to solve conjectures on exponential sums.      2. Geometric representation theory of Cherednik algebras  In joint work with Oblomkov "Geometric representations of Cherednik algebras" (Advances in Mathematics), the PI developed geometric tools to construct and study representations of Cherednik algebras.

Higher Gross-Zagier formula  In the joint work with Wei Zhang "Shtukas and the Taylor expansion of L&shy; functions" (to be published in Annals of Mathematics), the PI proved a generalization of the Waldspurger formula and the Gross&shy;-Zagier formula to higher derivatives of automorphic L-&shy;functions for PGL(2) over function fields. It relates the higher order derivatives of the automorphic L-&shy;function to the self-intersection numbers of algebraic cycles in certain moduli spaces (the moduli of "Shtukas" invented by Drinfeld).  This formula is the first time where higher derivatives of an L-&shy;function was given a geometric meaning. It has the potential of adding a new degree of freedom to the Langlands program for the function fields.              The PI continued his joint work with Wei Zhang to extend the previous work to the ramified case. This is almost done. The extended the formula includes the case coming from semistable elliptic curves over function fields, giving evidences for the Birch--&shy;&shy;Swinnerton-&shy;Dyer conjecture in the function field case.      4. Character sheaves on graded Lie algebras  In a series of three papers joint with George Lusztig "Z/m&shy;graded Lie algebras and perverse sheaves, I, II and III" (two to be published in Representation Theory, one submitted), the PI generalized aspects of Springer theory to the situation of perverse sheaves supported on the nilpotent cone of a graded piece of a Lie algebra. A key tool called "spiral induction" was discovered for this study. The third paper also revealed connection between such perverse sheaves and Cherednik algebras with unequal parameters.                 5. Betti geometric Langlands  In two joint preprints with David Nadler "Geometric Langlands correspondence for SL(2), PGL(2) over the pair of pants" and "Spectral action in Betti Geometric Langlands", the PI proposed a new perspective to the geometric Langlands program which should be of topological nature. Some foundational materials of this new direction were been recorded in these papers as well as basic examples.
