<AbstractNarration>The chemical composition of the oceans holds clues to important aspects of the history of climate, life, and mountain building on the Earth.  Although we now know that the amount in seawater of certain elements like calcium, magnesium and sulfur, which are minor, but significant, constituents of seawater, have changed by large amounts and cyclically over many millions of years, we still do not know what causes these changes.  One process that can contribute to, and also be affected by, the changes is the circulation of seawater through the fractured oceanic crust near mid-ocean ridges.  This research is aimed at understanding how changes in dissolved S, Mg, and Ca in seawater affect the large geothermal systems that stretch around the globe on the ocean floor.  Better understanding of could lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of why Earth's climate oscillates over long time periods and how mid-ocean ridge geothermal systems transfer chemical elements between the deep Earth and the oceans.  The research involves laboratory experiments that reproduce the conditions and processes deep within hot oceanic crust and models how seawater circulates through the rocks and changes as chemical reactions occur. In terms of broader impacts, the experiments will provide thermodynamic and kinetic data that can be used in geothermal resource development and in studies of water-rock interaction that occur in other contexts, such as nuclear waste storage.  New data on Sr partitioning in secondary minerals could have broad applicability to studies of hydrothermal/geothermal systems.  Additional impacts include support of analytical and experimental research facilities at that benefit students at the University of California and many other scientists and students from other institutions. The educational value of the project is substantial in that it connects geological processes with oceanography and climate, and integrated knowledge of chemistry, hydrology and geology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems are a major contributor to the ocean's geochemical cycle.  The chemical exchange that occurs as seawater circulates through basalt and gabbro of varying temperatures affects the balance of ions in seawater and influences the carbon cycle through the coupling of dissolved Ca and Mg and carbonate sedimentation. Understanding the geologic history of the oceans and the relationships between seawater chemistry and climate requires that chemical exchange between seawater and oceanic crust at and near mid-ocean ridges be understood, not only at present, but back in time through Earth's history.  Differences in the chemical composition of seawater in the geologic past could have had a significant effect on the seawater-basalt exchange in seafloor hydrothermal systems, especially at times when seawater Mg and SO4 were lower, and Ca and Sr were higher than at present.  Consideration of these differences could cause major changes in the way we interpret records from past oceans, in particular the Sr isotopic evolution of seawater. It may also change how we view the causes and consequences of changes in seawater composition through Earth history.  There is evidence that Sr isotopic exchange between seawater and ocean floor rocks changed substantially during periods when the Mg/Ca and Ca/SO4 ratios of the ocean were different than they are today. Hence modern seafloor hydrothermal systems may not be representative of most of the Phanerozoic.  To better understand how seawater Mg-Ca-SO4 chemistry affects MOR hydrothermal experiments using reactors and mineral/fluid compositions that mimic seafloor hydrothermal systems will be run at varying fluid compositions. Run products will be analyzed geochemically and the results will be incorporated into the water-rock interaction modeling code TOUGHREACT, a hydrological modeling code that will be modified to accommodate conditions of seafloor hydrothermal systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The floor of the oceans is made up of basalt lava flows and dikes that are formed where the plates diverge by a process called seafloor spreading that occurs at mid-ocean ridges.  These ridges form a nearly continuous ridge on the ocean floor that circles the globe and is more than 65,000 kilometers long.  Under the ridges, magma is present at shallow depth, just a few kilometers below the ocean bottom, and the extreme heat supplied from this shallow magma causes seawater to be drawn down into the rocks and to circulate in a global hydrothermal system.  Every million years a mass of water equal to about twice the volume of the oceans circulates through this global hydrothermal system.   The heat carried by circulating fluids is an important means by which heat is lost from the interior of the Earth.  The other effect is that hot seawater reacts with the rocks, which has the effect of exchanging chemical components of the rocks with those of the oceans. This exchange affects the chemical composition of the oceans, and helps regulate global climate.  It also acts a means of taking materials from the ocean, including water, and recycling them back into the deep mantle.  Hence the mid-ocean ridges hydrothermal system holds many keys to understanding how the Earth has evolved over its long history.  Although there has been extensive study of the hot springs associated with these hydrothermal systems, the so-called ?black smokers,? and the mineralogy of ocean floor rocks affected by hydrothermal alteration, there has been little effort at making models to simulate the overall chemical exchange in the systems.  But such models are critical to gaining a more complete understanding, and especially for figuring out how the systems are different at fast versus slow spreading ridges, and of particular interest for this project, when the chemical composition of seawater was different.  This project was focused on efforts to document and model how mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems change when seawater has a different composition, as was the case, for example, about 90 million years ago when the oceans had a lot more dissolved calcium and a lot less dissolved magnesium and sulfate.  One aspect of our approach involved laboratory experiments where we allowed minerals (feldspar and pyroxene) to react with seawater-like fluids under controlled temperature conditions.  These experiments were viewed as necessary to understand better how fast these reactions proceed, and also to better relate the behavior of the element Sr to that of Ca, Mg and SO4.  Our experimental results indicate that pyroxene dissolves considerably faster than feldspar, but that independent of the proportions of feldspar and pyroxene, the fluid always loses all of its magnesium and acquires almost exactly a compensating amount of Ca from the minerals.  Sr behaves in a manner that can be keyed to the changes in calcium.  These results help to constrain models for the overall hydrothermal system because feldspar and pyroxene are the two most prevalent minerals in basalt.  In parallel with the experiments we have run simplified 2-dimensional simulations of the near-axis part of hydrothermal systems.  These simulations provide several new insights into what the system look like down below the ocean floor, and how they work to change the mineralogy of the basalt and the composition of circulating seawater.  One important insight is that the circulation of cold seawater down into the basalt has a dramatic effect on cooling the rocks.  The water gets quite deep before it gets heated enough to start reacting with the rocks.  The upflowing hot fluid is limited to a narrow zone near the ridge axis.  Almost all of the chemical exchange happens in a small part of the system that can be maintained at temperature above about 150?C.  This result may explain why the mineral anhydrite is so seldom seen in ocean floor basalt; it forms only quite deep in the system, at a depth of more than 1 kilometer below the ocean floor.  The precipitating anhydrite also doesn?t clog the system and inhibit flow, because it forms where other minerals are rapidly dissolving.    Our relatively simple 2 dimensional models reproduce many observations of the hydrothermal systems, including the Ca, Mg, and SO4 of black smoker fluids, their Sr and Sr isotopes, and their oxygen deficient nature. The simulations also show the changes when seawater has a different composition.  These simple, but still quite involved, simulations set the stage for more complicated models that account for seafloor spreading and differing thermal effects in slow spreading ridges.  The models resulting from this project provide a mechanism to understand how the ancient oceans were different from the modern oceans, and raise a number of questions about how mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems work.
