<AbstractNarration>3D printing has tremendous potential to improve productivity in American businesses large and small, and to expand our ability to compete through innovation.  It holds the promise of moving from mass-manufacture of one design for all, to mass customization where objects can be individualized to meet personal needs and preferences, as well as the demands of varying tasks.  It also holds the promise of "democratizing" the means of production, by extending a new ability to manufacture unique products to individuals and small businesses who could not previously afford to do their own manufacturing.  However, there are a number of barriers which are currently keeping this exciting new technology from reaching more widespread use.  One of those barriers is the limited range of materials that 3D printers can handle.  Currently, nearly all 3D printing is done in a single hard material such as plastic.  However, most of the objects we use regularly are made from multiple materials, and often include soft materials which, as of yet, are inaccessible to 3D printers.  This project seeks to improve this situation by exploring the design and implementation of new types of 3D printers, including: those that can produce soft fibrous materials; those capable of creating metal objects without the need for high temperatures or specialized environments; and hybrid printers capable of producing mixed material objects that include both hard metal and plastic as well as soft components.  The goal is to create simple printers that are inexpensive and suitable for potential home or small business use.  To maximize impact, a premium will be placed on simplicity of operation, so that the new printers can be run in your garage or basement if not on your desktop, by people without extensive training; similarly, there will be no use of exotic materials or chemistry.  If successful, project outcomes will have a wide impact which helps to change the nature of manufacturing by expanding its availability and flexibility, especially for smaller scale production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to develop three new types of 3D printers and to explore the design space for interactive devices which is opened by them. The first will produce prints that are able to mix soft fibers (produced by electrospinning) with traditional rigid plastic in a single print. The second will consider printing of layered metal objects at near room temperature in a way that will support embedding and mixing of materials, while the third will take advantage of this property to provide prints which are capable of containing metal (e.g., as a strong structural core), conventional plastic (e.g., as a functional body) and soft fiber components (e.g., as a soft skin and/or to provide flexibility where needed).  For each of these printers, the project will explore the substantial new design space that is opened up at three levels: basic printing capabilities (such as engineered stiffness variations for custom bending), reusable components that are enabled by the new materials (such as input sensors or new compliant mechanisms), and full example objects which will test the practical bounds of the work.</AbstractNarration>

To do this, the project has also considered the creation of software tools to make design and production easier and more effective.  Some highlights of results from this work include:  * Development of a new 3D printer and print process based on ?electrospinning?, a technique for creating non-woven fabric and fiber objects from polymers (plastics).  This printer is capable of mixing soft fibers with conventional plastic printing in one print.  * Exploration of several new techniques related to use of an industrial knitting machine as a computational fabrication device to create soft objects, including new techniques for creation of functional knitted objects, as well as sophisticated tools for automatically generating knitted textures from high level goals.   * Developed a new low-cost Jacquard loom for personal handweaving which is more than an order of magnitude less expensive to construct than prior looms, enabling computational weaving techniques to be more widely employed in a handweaving context.  * Created a new assistive hand knitting device to support users with motor control and related special needs.

This work has included the construction of a prototype fabrication machine for furniture and room scale inflated objects, as well as design of several new input sensors and actuation mechanisms which can be manufactured directly into these objects to make them interactively responsive.  * Development of new techniques or use of carbon fibers as electrical conductors within high strength 3D printed carbon composite objects.
