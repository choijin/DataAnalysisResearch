<AbstractNarration>Complex numbers are everywhere in modern mathematics, from solving quadratic equations, to modeling fluid flow, to probing the spaces hidden in the curled-up dimensions of string theory.  The natural domains of complex-number-valued functions are complex manifolds, including the n-dimensional complex Euclidean space. This project concerns the relationship between the geometry of a natural class of complex manifolds, called Kahler manifolds, and the behavior of complex functions on these manifolds.  One of the most beautiful results in complex analysis (the study of complex-valued functions) is the uniformization theorem, which says that one-dimensional complex manifolds have essentially only three shapes: a sphere, a disc, or a plane, corresponding to positive, negative, or zero curvature. A higher-dimensional version of uniformization has long eluded mathematicians; for example, it is conjectured that if an open n-dimensional complex manifold has positive curvature then it is a copy of complex n-space.  The PI will address this long-standing conjecture.  The resulting research, which lies at the intersection of many branches of mathematics, will establish new and interesting connections between analysis, algebra, differential geometry and topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More precisely, the PI will work on the uniformization conjecture of Yau, which states that a complete noncompact Kahler manifold with positive bisectional curvature is biholomorphic to complex n-space. So far there have been numerous attempts at this conjecture, starting with Mok-Siu-Yau in early 1980s.  Along with the uniformization conjecture, the PI will also address related problems such as Siu's conjecture on Stein-ness of complete noncompact Kahler manifolds with positive bisectional curvature.  As in the PI's earlier work, the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence theory will serve as an important tool to study these conjectures. The PI will also study the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of Kahler manifolds with curvature lower bound (e.g., the degeneration of the complex structure). In some sense, this is a generalization of the breakthrough result of Donaldson-Sun on Kahler manifolds. The expectation is that the limit space should carry a natural complex analytic structure.</AbstractNarration>
