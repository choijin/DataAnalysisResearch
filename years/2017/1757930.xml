<AbstractNarration>The goal of Research Experience for Community College Students (RECCS) in the Geosciences is to engage 10 Colorado community college students per year through participation in authentic research in the geosciences with emphasis on locally relevant topics. Particular focus will be on engaging and supporting rural Colorado students. RECCS participants will be mentored through a 9-week research project overseen by preeminent scientists and will receive skills and scientific communication training over the course of the summer. It is expected that the research experience will guide students toward science degrees at four-year institutions. Rigorous program evaluation will provide data to measure the effects of engaging these students in research experiences and subsequent student interest in pursuing STEM-focused four-year college or graduate school degrees and scientific careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This summer research program will engage a diverse cadre of community college  , especially those from rural Colorado, in the sciences. Community colleges tend to be diverse in terms of race, ethnicity, and income level, and often include rural, first-generation college or veteran-status students. Studies show that research experiences help students improve their understanding of the scientific process, their ability to read scientific literature critically, and to integrate theory and practice. These students are more likely than others to pursue future research experiences or enroll in graduate school programs. The RECCS research environment is designed to provide several layers of mentoring by scientists, professional development trainers and RECCS staff, as well as peer-group interaction, to instill a sense of belonging within the student cohorts. This structure will ensure that participants receive the support they need to succeed in their projects and to gain confidence in their scientific ability. The involvement of scientists from Colorado University Boulder and local Federal Laboratories will provide students with access to cross-disciplinary and cross-agency expertise and  foster connections and collaborations between those research groups. In addition, RECCS also provides mentoring opportunities for early career scientists. The engagement of students from different community colleges will have a ripple effect on the students around them, hopefully inspiring other community college students to pursue science internships and other research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
