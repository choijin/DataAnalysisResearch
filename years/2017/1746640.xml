<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to ultimately increase the number of women in STEM careers, thus allowing women to secure higher paying jobs and to expand global innovation by increasing the number of women who are inventing future technologies. Research demonstrates a direct connection between play and academic pursuits, yet few STEM products appeal to the 10MM+ pre-adolescent U.S. girls.  Our hypothesis is that by designing an Internet of Things (IoT) platform of interactive decor building kits with motion and lighting features, we can engage girls in hands-on STEM learning during a formative time in their emotional and intellectual development. The kits will offer educational and exploratory opportunities including spatial and sequential thinking, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and programming. The user guides and on-line learning modules will be authored and designed to create and build a STEM identity in girls. Our theory is that this hands-on experience will create attitudinal and identity shifts in girls to motivate them to pursue additional STEM academic opportunities and further their exploration with other STEM activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is a method to provide an entrance to STEM experiences for a population typically not recognizing their strengths and abilities in the STEM areas. This is accomplished by leading them through an IoT modular product platform to build personalizable decor accessories as they pursue their interest in decorating and the arts.  The proposed project?s objectives are: (1) design and build a hardware prototype; (2) design and build an app prototype; (3) design and conduct research to determine that interaction with the proposed IoT modular platform results in an attitudinal shift toward STEM. The project will employ research methods including a large scale learning styles survey (400 users); moderated and recorded user feedback sessions, and in-person studies (15 users) using questionnaires adapted from published research and academic assessments.  Our success parameters are: (1) 50% of users can build and program the IoT product; (2) 20% of girls experience an increase in STEM areas; (3) 15% improvement in short-term recall of STEM skills and vocabulary; (4) 25% of users report an interest in trying another STEM experience; (5) 50% of users report they would display completed product in their room.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF SBIR Phase 1 Project Outcomes Report  Women remain underrepresented in many technical STEM careers including computer science and engineering. Long before women enter college or the career world, the experiences they have with STEM at home and school during their early elementary years can influence their interest in technical domains and have a lasting impact.  Despite this, very few products exist that are specifically designed to engage pre-adolescent girls in technology and engineering concepts.  The main research goal for this NSF SBIR Phase I grant was to create an Internet of Things (IoT) educational platform that engages pre-adolescent girls aged 8-12 in STEM via a hands-on building, engineering and programming experience that fuses arts and crafts with technology, and ultimately increases their STEM literacy and positive attitudes and interest in STEM. In order to meet this goal, three primary project objectives were set:  develop a prototype of a hardware building kit (Interactive Wall Art), build the associated app and conduct research to determine product efficacy. All three objectives have been completed, thus completing the SBIR Phase 1 work.  In order to evaluate the efficacy of the Wall Art Kit at increasing STEM literacy and positive attitudes, mixed-method research was conducted with a sample of N=20 girls aged 8-12 years (mean age= 10.05 years). Girls completed pre and post interviews before and after engaging in a 3-hour hands-on session building and programming with the Wall Art Kit prototype. A subset of n=16 girls participated in a follow-up survey an average of 30 days after their in-person experience to explore how well they retained STEM concepts they were introduced to.

Additionally, girls had a high level of retention of key facts and concepts, with 87% or more of girls answering all technical questions correctly on the follow-up survey and 100% of girls answering three of the questions correctly.  These results suggest the powerful impact the Wall Art technology may have on increasing girls' technical knowledge, confidence, and positive attitudes.
