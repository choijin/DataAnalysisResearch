<AbstractNarration>Newer faculty often find the process of writing their first grant proposals to be quite challenging. Professors Katherine Plass of Franklin and Marshall College and Thomas Miller of the California Institute of Technology are organizing a workshop that seeks to provide new faculty with insight about proposal writing and reviewing processes, and position newer faculty to write more competitive proposals to federal funding agencies. Participants have the opportunity to network with successful grant recipients and program officers. They engage in mock panels, speed coaching sessions, and other activities designed to provide them with a better understanding of how to put together a research plan that is ambitious yet realistic. Broader impacts are also discussed in terms are educational activities, outreach and applications to societal problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop, supported by the Division of Chemistry, is entitled, "Chemistry Early Career Investigator Workshop," will be held on March 20-21, 2017 in Arlington, Virginia. This workshop brings together 100 junior faculty from a broad range of institutions and demographics to discuss steps in strategically crafting research ideas, planning educational and outreach activities, and assessing and evaluating project aims. Potential participants can access more information as it becomes available at: http://go.fandm.edu/che-2017career. In addition an email address is also available: CHE-2017Career@fandm.edu</AbstractNarration>

Faculty members (99 total) eligible for funding through the NSF CAREER program and likely to apply to the Division of Chemistry spent 1.5 days working closely with all Division of Chemistry program directors, as well as four invited speakers who had received CAREER funding and program directors from other federal agencies. Attendees came from a diversity of institution types and locations across the country. Almost 50% (48 of the 99 attendees) identified as members of groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.  Workshop evaluations were overwhelmingly positive. Of the 78 participants who responded, 98% indicated that they would recommend attending such a workshop to colleagues. Attendees reported improved ability to prepare quality proposals that clearly communicate to reviewers on both a general and detailed level and satisfy NSF requirements.  Furthermore, attendees better understood NSF requirements and merit review criteria. In particular, participants reported a greater understanding of what is encompassed in the broader impacts requirement. This was the most common concern of attendees before the workshop. Additional benefits included attendees who reported feeling ready to communicate well with program directors and to act as proposal reviewers.  A website was developed (http://go.fandm.edu/che&shy;2017career) that was not only used for organizing the workshop, but now contains a resources page with slides from all of the invited speakers, the advice solicited from CAREER awardees, as well as summaries of what the attendees learned from each activity.  This workshop has ensured that 99 new faculty members are well trained not merely to write NSF proposals well, but to craft their careers and those of their students around activities that advance science and serve society as communicated through the intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
