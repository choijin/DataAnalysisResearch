<AbstractNarration>LIGO has identified gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing black hole binaries, initiating a revolution in astrophysics. Reliable measurements about these previously-unseen events will allow astrophysicists to infer the processes responsible for forming them, and to test general relativity. The main thrust of this project is to perform comparisons of the best available solutions of Einstein's theory (large-scale supercomputer simulations) and current approximations used to estimate the parameters of the binary systems, such as masses, spins, orbital eccentricity, etc. Numerical relativity solutions will be used to remove bias and reduce systematic errors in the estimation of these parameters from data observed by LIGO. Accurate knowledge of these parameters will lead to a greater understanding of the processes that formed these binary systems and the history of their corresponding stellar progenitors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major theme of this project is the interpretation of gravitational wave observations of binary black holes, as measured using LIGO data.  The PI's group will help produce these distributions and the associated science. The principal method at present to infer the properties of coalescing black holes relies on approximate solutions of Einstein's equations, whose limitations will bias astrophysical inferences about individual events and populations. Thus, to enable this core activity, this group will directly and indirectly compare LIGO data to numerical relativity simulations of binary black hole coalescence and will perform inference using several models in parallel, including multimodal surrogate models tuned to numerical relativity, to draw the sharpest possible conclusions and assess the systematic error.  Additionally, the group will extend underlying parameter estimation strategy used in this approach.  For example, by using Gaussian process interpolation of the likelihood function to make the inferences more robust and to assess their error. They will also develop a hierarchical strategy for targeting numerical relativity followup simulations and incorporating them into the parameter and systematic error estimates. These techniques will be apply to perform tests of general relativity using multiple modes excited during the merger, particularly as excited coherently during the coalescence of precessing binary black holes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit: The revolutionary discovery of gravitational waves (GWs)  from a pair of merging black holes demonstrated the power of a new messenger to convey new insight about the universe.   The years 2017-2020 encompassed continued dramatic GW discoveries enabled by the NSF's ongoing investments, notably (a) dramatic discoveries of many more and extreme merging objects, with exceptionally large or asymmetric masses, challenging ourexpectation for how these form; and (b) the transformative discovery of both gravitational waves and light from the collision of two  neutron stars.   Over the duration of this award, the RIT group made key contributions to two critical tasks, on the one hand characterizing individual events from their waves, and on theother reconstructing the population of events responsible from individual events.    The project produced two key pieces of open-source software used as critical infrastructure for production GW analysis and interpretation, in parallel to its two core activities: RIFT and PopModels.   RIFT is a code to infer parameters ofindividual merging binaries from their gravitational waves.  Developed during this award by O'Shaughnessy and Lange, RIFT has become increasinglywidely used due to its low computational cost and flexibility, playing an increasingly important part of the discoveryand catalog papers written during this period, particularly for GW190521 and the forthcoming O3a catalog, as well as forthe binary neutron star GW170817.   PopModels is a code to infer the distribution of merging binaries,given a set of observations and  outputs.  Developed by Wysocki and O'Shaughnessy, it played a particularly critical role in the interpretation of GWTC-1,providing roughly half of LIGO's headline interpretations.  The project also enabled a key new inference strategy: directly comparing GW observations to numerical relativity. This approach shows tremendous value when interpreting the most massive and  revolutionary observations like GW190521,which challenged existing models' flexibility and accuracy.  Our work was critical to enable comparison with eccentric numerical relativity simulations, which fit the data well and which are compatible with the location of a proposed optical counterpart.  This award also helped the group conduct numerous short-author investigations supporting the interpretation of LIGOresults.  We specifically made detailed comparisons to  binary evolution models, to highlight the value of BH spinsmeasurements.  We also contributed to multiple studies about binary black hole formation in AGN disks, and associated observational signatures.  In short, our group's work has made critical contributions to the characterization and interpretation of LIGO's observations.  For example, our work identified the sharp dropoff in event rate at high mass; we then  helpedconfidently determine the parameters of GW190521; and we provided a natural interpretation for it, in the context ofhierarchical binary formation.   More broadly, we have produced leading work on the properties, demographics, and origins of mergingcompact binaries, constantly and quantitatively confronting observations with astrophysical theory to help differentiate between the many current options for how these objects might form. At the highest level, our work focuses on how gravitational wave observations help us learn about the lives and deaths of massive stars over cosmic time, alone and inbinaries, and how these clues in turn tell us about where these objects live and how those structures form -- for example about dense cluster environments near galactic centers.   Mentoring and broader impacts:  This award provided principal, partial, or indirect support for three graduate students(J. Lange, D. Wysocki, and V. Delfavero).  The two graduating students Wysocki and Lange obtained postdoctoral positions at UWM and UTAustin, respectively.    Both students were trained to manage multiple high-impact collaboration deliverables, their ownshort-author work, and simultaneously mentor junior students and undergraduates in our research group.     Former undergraduate, then MS student, and now PhD candidate V. Delfavero completed their MS thesis work on RIFT. Undergraduates M. Rizzo and B.
