<AbstractNarration>The occurrence of earthquakes below 50 kilometers depth, and as deep as 700 kilometers depth, is unexpected because of the high pressure and temperature at those depths. Such deep earthquakes, which represent ~25% of all earthquakes globally, occur in subduction zones and occasionally cause damage at the surface, so better understanding of why they occur will help with seismic hazard analysis and preparation. It will also help us to better understand the variety of conditions under which earthquakes can occur. This work will provide new constraints on the possible mechanisms of such earthquakes by studying the properties of a unique cluster of earthquakes that occur beneath northwestern South America. This project benefits society because of its focus on earthquake occurrence and hazard and because it enhances STEM education by training a postdoctoral fellow in seismology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cauca cluster of intermediate-depth earthquakes, which is located beneath Colombia between at depths of 50-200 kilometers, has ~58 earthquakes per year with local magnitude ML greater than or equal to 2.5. The earthquakes are located both in a planar seismic zone in the subducting slab and in two distinct columns, or fingers, extending 30-40 kilometers normal to and above the slab and into the mantle wedge.  Using seismic data from 2010 to the present from the Colombian National Seismic Network, the Cauca cluster earthquakes will be characterized by precisely relocating the earthquakes, inverting waveforms to calculate focal mechanisms for many of the larger earthquakes, and estimating static and dynamic source properties for the earthquakes.  These analyses will provide the first-ever characterization of mantle wedge earthquakes and a comparison of the source properties of earthquakes in two settings, thus enabling the testing of different hypotheses --- such as dehydration embrittlement, shear instability, hydrofracture, and collapse of fluid propagation pathways --- for why these earthquakes occur.  The new constraints on the mechanisms of intermediate-depth earthquakes and fluid migration pathways through the mantle wedge will be applicable to all subduction zones&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   When two tectonic plates collide, one plate sinks (or subducts) deep into the Earth beneath the other one.  Earthquakes occur both between and within the two plates.  While the high pressures and temperatures &gt;70 km depth should prevent earthquakes from occurring, earthquakes within subducting plates can occur down to as much as 700 km depth.  We investigate why these deep earthquakes occur by studying a unique group of earthquakes in Colombia, where the Nazca plate subducts beneath the South American plate.  By precisely locating the earthquakes and measuring other earthquake properties, we have learned that the Cauca cluster of earthquakes occur both within the subducting plate and, unusually, in three distinct groups above it at ~100 km depth.  The earthquakes in the Nazca plate are likely caused by melt-related mechanisms whereas the earthquakes above the Nazca plate are likely a result of fluids released from the subducting plate traveling upwards through a relatively cool layer of rock.  The observation of earthquakes above the subducting plate represents a new type of earthquake and our characterization of those earthquakes helps the community understand why intermediate-depth earthquakes occur and, more generally, provides insight into processes at convergent margins. With the participation of postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students in the research, this work has contributed to the training of the next generation of scientists.  The collaboration with scientists in Colombia has contributed to a global perspective and enhanced the infrastructure for research.
