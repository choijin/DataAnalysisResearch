<AbstractNarration>The research supported in this proposal concerns the study of nonlinear dispersive and wave equations.  These arise as fundamental models of a wide variety of physical systems, including the propagation of waves and the study of nonlinear optics, and are closely related to models of fluids, as well as a number of aspects of statistical and quantum mechanics.  The development of mathematical tools to understand important issues such as existence and uniqueness of solutions, as well the behavior of the corresponding evolutions on a qualitative and quantitative level, is therefore an issue of fundamental scientific importance.  As a particular example, several of the questions to be investigated in this research involve studying long-time properties of solutions to the nonlinear Schrodinger and nonlinear wave equations evolving from "generic" randomly chosen initial data.  In addition to being of substantial mathematical interest, investigation into these questions addresses the broader scientific issue of whether possible singularities arising in the mathematical formulation can occur in physically relevant settings.  Moreover, the topics to be studied are closely connected to a wide range of issues in partial differential equations, probability, and harmonic analysis, and the ideas and techniques developed will provide important contributions to the availability of mathematical tools for future research on related questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The particular scope of this research project is to investigate several problems concerning local and global well-posedness properties for nonlinear dispersive and wave equations, focusing on the nonlinear Schrodinger, nonlinear wave, and Korteweg-de Vries equations.  The research encompasses four broad directions, which are often interrelated, and which each contribute to the wider theme of understanding the precise dynamical behavior of solutions both locally and globally in time.  The first two directions of interest concern global in time existence of solutions, in particular focusing first on the development of global well-posedness results adapted to the energy-supercritical setting, and second on important issues surrounding probabilistic global well-posedness results in endpoint and limiting situations (in this probabilistic framework, initial data for the problem is chosen as a random Fourier series, and results are obtained by excluding sets occurring with small probability).  The third direction of interest turns to the study of local in time stability properties of solutions, focusing in particular on initial data of low-regularity.  The fourth direction of study investigates dispersive models with higher-order nonlocal terms, in which a key ingredient will be the adaptation of recent developments in the study of nonlinear elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations with similar nonlocal features.  In each of these settings, the PI and collaborators will incorporate techniques from harmonic analysis, probability, and spectral theory to analyze the dynamical features involved in the evolution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The research supported by this award includes work in a variety of topics in nonlinear partial differential equations.  Many of the equations under study arise as mathematical models of physical systems such as the propagation of waves, nonlinear optics, and many-body quantum mechanics.    One major focus of the supported work is the long-time behavior of solutions to the nonlinear Schrodinger and nonlinear wave equations with highly nonlinear effects (focusing on the ``energy- supercritical'' regime, where the natural properties of the system do not provide strong enough control to ensure that solutions are  well-behaved for long periods of time).  The PI and her collaborator studied a case where the nonlinearity is ``slightly supercritical,'' and showed that a relaxed class of symmetry assumptions lead to strong control over the long-time behavior of solutions.  The PI's result on linearized water waves has potential applications to the understanding of the nonlinear problem, and is likely to aid in developing understanding of the nonlinear dynamics of the water wave equations and the scenarios in which singular behavior can be ruled out. The ultimate target of this line of work is an improved  set of assumptions on long-time existence results, with the aim of establishing theorems which are closer to being relevant to phenomena that can be physically observed.  The PI also obtained results on study of the Hartree hierarchy, a system of equations which has close connections to the dynamics of many-body quantum systems, and which is in particular closely related to the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation.  The PI showed that in certain circumstances solutions to the hierarchy cannot exist globally in time, a result which made use of intuitions and developments from the study of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation.  This contributes to an active area of research studying the interplay and exchange of techniques between the theory of nonlinear dispersive PDE and hierarchies of equations arising from quantum mechanics.  The award also supported the integration of research and education.  The PI attended and was an invited speaker at a number of conferences, including a ``Workshop for Women in Analysis and PDE?? at the IMA at the University of Minnesota, and ``Connections for Women: Dispersive and Stochastic PDE?? at MSRI in Berkeley, CA. Each of these talks were addressed at a general audience, including beginning and advanced graduate students, and had a significant expository component.  The PI also engaged actively in the dissemination of the research results, giving talks at a number of university departmental seminars and international conferences.  In addition to aiding in the dissemination of the research to colleagues, these  talks were attended by graduate students at the respective institutions, and contributed to the integration of research and teaching by providing exposure of recent results in the field to young researchers working in related subjects.
