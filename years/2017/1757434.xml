<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to serve the "Convergence Insufficiency" clinical population, which includes millions of people in the US alone, as well as 50% of the brain injury population who has post concussive syndrome (PCS).  Designing engaging vision therapy protocols that leverage virtual reality gaming technology will have a dramatic impact in particular on this young population's academic and professional career growth and goals.  Broad market impacts also include the opportunity for translational research funded by prior NSF grants to reach the general public. This solution has the potential to be an affordable alternative to traditional vision therapy administered in the comfort of one's home saving both healthcare cost and patient's time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project seeks to explore the commercial potential of a novel combination of virtual reality and vision therapy technologies. Convergence Insufficiency is a binocular vision dysfunction which causes the following vision symptoms: blurry and double vision, eye stress and strain, headaches, and a 'halo' effect where words appear to float above the page while reading. These visual symptoms negatively impact a person's ability to perform near work such as reading and computer/tablet use. The Virtual Reality Vision Therapy developed here encompasses integration of eye tracking with traditional vision therapy methodologies, promotion of patient compliance through a suite of engaging virtual reality video game experiences, objective assessments of patient progress throughout the course of vision therapy, and a flexible platform to create a patient specific therapeutic intervention.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   John Vito d?Antonio-Bertagnolli (EL), Tara L. Alvarez (PI/TL), and Carl Georgeson (IM) conducted 100 customer interviews over the course of this I-Corps grant. Relevant outcomes include the following: Company Formation - OculoMotor Technologies is a registered Delaware C-Corp, and was incorporated on March 6, 2018. Two members of this I-Corps team are equity owners. Patent Applications - OculoMotor Technologies utilized knowledge gained during the I-Corps program to determine countries in which to file for IP protection for a prior PCT application. The USA, the EU, Canada, and Korea were selected, due to having active chapters of COVD, the largest board-certifying organization for vision therapy practicing optometrists. STTR Proposal Submission - An STTR proposal was submitted to the NIH on April 5, 2018. An additional STTR proposal was submitted to the NSF on June 14, 2018. Key Findings -  (1) Optometrists who do not offer vision therapy tend to have a negative impression of the vision therapy industry. These optometrists cite a lack of peer-reviewed literature supporting various vision therapy protocols as the reason for their distrust. (2) Vision therapy practices among practicing optometrists tend to vary geographically; specifically, optometric practices located close to large optometry schools and coastal medical hubs tend to rely more on literature-backed therapy methods, while more suburban and rural practices tend to be more open to anecdotally verified therapy methods. (3) Home therapy protocols vary widely from office to office. Most offices make a clear effort to "gamify" therapy in the office setting; however, no office made the same effort for the home setting. All optometrists interviewed noted a lack of compliance with home therapy protocols. (4) The foremost place where vision therapy practicing optometrists learn about new vision therapy tools and techniques is at regional and national optometry conferences; typically, in exhibit halls.
