<AbstractNarration>As post-hurricane recovery efforts in post-Harvey Houston turn toward future planning, state and local authorities are evaluating multiple proposals to increase the area's resilience to future storm and flooding events. A particular focus is what to do about neighborhoods that have flooded multiple times in the past three years. Some experts recommend expanding buyout programs. But short of widespread use of eminent domain eviction, any such program will require consent and participation from residents. The proposed research seeks to investigate how residents of flood-prone areas decide whether to remain and rebuild, relocate to other areas of the city, or relocate outside the city altogether. What factors do they consider important? What experiences make a difference in their decision making? What information and whose recommendations do they trust and use as they reach decisions about whether to remain or leave? The researchers suggest that accumulated alluvial awareness, which they define as attention to past and possible future flooding experiences, is increasing and that this awareness affects how attached residents feel to certain neighborhoods, communities, and the city itself. The significance of the proposed research also extends beyond Houston as coastal communities across the United States are beginning to see new rainfall and flooding patterns, whether associated with extreme rainfall events, the increase of "normal" rainfall, or with sea-level rise and subsidence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will take place in two Houston neighborhoods that were severely impacted by Harvey flooding, Greenspoint and Meyerland. Even before Harvey both neighborhoods already counted among the three Houston neighborhoods with the greatest number of repetitive assistance payouts from the National Flood Insurance Program. Although the two neighborhoods share a vulnerability to major flooding, they are in many ways demographically distinct in income, education levels, ethnicity and race, housing stock (rental housing complexes vs. single family owner-occupied property). This contrast increases the probability that the proposed research will be representative of the economic and ethnic diversity of Houston as a whole while also making it possible to test the concept of alluvial awareness while controlling for other variables. The research team will consist of the anthropologist PI, Dr. Dominic Boyer, one postdoctoral fellow, and four undergraduate students, divided into two neighborhood-based teams. The researchers will employ a mix of social science methods.  Working together with district council offices, neighborhood associations, environmental justice NGOs and faith-based communities, the research team will work to encourage community participation in a survey. They will select a sub-sample of individuals and families willing to participate in longer and more in depth semi-structured interviews. The project research team will seek volunteer families to be shadowed by researchers involving participant-observation in order to gain more intimate familiarity with individual and family decision-making processes. The project will contribute new insights to two highly theoretically generative areas of contemporary anthropological research: (1) the anticipation and temporalization of disasters; and (2) infrastructural arrangements and their influence on social identification and political subjectivity. It will also focus attention on chronic flooding as both a temporal and infrastructural phenomenon. The concept of  "alluvial awareness" will be tested with the data gathered in the course of research. Findings will give anthropology and the social sciences a better grasp on the emotional and epistemic impacts of flooding in newly chronic flood zones. The proposed research will provide actionable data to local government and urban planners in terms of understanding the criteria according to which residents in coastal areas everywhere elect to remain or leave areas affected by chronic severe flooding.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report    NSF RAPID Grant #1760400  Overview  With 23 distinct watersheds, Houston?s nickname of Bayou City is well deserved. Houston has flooded repeatedly since its founding, and a major flood still occurs somewhere within Harris County about once every two years. While flooding is a part of Houston?s history, Hurricane Harvey, which was the third "500-year" rainfall event to hit Houston in three years, marks a potential turning point in how the region responds to flooding. What policy vision should guide the next 5, 10, and 50 years of living with bayous? What should be prioritized when planning for future floods? What rights and responsibilities fall to homeowners, renters, landlords, different levels of government, and civil society organizations? The data from NSF RAPID Grant #1760400 helps answer these questions by spotlighting the experiences of Brays Bayou and Greens Bayou residents during Hurricane Harvey and in the lengthy period of recovery that followed.  The project team (PI Dominic Boyer, Postdoctoral Fellow Mark Vardy, Research Assistants Jolen Martinez and Alice Liu) conducted 91 individual interviews and gathered 180 sets of survey responses from residents in the Brays Bayou and Greens Bayou watersheds that focused on decision-making processes about staying in residences that flooded or relocating elsewhere. We hypothesized that people?s experience with flooding might influence their sense of belonging to neighborhoods, communities, and Houston itself. We confirmed this flood-related sense of belonging, "alluvial awareness," has increased what anthropologist Nikhil Anand has termed "hydraulic citizenship" (political action focused on water management) in Houston.   In our data, we encountered a wide diversity of voices and range of experiences. Some Houstonians who flooded are fiercely committed to remaining in their neighborhoods, while others desperately want to relocate elsewhere. Some people felt traumatized by Harvey and remain uncertain what to do, while other residents have become vigorous "hydraulic citizens" in the neighborhoods. Despite the range of responses to the experience of being flooded, we found that in nearly every case, people were spending considerable time and energy in dealing with Hurricane Harvey even long after the floodwaters had receded.  Houston needs to repair the damage from Harvey while preparing for future storms and floods that might be still worse. Harvey can be seen an opportunity to create a more resilient city. But for that to happen, Houston needs action on multiple fronts.  Major Project Findings  1.People who moved away from their residences after being flooded in Hurricane Harvey are more likely to consider the stress of living in an area that might flood again, and the potential financial costs of future floods, as more important factors in their decision-making than those who remained in the residence that flooded.  2. Emotional attachment to the neighborhood where a flooded residence is located is correlated with people staying. This emotional attachment is eroded by the experience of being flooded multiple times. While policies and programs that address flooding at the level of individual households are clearly important, solutions to flooding should also be designed at a community or neighborhood level.  3. Flooding can also increasethe sense of connection some residents have to people in their neighborhoods. This indicates that experiencing a disaster such as Hurricane Harvey does not necessarily result in suffering. Rather, we found that the amount of suffering that residents experience was always influenced by the presence or absence of a social support network.   4. Floodwater infrastructure is political, and residents are not passive in the face of flooding. Residents who flooded can sometimes become more involved in civic affairs to engage with flooding issues. In doing so, they hold public officials accountable for unchecked upstream development and insufficient downstream infrastructure for evacuating floodwater.   5. Homeowners often contend that infrastructural interventions will not reduce the risk of flooding to a tolerable level. Those with the means to do so are taking steps to find their own individual solutions like home elevation. Elevation, however, means different things for different people. Some residents perceive elevation as an ad hoc solution that exacerbates the unsettled situation of their neighborhood.  6. People are made more vulnerable to flooding by structural conditions related to poverty, race, ethnicity, and citizenship status. Financial precarity propels people into flood risk as the rapid turnover of rental accommodation means that renters frequently move in unaware of flooding history. The loss of vehicles to flooding often has more dire consequences for residents living in poverty, who also have fewer resources to deal with moldy housing.   7. People pay most attention to individuals who are already in their social networks when they are deciding to relocate or remain. This is an intuitive finding that reinforces the need for flooding solutions to incorporate the ways in which people actually inform themselves and make decisions about flooding in context of their social networks.
