<AbstractNarration>The Association for Computing Machinery proposes to provide scholarships to enable greater participation in the 2017 Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference. That annual conference celebrates diversity in computing, bringing together students, faculty, and professionals in computer science and computer engineering who represent diversity across backgrounds, gender, ethnicity, and disability status.  The conference enables attendees to connect with each other, receive mentoring from more senior community members, and be inspired by leaders in computer science and computer engineering, and their research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tapia conference has grown from 161 participants in 2001 to almost 1,000 participants in 2016, with a diversity reflecting that of our country.  In 2016, 93% of the student attendees found that the conference was inspiring, and 97% said that it provided them with an opportunity to make new connections. The scholarships funded under this proposal will be available to undergraduate and graduate students, faculty from Minority Serving Institutions, and doctoral students participating in the conference?s Doctoral Consortium.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference is the main conference for celebrating the diversity that exists in computing.  The conference mission is to bring together undergraduate and graduate students, professionals, and faculty in computer science and computer engineering from all backgrounds and ethnicities to:  Celebrate the diversity that      currently exists in computer science and computer engineering. Connect with others with common      backgrounds, ethnicities, disabilities, and gender so as to create      communities that extend beyond the conference. Receive advice from and make      useful contacts with computer science and computer engineering leaders in      academia and industry. Be inspired by great presentations      and conversations with successful people in computer science and computer      engineering who have similar backgrounds, ethnicities, disabilities, and      gender to the attendees.   The Tapia Conference has grown from 164 attendees in 2001 (the first conference) to 1186 attendees in 2017.  The 2017 Tapia Conference was held in Atlanta, Georgia with the following attendee demographics:  48% women 34% Black/African American  18% Hispanic/Latinx  20% White/Caucasian 14% Asian/Southeast Asian 0.5% Native American/Native Alaskan/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander 4% Multiracial 11% Persons with Disabilities or U.S. Military     In addition, 57% of the conference attendees were students, of which 66% were undergraduate students.    Based upon the Tapia 2017 conference survey,  88% of the students agreed or strongly agreed that attending Tapia 2017 increased their dedication to completing their degree in computing  98% of the students agreed or strongly agreed that attending Tapia 2017 provided an opportunity to make new connections     95% of the attendees met at least five new people at Tapia 2017, an indication of the significant opportunities for networking    95% of the students agreed or strongly agreed that Tapia 2017 was inspiring with respect to learning about various opportunities in computing   For Tapia 2017, the invited speakers included  Dr. Randal Pinkett (BCT),  Dr. Edward Castillo (Beaumont Health Research Institute),  Dr. Adrienne Felt (Google),  Dr. James Mickens (Harvard University),  Dr. Oyekunle Olukotun (Stanford University),  Dr. Avani Wildani (Emory University)   The funding from NSF was used to support approximately 87 students and 13 Doctoral Consortium participants for Tapia 2017.  The support includes travel to the conference, conference registration, and 3 nights in a hotel; doctoral consortium students receive 4 nights in the hotel.  Funding is also used to conver the A/V and meals for the Doctoral Consortium.    Doctoral Consortium that takes place the day after the last day of the conference and allows senior doctoral students to present their research to experts in their area and receive very valuable and detailed feedback.  The support from NSF serves a significant need to support students to attend the Tapia Conference, for which the students are inspired to complete their degrees in computing, as indicated by the survey results.
