<AbstractNarration>The proposal requests funding to help defray the expenses of US participants in the "Third Symposium on Spectral and Scattering Theory" that will be held July 17-28, 2017, on the campus of the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC) in Florianopolis, Brazil. The bulk of the support is directed at graduate students and postdocs. For additional information see the conference website: http://www.math.purdue.edu/~sabarre/SymposiumFlorianopolis.html. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this symposium, the third in a series that began in 2003, is to bring together experts working on diverse aspects of scattering and spectral theory, as well as related inverse problems, in order to stimulate interactions and collaborations among the participants. A highlight of the 2017 event will be four minicourses for graduate students and postdocs taught by well-known experts in the field. The topics of the minicourses and their presenters are the following: the stability of matter (Rafael Benguria); x-ray tomography and boundary rigidity (Colin Guillarmou); quantum ergodicity of eigenfunctions (Hamid Hezari); inverse scattering theory (Andreas Kirsch).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Third Symposium on Spectral and Scattering Theory was held in Florianopolis, Brazil , from July 17  to July 28, 2017.  The symposium brought  together graduate students, recent PhDs and senior researchers in  scattering theory, spectral theory, dynamics  and inverse problems to make further progress in establishing connections between these areas.  There were four mini-courses of five hours each during during the first week of the symposium; during the second week there were  lectures by invited speakers.  The topics of lectures and mini-courses  included areas of high interest in these fields such as trace formulas, spectral asymptotics and resonances;  quantum ergodicity,  the study of nodal lines of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian and Schrodinger operators;  chaotic quantum scattering, understanding connections between classical and quantum chaos in  geometric scattering; resolvent estimates and the long time behavior of solutions of the wave equation on various space times including de Sitter, Kerr, Kerr-de Sitter and Schwarzschild geometries;  Inverse problems;  generalized Radon and  X-ray transforms.  The conference was funded by Brazilian institutions (CAPES and SBMAC) and the NSF.  The NSF grant funded the participation of 10 graduate students and 3 recent Ph.Ds (less than three years since PhD) from US institutions.  During the first week of the symposium the participants attended  the following four mini-courses of five lectures each given by  distinguished mathematicians:  1) Rafael Benguria, Universidad Catolica de Chile-- The Stability of Matter  2) Semyon Dyatlov, MIT --  Fractal Uncertainty Principle and Applications to Open Quantum Chaos  3) Colin Guillarmou, Universite De Paris Sud -- X-ray tomography and boundary rigidity  4) Andreas Kirsch- Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)- An introduction to the mathematical theory of inverse problems.  The mini-courses exposed the participants to very active research topics and the lectures were given in enough details that would make it possible for someone to start working on those problems. All the mini-course teachers provided lecture notes.  During the second week of the symposium  participants attended lectures by invited speakers.  Two advanced graduate students and  the three recent PhDs were given the opportunity to deliver  fifty minute lectures.  The  involvement of  graduate students and post-docs in any scientific meeting is extremely important; this is one way scientific knowledge gets transmitted from one generation to the next. Several graduate students and young Ph.Ds from Brazil and the United States had a chance to interact with the invited speakers and each other.  This exposed these junior mathematicians to a very exciting and dynamical mathematical environment which hopefully has served to encourage them to continue working on mathematical research and increase the potential for future collaborations.
