<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description&lt;br/&gt;Ever since the history-making discovery of nuclear fission, which demonstrated the huge amount of energy that can be released when the strong bonds between the atomic constituents (neutrons and protons) are broken, theoretical nuclear physicists have searched for a comprehensive explanation of the properties of the atomic nucleus based on knowledge of the strong force between these constituents. This project takes advantage of the instrumentation, computing capabilities, and theoretical expertise at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to develop a theoretical framework that will improve our understanding of these forces. When this goal is achieved, it will be possible to predict reactions that take place under extreme conditions, from stellar explosions to the interior of nuclear reactors. Improving our knowledge of nuclear reactions will help us further understand 'nuclei-fueled' astrophysical processes, and safely and economically harness nuclear phenomena in support of the broad scope of humanitarian needs. Future advances in nuclear science and technology hold promise for a growing number of applications for medicine, industry, energy, and national security. The development of advanced instrumentation and applications of nuclear isotopes in disease treatments provide two prominent examples that rely on elementary properties of atomic nuclei. In addition to providing access to the facilities and expertise at LLNL, this project will provide training and unique research experiences for the PI and a postdoctoral fellow, with indirect benefits to graduate and undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to dramatically expand the reach as well as the impact of nuclear reaction theory with the aim of predicting properties of experimentally inaccessible nuclei and reactions, while supporting and informing experiments at current and upcoming radioactive beam facilities.  The goal is to develop and implement a symmetry-guided theory that will enable pioneering ab initio investigations of reactions for heavier nuclear species, while accounting for the challenging structure of the participating nuclei. This will be achieved by capitalizing on approximate symmetries known to dominate in nuclei. In this approach all participating particles in the target and incoming proton or neutron are treated on the same footing within a 'shell model' concept of the quantum many-particle system and the compound nucleus. In addition, state-of-the-art chiral effective field theory interactions between protons and neutrons will be employed. New predictions, possible through the unique combination of expertise of theoretical and experimental nuclear physicists at Louisiana State University and LLNL are anticipated for processes inaccessible to experiments, which can facilitate neutrino- and fusion-related research and are key to advancing knowledge about astrophysical processes, as well as of fundamental symmetries in nature. This, in turn, can help address two of the most fundamental questions of physics today: the origin of elements, and if the neutrino is its own antiparticle. While the proposed applications focus on specific important questions, the new developments will have wider impact, as multi-physics simulations in the areas of nuclear energy and national security have similar needs. As part of this research, future leaders will be trained in research in low-energy nuclear science, while learning and working in massively parallel environments at petascale computing facilities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Support of this proposal has enabled transformative research in low-energy nuclear science, only possible by the unique combination of the expertise in the collaboration between Louisiana State University (LSU) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).&nbsp; In particular, it has provided pioneering first-principle (ab initio) framework for nuclear reactions, first for nuclei up though the calcium region, but the ultimate goal will be to reach heavier nuclei. New predictions are now feasible for properties of nuclei and reactions by studying diverse nuclear systems, from well-known stable to rare isotopes. The critical need for this has been recently recognized, as reaction theory from first principles is important to support and inform current and upcoming experiments at rare isotope beam facilities, and is key to advancing our knowledge about astrophysical processes, neutrino physics, and fundamental symmetries in nature. While current applications focus on specific important questions, these new developments have wider impact, as multi-physics simulations in the areas of nuclear energy and national security have similar needs.

To study advanced techniques for modeling nuclear reactions, developed at LLNL and combine them with the large-scale nuclear structure method recently developed at LSU that can reach heavier nuclear species by capitalizing on a symmetry-adapted (SA) concept that exploits symmetries known to dominate in nuclei. To provide the nuclear physics community with a new tool for calculating first-principle reaction rates that account for the microscopic structure of the participating nuclei, including large-scale reaction modeling involving light nuclei and, only now, intermediate- and medium-mass nuclei. To implement electroweak transitions in LSU&rsquo;s symmetry-adapted nuclear structure framework for neutrinoless double-beta decay studies from first principles, that aim to resolve the neutrino type. To establish collaboration with the theoretical and experimental nuclear physics group at LLNL, with the goal to address problems of interest to national labs.</p> </div> <div> <p>In particular, under this award, a novel ab initio reaction theory (SA-RGM) has been developed with results for proton scattering off targets of 4He, 16O, and 20Ne for low energies. Modeling heavy targets, such as 20Ne, represents a remarkable results for ab initio theories, because computational resources in conventional models grow exponentially. We note that these solutions are feasible due to the ability of the SA framework to trim the size of the model space to only the physically relevant basis states, e.g., down to 112 millions of basis states for the lowest 3 states in 20Ne, as compared to the inaccessible full size of 40 trillion basis states.

We provided the first ab initio calculations of alpha widths from ab initio wave functions beyond the lightest nuclei, including explorations of the effect of the calculated reaction rate on the final xrb nucleosynthesis abundance pattern. The focus is on alpha capture reactions for oxygen isotopes; indeed, the alpha capture reaction on 15O has been shown to have the largest impact on reproducing light curves available from astronomical observations.</p> <p>We have studied physics beyond the standard model based on beta decays in light and intermediate-mass nuclei with enhanced deformation or clustering.&nbsp; We have provided calculations for 48Ti using chiral potentials, of interest to neutrinoless double beta decay studies.
