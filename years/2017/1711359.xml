<AbstractNarration>This is an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology, under the program Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellow, Carla Stout, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow is being mentored by Ángel Valdés at California State Polytechnic University. This research examines the phylogenomics of nudibranchs (sea slugs) using newly developed DNA sequencing technologies that have proven useful for other problematic groups (e.g. fish, birds, spiders, etc.) when elucidating deep levels of relatedness. Nudibranchs are diverse (~3000 species) in terms of body forms, reproductive and developmental modes, feeding specializations, and defensive mechanisms. Elucidating how these biological facets have evolved has been difficult with the current lack of understanding of the relationships among the species, which is crucial for identifying their evolutionary patterns. This study will provide the first extensive collection of high-throughput sequence data for nudibranchs, which will be made available to the public via online data repositories. By developing a standardized sequencing kit for nudibranchs, the fellow's research facilitates future studies of additional species by other researchers. The fellow is mentoring students from underrepresented groups in science through participation in the host institution's programs designed for minority inclusion in research. These efforts will help prepare students for careers in diverse scientific fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project include reconstruction of the relationships among species of nudibranchs, investigation of factors promoting cladogenesis, and establishment of the timing of major diversification events. Methods include generation of transcriptome datasets for identification of loci well suited for targeted enrichment, development of probes, library preparation and Illumina sequencing, and phylogenomic analyses. The relationships established will then inform subsequent analyses to determine the influence various factors, such as aposematic coloration, sexual selection, and dietary specialization have had on radiation events, character evolution, and biogeographical patterns, using software designed to address these questions. The fellow is gaining expertise in phylogenomics of non-model organisms and providing mentorship in molecular lab techniques and bioinformatics to students from groups underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>
