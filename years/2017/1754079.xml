<AbstractNarration>This project will build a database summarizing the results of over 1,000 facial identification studies published in the last five decades. Using this database, the project will address four research questions: 1. The effect of 80 factors on facial identification performance will be summarized. 2. The generalizability (application) of findings from eyewitness laboratory research to actual eyewitness performance will be examined by testing whether variations in research methods affect patterns of research results.  3. The implications of new witness performance measures (based on signal detection theory) will be assessed to see if they provide an adequate account of research findings as compared to prior performance measures.  4. The pattern of relationships among more than 60 indices of eyewitness performance proposed by various researchers will be investigated. It is anticipated that these measures are highly redundant and eyewitness performance can be fully reflected in a handful of readily understood measures.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will build a comprehensive database of facial identification research that includes over 1,000 studies published in the last five decades; it will expand the database constructed by Penrod and his colleagues in 1986 and 2002. Using this database, four research questions, which are crucial for better understanding eyewitness performance, will be addressed. These questions are as follows:  First, the effect of certain independent variables in facial identification research that influence identification performance will be investigated. The accumulated database includes approximately 80 independent variables that facilitate a review of the relative contribution of each variable to identification performance. This will not only help summarize findings from previous literature on facial identification, but also suggest a direction for future research by revealing valuable variables deserving particular attention.  Second, the generalizability of findings from eyewitness laboratory research to actual eyewitness performance in the real world will be tested. Some researchers warn of the risk to the generalizability of eyewitness research results because of methodological homogeneity across studies and low external validity in research methodology. To test the generalizability of finings, this project will investigate whether research methodology (e.g., participant type, stimulus type, experimental procedures, etc.) moderates the effects of independent variables on eyewitness performance and if so, whether laboratory research under-estimates or over-estimates real-world performance.  Third, the implications of a new signal detection model for eyewitness performance during lineups and test its validity through analysis of the cumulative database will be tested. Past eyewitness research based on signal detection theory has generally focused on identification of a guilty suspect (i.e., hit rate) and an innocent suspect (i.e., false alarm rate) while ignoring filler identifications (which carry costs such as "burning" witnesses, missing perpetrators, and failing to clear innocent suspects). In contrast to past research, the proposed signal detection model will clarify the theoretical and practical importance of filler identifications in eyewitness performance.  Finally, the psychometric structure of indices measuring eyewitness performance with the cumulative database will be investigated. Although researchers have frequently used very few selected indices (e.g., DR, PPV and others) to measure eyewitness performance, there are more than 60 indices measuring or relevant to eyewitness performance. It is anticipated that eyewitness performance is reflected in a handful of components and that each index measures one or multiple components to a different degree.  The project aims to reveal how the various indices relate to one another, that is, reveal in accessible terms--what components of eyewitness performance these indices measure, and arrive at suggestions about which (preferably accessible) metrics best characterize which aspects of performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Present Project Had Two Major Goals  1. Build an up-to-date database of facial identification/eyewitness studies published over the last 50 years. The database contains 2,127 experimental conditions from 1,011 studies in 669 journal articles. Over 180,975 individuals participated in those studies.  2. Investigate several research questions with the database.      Q1: We examined the effects of 36 factors that could influence facial identification performance.  Overall, presentation/lineup bias, witnesses’ age and ability, the disguise of targets, exposure time at study, and training yielded the largest effects       Q2: How generalizable are findings of facial identification/eyewitness research?  Differences in performance between basic and applied research settings can be systematically accounted for by methodological variables that influence the performance (including factors such as the number of faces studied and the amount of time available to view faces).       Q3: How can signal detection theory (SDT--generally applied to yes/no decisions) be applied to eyewitness decisions in lineups and take into account guilty and innocent suspect identifications, filler (innocent individuals in lineups) identifications and rejections?  We developed a new SDT framework for eyewitness performance in lineups&mdash;the Multi-d&prime; Model which provides multiple discriminability measures which can be used to investigate eyewitness performance.  We applied the Multi-d&prime; model to issues in eyewitness research, such as the comparison of eyewitness performance in show-ups versus lineups; the influence of lineup bias on performance; the impact on performance of filler selection methods (match fillers to witness descriptions vs. match fillers to the appearance of suspects); eyewitness confidence; and lineup presentation modes (simultaneous vs. sequential lineups).       [Q4]  Measurement Issues. Eyewitness researchers use "mock-witness" measures [asking non-witnesses to select the members of lineups who most-resemble descriptions of perpetrators] to assess lineup fairness.  We tested the validity of these measures and found that lineup fairness estimated by mock-witness measures reliably predicts eyewitnesses’ choosing behaviors and the discriminability of innocent suspects from fillers.      Key Outcomes  A doctoral student completed her dissertation based on the significant results from Q1 and Q2 and is now a university assistant professor. Two Masters students acquired research and data analytic skills working on the project.  Two scientific articles have been published with a third under review.  Further papers will emerge from the project.  Results have been presented to professional/research audiences in several conference presentations.  Compared with prior meta-analyses focusing on one or few variables at a time, the current meta-analyses investigated the effects of 36 IVs simultaneously. This permits us to present a comprehensive view of findings from facial identification studies.   Previous meta-analyses were frequently conducted with a single index (e.g., overall accuracy rates, or d') as an outcome measure.  However, the current meta-analyses looks at multiple outcome measures.  Our meta-analyses are the first to  test the generalizability of online experiments and demonstrate there are no significant differences in results between online and in-person experiments.     The Impact of Findings from the Multi-d' Model (Q3)  The Multi-d' model demonstrates that guilty-innocent discrimination is a function of discriminability measures involving fillers. The Multi-d' model calls attention to the role of fillers in eyewitness performance and we anticipate that reports of our measures will become common in research reports. The published paper presenting the results of these analyses is already gaining citations and use in the eyewitness research literature.  The Multi-d' model explains that guilty-innocent discrimination increases as lineups become fairer, but there is a tipping point beyond which increases in fairness reduces performance&mdash;lineups can be too fair.      Impact on other disciplines  The current meta-analyses have practical implications for policies relevant to eyewitness identification (e.g., identifying effective lineup practices for the police and providing courts with guidance about factors, such as lineup bias, which threaten eyewitness identification reliability).   The Multi-d&prime; model may be applied to other types of "compound" decision tasks beyond those of eyewitness identifications in lineups. There are tasks that require both detection and identification decisions simultaneously in fields of engineering, medicine, education, and so on. The Multi-d&prime; model may prove a useful tool for understanding decisionmakers’ performance for a variety of compound decision tasks.      Impact on society beyond science and technology  Meta-analytic findings serve as an guide to researchers insofar as they identify research topics where the volume and consistency of research findings have produced relatively "settled" findings and identify topics where additional research is needed.  Eyewitness research has had a growing impact on policing practices and the courts (reflected in the ready acceptance of expert testimony concerning eyewitness (un)reliability in the vast majority of US jurisdictions and the increasing use of jury instructions designed to sensitize jurors to the factors which threaten the reliability of identifications made by eyewitnesses).  We anticipate our findings will be relied on heavily by experts and courts for the foreseeable future.  The Multi-d' model work has inspired a pending NSF proposal assessing lineup fairness (operationalizing the notion of "impermissibly suggestive arrays").
