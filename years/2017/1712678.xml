<AbstractNarration>This is a workshop sponsored by the National Science Foundation in conjunction with the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The workshop, "Smart Cities and Connected Communities: A workshop bridging rural, peri-urban, and urban sustainability" brings together leaders in science, technology, and community and economic development to identify research challenges addressing challenges in sustainability in food production and distribution in the context of smart and connected communities. Some of these challenges include increased food and nutritional security through high output and resilient local agriculture technologies and systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop agenda includes a mixture of plenary and targeted short talks,  and breakout sessions.  Key questions to be addressed include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a) What are the commonalties/differences that rural, peri-urban, and urban communities face in building&lt;br/&gt;smart, connected, and sustainable communities?&lt;br/&gt;b) What examples of connected communities focused on food systems security and nutritional security&lt;br/&gt;exist, and what have we learned from them?&lt;br/&gt;c) What strategies will meaningfully increase the resilience and reliability of connected agricultural&lt;br/&gt;communities?&lt;br/&gt;d) What measures can be consulted to assess progress toward smart, connected and sustainable&lt;br/&gt;communities?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discussion on these specific questions will help inform new research strategies as we look towards building future smart and connected communities bridging rural and urban settings.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The "sharing economy" has explored and built new business models, new marketing opportunities, and new options for consumers. Much of that sharing has been facilitated by location-aware, take-anywhere technology. By overlaying that expanded level of human connectivity with networks of connected devices and infrastructure, the "smart cities" concept offers new possibilities for enhancing the livability and sustainability of communities in urban, peri-urban, and rural locations.  The University of the District of Columbia hosted a workshop that brought together leaders in community and economic development, government, science, and technology to address broad-based sustainability challenges for livable communities across rural, peri-urban, and urban locations. The agenda of the one-and-one-half-day workshop included a mixture of plenary sessions, short targeted talks and case studies and a breakout session. Some of the main questions discussed were: 1) What are the commonalties/differences that rural, peri-urban, and urban communities face in building smart, connected, and sustainable communities? 2) What examples of connected communities exist that focus on food systems security and nutritional security, and what have we learned from them? 3) What strategies will meaningfully increase the resilience and reliability of connected agricultural communities? 4) What measures can be consulted to assess progress toward smart, connected and sustainable communities?  Some common themes among the talks included: the challenges that different rural, peri-urban, and urban areas face in order to achieve sustainability and how these challenges may or may not overlap with other areas; population growth and health disparities; the need for creative solutions and dynamic partnerships that include multiple stakeholders; new ways for organizing, distributing, and measuring services; the central role of technology; and the need for food systems to be at the center of sustainable solutions.  Food systems have become national (if not international) and the average American has become disconnected from food production and the distribution chain. Urban food production has grown in popularity, but is not as organized, economically refined, and technologically advanced as the rural system. There is an opportunity for items that are highly perishable and nutrient-dense to be grown in new and innovative ways in urban areas. This requires software and information-sharing to connect stakeholders, and economy of scale for smaller growers and distributors, an organizing body, baseline data and evaluation tools, technology to automate systems and which can be adapted to the plethora of growing environments, agricultural education, and workforce development.  The primary suggestion that resulted from this workshop is to find funding to support the initial organization of a Mid-Atlantic Regional Food Systems Network.
