<AbstractNarration>An award is made to Delaware State University to enhance research in several areas while also contributing to undergraduate education and training. The instrumentation (Seahorse, Argilent Technologies, Inc.) allows researchers to measure the energy and metabolism of the cell. In addition to providing training of undergraduates in research, this equipment will also be a critical component of the redesigned core curriculum in biology. The PIs of this project will pilot a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) that will provide an opportunity for students to participate in authentic research. Exposing students to such research experiences will give them a more positive view of scientific careers and enhance retention rates in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; This instrumentation will support a diverse, interdisciplinary team of investigators whose research focuses on understanding the genetic, molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie energy budgets in cells (Seahorse). The Seahorse will serve four distinct projects. One project investigates the connection between mitochondrial function and TDP-43, a nuclear ribonucleoprotein that has been implicated in many forms of neurodegeneration. Two other projects investigate the role of dopamine in metabolic dysfunction related to neurodegeneration, one focusing on rotenone toxicity in a drosophila model, while the other project investigates the role of SUMOylation in preventing mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. A fourth project investigates the role of CD44, a cell-surface glycoprotein important in the metabolic reprogramming of cells to glycolysis under hypoxic conditions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The Acquisition of Seahorse to measure mitochondrial metabolism fueled biological research.  This cutting-edge equipment supported by this grant has enhanced the capabilities of multiple labs at Delaware State University, by providing students with the skills necessary to functionally understand metabolism and apply it to current research in four different labs. Students training on this equipment presented at scientific meetings and contributed to current research projects that will lead to scientific publications.  The research projects include looking at mechanisms associated with aggregation in Parkinson’s disease and the development of therapeutics.   An additional project is examining mitochondria dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Also, mechanisms associated with metabolic changes in cancer are being investigated.  There is also one group investigating a functional understanding how metabolism influences how neurons work using drosophila.   This coupled with a techniques course looking at research questions has enhanced the undergraduate research experience and marketability for graduate school, academic labs, or industry.  This training is enhanced with a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE). Engagement in course-based authentic research experiences has been shown to improve student understanding of content and use of scientific thinking, making them competitive for opportunities in their field.  This will continue to support research and collaboration and provide training for the next generation of scientists.
