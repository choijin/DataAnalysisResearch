<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: SI2-CHE&lt;br/&gt;ExTASY Extensible Tools for Advanced Sampling and analYsis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An international team consisting of  Cecilia Clementi(Rice University), Mauro Maggioni (Duke University) Shantenu Jha (Rutgers University), Glenn Martyna (BM T. J. Watson Laboratory ), Charlie Laughton (University of Nottingham), Ben Leimkuhler ( University of Edinburgh), Iain Bethune (University of Edinburgh) and Panos Parpas(Imperial College) are supported through the SI2-CHE program for the development of ExTASY -- Extensible Toolkit for Advanced Sampling and analYsis, -- a conceptual and software framework that provides a step-change in the sampling of the conformational space of macromolecular systems. Specifically, ExTASY is a lightweight toolkit to enable first-class support for ensemble-based simulations and their seamless integration with dynamic analysis capabilities and ultra-large time step integration methods, whilst being extensible to other community software components via well-designed and standard interfaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The primary impacts of this project are in the biological sciences.  This software advances our understanding of biologically important systems, as it can be used to obtain fast and accurate sampling of the conformational dynamics of stable proteins; a prerequisite for the accurate prediction of thermodynamic parameters and biological functions. It also allows tackling systems like intrinsically disordered proteins, which can be beyond the reach of classical structural biology. Along with the research itself, the PIs are involved with outreach programs to attract high school students to science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The simulation of the motion of small molecules is of fundamental importance to understand their behavior, function and mechanisms, which are crucial in applications to pharmacology and material sciences, among others.  The simualtion of the dynamics of molecules is computationally expensive, as very small time steps need to be taken in order to take into account very fast vibration modes, while phenomena of interest typically happen at a much longer time scale, of the order of tens of billions, or more, time steps. Even when such simulations can be successfully run, it is of interest to understand and capture a "summary" of the motions of the molecule. This is not a trivial endeavour: how to understand and visualize the billions of molecular configurations of the molecule that have been simulated? One often seeks a low-dimensional representation, that projects the high-dimensional state space of the molecule, where each point represents the coordinates of all the atoms in the molecule, onto a low dimensional space of "effective" configurations, colored by the density of occupation. Regions of high density represents (projected) regions where the molecule dwells for large times (called metastable states), before moving to other regions of high-density, via regions called transitions "paths". These "paths" (which may or not be well-approximated by one-dimensional paths) are of particular interest as they capture the conformational changes in the molecule in transition between metastable states.  We introduced novel techniques, and extended existing ones recently introduced by the PI and his collaborators, to automatically construct families of low-dimensional representations as discussed above, using Diffusion Coordinates. We developed computational techniques to speed up the calculation of these coordinates, in particular to enable parallelization across multiple CPU's and multiple machines.  The PI also developed novel techniques to perform on-the-fly construction of reduced models and coordinates, that does not requiring running long expensive simulations before seeking a reduction, and instead used many short trajectories collected in parallel (typically by many computers) and assembles them quickly to create automatically a faster simualtor of the system, using ideas from machine learning.

Without such guarantees, it would be hard to justify any trust in the results of reduced simulations learned by the machine learning algorithms.  We believe the rigorous use of machine learning for creating algorithms that create faster and lower-dimensional simulators for existing expensive simulators for complex high-dimensional stochastic system is an emerging important field that will have significant impact on various disciplines, ranging from molecular dynamics to material sciences, to atmospheric sciences, and beyond. The algorithms, together with their theoretical guarantees, developed in this project are a first step in this promising direction.
