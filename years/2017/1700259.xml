<AbstractNarration>The theory of Operator Algebras was developed in the 1930s as the mathematical foundation of quantum mechanics. This theory also provides the natural mathematical framework in which physical systems as they evolve in time (called dynamical systems) can be represented and studied; Groups are the algebraic structures that represent the time in dynamical systems. Today, each of the theories of Operator Algebras, Groups, and Dynamical Systems are independently of each other among most important and well-established parts of modern mathematics and mathematical physics. But the framework of operator algebras still allows deep interactions between these mathematical concepts. The aim of this project is to exploit the existing, and develop new bridges between these different theories. This allows one to utilize the current advanced mathematical technology of each area to help overcome some open problems in the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with various aspects of interaction between analytic group theory (and its quantum version) and operator algebras, particularly via the theory of boundaries. Measure-theoretical boundaries (e.g. the Poisson boundary), and topological boundaries (e.g. the Furstenberg boundary) of groups were introduced and developed in the 1960s and 1970s in the seminal work of Furstenberg. These concepts were used as a tool to prove certain rigidity results for lattices in Lie groups. The former type of boundaries have since been vastly investigated and used as the main tool in some of the most substantial results in the past few decades in both ergodic theory of groups and rigidity theory of von Neumann algebras. However, topological boundaries are much less understood, and surely have not been fully exploited as a similar powerful tool in continuous ergodic theory or C*-algebraic rigidity problems. These boundaries are defined abstractly in general for all discrete (and also non-discrete) groups, and they compromise all natural notions of boundaries such as Gromov's boundaries of hyperbolic groups or Furstenberg boundaries of semisimple Lie groups. The project aims to further develop the understanding of such boundaries. The goal is to apply them to generalize various results in operator algebra theory that have been proven by using special cases of such boundary actions, for example, the existing results concerning maximal injective von Neumann subalgebras and character-rigidity. In another direction, the project aims to develop and study the boundary theory of quantum groups and investigate their possible applications to problems such as C*-simplicity in the quantum setting.</AbstractNarration>

This project is concerned with various aspects of interaction between analytic group theory (and its quantum version) and operator algebras, particularly via the theory of boundaries. Measure-theoretical boundaries (e.g. the Poisson boundary), and topological boundaries (e.g. the Furstenberg boundary) of groups were introduced and developed in the 1960s and 1970s in the seminal work of Furstenberg.

These boundaries are defined abstractly in general for all discrete (and also non-discrete) groups, and they compromise all natural notions of boundaries such as Gromov's boundaries of hyperbolic groups or Furstenberg boundaries of semisimple Lie groups.   The PI's work on this project has resulted in the introduction of several new concepts, with significant applications, and potential of much more substantial impacts on the theory of (quantum) group C*-algebras and their connection to other areas such as dynamical systems, ergodic theory and representation theory of groups.   The theory of stationary C*-dynamical systems was introduced and developed in a work of the PI as part of this project, which has provided new powerful tools in bridging between several areas of mathematics, including C* and von Neumann algebra theories, measurable ergodic theory and representation theory of discrete groups. This is a new theory, already with surprising applications in several rigidity problems in operator algebras and ergodic theory, and a lot more possible applications yet to be discovered. This new concept was used to prove simplicity of certain intermediate C*-algebras in a completely new way in the joint work of the PI with his PhD student. In another work of the PI, a model theoretical framework for actions of quantum groups has been established for the first time, which allowed unifying and generalizing several important previous results on the notion of Rokhlin property. This new approach will allow interaction between C*-algebras and quantum groups, and logic and model theory. The notion of Furstenberg boundary associated to a unitary representation has been introduced and studied in another work of the PI in the framework of this project. The concept is potentially very significant, and could provide very strong tools in the analytical theory of discrete group representations. Using recent developments of applications of boundary actions in C*-algebras, a systematic study of representation rigidity was initiated in the work of the PI in the framework of this project  Given a group G, any subgroup H gives rise to a canonical representation of G, called the quasi-regular representation associated to H. It is a natural question to ask whether one can recover a subgroup from its associated quasi-regular representation (representation rigidity of the subgroup). In the above-mentioned work we prove sufficient conditions for representation rigidity of large classes of subgroups. Furthermore, the understanding of ideal structure and representation theory of quasi-regular representations of discrete group have significantly improved from this work.   In the area of human resources development, three PhD students in the Department of Mathematics of University of Houston, and an international visiting PhD student have been trained as part of this project by working under supervision of the PI on research problems from this project. Three high quality publications have resulted from the work of the students under the PI’s supervision.          Last Modified: 10/26/2020       Submitted by: Mehrdad Kalantar]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
