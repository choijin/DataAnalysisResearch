<AbstractNarration>Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical:    &lt;br/&gt;Crystalline silicon solar cell technology has dominated the photovoltaic technology market for years with a current market share of 90%, owing to its wide technological applications in semiconductor electronics. Light absorption for limited range of the spectrum and thermalization losses hinder further increase in silicon solar cell efficiency. This research endeavor is geared toward increasing efficiency beyond the thermodynamic limits imposed by the physics of single-junction silicon solar cells by incorporation of different bandgap semiconductors in tandem. This research will perform optical and electronic optimization schemes to improve absorption, photocurrent and efficiency in solar cells, light emitting diodes and other electronic devices. The research will address fundamental limitations of integration of perovskites with silicon and other semiconductors and will impact a diverse technical and societal community. The broader impacts of this research lies in 1) incorporating research findings into curriculum enhancement of courses such as Photovoltaic Engineering, Physical Electronics and Optoelectronic Engineering at Tennessee Tech University, 2) recruiting female, underrepresented groups and veterans in research and 3) organizing outreach activities to foster increased awareness of energy technologies at the high-school, middle-school and community levels. This will help increase longer-term enrollment in engineering and computing education, yielding many long-standing benefits to society at large.  &lt;br/&gt;Technical:    &lt;br/&gt;The primary scholarship of the research plan lies in addressing the challenges facing perovskite/Si tandem technologies such as: 1) high sub-bandgap absorption in the perovskite absorber; 2) low photoconversion efficiency of perovskite/Si tandem; 3) relatively higher reflection and parasitic losses; and 4) compromising open-circuit voltage and fill factor. Transfer-matrix based optimization of optical absorption, reflection and internal quantum efficiency vs. wavelength of each layer will provide insights about maximum achievable absorption efficiency and photocurrent in each layer. Modeling of wavelength-dependent absorption by combining conventional pyramidal texture with wavelength-selective intermediate reflector will further increase the tandem efficiency. Doping concentration and thickness based current density vs. voltage simulations for each subcell layer in the tandem and optimizing those parameters to match the current will achieve the best possible photoconversion efficiency for tandem designs. This research will have significant contributions to solid-state lighting, lasing and thin-film electronic device applications.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Silicon solar cells have dominated the photovoltaic industry for the past 25 years; however it is becoming increasingly challenging to increase single-junction silicon cell efficiency any further. Perovskite solar cell technology has drawn attention because of how quickly its efficiency has increased from 3.8% to 22.7%. Perovskites are inexpensive and high quality light absorbers. Multijunction solar cells offer the pathway to increase efficiency beyond the thermodynamic limits imposed by the physics of single-junction solar cells by incorporation of different bandgap semiconductors in tandem while maintaining the current matching attribute. The bandgap of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite is 1.57 eV, which is near ideal for a two junction tandem design having silicon on the bottom with a bandgap of 1.12 eV. &nbsp;Perovskite-silicon multi-junction cells now boast efficiencies exceeding perovskite only cells. The latest reported perovskite-silicon efficiency is 23.6%. The three specific research objectives of this project were: (1) Provide transfer-matrix based optimization of optical absorption, reflection and internal quantum efficiency vs. wavelength of each layer in the tandem stack comprising Perovskite/Si heterojunction, Perovskite/GaAs/Si heterojunction and Perovskite/GaAs/GaInAs solar cells. Light trapping mechanism was incorporated to further increase the tandem efficiency. (2) Provide current density vs. voltage simulations for each subcell layer in the tandem and then optimize those parameters to match the current and (3) Provide understanding of carrier transport mechanisms related to drift and diffusion currents through solar cell structure for further optimization. In this research we used two optical modeling techniques: the transfer matrix method and finite element analysis (FEA) of Helmholtz&rsquo;s equation. The transfer matrix is limited to planer structures and thus cannot account for textured surfaces (unless artificially modified). FEA can do both planar and textured surfaces but takes more computation time. We started with simulating complex refractive indices vs. wavelength for each layers. Complex refractive index is a very important property that determines the propagation of light through and absorption in a particular layer. We implemented evolutionary optimization algorithms and used parameters such as material layer, thickness, composition ratio, doping, carrier lifetime etc. We used transfer matrix method along with evolutionary optimization algorithms to simulate power conversion efficiency and losses vs. wavelength. Different types of losses were considered such as: reflection loss, parasitic loss (light absorbed in antireflective coating layers, window layers and tunnel junctions), thermal loss, recombination loss and spatial relaxation loss. Using the junction characteristics from the single layer simulations, we stacked a perovskite cell on top of a silicon cell. We allowed the optimizer to vary the bandgap of the perovskite as well as the depth of the perovskite and some silicon layers. The resulting efficiency was 26.79%. The iodide to bromine mixture ratio was 22% bromide to 88% iodide. This implied that the bandgap of perovskite was 1.67 eV. We have matched the current for the perovskite/Si heterojunction and found the power conversion efficiency and losses. They are shown in the figures attached. &nbsp;A triple junction solar cell comprising Perovskite/GaAs/Si was optimized and we varied the bandgap of the perovskite as well as the depth of the perovskite, gallium arsenide, and silicon layers. The resulting efficiency was 28.77%. The iodide to bromine mixture ratio was 43% bromide to 57% iodide. This implied that the bandgap of perovskite was 1.80 eV. The current was matched to achieve highest efficiency for the combination. Power conversion efficiency, losses, current to voltage characteristics before and after current matching are shown in the figures attached. Using the junction characteristics from the single layer simulations, we simulated a stacked Perovskite/GaAs/GaInAs triple junction solar cell. We allowed the optimizer to vary the bandgap of the perovskite and GaInAs as well as the depth of all layers. The resulting efficiency was 33.99%. The iodide to bromine mixture ratio was 38% bromide to 62% iodide. This implied that the bandgap of perovskite was 1.76 eV. On the bottom, the gallium to indium ratio was 64% gallium to 36% indium. The resulting bandgap of GaInAs was 0.95 eV. Power conversion efficiency, losses, current to voltage characteristics before and after current matching are shown in the figures attached. We then performed FEA analysis of non-textured and textured surfaces and reduced the reflection loss and improved the efficiency by using textured surfaces. After adding texture to the perovskite/silicon tandem design in the front middle and back of the cell, the power conversion efficiency increased to 27.36%. We noticed that the reflection loss was reduced to 20.89% from the 24.53% obtained in the non-textured configuration. The plots are shown in the attached figure. We also performed carrier transport analysis and found the generation rate using FEA analysis and used drift-diffusion model to calculate current out of the terminals. We organized an outreach activity and taught middle school students how to build solar houses, simple batteries from lemons and fruits and how to generate electricity from piezoelectric devices.</p>
