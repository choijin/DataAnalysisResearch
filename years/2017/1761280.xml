<AbstractNarration>This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project provides funding for 10-week summer research experiences in physical-layer security at the University of Coimbra in Portugal.   Over the three-year project duration, the three yearly unifying topics of student projects will be network protocols for secrecy, intentional jamming techniques for secrecy, and novel error-correcting codes for secrecy in wireless networks. Students will implement projects on a software radio platform where appropriate. The disseminated results will aid system designers in adding a completely new layer of security at the physical-layer of modern networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will increase the understanding of physical-layer security for communications in real-world sensor networks.  Over the three-year grant period, fifteen students (including at least twelve undergraduates) will conduct research in Coimbra, Portugal.  The Portuguese research mentors are experts in physical-layer security and coding theory. Stronger collaborations between the universities will develop, leading to advanced results in physical-layer security. The research results may alter secure system design across many platforms to produce modern data security solutions. Recruitment of student participants will be performed at several diverse institutions throughout Southern Colorado, and will allow the development of effective mechanisms for attracting underrepresented groups to STEM research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project supported 10-week international research experiences at the University of Coimbra in Coimbra, Portugal for 15 total students over the summers of 2016-2018.  The students completed their experiences in cohorts comprised of five students each year.  The composition of student participants was 13 undergraduate students and two graduate students.  Six of the 15 participants belong to at least one traditionally underrepresented group in STEM.  Many students worked in teams with each other and/or foreign students to complete their projects.  All students were assigned, and completed, a project focused on practical approaches to achieving physical-layer security in real-world digital communication systems.   Physical-layer security, in general, seeks to achieve reliable and secure communications by exploiting the properties and characteristics of the transmission medium.  For example, some systems may have signal reception that varies widely in quality from moment to moment, and this characteristic of the system may be used to prevent eavesdroppers from obtaining any useful information about the signal, while still guaranteeing reliable communication for legitimate network users.  Prior to this project, it was theoretically known that many systems could experience security benefits from efforts at the physical layer, including the application of signal processing techniques and secrecy coding (also known as wiretap coding).  This project explored practical aspects needed to move the theory to real-world implementation.    The broader impacts achieved by the project relate to the research results and other factors. Of the 13 undergraduate students, six have applied and/or attended graduate school as of the close of this project.  All students reported an increase in their understanding of the importance of diversity in solving technical problems.  One student not attending graduate school now works abroad in a technical position.  All students seeking technical positions in industry have found excellent positions in successful companies.  The broader impacts of the research include an increased understanding of how to achieve physical-layer security in practice, as well as new knowledge of required design aspects for such systems.  For example, it is now known that optimal working systems must address several design criteria including intelligent antenna placement, smart power allocation, and optimal application of wiretap coding. Other signal processing techniques, such as beamforming, etc. can strengthen our approach to deriving security from the physical layer of a communication system.  Seven student participants wrote and submitted technical papers on these results, and four students attended technical conferences and presented their work to experts in the field.    The results of the project related to intellectual merit include new approaches and guidelines for achieving physical-layer security in practice, as well as new metrics for measuring physical-layer security, with multi-layer and/or adaptive techniques for security in real-world communication systems.  Although it was always known that sensing the environment would be important to achieving physical-layer security in practice, many of the theoretical underpinnings of physical-layer security rely on impractical assumptions placed on the eavesdropper.  For example, most theoretical works require explicit knowledge of the state of the eavesdropper's channel.  In practice, this would require knowledge of the eavesdropper's hardware, software, and physical location; however, these details may not be available to the designers of digital communication systems.  Our new approach to physical-layer security requires one to sense the environment and exploit only knowledge of legitimate users of the network to fine tune reliability while maximizing secrecy in real networks.  We learned how to measure the secrecy benefit of a physical-layer security system layer by layer (i.e., protocol by protocol), and the composite effect of several layers combined was also studied.  Some of our schemes were deployed in communication systems with software defined radios, and the overall proof of concept for these systems was verified.  A total of nine peer-reviewed technical works resulted from the project, all of them including student co-authors.  These works were published in meaningful and highly visible conference venues and technical journals.       Last Modified: 10/28/2020       Submitted by: Willie K Harrison]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
