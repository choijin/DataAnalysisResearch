<AbstractNarration>Giant panda populations have become isolated and fragmented throughout their natural habitat in China, making it difficult to locate potential mates. Giant pandas rely on chemical cues in order to communicate identity, kinship, and reproductive status to other individuals. However, limited information exists on the ability of giant pandas to communicate across a fragmented landscape. Therefore, this study will collect compounds from the air throughout the natural environment and analyze these components to assess individual movement, habitat use, and communication across fragmented habitats. This research will be conducted in the Sichuan province of China under the mentorship of Dr. Zhang Zejun at China West Normal University. Dr. Zhang Zejun not only offers expert knowledge regarding giant panda reproduction and habitat use, but also provides access to field locations, cameras, and analytical equipment required to implement this study. This research will develop a novel tool that will potentially connect isolated populations and contribute to conservation efforts of this iconic species.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elusive giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) utilizes volatile chemical cues to determine identity, gender, and sexual receptivity of conspecifics across fragmented habitats. With isolated populations still at risk for extinction, this study aims to identify unique volatile chemical profiles detectable in air that vary with distribution and habitat in free-ranging giant pandas. Field air analysis and solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) will be used to collect volatile compounds from free-ranging giant pandas occupying the Sichuan province of China. In collaboration with Dr. Zhang Zejun at China West Normal University, volatile compounds will be captured from the environment by securing SPME fibers along known giant panda routes and scent-marking stations. Extracted volatile compounds will be analyzed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry in order to determine differences in the volatile air profile relative to identity, gender, and site location. This research will provide valuable knowledge of giant panda population dynamics and communication across a fragmented landscape. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. Graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>
