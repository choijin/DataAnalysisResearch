<AbstractNarration>This award is made under NSF's EAGER funding mechanism, which supports Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research. The researcher will investigate how people develop new understandings of risk in very high risk/very high reward situations. The context in which this question will be investigated is clinical trials of new cancer immunotherapy drugs, which have the ability to achieve high cure rates for previously incurable and rapidly terminal disease. Because the possibility of a cure comes at the cost of serious side effects, the new immunotherapies introduce a level of uncertainty about treatment outcomes beyond what either  patients or clinicians have heretofore experienced.  This requires new methods of communicating about and navigating uncertainty for those who run and those who participate in clinical trials. This research will investigate the relationship between new clinical understanding of immunotherapies and how explanations of risk and efficacy are crafted, utilized, and contested in the unique cultural space of the clinical trial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Marlaine Figueroa Gray (Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute) will conduct this preliminary study by documenting and analyzing conversations in which patients are consented into trials, focusing on how uncertainty is framed by the provider and the patient.  Figueroa Gray will use ethnographic methods to collect data by documenting the content of consent conversations in which providers explain benefit and risk of trial participation to patients, and will observe the clinical space in which such conversations take place.  The researcher will also conduct interviews with providers who run the trials and patients who participate in them at a cancer research facility in Seattle, Washington.  Findings from this research will connect biomedical and lay understandings of new immunological therapeutics to professional and lay conceptions of risk and management of uncertainty. Findings will contribute to new social science theory of how people form their understandings of extreme risk and appropriate courses of action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview: A true revolution in cancer therapies is occurring. Researchers can now achieve a high response rate, and potentially a cure, for previously incurable cancers using immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has evolved in the last fifty years via phase 1 research from the blunt instrument of traditional chemotherapy, to the targeted action of an adopted immune system (e.g. stem cell transplantation), and now to immunotherapies which harness a patient's own immune system. While exciting, this revolution is also changing the landscape of early phase clinical trials. Traditionally participation in early phase clinical trials has been framed as altruistic: "for the greater good" of science and future patients. Patients in early phase cancer research participated in trials to advance scientific understanding of treatment dose and toxicity with little or no hope for a personal cure. In contrast, participation in immunotherapy early phase clinical trials now holds the promise of durable responses but at the risk of great toxicity, including  ICU admissions with possible adverse cognitive and physical reactions or death. This research provides an anthropological understanding of how patient and provider perceptions of the risks and benefits of these evolving oncology treatments shape patient and provider narratives and decision-making regarding trial participation.   Theoretical approach: This is an ethnographic study conducted by a medical anthropologist.  Ethnography is a process of conducting interviews, listening, observing, participating, being present,and writing fieldnotes. The product of this process is a written description of a group of people living in a particular place and time. Medical anthropologists have a rich history of studying how people make decisions about participating in clinical trials. Anthropologists describe how conceptions of altruism, value, and hope function and are remade in the context of medical decision making. This study brings anthropological attention to the new context of immunotherapy trial participation to investigate whether new paradigms of decisionmaking exist.  Outcomes:  We completed two one-on-one interviews with eight patients, before and after early-phase immunotherapy trial participation. In addition, we observed patients in meetings with their care teams and conducted interviews with seven providers who care for immunotherapy patients in various capacities. Human subjects approval was obtained by the study team prior to the beginning of any human subjects activities.  This qualitative study contributes several insights in the patient and provider experience of immunotherapy trials, the narratives they craft, and how those narratives guide medical decision making. This study revealed that participants in Phase 1 immunotherapy trials craft unique identities as immunotherapy patients,different from their lived experiences as cancer patients or recipients of other prior chemotherapy treatments.  They seek out the stories of other immunotherapy patients using social media and use these stories as data in their decision making, focusing on patient results and the stories of patients returning to daily life. While practices of altruism and hope guide decision making and identity formation of immunotherapy patients (as it has for all research participants), immunotherapy patients hope that their success on early phase trials will serve as inspiration to other patients not to "give up" by showing that a durable response to advanced cancer is possible. Immunotherapy patients see themselves as consumers and generators of science in ways not previously described in the anthropology literature regarding trial patients. Finally, novel constructions of patient regret and provider grief emerged in this study.        Last Modified: 06/17/2019       Submitted by: Marlaine S Figueroa Gray]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
