<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the development of a unique wearable scuba-diving device that will eliminate the risk of Decompression Sickness (DCS), by monitoring in real time the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the body of the user while in the dive. The risk to develop DCS while conducting underwater activities occurs during the ascension phase, when the changing pressure may yield the formation of nitrogen bubbles in tissues and body. The presence of bubbles triggers a variety of serious injuries with long term consequences and even death. Any professional and licensed recreational scuba training makes trainees aware about the risks associated to DCS. Divers are instructed to follow ascent rates and safety stops according with criteria established from statistical considerations of empirical data. Nevertheless, DCS is suffered by rule-abiding divers during 3% of the immersions, requiring costly and distressing evacuation and treatment with hyperbaric chambers. The wearable device will alert the scuba-diver before the sickness develops, reducing the risk to suffer DCS, making underwater activities simpler and safer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project plans to demonstrate an innovative ultrasonic resonant concept adapted from the acoustic chamber notion. Acoustic chambers are structures which are belted by piezoelectric arrangements which are set to deform expanding and compressing when subjected to oscillating electric voltages. The frequency of oscillations can be set to match the modes of vibration of the media entering in resonance. Under such conditions the setup is extremely sensitive to minor changes in the elastic properties of the system, such as those induced by the presence of compressible bubbles. This project will execute a plan to produce a wearable design of the piezoelectric array. Artificial intelligence as well as conventional methods will be employed to analyze the electrical disturbances, and relate them to the bubbles sizes in real time. The computing, data acquisition and power requirements will be determined. Ultimately, these results will determine the feasibility to integrate all the required components in an autonomous wearable DCS risk detection device by a scuba diver.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p style="text-align: left;">The abrupt change in pressure inside a solution oversaturated with gas causes bubble formation. This harmless phenomenon can be easily observed when opening a can of soda or a bottle of champagne, but It could lead to a serious disease when occurring inside the human body. This sickness is known as decompression sickness (DCS) and it principally affects divers exposed to a sudden decrease in pressure when surfacing too fast. It is caused by the growth of bubbles in tissues or by bubbles that travel the lung circulation through the arteries. DCS causes minor problems, such as skin rashes, more severe effects, such as joint damage or the worst possible condition where bubbles block the blood flow, which can cause death. Until now it does not exist a method to detect bubble presence inside the body in real time. Our project demonstrated the technical and commercial viability of a device capable to detect bubbles in real time moving through vessels or formed within a tissue. For that purpose, we designed and built a sensor of piezoelectric materials to be used as a belt around a human limb to monitor for bubble presence. Experiments were conducted using cadaveric bovine tissue exposed to atmospheric conditions while bubbles were controllably introduced after being generated in a bubble generator device. Under these conditions we verified that the device successfully detects a change in the electrical parameters monitored when a single bubble as small as 100um is present. Moreover, we used a hyperbaric chamber filled with nitrogen to recreate the decompression effect. Bubbles were generated by a sudden decompression and the device detected the start of bubble formation inside the tissue. The next steps are to miniaturize the device to make it wearable and to compare its performance against the current standard in DCS diagnosis which is doppler ultrasound.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/25/2019<br>      Modified by: William&nbsp;Garcia Rodriguez</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
