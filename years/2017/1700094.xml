<AbstractNarration>This project addresses theoretical and computational properties of solutions to a certain class of partial differential equations, which arise in many modeling problems. These include the following: the design of optical instruments using mirrors or lenses, market matching in economics, and the optimization of transportation networks. One very important question concerns the smoothness of solutions; namely, if solutions of these equations can have sharp corners or not. The question of smoothness has direct implications in the accuracy of these equations as models in the aforementioned problems. For example, in designing a lens with certain refractive properties, failure of smoothness can cause chromatic aberration (as when a prism splits white light into a rainbow), a phenomenon that lies outside the scope of the simplified model given by this class of equations. Nevertheless, this special class of equations is extremely convenient for modeling purposes, owing to the fact that their solutions often have simple geometric characterizations. This is especially important in the example of optical instruments, since in comparison with other models, it is logistically far simpler and more efficient to manufacture lenses or mirrors that arise by application of these equations than by using other models. Smoothness also plays a large role in the development of accurate and fast numerical algorithms. Effectively translating theoretical results into the language of computation is vital in creating a bridge between abstract mathematical results and practical outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more specific terms, the project will be concerned with a subclass of Monge-Ampere-type equations known as generated Jacobian equations (GJEs). These contain many problems from geometric optics in the near-field regime, the Monge-Kantorovich (optimal transport) problem, and the real Monge-Ampere equation. The first portion of the project focuses on regularity and "partial regularity," by which is meant the study of singular behavior of weak solutions. Specific goals are to categorize systematically the structure (size, shape, topological, and differentiable structure) of singular sets, and to characterize quantitatively the inhomogeneous data that give solutions that still exhibit regular behavior when standard conditions in regularity theory fail. The methods used to study these problems will be a combination of geometric techniques developed to analyze regularity of degenerate, fully nonlinear elliptic equations, along with techniques originating in the calculus of variations and optimal transport theory. The second part of the project focuses on the development of numerical solvers for GJEs. The intent is to leverage the understanding afforded by partial regularity to develop numerical schemes that avoid degenerate singular structures, resulting in fast, accurate algorithms to solve GJE and optimal transport problems beyond the reach of existing techniques, with a specific aim of producing algorithms backed with rigorous performance bounds. The two halves of the project are interrelated, as improved numerical tools can be an effective tool for visualizing and formulating conjectures on the singular behavior of solutions, and in turn, improved theoretical understanding of singularities leads to the development of effective numerical algorithms.</AbstractNarration>
