<AbstractNarration>Challenges to maintaining high water quality in Maine lakes include predicting the responses of lake ecosystems to variations and the extent of engagement of residents in lake stewardship activities. The long-term goal of this research project is to advance a fundamental understanding of processes that control the susceptibility of lakes to environmental factors.  Citizen scientists are being trained to collect the data that projects researchers are using to characterize the environmental characteristics of the local environment.  The cross-disciplinary approach to the research project, especially with respect to stakeholder engagement in implementing best management practices, can act as a model for other states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to engage citizen scientists to collect water and sediment samples from 25 Maine lakes simultaneously several times during the summer season across a continuum of oligotrophic to eutrophic lakes. The synthesis of data allows the project researchers to formulate a scientific basis for the changes in lake water quality and to develop a predictive model for the epilimnetic phosphorus concentrations.   Through workshops and pre- and post-project surveys with citizen scientists and lake residents, the researchers are articulating processes by which changes to lake water quality are influenced by natural and anthropogenic factors and identifying cognitive and behavioral factors that affect the human system. The project researchers are training citizen scientists in proper sample collection practice and developing surveys to assess lake stewardship activities and engagement.   Afterwards, the researchers are implementing lake stewardship workshops to share the project findings. The development of the predictive lake phosphorus model involving lake stakeholders will advance knowledge within the field of limnology and will allow the development of an adaptive management process whereby the interaction between the social and biophysical components are enhanced.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project was conducted to determine the factors that control the degradation of lake water quality. The study was designed and conducted in collaboration with our stakeholders, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the Lake Stewards of Maine (LSM), the oldest and largest lake citizen scientist organization in the US. We hypothesized that important factors would include (1) specific lake physical and chemical characteristics; (2) watershed characteristics, including land use; and (3) climate characteristics. To this end, we sampled the water column and sediment of 35&nbsp;Maine lakes in the period June-early July and again in August 2018. Lake sampling was performed with the help of lake citizen scientists who were trained and organized by the LSM. The Maine DEP and the Lake Environment Association (LEA), a lake advocacy group in Maine, also shared comparable data with us on 120 additional Maine lakes.</p> <p>The study results showed that the best predictive models for the loss of lake water quality and eutrophication were those that incorporated parameters representing all three categories above. In particular, we observed that lakes that are relatively shallow and have a high areal percentage of agriculture in their watershed, and whose sediment contains relatively low aluminum and high phosphorus concentrations are especially susceptible to episodic or sustained loss in water quality.</p> <p>Establishing a model that evaluates lake vulnerability with respect to eutrophication informs best water quality management decisions. This is especially important to our stakeholders, including the Maine DEP and local lake associations, because as environmental agencies proceed toward developing land-use criteria for lakes, the availability of a model that reflects lake physicochemical and watershed characteristics, and is supported with descriptive water quality measures, will be highly important in the development of those criteria.</p> <p>We conducted surveys and focus group sessions to document lake associations? and citizen scientists? participation in conservation stewardship activities.&nbsp;The scientific results from this study were shared with the participant citizen scientists in two focus group meetings and a public meeting.&nbsp;The presentation of our physical science findings on specific lakes at these meetings generated a great deal of interest among lake residents and volunteers. These meetings resulted in strategies toward (a) best practices for active monitoring and citizen engagement in lake systems, (b) future data needs and strategies for data collection, and (c) engaging additional lake associations in future stewardship activities.</p> <p>The results of the citizen scientists? survey and focus groups suggested that&nbsp;levels of commitment vary by lake association and, more often than not, a core group of dedicated volunteers is necessary to sustain efforts. We found that the presence of LSM volunteers can serve as a catalyst for active associations, as does poor lake water quality brought about by the presence of invasive species or lake algal blooms. Key efforts aimed at education, communication, and outreach to expand the volunteer base and involve the younger generation will aid in sustaining citizen engagement efforts. Moreover, building social capital through self-organizing, nested relationships that engage in deliberative and collaborative efforts with supporting institutions, local, state and non-profit, are key to long-term successes in lake stewardship.</p> <p>Our surveys showed that in general, the citizen scientists are older, more educated, and wealthier than the average population. They are almost evenly divided between male and female, and between working professionals and retirees. They are deeply concerned about the environmental health of lakes and many have a sophisticated understanding of the biophysical and socioeconomic drivers that contribute to challenges to the sustainability of these ecosystems. Survey respondents overwhelmingly self-identify as volunteers engaged in environmental stewardship, rather than citizen scientists gathering data. Results from our study suggest a more suitable label for such engagement might be ?citizen stewards,? to more appropriately capture and reflect the work accomplished.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/18/2019<br>      Modified by: Aria&nbsp;Amirbahman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743082/1743082_10509507_1574108142211_Sediment_Sampling--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743082/1743082_10509507_1574108142211_Sediment_Sampling--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sediment Sampling"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743082/1743082_10509507_1574108142211_Sediment_Sampling--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sediment Sampling"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students collecting lake sediment samples.</div> <div class="imageCredit">University of Maine</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aria&nbsp;Amirbahman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Sediment Sampling</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743082/1743082_10509507_1574108436355_Secchi-CitizenScientist--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743082/1743082_10509507_1574108436355_Secchi-CitizenScientist--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Water Quality Measurements"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743082/1743082_10509507_1574108436355_Secchi-CitizenScientist--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Water Quality Measurements"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A student measuring the lake Secchi depth with the help of a citizen scientist.</div> <div class="imageCredit">University of Maine</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aria&nbsp;Amirbahman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Water Quality Measurements</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743082/1743082_10509507_1574108566845_FocusGroup-Meeting--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743082/1743082_10509507_1574108566845_FocusGroup-Meeting--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Focus Group Meeting"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743082/1743082_10509507_1574108566845_FocusGroup-Meeting--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Focus Group Meeting"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Brainstorming on lake stewardship with citizen scientists at a focus group meeting.</div> <div class="imageCredit">University of Maine</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aria&nbsp;Amirbahman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Focus Group Meeting</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743082/1743082_10509507_1574108642827_PI-CitizenScientists--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743082/1743082_10509507_1574108642827_PI-CitizenScientists--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Discussion with Citizen Scientists"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743082/1743082_10509507_1574108642827_PI-CitizenScientists--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Discussion with Citizen Scientists"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">One of the project investigators describing lake processes that lead to eutrophication to the citizen scientists during a sampling event.</div> <div class="imageCredit">University of Maine</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aria&nbsp;Amirbahman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Discussion with Citizen Scientists</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743082/1743082_10509507_1574108977552_Sampling_Sabbatus--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743082/1743082_10509507_1574108977552_Sampling_Sabbatus--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sampling with Citizen Scientists"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743082/1743082_10509507_1574108977552_Sampling_Sabbatus--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sampling with Citizen Scientists"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A student collecting lake water samples with the help of a citizen scientist.</div> <div class="imageCredit">University of Maine</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aria&nbsp;Amirbahman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Sampling with Citizen Scientists</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
