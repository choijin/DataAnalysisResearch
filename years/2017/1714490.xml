<AbstractNarration>The project is motivated by applications to population genetics and optimization. The first objective of the project is to predict the changes of the genic characteristics of a population, and to compute fundamental biological quantities, such as the expected time before extinction and fixation of a gene type in the genome. The successful implementation of this research program is expected to have a direct impact on understanding medical disorders caused by single-gene mutations in genetics and of evolutionary trees in phylogenetics. The second objective of this research is centered on a family of open problems in optimization with applications to communication networks, spacecraft control, and economics, among others. A suitable framework to analyze such questions is the theory of singular stochastic control, where the goal is to design a controlled process that performs a task with minimum cost in a random environment. This project will help to gain insight into the construction of optimal execution policies and in the evaluation of minimal costs in networks. The PI will continue to involve both undergraduate and graduate students in her research program, to promote the visibility of women and underrepresented groups in the mathematical community, and to organize conferences at University of Minnesota and American Mathematical Society meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the first part of the research program is to build a comprehensive regularity theory for a class of degenerate elliptic operators defined on singular manifolds capable of taking into account a wide range of factors that impact the genetic evolution. The PI aims to develop novel analytic and probabilistic methods adapted to the particular degenerate features of these operators and the geometry of the non-smooth manifolds, where such problems are formulated. She expects that this research will have further implications in harmonic analysis, mathematical finance, and in probability. The second topic of the project seeks to develop the mathematical foundations to address the questions of interest related to the identification of optimal execution policies in singular stochastic control problems. The PI pursues a program to advance our understanding of the regularity theory of a wide class of second order Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations with gradient constraints. This research will entail the development of novel techniques that forge into the theories of nonlinear equations and nonlinear boundary conditions of oblique type, and require careful boundary estimates adapted to the non-smooth domains appearing in this framework.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Motivated by applications to population genetics and optimization, the two main lines of research, proposed by the former PI, are related to degenerate elliptic equations and optimal stochastic control theory. The objective of this research project is the description of the statistical properties of evolutionary processes of gene frequencies in biology, and the design of optimal control policies that minimize costs in systems arising in communications, engineering, and economics.     Starting from the second year of the award, the grant was transferred to the current PI.  The PI continued the study of degenerate partial differential equations and extended the research into the framework of inverse problems, arising naturally from financial mathematics, probability, geophysics, medical imaging and many others.  The research projects include the study of fractional Laplacian arising from long-range interactions between particles and it can be seen as the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for a degenerate extension operator related to population genetics. The PI studied various inverse problems for the perturbations of fractional Laplacian and demonstrated the possibility of reconstructing unknown internal properties from knowledge of partial or incomplete exterior measurements. Moreover, the PI investigated inverse boundary value problems for local equations, including elliptic equations, nonlinear equations, and transport equations with applications in optical tomography, blackbody emission, vortex dynamics, and kinetic theory.      Supported by the project, the former PI, the current PI and their collaborators have produced 14 publications. The current PI is constantly invited to participate in conferences, presents the research results, and regularly serves as a reviewer for mathematical journals in the community. The current PI has organized two minisymposia and one workshop; moreover, the PI has also organized the applied and computational mathematics seminar at the University.  Student participation is as follows.  One female graduate student has been trained and worked on a research project under the goal of the proposed problems. The current PI and this graduate student produced one research article. Two female undergraduate students have been trained to work on senior projects related to the X-ray transform and related inverse problems.
