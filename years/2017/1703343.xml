<AbstractNarration>A persistent challenge facing educators is how to broaden participation of underrepresented populations in STEM careers. Historically, students who are deaf or hard of hearing experience significant obstacles to successful learning in the sciences. Most of these students rely on the support of sign language interpreters. This project will develop a prototype Signing Bioscience Dictionary that will include approximately 1,500 terms that are routinely used in undergraduate biology courses. This project team will examine the potential effectiveness of the dictionary in increasing the life science vocabulary of student interpreters enrolled in Lamar University's four-year undergraduate Interpreter Training Program. The overall goal is for trained interpreters to accurately and effectively convey undergraduate biology information via sign language to support deaf and hard of hearing students. This project may also lead to the dictionary being incorporated into undergraduate training programs across the nation, potentially increasing the number of STEM interpreters working with these students and leading to more persons who are deaf or hard of hearing pursuing careers in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project rests in advancing the knowledge base for retaining deaf and hard of hearing students in the life sciences.  In addition to developing a prototype dictionary, the project will evaluate its  potential effectiveness in enabling undergraduate students at Lamar to develop a more robust American Sign Language life science vocabulary and use it to interpret content taught in undergraduate biology courses. In addition, this project will solicit recommendations from students and instructors at Lamar to identify new terms to be included in an expanded version of the dictionary and to incorporate any improvements they suggest. The project innovation is the repurposing of the signed terms from TERC's Signing Life Science Dictionary into interactive on-demand videos that include terms, definitions, illustrations, and an avatar signing the English text-based elements. Use of video will make the dictionary compatible with most computers and browsers and does not require an Internet connection. Research methods and measurements will build on the designs TERC has used for evaluations of other signing dictionaries. Results will render new knowledge about the effectiveness of the dictionary in strengthening the American Sign Language STEM knowledge of students in Lamar's training program. If successful, the project will help address the challenge of broadening participation of an underrepresented student population in STEM learning and potentially in STEM careers.</AbstractNarration>

They can use icons to access terms from an alphabet list, a category list, or a search box. A single click leads to a definition page that includes the term and its definition in English. It also includes icons for listening to the term and its definition, seeing a 3D avatar character sign the term, and viewing an illustration. Controls can be used to start and stop the signing, loop back to the beginning, increase the page size, and go back to the definition page. The SBD is available free from the TERC and Lamar Web sites. Since the interactive terms are available as on-demand videos, the SBD is compatible with most computers and browsers and does not require an Internet connection.</p> <p>Research into use and effectiveness of the innovation was conducted over 9 months with 26 Lamar undergraduate interpreting students, representing each of the four program levels. Data were collected using matching vocabulary pre- post-tests, matching pre- post-interpretation samples, observation, post-use surveys, and videos of use. Findings supplied answers to four primary research questions: 1) How do Lamar undergraduate interpreting students use the SBD to learn life science terms? 2) How effective is the SBD in increasing Lamar undergraduate interpreting student's knowledge of the vocabulary and ability to sign life science terms? 3) How effective is the SBD in increasing Lamar undergraduate interpreting student's&nbsp; capacity to accurately and clearly interpret content typically taught in undergraduate biology courses? 4) What additions and/or changes would make the SBD more effective?</p> <p>This study provided important information about use of the SBD to improve interpreting students' life science vocabulary and, as a result, enable undergraduate interpreting students at Lamar and potentially at other universities to build a robust life science vocabulary and ultimately bring about access to and learning of STEM content for pre-college and undergraduate students who are deaf or hard of hearing. Specifically, findings from this study of first-time users of the SBD show that when it is used during two-hour study sessions over a two-week period as a tool to learn life science terms that it appears to contribute to Lamar University's interpreting students having an increased ASL life science vocabulary and ability to sign life science terms. Such knowledge may, however, contribute to only those students who are in the advanced level of the program being able to keep up with the pace of a typical biology lecture and accurately and clearly interpret content typically taught in the Lamar undergraduate biology program. This may be a result of student interpreters in the lower levels of the program not yet having achieved the fluency in ASL to make effective use of the ASL life science vocabulary included in the SBD. Findings indicate that the dictionary's interactive features promote individualized learning for students in all levels of the program that makes the learning of life science terms and what they mean easy and fun.
