<AbstractNarration>Dr. Katherine D. Chadwick has been granted an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out research and education plans at Stanford University and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Building on recent developments of airborne-based measurements of the chemistry of leaves (foliar chemistry), Dr. Chadwick will develop the methodology to remotely map soil organic carbon and nutrient profiles. This methodology will be of interest to those that need to determine inventories of subsurface carbon and nutrient stocks for scientific or management questions. The datasets derived from this project could be used to test models of soil carbon stocks and turnover and help to develop methodology for large-scale land surface models. The education activities will focus on mentoring two undergraduate students in research projects related to the investigation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No geophysical, geochemical, or remote sensing approaches currently exist that can map below ground soil carbon or nutrient composition over large spatial scales, requiring most studies to rely on point sampling and intensive characterization methods combined with uncertain spatial extrapolations. The ability to remotely assess soil carbon and key nutrient stocks using above ground measures will allow for spatially explicit estimates of soil carbon inventories and their relationship to landscape position, lithology, soil moisture, aspect, and other remotely measurable parameters. In addition, building a link between remotely detectable characteristics of vegetation and subsurface properties will open a window into the spatial distribution of critical zone processes and how they interact over spatial scales currently not feasible to study.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>As an NSF postdoctoral researcher, I expanded my research through collaboration with my mentors Kate Maher at Stanford and Eoin Brodie at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. I am working with the Department of Energy&rsquo;s Watershed Function Scientific Focus Area, an ongoing project studying water, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) fluxes along topographic gradients within catchments in the East River watershed in Colorado. In the summer of 2018, I coordinated the integration of flight and ground teams in the first Assignable Asset survey undertaken by the National Ecological Observation Network&rsquo;s Airborne Observation Platform (NEON&rsquo;s AOP). I led a group of twenty scientists ranging from PIs to undergraduates in a field campaign to collect samples of leaves, litter, roots, and soils for chemical analysis, as well as samples for rhizospheric and soil microbial DNA analysis, across 430 sites within the 330 km<sup>2</sup> AOP survey area. I coordinated our efforts directly with the AOP data collection team to ensure that the field and aerial data collections were temporally aligned (critical for linking foliar characteristics with imaging spectroscopy data in systems with rapid phenological change). These samples are now organized into an archive that we are utilizing to support a variety of studies from collaborators across many disciplines. So far, we have generated maps of foliar traits that have been extrapolated across the entire study area and are in the late stages of a manuscript that documents the work we have done associated with this effort.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project remains ongoing and over the next two to five years, I will build off the coaligned NEON AOP dataset and field sample archive. I plan to explore aboveground-belowground linkages between vegetation, topographic position, and soil chemical properties from this sample archive as a first step in evaluating our ability to leverage remotely detectable properties of the land surface (topography and vegetation characteristics) to assess the spatial distribution of soil properties. These linkages will include comparisons of foliar characteristics, species composition, and topography, to vertical distributions of soil organic C, rock-derived nutrients, and heavy metal concentrations. This will allow us to evaluate the processes controlling soil C retention, transformation, and export at scales comparable to those considered in Earth-system models of carbon and nutrient cycling, consider relationships between foliar rock-derived nutrient composition and the cycling and retention of those nutrients within soils, and develop maps of vegetation that tolerate metal-contaminated soils and floodplains across watersheds, providing insight into locations where metal mobilization may be taking place and contaminating drinking water supplies. To complete this work, I co-wrote a successful proposal to the National Science Foundation&rsquo;s new Signals in the Soils program with Kate Maher which is supporting my ongoing postdoc work and funding a suite of chemical analyses on the soil profile samples from this archive.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>My NSF fellowship facilitated my collaboration with scientists across a wide range of disciplines and institutions. I have also had the opportunity to work with and mentor many undergraduate researchers during this process, which has been a wonderful and valuable experience. I have built lasting relationships with many of them and they are being included as coauthors on a forthcoming manuscript about this work. In addition, through encouragement from Kate, we have met with local water managers to discuss the way that our work going forward could help with monitoring and improving local drinking water quality if we can identify locations where metals are mobilized in floodplains. There are many projects and collaborations like this that I was able to develop through this work that means I will be able to carry this research forward with me for years to come.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/01/2020<br>      Modified by: Katherine&nbsp;D&nbsp;Chadwick</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1725788/1725788_10499951_1588376380227_5_vswir_pca_hillslope--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1725788/1725788_10499951_1588376380227_5_vswir_pca_hillslope--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Meadow variability as seen from hyperspectral reflectance"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1725788/1725788_10499951_1588376380227_5_vswir_pca_hillslope--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Meadow variability as seen from hyperspectral reflectance"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This image overlays a false color representation of variability in the reflectance properties of a meadow ecosystem in East River watershed, Colorado.
