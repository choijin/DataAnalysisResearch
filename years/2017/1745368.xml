<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, this project explores how molecular shape impacts the internal organization of crystalline solids.  Because material properties intimately relate to the composition of the building-blocks and their alignment, a greater understanding of the factors that influence component interactions holds much importance to the development of advanced materials that exhibit a wide-variety of functional properties.  The project is anchored by a research team at Eastern Illinois University and will prove useful for probing the structural boundaries of the recognition process by investigating the complementary shapes of molecular neighbors.  The educational and service component of the activity focuses on training students (undergraduate and Master's level) as scientists for careers in STEM fields, developing teaching modules for the introductory organic laboratory, and providing X-ray instrument services to the greater academic community of small colleges and universities that support rigorous undergraduate research programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Many functions of solid materials require exquisite control over the molecular architectures of their building blocks.  The construction of structurally controlled supramolecular assemblies (e.g., bulk solids) is still at a primitive level despite great progress in the chemical synthesis of discrete molecules over the past few decades.  This project explores the structural boundaries of molecular shape to the molecular recognition process by using the quasiracemate approach for constructing bimolecular compounds.  Chiral building blocks formulated from known organic precursors will be synthesized via diarylamide and Pemoline templates.  Since it is well known that a high propensity exists for organic molecules to arrange in centrosymmetric relationships, this activity explores the supramolecular behavior of these molecules to form quasicentrosymmetrically related aggregates.  Video-supported thermomicroscopy and calorimetric techniques will be used to investigate the ability of pairs of materials to assemble.  X-ray diffraction techniques will help determine the detailed structures of the materials obtained and assist with determining the topological contributions to these molecular assemblies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The manner in which molecules recognize each other holds much importance to nearly every area of science.  With a clear understanding of the details that promote molecular interactions, this information can also translate to the construction of useful materials with specific functions.  This might include the design and construction of more effective magnetic materials or therapeutic agents.  Because the property that is achieved from collections of molecules is derived from a complex blend of cohesive contacts, classifying each contributor is essential for identifying the functions and potential applications of materials.  Molecular shape is one such contributor to the molecular recognition process that has seen little attention from the scientific community. Using a family of small organic molecules that systematically differ by the pendant substituents, this research project focused on understanding the role of molecular shape to the assembly of the building-blocks in molecular crystals.  Supported by this grant, the PI?s lab has (i) demonstrated the use of hot stage thermomicroscopy as a probe to understand the role and structural boundaries of molecular shape to supramolecular assembly; (ii) established structural models for these associations using X-ray crystallography; and (iii) examined several crystalline systems that assemble with approximate symmetry due to the complementary shapes of the neighboring molecules.  This work provides clear evidence of the importance of the shape space of these molecules and their potential utility to constructing functional materials.  To achieve the goals of this research program, this NSF award funded the research activities of 25 undergraduate (24) and masters (1) students at Whitworth University in Spokane, WA in the form of both supplies and salaries.  Many of these students have moved on to Ph.D. programs and careers in the chemical sciences.  Another important aspect of this award relates to establishing an integrative applied crystallography center at WU, open to students and faculty in the Spokane area as well as the greater academic community of small colleges and universities that support rigorous undergraduate programs.  Given that crystallographic hardware remains rare at undergraduate institutions, this instrument facility provided a critical resource to investigators during the program period.  The impact of this facility can be measured by productivity, student training, and by the diverse pool of collaborators and institutions.
