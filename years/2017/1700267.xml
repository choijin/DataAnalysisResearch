<AbstractNarration>This research project aims to address several fundamental problems arising in two areas of mathematical analysis that have have their origins in quantum physics: operator algebra theory and quantum information theory. The common mathematical structures that thread the various aspects of this project together are called quantum symmetries. Quantum symmetry can be thought of as an enriched notion of symmetry, adapted to model the complex structures arising in nature. In practical contexts, mathematicians and scientists are interested in studying properties of a given system (e.g., a mechanical system, a molecule, or a population of organisms). Understanding the symmetries of such a system - transformations of the system that preserve the relevant structure - provides a wealth of insight into its properties. In many contexts, the symmetries that one encounters are described by mathematical structures called groups. However, for certain complex systems (particularly those connected to quantum mechanical phenomena, or operator algebra theory), groups are insufficient to describe the relevant symmetries that arise. This results in the need for a more general mathematical notion of symmetry, and led to the concept of a quantum group. Quantum groups were formally introduced in the 1980's as a tool to study certain types of non-classical symmetries arising in statistical physics. Since that time, quantum groups (and related notions of quantum symmetry) have proved to have remarkable applications in topology, quantum algebra, operator algebras, quantum probability, quantum information theory, and the classification of topological phases of matter. By exploiting the quantum symmetries appearing in various mathematical and physical systems, this project aims to provide new insights into challenging problems in both operator algebra theory and quantum information theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is divided into three components. The first part concerns the structural theory of von Neumman algebras associated to a class of discrete quantum groups, called orthogonal free quantum groups. The principle aim here is to use recent exciting developments in free probability theory and geometric quantum group theory to solve a conjecture which states that these von Neumann algebras can never be isomorphic to free group factors. The second part of this project concerns the structure of a class of von Neumann algebras, called the q-deformed Araki-Woods algebras. The PI will use certain asymptotic distributional symmetries for these algebras to investigate finite dimensional approximation properties and algebraic indecomposability results. The third and final part of this project proposes completely new applications of quantum symmetries in quantum information theory (QIT). The PI will investigate a new method for constructing examples of quantum channels using representation categories of quantum groups. Applications of these new quantum channels to various relevant questions in QIT will be investigated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The central goal of this project was to study certain generalized notions of symmetry that arise in quantum systems and related mathematical structures, called quantum symmetries.  This project aimed to explore the role that various types of quantum symmetries (e.g., quantum groups, Hopf algebras, and tensor categories) in both abstract operator algebra theory and quantum information theory.  On the operator algebra side, some of the major outcomes achieved by the PI and his collaborators include:  - Establishing a fundamenatal property called ``strong 1-boundedness'' for an important class of quantum group von Neumann algebras (the orthogonal free quantum group factors).  This result implies that these algebras are not isomorphic to the von Neumann algebras obtained from free groups, and supply the first non-group-like examples of strongly 1-bounded algebras.  - Establishing a fundamental finite-dimensional completely bounded approximation property for the q-deformed Araki-Woods von Neumann algebras.  This work will ceertainly lead to future work on rigidity properties of these von Neumann algebras.  - Combining tools from subfactor theory and Hopf algebra theory to prove that quantum symmetry groups of finite spaces yield von Neumann algebras satisfying the Connes Embedding Conjecture.  - Developing and studying quantum group analogues of various group-theoretic notions such as lattices, the property of Rapid Decay, and hypercontractivity of heat semigroups.     On the quantum information theory side, some of the major outcomes achieved by the PI, his students, and his collaborators include:  - Developing a theory of Temperley-Lieb quantum channels based on the representation thoery of quantum orthogonal groups.  Among other things, these channels provide interesting examples of non-random, highly entangled channels.  - Using the representation theory of quantum automorphism groups of graphs to shed light on the existence of  winning strategies for certain non-local graph isomorphism games arising in quantum information theory.   -  Generalizing the notion quantum majorization in quantum information theory to the infinite-dimensional framework of semifinite von Neumann algebras.  In addition to supporting the Pi's research, this award also partially supported the research projects of three undergraduate students, three graduate students, and two postdoctoral fellows.
