<AbstractNarration>The objective of this CAREER project is to understand fundamental physics of semiconductor deep ultraviolet emitters through a comprehensive combined experimental and theoretical study, and to identify and demonstrate solutions in the form of novel nanostructures, materials and device concepts for ultraviolet optoelectronics with significantly improved efficiency. To address the fundamental issues from III-Nitride semiconductor ultraviolet light emitting diodes, novel nanostructures, alternative material candidates, and unconventional ultraviolet optoelectronics will be explored to develop next-generation high-efficiency ultraviolet light sources that will have significant impact on the society through applications such as curing of resins and polymers in 3D printing; phototherapy for medical treatment; agricultural plant lighting; water/air disinfection; and bio-agent sensing. This project offers educational training in multidisciplinary areas such as Electrical Engineering, Material Science, and Physics for both undergraduate and graduate students. The outreach plan which will be integrated with the research includes involving students from National Technical Institute for the Deaf, promoting connectivity and representation of females in engineering, and developing training courses and demonstrations for K-12 students and teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: This CAREER project aims to realize high-efficiency ultraviolet photonic devices based on learning and exploiting the fundamentally new aspects of the physics of photon emission from novel quantum well active region design, alternative materials, and unconventional device concepts. This research will focus on in-depth understanding of fundamental physics, a thorough exploration of light emitting diode device realization, and comprehensive physics-driven characterizations for designing high-efficiency polarization-dependent ultraviolet optoelectronics emitting from 300 nm down to 220 nm. In particular, nanostructured quantum well structures will be proposed and investigated to address the fundamental issue from conventional III-Nitride ultraviolet emitters. The novel physics in these extreme quantum structure active regions will be investigated thoroughly, with the goal of realizing high-efficiency ultraviolet optoelectronics which involves epitaxial growths, material characterizations, device fabrications and measurements, coupled with rigorous theoretical analysis. Alternative material candidates will be explored to serve as active region for ultraviolet photon emitters as well. Unconventional ultraviolet optoelectronic device concepts will be developed to shed light on the pursuit of next-generation high-efficiency ultraviolet light sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
