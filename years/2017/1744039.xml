<AbstractNarration>The Women in Statistics and Data Science (WSDS) Conference will take place from October 19 to 21, 2017 at the Hyatt Regency La Jolla in La Jolla, CA. The theme for the 2017 conference is Share WISDOM (Women In Statistics, Data science, and -OMics). The conference will create an environment that promotes transformation and collaboration by encouraging and supporting women statisticians, biostatisticians, and data scientists. In particular, an ultimate objective of this conference is to increase the proportion of successful women researchers who have the technical skills, capacity and inclination to take on the challenges of complex data oriented research in twenty-first century. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two and half-a-day conference (starting the afternoon of October 19th) will have multiple technical sessions providing participants with the opportunity to learn about novel approaches and innovations addressing the challenges of working with complex data. The technical sessions will be complemented by professional development sessions for all stages of participants starting from graduate students to senior researchers. The synergy derived from the diverse cohort of presenters and participants will support the intentional integration of formal and informal learning and mentoring. The conference, through multiple invited technical sessions will highlight the research of female rising stars, mid-career and senior researchers and will provide the opportunity to establish new collaborations. In addition, the mentoring and networking sessions of academic, government and industry participants will guide early-career women participants on a successful career trajectory.
