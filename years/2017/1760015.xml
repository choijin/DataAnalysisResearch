<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to advance microbiologists' ability to detect, characterize, and control microscopic organisms such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Collectively, the planet's microbiome makes up more than 80% of all living mass and it significantly impacts human health and activities. Some microorganisms are beneficial, providing useful industrial functions or therapeutic value; others can cause severe disease and disrupt industrial processes. Currently, microbiologists grow microorganisms in their laboratories to characterize molecular and cellular mechanisms related to replication, pathogenicity, therapeutic and industrial properties, and interactions with the host and the environment. These goals have proven successful in the generation of diagnostic tools, new therapies, and improving industrial processes. However, a vast proportion of microorganisms remain unable to be efficiently cultivated. Particularly in clinical diagnostics, the ability to detect pathogens accurately and in a timely manner has a direct impact in patient health. This project seeks to address this bottleneck by accelerating the time to detect and isolate microbes from clinical and industrial samples. It is anticipated that reducing the time required to analyze samples from days to a few hours will lead to significant improvements in clinical outcomes and industrial microbiology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project focuses on developing a miniaturized and disposable device that automatically performs sample processing and analysis to isolate and characterize bacteria. It features state-of-the-art microelectronic arrays embedded in microfluidic channels. The array generates electrical force fields having specific frequencies to selectively isolate microorganisms from background debris and other undesired cells present in clinical and industrial samples. Laboratory prototypes have demonstrated proof-of-principle for the isolation and detection subsystems. In the next phase of the technical development, these components will be integrated into a single device. This project will inform the specific design criteria and requirements for this next prototype through customer discovery work.</AbstractNarration>
