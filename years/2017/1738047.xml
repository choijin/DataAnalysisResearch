<AbstractNarration>Title: 2017 Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS) on A Spectrum of Types&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides student travel and subsistence for the 2017 Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS). This summer school provides an important and valuable educational opportunity for students to study theoretical topics related to programming languages and methods/verification. The focus of this year's school is "A Spectrum of Types". The broader significance and importance include building international community and cooperation in foundational research areas, and enhancing education of US students, including women and underrepresented minorities, with exposure to and interaction with leading-edge research and researchers. By supporting US-based students, the school will thus train the next generation of programming languages, compilers and software engineering researchers in both industry and academia, nationally.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award provides student travel and subsistence for the 2017 Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS). OPLSS provides an important and valuable educational opportunity for students to study important techniques to enhance software correctness. The focus of this year's school is "A Spectrum of Types". Nowadays, types not only represent the final value of a program, but can provide important information to allow languages with different semantics to talk to each other correctly. They become so expressive that they can even contain programs; this added flexibility is important to express important invariants and performance constraints. The challenge is how to integrate  these ideas in the context of languages which do not even have types and concurrent languages.     In order to attract more students to the field of programming languages and to make the OPLSS lectures accessible to a wider audience, for the first time OPLSS has a series of additional tutorial like lectures which introduce students to basic notions of syntactic theories.   The broader significance and importance of OPLSS  include building an international community and cooperation in foundational research areas, and enhancing education of US students, including women and underrepresented minorities, with exposure to and interaction with leading-edge research and researchers. By supporting US-based students, the school will thus train the next generation of programming languages, compilers and software engineering researchers in both industry and academia.
