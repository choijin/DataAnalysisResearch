<AbstractNarration>The 26th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques is the premier forum for presenting, discussing, and debating innovative compiler and architectural techniques for advanced computing and communication systems. This conference brings together researchers in fields related to architecture, compiler, application, language and systems for technical exchange on traditional system topics and emerging research areas. The PACT community has enjoyed a close interaction between academic researchers and industrial designers and aims to continue this tradition at PACT 2017. This project funds student travel grant, and includes a goal to broaden and diversify the student participation in the 26th International Conference on Parallel Architecture and Compilation Techniques (PACT 2017). This year's conference, being in its 26th year, will be held from September 9-13, 2017 in Portland, Oregon, USA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal has two primary Broader Impacts. First, the students receiving travel support will benefit from the opportunity to engage in the technical, professional, educational and social exchanges that PACT fosters. The conference serves as an open forum to exchange research results and develop new ideas, as an educational platform to expose students to new research methodologies, tools, and infrastructures, and as a social event to network and prepare students as future researchers. Second, the PACT conference will be indirectly strengthened. More tutorials and workshops can be associated with the main conference, as a result of increased number of student attendance that this travel grant will enable. More broadly, this travel support will increase the attendance of under-represented minorities and talented undergraduate students, attracting them to graduate schools.</AbstractNarration>
