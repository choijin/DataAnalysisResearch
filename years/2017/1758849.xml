<AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation award provides partial support for the event "Chromatic Homotopy Theory: Journey to the Frontier" that will take place May 16-20, 2018 at the University of Colorado, Boulder. This five day event will consist of a two-day workshop followed by a three-day conference. The goal is to promote the work of young researchers in the field, while providing an opportunity for graduate students and early career mathematicians from smaller and/or underfunded institutions to meet the experts in a friendly and thriving environment. Confirmed speakers for the conference come from across the world, including America, Asia and Europe. This meeting will help increase communication and collaboration among the worldwide topology community. The event will be filmed and made available on the internet, thereby broadening its impact. Resources on chromatic homotopy theory are sparse and these videos will also help increase the accessibility of the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chromatic homotopy theory is a deep and difficult branch of homotopy theory which has undergone significant computational and conceptual advances in the recent past. These advances often involve ideas at the interplay of algebraic geometry, number theory, higher category theory, and even quantum field theory. The primary scientific aim of this conference is to survey some of these connections and their impact on the field today. The research of the invited speakers is on the forefront of new developments in the field. Most of them are early career mathematicians whose work is influencing the discipline in new and innovative ways. The workshop preceding the conference will consist of a mini-course covering some of the background necessary for younger participants to fully benefit from the conference. Some of the very best researchers in chromatic homotopy theory will be contributing to the lectures of the workshop. More information is available at https://sites.google.com/view/chtjourney.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit  Topology is an area of mathematics that studies properties of geometric objects that remain unchanged if the object is deformed in a continuous way. As is the case with most areas of mathematics, it has specialized branches that introduce sophisticated machinery to help answer questions that otherwise seem inaccessible. Chromatic homotopy theory is one of these deep and difficult branches of topology. Chromatic homotopy theory involves ideas at the interplay of other areas of mathematics such as algebraic geometry, number theory and higher category theory. The primary scientific aim of this conference was to survey recent development in chromatic homotopy theory. The three days of research talks (May 18-20) gave an opportunity for researchers to present and publicize new results. Many of the speakers were early career mathematicians whose work has and continues to influence the discipline in innovative ways. Broader Impacts Speakers for the conference came from across the world, including America, Asia and Europe. This meeting helped increase communication and collaboration among the worldwide topology community. Videos of the talks are available to all on the internet and so the event has helped and will continue to help disseminate the work of our speakers.
