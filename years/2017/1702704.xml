<AbstractNarration>Water resources are a critical issue for agriculture in the arid parts of the US, and it is likely that water availability will be affected by future climate change, yet it remains difficult to predict the magnitude of future rainfall changes. The proposed research will develop a new and precise method for quantifying past changes in water table depth, using measurements of dissolved noble gas isotopes in ancient groundwater.  This knowledge of past water table fluctuations will help illuminate the regional rainfall response to climate variations, and strengthen predictions by providing rigorous tests of rainfall models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The method is based on the demonstrated fact that heavy gases settle to the bottom of the stagnant column of air in the soil above the water table depth.  The deeper the water table, the more extreme the enrichment of heavy isotopes, and these heavy isotopes become dissolved in the water thus preserving information about the water table depth in aquifers containing ancient groundwater.  This groundwater is already routinely sampled to learn about past temperature from the abundance of the noble gases; the proposed research will add water table depth to the information that can be extracted from the samples.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported the development of a novel method to know how deep the water tables were at times in the past, which indicates useful information about past water status and water availability.   The method takes advantage of the fact that ancient water is present in certain artesian (or confined) aquifers, and the water contains dissolved gases such as atmospheric krypton and xenon.  These gases are chemically unreactive - the so-called "noble" gase - making them suitable for tracers of physical processes such as the temperature and depth of the water table.  Our method uses the stable isotopes of krypton and xenon - which are simply forms of these gases that have an extra neutron.  They are therefore heavier, and therefore preferentially sink to the bottom of the air-filled soil layer above the water table.  Luckily, the magnitude of this settling of heavy gases depends in a known way on the gravity at the surface of the Earth, so it is easy to predict how much heavy isotope enrichment there should be for a given water table depth.   The method therefore gives the past water table depth in a very straightforward and accurate way, which was not possible using prior methods.  This new method complements the existing method of using the total krypton and xenon abundance in the ancient water to infer the past temperature, which has been very useful in understanding how Earth's climate cooled during the last ice age, and how much it will warm in the future.  The past water table depth not only helps to understand past water availability and future water status in a warming world, but it also helps to make a small correction for the geothermal gradient in soils.
