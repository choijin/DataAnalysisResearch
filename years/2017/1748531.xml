<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate a community of innovation that is devoted to building virtual reality (VR) devices and experiences. The aim of this research is to track the conversations and activities of this technological community at the nexus of industry, entertainment and research. The results of this research will deepen our understanding of the formation and growth of innovation communities. It will address how knowledge flows across institutions, and how technologies are shaping places and selves. The findings of this project will be of interest to policy makers, designers, innovators, businesses, entertainment industry and educators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is an ethnography of an innovation community and will be conducted through participant observation and interviews. The project will be based at the confluence of academic institutions, technology companies, and the entertainment business. The questions structuring the ethnography include: 1) what are the goals and narratives of this community of innovation; (2) how do the interactions between bodies and VR technologies create novel kinds of places that are simultaneously virtual and physical; and (3) how does the language the VR community uses to describe the technology invite a rethinking of human sociality? In focusing specifically on female led research and ventures, this ethnography will further highlight the role of women in STEM and tell the story of an emerging technology from a perspective often absent in such conversations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award funded 12 months of ethnographic fieldwork, conducted by the PI (Lisa Messeri). Fieldwork was based in Los Angeles and was focused on the community of virtual reality researchers. In specific, the research focused on how "women in VR" was a visible and actively constructed identity for many (men and women) working in this industry. This research therefore focused on two anthropological questions (1) what role are women playing in the development of an emerging technology and (2) how does the place where a tech is considered to be emerging (LA vs San Francisco, for example) effect its development.     The research will result in a series of academic and popular articles, as well as a book. These pieces of scholarship and observation will draw on the data collected during these 12 months and contribute to conversations in feminist science and technology studies (STS), anthropology, and media studies.

I was able to share with many whom I met the role social science has to play in technological development. By being present in design meetings and other instances where my opinion was solicited, this research actively engaged with technological development by putting lessons from STS "in practice." Additionally, as my research focused on women in VR, many of the women I worked with were ones who had previously imagined themselves outside of technology. Not only had VR allowed them into the cordoned off realm of "technology", but (as several reported to me) the fact that a professor from Yale showed interest in what they were doing made them more excited to keep trying to make their way in an industry which, despite narratives of a utopian gender parity, still actively tries to keep them out.
