<AbstractNarration>Algebraic geometry is concerned with geometrically understanding algebraic varieties -- the spaces of solutions to polynomial equations -- in order to solve algebraic equations.  Abelian varieties are especially interesting because these spaces possess the structure of an Abelian group, that is, the points of the space can be added to each other to produce other points.  Abelian varieties appear ubiquitously in mathematics as important invariants of more complicated varieties and are therefore a crucial tool in algebraic geometry, number theory, representation theory, and complex analysis.  This research project aims to understand how algebraic varieties vary in families by studying the geometry of the moduli spaces that parametrize abelian varieties and related objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the project is concerned with hyperbolicity phenomena in locally symmetric varieties.  Some such varieties can be interpreted as moduli spaces of Hodge structures, and in those cases hyperboliciity relates to the fact that the existence of variations of those Hodge structures (for example the periods of abelian varieties or hyperk√§hler varieties) over a base B imposes strong conditions on the birational geometry of B.  This is closely related to conjectural uniform boundedness properties of such variations over varying bases B, which in turn strongly parallel conjectural boundedness properties exhibited by Galois representations coming from geometry over arithmetic bases.  The project aims to expand upon new techniques recently developed by the investigator and collaborators to explore such phenomena, both in the geometric and arithmetic contexts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Topological invariants of algebraic varieties often come equipped with an additional structure called a Hodge structure.  This enhancement provides a particularly powerful tool for understanding the moduli theory of algebraic varieties.  In particular, the intrinsic geometry of moduli spaces of Hodge structures is a common source of hyperbolicity in moduli spaces of algebraic varieties which are classified by their Hodge structures.    During the tenure of this award, the PI (together with coauthors) has developed a number of new tools (involving ideas coming from mathematical logic) to understand how Hodge structures behave in families of algebraic varieties.  This has produced results related to:  1.  The transcendence theory of the classifying maps of families of Hodge structures (called period maps). Roughly speaking, this is encapsulated in the Ax--Schanuel theorem, which says that algebraic relations among the data in the Hodge structure should come from the geometry of the varieties (via the Hodge conjecture).  2.  The algebraicity of (mixed) period maps.  Roughly, the PI showed that moduli spaces of Hodge structures that arise in geometric families are quasiprojective algebraic varieties, thus resolving an old conjecture of Griffiths.  The PI has also generalized this result to the case of mixed Hodge structures, which arise in the cohomology of general algebraic varieties (as opposed to pure ones, which arise from smooth compact varieties).  3.  The tame geometry of moduli spaces of Hodge structures.  While full moduli spaces of Hodge structures are not algebraic, they admit a notion of tameness (precisely are definable in an o-minimal structure) with respect to which their intrinsic geometry is better behaved.  4.  The Hodge theory of hyperkahler varieties.  Many of the hallmark results in the geometry of hyperkahler manifolds have been generalized to the singular case.  5.  The Hodge theory of Calabi--Yau varieties.  Hyperkahler varieties are known to be one of the building blocks of projective Calabi--Yau varieties, and the techniques of the previous paragraph have allowed for instance to generalize this to the Kahler setting.  The PI has used funds from the award to organize a number of activities meant to discuss, develop, and disseminate ideas related to these themes.  The PI has also participated in a number of introductory lecture series and summer schools meant to introduce young researchers to this area of research and provide opportunities for early career development.
