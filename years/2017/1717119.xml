<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to deploy ten  temporary seismic stations in the Wellington region on New Zealand's North Island. The recorded seismicity will help constraint the rupture area of the Kaikoura Mw= 7.8 earthquake that occurred in the northern part of New Zealand?s South Island on November 13, 2016. The main motivation for deploying instruments in this region is the potential for earthquakes migrating northwards onto or being triggered on the subduction megathrust located beneath the Wellington area and/or on crustal faults that cut through the region surrounding the capital of New Zealand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stress change calculations show that the area near Wellington has been subjected to an increase in earthquake-causing stress. The plan is to deploy the temporary seismic instruments at sites previously used in the 2009-2011 SAHKE project, concentrating on redeploying in the southwestern part of the former array. This will yield an average station spacing of about 12 km. We will work directly with our collaborators in Victoria University of Wellington on the siting plan, and we will take advantage of their landowner connections for facilitating permitting. We expect to run the stations for about 6 months. Once the instruments are removed and shipped back to the U.S., the data will be converted to a standard archive format and provided to the IRIS Data Management Center, along with the metadata, within one month.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the project was to deploy 10 temporary seismic instruments in the southern part of New Zealand's North Island and the northern part of the South Island in order to record aftershocks of the November 2016 magnitude 7.8 Kaikoura earthquake for several months.  The instruments were deployed with the assistance of scientists from Victoria University of Wellington and GNS Science in New Zealand, along with 14 additional instruments from our collaborating institutions.  One staff member and one graduate student from the University of Wisconsin-Madison participated in the deployment.  We successfully recorded data for about 6 months, from early December 2016 to early May 2017.  One staff member and one post-doctoral researcher from the University of Wisconsin-Madison participated in the instrument removal.  The data were assembled in a standard-format seismic database and submitted to the national seismic data archiving facility, the Data Management Center of the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology.  The data are publicly available there, accessed using seismic network code Z1.2016-2017.  The aftershock data recorded by the instruments we deployed can be used to study the many faults that experienced slip during the Kaikoura earthquake, and help understand the complex tectonics and seismic hazard of this part of New Zealand.
