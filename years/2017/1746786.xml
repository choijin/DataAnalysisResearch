<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will address the need to retain more diverse students' science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) interest and increase their scientific literacy and 21st century skills. These goals are critical for the United States to remain competitive in the global workforce and reinforce goals of individual prosperity that are enhanced by developing STEM skills. There is therefore a strong market need among educators and parents alike for STEM video games that support development of these skills. This project will create an expert-level group challenge in an online video game for multidisciplinary integrated science learning that will increase students' scientific problem solving and collaboration skills. This innovation will empower teachers to do hands-on, integrated STEM cooperative group learning with highly engaging authentic experiences based on well-researched pedagogical best practices such as cooperative learning and inquiry-based science practices. Key innovations include novel instructional design for live simulated group challenges and generating a scalable architecture that will serve as a framework for creating authoring tools and additional challenges in the future. This work upholds the National Science Foundation's missions to strengthen the United States' workforce competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will establish the technical and commercial feasibility of the collaborative live simulation challenges for groups of students. Key technical risks include creating effective group simulations with randomly seeded variables that run live within a 3D Gameworld, given the limitations of consumer and institutional technology, and developing a scalable architecture which will allow applications of this innovation in additional contexts. The innovation in these areas will lead to future applications of this technology to create content authoring tools which enable scalable group challenge content development to expand to additional STEM content areas across elementary to high school age groups, and can be extended to support teachers making custom challenges based on local interests on demand without technical skills. By the end of Phase I, the project will lead to (1) producing a playable challenge based on integrated disciplinary core ideas in middle school level life science, aligned with Next Generation Science Standards; (2) answering key technical questions around bandwidth and simulation technical limitations for the proposed solution with accessible technology in our target applications; (3) addressing key technical risks around the deployability of the project; (4) collecting initial data on the educational application benefits.</AbstractNarration>

There were also significant improvements in the specific SEPs of Planning and Carrying out Investigations, Analyzing and Interpreting Data, and Defining Problems for Engineering. For example, one participant on the pre-test analyzed data graphs by saying they were, ?going up and down in a similar way? (which was not accurate nor specific), and then in the post-test improved by saying that, "Humans seem to increase while bees are declining.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Phase I project resulted in the creation of a collaborative applied science video game challenge. Students group up in teams of five and explore an ecosystem with a variety of problems.

After reaching a consensus about the problem, students then test solutions and recommend a single or set of solutions to address the problem. The innovation was first created with two problem scenarios, but was designed to be expanded so that educators could use it with many potential scenarios across disciplines. A key aspect of the innovation involves leveraging technology to enable collaborative experiences, rather than the individual, siloed approach of most games and simulations. We named this experience Expeditions. In Phase I R&amp;D, the researchers successfully addressed the main technical risks for the Expeditions, which were   that the Expeditions simulation works with sufficient simulation detail while functioning on low-end bandwidth and computers; that the Tyto Online framework can work on Chromebooks, which represent 58% of devices currently being adopted within school system; that the Expeditions showed initial positive learning results with significant improvements for pilot students.    A small pilot test was conducted in order to collect initial efficacy data, the enjoyment level of the kids from the experience, and qualitative information that will be used to guide further development of the product. Overall, even though students only engaged in one short Expeditions experience for less than 2 hours, significant pre/post-test results were established with a 12.16% increase on the science test. This assessment focused on Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs), as defined by the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).

In SD [South Dakota] humans stay the same while bees increase,? which was both specific and accurate to the data, demonstrating a significant increase in performance. Students also rated their enjoyment of the experience as a 6.05/7.0 average (with 7 being, ?I loved it!?). The primary innovation benefits identified by the researchers are to:  Increase deep learning across students so they could apply their learning in novel settings in order to more fully understand the content; Focus on integrated STEM learning, as this approach provides contextual, deeper knowledge for students; Utilize a problem based learning approach and strategies, which are shown to encourage accessing of prior knowledge and high-road transfer, improving metacognitive awareness and long-term retention; Provide a tool for cooperative learning, which has a broad set of diverse, positive outcomes for students, including better communication, improved motivation, and even feelings of acceptance and inclusion among group members.    The results showed potential for the Expeditions to improve students? science and engineering practices, and engage with them with a more authentic scientific problem solving experience, and educators in interviews have been emphatic about their excitement for such a tool.
