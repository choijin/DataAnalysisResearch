<AbstractNarration>This project will study the interface between quantum mechanics and thermodynamics.  This is a cutting edge research direction because the way quantum systems come into equilibrium, or "thermalize", remains a mystery.  The picture is clearer for isolated classical systems.  For example, in classical dynamics if a system of interacting particles explores all possible configurations, then it can thermalize.  Such a system is also said to be "chaotic" and to lack "integrability", which means the particle trajectories cannot be predicted with a sequence of integrals.  For integrable systems, future dynamics can be predicted.  Interestingly, however, if the conditions for integrability are weakly broken, there are still scenarios for which stable dynamics can be predicted.  This is a consequence of the celebrated Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem, which shows that small perturbations are insufficient to render the system chaotic.  This effect is largely responsible for the orbital stability for our own solar system.  Since quantum physics describes dynamics too, it is natural to ask if there is an analogue to the KAM theorem for quantum systems.  This project will explore this question by first creating a quantum integrable system using a gas of ultracold atoms confined in one-dimensional traps.  Changes to the system's behavior will then be caused by adjusting magnetic long-range interactions between the atoms.  The time it takes for the gas to thermalize after a momentum kick will provide a measure of the breakdown of integrability in the system.   This work will have an impact on quantum information processing, and other technologies that rely on the predictability of quantum dynamics.  Students working on this project will also benefit from research training that will prepare them for jobs in high tech industry or academic careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve these goals, this team will confine atoms of dysprosium (Dy), the most magnetic element, in two-dimensional optical lattices.  The energy gap to the first transverse motional excited state will be larger than the gas temperature and chemical potential, ensuring that the gas in each cigar-shaped tube is in the quasi-1D regime.  For large-enough scattering lengths, the gas will approximately realize the Tonks-Girardeau limit of the integrable Lieb-Liniger model.  A magnetic field will set the angle of the dipoles with respect to the tube axis.  The magnitude of the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction can be tuned by this angle, allowing us to control the integrability-breaking perturbation strength.  A Bragg diffraction pulse will split the gas in two.  These parts of the gas will collide every 10 ms due to weak longitudinal harmonic confinement.  This dipolar version of the quantum Newton's cradle experiment will allow this team to explore analogs of the classical KAM scenario in the quantum realm.  Moreover, spin-orbit coupling (previously demonstrated by this group with Dy) will be introduced in attempts to induce p-wave superfluidity near Feshbach resonances in one-dimensional gases of fermionic Dy.  In this way, one-dimensional atomic systems will be used to explore novel types of superfluids that arise when the spin of the atom depends on the direction the atom is moving.  This is important because exotic superfluids such as these support unusual excitations that may be useful for quantum information processing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Quantum many-body physics in 1D is notoriously strange.  Inherently strong quantum fluctuations destroy long-range order, despite the possible presence of locally strong particle correlations. Consider the example of infinitely repulsive, short-range-interacting bosons---the so-called Tonks-Girardeau (TG) gas.  Strong repulsion causes 1D traffic jams, because exchanging positions without collision is impossible, resulting in a wavefunction with nodes at each particle just like an ideal Fermi gas.  More generally, tuning interactions from weak to strong changes the system equation of state from an ideal Bose gas, to a weakly interacting quasi-condensate, and finally to a TG gas, where it again behaves like an ideal gas, though of a fermionic nature.  Though bizarre, many experiments have established the existence of these phases using 1D quantum gases.   Excited states of 1D bosons are stranger still, though difficult to study due to coupling to environmental baths.  Fortunately, quantum gases experiments provide a well-isolated and controlled setting for exploring novel regimes.  For example, Bragg diffraction has been used to kick the atoms like a Newton's cradle, which we have also explored in this program.  In addition, in this project, we performed an experiment that quantum quenches a TG gas augmented with long-range dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) into create a hierarchy of exotic quantum many-body `scar' states using a strange `topological? property of the gas called a quantum holonomy.  Surprisingly, the DDI stabilizes these scars, allowing us to create and study these novel states of matter.  Quantum many-body scars are atypical and non-ergodic excited states that fail to immediately thermalize.  Their name derives from the regular patterns (scars) that certain wavefunctions trace through the otherwise ergodic phase-space of single-particle chaotic quantum systems.  Many-body analogs have recently been observed in the context of Rydberg atom lattice arrays, though much about their physics remains unclear.  Neither many-body localized nor exactly integrable, scar states are nonetheless long-lived and as such may be of use in storing information.  We prepare the hierarchy (in energy) of scar states by quenching the sign of the short-range interactions of a TG gas from positive to negative. This maps the wavefunction of the strongly repulsive TG gas onto that of a strongly attractive `super'-TG state.  We then tune the strength of the attractive interaction from strong to weak, which realizes excited states of increasing energy.  Measurements of the gas stiffness (inverse compressibility) and energy density identify the states.  The use of a quantum holonomy topologically pumps the gas to ever higher energy quantum many-body scar states.  Our work constitutes the first use of a quantum holonomy for topological pumping into scar states and is enabled by the first use of dipolar (dysprosium) atoms in 1D for exploring strongly correlated quantum gases.
