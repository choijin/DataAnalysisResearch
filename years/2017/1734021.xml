<AbstractNarration>The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on R/V Atlantis, a 274' general purpose Global vessel operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The vessel is owned by the U.S. Navy, has state-of-the-art instrumentation and supports all disciplines of oceanographic research. The Global vessel and can accommodate a scientific party of up to 32 persons for as many as 60 days. The vessel works in all the world's oceans supporting science funded primarily by U.S government agencies. R/V Atlantis is specifically outfitted for launching and servicing Alvin, the human occupied submersible as well as other vehicles of the National Deep Submergence Facility (NDSF). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2016, R/V Atlantis completed 279 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 60% of the total sailing schedule (167 days). In 2017, Atlantis is scheduled for 300 days with NSF accounting for 231 of those or 73%. R/V Armstrong is scheduled for 237 days, 30% of which (72 days) are for NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) -80C Ultra-Low Upright Freezer $8,320&lt;br/&gt;2) Ultra-low Chest Freezer (2 ea) $11,160&lt;br/&gt;       $19,480</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2017, NSF awarded WHOI a grant to purchase  two ultra-low temperature (-80 degrees C) freezers to supplement the aging and limited capacity of the existing freezers. The request funded  both an upright, front loading, 11.8 cubic-foot Panasonic model MDF-U33V-PA and two smaller, top loading, 3 cubic foot Panasonic model MDF-C8V1-PA.  The Intellectual Merit associated with this proposal is that the equipment awarded here for shared-use support of  projects and is intended to insure sufficient access to the resources necessary to complete the approved research. The Broader Impact of this proposal depends upon the specific research conducted but can include educational and public outreach efforts.  Typically, the following broad impact benefits are derived from the availability of our shared-use instrumentation:  Enhancement of capabilities aboard our vessels available for both the primary research goals and the education of students on-board and, in some cases, participating electronically.  Improved research support infrastructure to better allow the research results to be used in formats understandable and useful to non-scientists for both education and policy formation by Federal, State and local agencies. Increased acquisition and dissemination of data and general interest materials for use in schools at all levels, museums and traveling science exhibits. Enhanced ship-to-shore communications capabilities allowing alternate means for participating and benefiting from cruise activities.  This includes routine transmission of meteorological data for use in weather forecasting. Maintaining the level of technology necessary to allow the use of the shipboard laboratory and data systems by persons with disabilities.
