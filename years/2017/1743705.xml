<AbstractNarration>This proposal supports 15-20 students for their travel to attend the 2017 Annual International Cryptology Conference (CRYPTO), sponsored by IACR (International Association of Cryptologic Research), in cooperation with the Computer Science Department of the University of California, Santa Barbara. CRYPTO is a highly selective conference in cryptography, attracting students, researchers and industry specialists from all over the world. The scope of research papers accepted to CRYPTO range from the theoretical foundations of cryptology to application and implementation of cryptographic schemes. As such, it fits closely with the goals of NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which include applied cryptography and implementation of cryptographic schemes.</AbstractNarration>
