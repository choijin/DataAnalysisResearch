<AbstractNarration>A fundamental challenge faced in fluid dynamics is that the basic governing equations do not account for persistent, randomly driven fluctuations that arise due to uncertainties in modeling from empirical, numerical and physical sources. In view of the wide progress made in computation and given the ubiquity of probabilistic methods in applications there is a clear need to better understand the numerical and analytical underpinnings of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) in general and in relation to the basic equations of fluid dynamics. This project seeks to further the development of numerical and analytical tools for SPDEs with a view towards novel applications in climate and weather modeling and for the study of turbulence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will focus in particular on three emerging areas of nonlinear SPDEs.  Firstly we will address the theory of invariant measures and statistically steady states. In particular we will develop tools to study inviscid limits in the class of invariant measures for the Navier-Stokes equations and for related  models arising in geophysical and turbulence applications. We will also identify and characterize noise regimes leading to ergodic and mixing properties for some previously unaddressed classes of nonlinear SPDEs.  A second portion of the project will develop parameter estimation and inverse modeling techniques for noisy nonlinear PDEs.  The third portion of the project is devoted to the numerical analysis of nonlinear SPDEs and to developing related analytical tools needed for this purpose.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project, a continuation of NSF-DMS-1313272, developed analytical and numerical foundations for the nonlinear partial differential equations of fluid mechanics driven by random fluctuations or subject to noisy observation.  While it has long been appreciated that probabilistic perspectives and methodologies are essential in fluid mechanics, recent mathematical and computational developments are facilitating continued exciting progress in this topic. Moreover this work hold significant potential for applications in Turbulence and in Geophysical flows.  Specifically the work supported by this grant concentrated on three interconnected directions of research  1) We developed methods to identify and characterize the robust observability of statistically steady states (invariant measures) in some classes of stochastic models in fluid dynamics.  In particular our work analyzed statistically steady states in the stochastic Korteweg&ndash;de Vries (sKdV) equation and in a stochastic version of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations.  The research on the sKdV equation was carried out in collaboration with the PIs postdoctoral fellow.  2) We considered parameter dependence problems.  During the period of the grant our main focus was on stochastic models in convection where we analyzed the infinite prandtl limit, an asymptotic of interest in mantle convection as well as considered the effect of Gaussian noise on the onset of instability.  3) We developed a Bayesian setting to estimate an unknown background flow mixing a passive scalar which is observed sparsely and subject to a degree of observational noise.  We developed computational methods to sample from the resulting Bayesian measures of uncertainty as well as analytical tools concerning consistency for this problem.  This work was carried out in collaboration with the PIs Ph.D student.          Last Modified: 07/04/2018       Submitted by: Nathan E Glatt-Holtz]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
