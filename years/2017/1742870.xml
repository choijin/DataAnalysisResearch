<AbstractNarration>1742869/ 1742870&lt;br/&gt;Huq; Leddy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With increased water scarcity, it is critical that safe water supplies be maintained, including wastewater for environmental discharge or reuse. Currently microbial (bacterial and viral) water quality is measured using standard microbiological and biotechnological culture methods to establish safe water quality. This proposed EAGER is transformative as the study aims to explore the use of a newly developed detailed and sensitive metagenomic sequence analysis to understand and identify microbial communities for accurate determination of biological water quality in water, wastewater, biofilms, and water reuse systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the proposed metagenomic analysis system, microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, will be accurately identified to species and strains. Additionally, antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity properties are also identified to evaluate diversity and abundance of the genes and microorganisms in-situ. By assessing the microbial communities and comparing their composition, a better understanding of the microbial communities and their ecology is developed to provide improved methods for assessing microbial water quality for indirect potable reuse and direct potable reuse. Culture-dependent methods and indicator microorganism measurements have proven to be slow and biased because they do not represent all species, often not even the dominant species present during advanced water and wastewater treatment. Molecular techniques have provided insights into microbial community structure; however, these methods are seriously limited because they target single microorganisms that are often the less dominant species. Therefore, with metagenomic analysis using next generation sequencing, accurate resolution of the microbial communities and their diversity is achieved, resulting in significant benefits for environmental and public health applications. Metagenomic whole DNA sequencing involves shearing all DNA in a sample that is then sequenced by next generation sequencing. Next generation sequencing is non-discriminatory, identifying all organisms, even the underrepresented, while identifying functional and resistant genes, pathogenicity, and providing taxonomic structure based on phylogenetic trees, all in a single analysis and within approximately one day. Therefore, next generation sequencing provides a more complete identification, with greater resolution of the microbial community and its ecology. The results from this study have the potential of defining microbial communities in water systems at each step of the process and will transform the ability to understand and design better indicators, validate surrogates, and also define sustainable microbial communities beneficial for drinking water and water reuse. The long term societal impact will be paramount as the proposed project will yield a more defined microbial community structure for water quality and safe water supplies and will demonstrate the utility of this important, emerging approach for the water and water reuse industry. During the course of this study, a doctoral student will gain fundamental and applied knowledge in the area of bioinformatics and water reuse that encompasses advanced treatment technologies that are employed in water reuse. Student interns will have the opportunity to learn field sampling techniques. This study will establish a good foundation to achieve notable broader impacts for the environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Culture dependent methods, including use of indicator microorganisms to measure water quality, are time consuming, cumbersome, and biased, in large part because of selective growth of microbial species on the bacteriological culture media that are routinely employed.  The microbial growth that is obtained frequently does not represent the dominant microbial species present during various stages of advanced treatment for water reuse.  The introduction of molecular techniques, such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP), quantitative PCR, 16S rRNA clone libraries, etc., have provided insights about individual organisms in the microbial communities.  However, these methods are seriously limited because they target single microbial species and generally detect, with great difficulty, the low-abundance organisms present in wastewater, biofilms and advanced treatment systems that employ advanced technologies such as MF and RO membrane filtration.  In any case, these methods are seriously challenged when employed to assess treatment performance as part of the framework for potable reuse.  Therefore, with high throughput sequencing (HTS), also referred as next-generation sequencing (NGS) combined with innovative bioinformatics tools, a more complete identification, with greater resolution of the microbial communities and their ecology is achieved that will enhance and improve advanced water treatment technologies, public health applications, and the water reuse industry.  Environmental metagenomics is the study of organisms in a microbial community and is achieved by analyzing the total DNA present in an environmental sample.  Whole genome sequencing (WGS) involves shearing all DNA in a water or biofilm sample that is then sequenced by HTS.  Sequencing by HTS is non-discriminatory, identifying all organisms, even the underrepresented, while identifying functional and antibiotic resistant genes and genes coding for pathogenicity, while providing taxonomic structure based on phylogenetic trees, all in a single analysis, even in a complex matrix.  HTS was used in this study to characterize all microorganisms and identify their gene complement (genes coding for antibiotic resistance), and evaluate the diversity and abundance of microorganisms in  communities present in raw water (i.e., source water), product water, treated wastewater, and biofilms using the following technologies and treatment:  granular activated carbon (GAC), ozone, ammonia and chlorination. without the necessity of growing or cultivating any of the organisms.  This study also summarized and compared the microbial communties in the GWRS advanced water purification facility.      The study successfully tested filtration and concentration of 200 liters of secondary treated wastewater and advanced treated recycled water in a short period of time, allowing for rapid sampling across multiple sampling locations at the OCWD AWPF and other sites.  Additional spiking methods were successfully employed to sequence low biomass samples (i.e., ROP, UVP and FPW) to achieve HTS comparative analysis of microbial communities across all samples. Increasing filtration volumes to 200 liters enhanced the limit of detection and provided higher concentrations of DNA for spiking and sequencing ROP, UVP and FPW water samples that contain very low concentrations of microbial biomass due to advanced treatment.  Due to increased detection limits, in this study we were able to identify metagenomes from protists, fungi, bacteria, and ARGs that are present in extremely low concentrations.   Metagenomic HTS analyses successfully identified and compared microbial communities across the AWPF; this was a specific objective of the study. This approach provided previously unavailable insight into the microbial composition of drinking water and wastewater.and accurately identified the reduction and removal of microorganisms, potential pathogens, and genetic elements of interest (such as antibiotic resistance) that may exist across treatment.

Coupling bioinformatic analysis with HTS provided a transformative approach that was not previously available to survey the microorganisms in recycled water and their removal to determine water quality and water safety for water reuse applications.
