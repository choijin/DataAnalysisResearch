<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for the "Table Top Experiments with Skyscraper Reach" workshop. It will be held August 9-11, 2017 on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus. The primary intellectual merit of the conference is in its potential to catalyze collaboration across diverse physics fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is aligned with NSF interests in developing a diverse workforce. On-campus experiments will give under-represented minorities (URMs) and women who are undergraduates hands-on detector experience. These experiments usually have small numbers of collaboration members, hence workshops such as this are particularly important for broadly disseminating the plans for such experiments and recruiting new collaborators. The funding to attend the conference is targeted at junior scientists and the organizers will aim for gender equity and will recruit URMs as participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funds to support travel for attendees to a workshop that will bring together scientists to discuss about 20 new experiments that can be performed with under 20 collaborators and modest funding. Such experiments span a range of techniques from nuclear, particle, and atomic physics, and represent a variety of programs within the NSF physics division. By bringing together experts promoting a unique collection of research programs, using a wide variety of experimental techniques, it is hoped to form a community where ideas can be exchanged and collaborations can be formed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Standard Model of particle physics is currently the most comprehensive and successful theory to describe the myriad interactions between all known fundamental particles in nature. Experimentally, the Standard Model is one of the best-tested theories in physics. It is therefore somewhat disconcerting to note that the Standard Model is "hand-tuned" in that most of its parameters are taken from experiment, rather than from a-priori arguments. The Standard Model is also undeniably incomplete, as it contains no reference to gravity, dark matter, or dark energy. Astrophysical observations indicate that the latter two account for nearly all of the mass-energy in the universe.  There must therefore be other physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), and there are many attempts to describe such physics both theoretically (e.g. string theory and SUSY theories, to name but a few) and experimentally. Experiments searching for BSM physics can be divided into two main categories: (1) experiments operating at the highest available energies (such as at the LHC) with reasonable precision, and (2) experiments operating at considerably lower energies with extremely high precision. The latter often search for subtle effects that are forbidden within the Standard Model, occur due to higher-order effects or loop-diagrams containing new particles, or affect final-state kinematical distributions. These low energy approaches therefore seek tiny deviations from the Standard Model, which may provide the first laboratory evidence for new physics. The two approaches are complementary since such low-energy tests at the "precision frontier" explore regimes of BSM theories that cannot be directly tested at high energies.  Looking towards the future, next-generation (post LHC) energy frontier searches face significant challenges due to the cost and time scale needed to continue to increase the energies accessible at colliders. In addition, the latest results from the LHC do not appear to point to a specific scale above the electroweak scale at which new physics should appear. Therefore, it is timely to consider a broad range of  new approaches to search for hints to the scale and nature of new physics.  A main advantage of low-energy searches lies in their small scale, which implies greater flexibility. Current low-energy experiments span a wide range of ?new physics? searches including searches aimed at understanding the gauge hierarchy problem, identifying the nature of dark matter, searching for the presence of new fundamental interactions, and testing the nature of gravity at microscopic distances.  We promoted this approach by holding a workshop on "Table-top Experiments with Skyscraper Reach." Twenty three talks were given at the workshop covering theory and experiment.  The experiments described spanned a range of techniques from nuclear, particle, and atomic physics, and represent a variety of programs within the NSF physics division, including EPP, PA, NP, AMO-E, and Gravity.   The interactions among the participants were lively and valuable.  In fact, the decision was made to hold another workshop on this topic in 2018.  The purpose of this award was to reduce overall costs so that scientists could attend the workshop.   The support was particularly targeted at the postdocs and junior faculty who attended.  The conference had 46 participants, excluding MIT postdocs / graduate students / UROPs  who were innvited and not asked to register (~ 8 - 10 attendees).   The conference emphasized the work of young scientists, where the breakdown was 26% - Assistant Prof.,  41% - Grad students / postdocs,  26% - Senior  (Assoc. or Full Prof.), 7% - other.    Specifically, this grant supported the travel of 3 were junior faculty, 5 were postdocs or graduate students and 2 undergraduates.
