<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Programs. Professor Jacob Ciszek from Loyola University of Chicago and colleagues have acquired a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) capabilities. A SEM/EDS focuses a beam of electrons at a sample. The electrons interact with sample surfaces to produce a visual image of the material and analyze its chemical elements. These images reveal details of a material's structure such as the size and shape of nanoparticles, proteins or organisms.  Such images can help understand the material's properties. This acquisition enhances the training of graduate and undergraduate students in research at three North Chicago institutions: Loyola University, DePaul University and Columbia College. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This electron microscope enhances research and education at all levels. It impacts research areas which are as diverse as the determination of the spacial location of reaction loci on organic semiconductor surfaces and the analysis of the microarchitecture of lizard toe pads. The instrument is also used in characterizing the diversity of phages, analyzing spatial location of heavy metal environmental bioaccumulation in the retina, and characterizing the small features associated with pharyngeal jaw evolution of goby fish in the Great Lakes. The SEM/EDS capabilities benefits the analysis of self-assembled supramolecular polymers and identification and quantification of carbon fractions from meteorites. The microscope is used in analyzing the morphology of changes associated with thin-films spin coated from electrodes, imaging the mesoscale morphological features of photovoltaic devices, and measuring taxonomic characters used to identify small snails.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant allowed the purchase of a Hitachi SU3500 scanning electron microscope (SEM), capable of imaging nanoscale features on chemical, biological, environmental, and industrial samples, coupled with a Bruker Quantax EDS system for determining the elemental composition of the sample.  This instrument, located at Loyola University Chicago, was acquired to run samples from a consortium of scientists including those at DePaul University and Northeastern Illinois University, all located within 5 miles of each other in the north Chicago region.  The SEM has allowed researchers at these institutions to generate a wide range of novel chemical, biological, and environmental insight, and representative examples follow.   Researchers qualitatively confirmed bacterial surface coverage on transparent electrodes via the SEM.  It was found that bacterial colonies preferentially adhered to the surface when heavy metal ions were present (Ca2+ &gt; Pb2+ &gt; Cd2+ &gt; Mg2+) potentially explaining why metals have been reported to improve microbial fuel cell performance.  Others used the SEM to prove that thin chemically installed coatings on top of organic semiconductors were able to improve adhesion of top contact electrodes in bendable/wearable devices.  One lab has demonstrated that temperature increases currently seen in natural nesting are sufficient to induce neural and craniofacial malformations in Anolis lizards.  Another lab has used the SEM to analyze defects in Drosophila eye imaging discs and have shown these defects correlate heavily with the loss of Drosphila MLR complex function.  In one final example, the SEM was used to image single crystals of tetracene (an organic semiconductor) and directly observed the reaction of this crystal propagating from a single dislocation step (defect site).  This has important implications for understanding the mechanism of surface reactions.  In the three year period of this grant, the instrument has impacted the research of 34 scientists spread over 11 distinct research focuses.  The SEM had additional impacts on the infrastructure at the host university, the educational environment, and greater society in north Chicago and the near-north suburbs.  The grant spurred the department of chemistry and biochemistry to establish a shared instrumentation facility (in order to facilitate both internal and external users of the SEM) leading to a centralized research support infrastructure at the university.  It is a showcase instrument for students, faculty, and administrators, sparking interest in science with its intuitive interface and ability to easily image down to tens of nanometers.  It is utilized by students in the Advanced Inorganic Lab to study nanoparticles and in the Physical Chemistry Lab to study atomically sharp probe tips, and demos are regularly run for campus members ranging from students to deans.  Finally, the instrument is regularly involved in outreach activities (participants outside Loyola).  A prominent example is the Emerging Scientists Workshop where high school students participate in an immersive day of research performing actual experiments that are part of the everyday research at Loyola.
