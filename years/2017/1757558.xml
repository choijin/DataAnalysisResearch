<AbstractNarration>The Tennessee Technological University (TTU) REU Site focuses on providing a summer research experience to a diverse group of ten undergraduate students yearly from a nationwide search. Participating students will perform cutting-edge research in the areas of energy generation (solar, biomass, piezoelectric, generation from salinity gradients, etc.), energy storage/conversion (lithium-ion and lithium-air batteries and formic acid fuel cells) and power grid integration (solar and electric vehicle to grid integration). The proposed collective research topics embody challenges related to renewable energy harvesting, storage and distribution that will impact the quality of life for 21st Century peoples and train future scientists and engineers for careers critical to achieving energy independence of our Nation. The NSF-REU Site is designed with four key broader impacts in mind: (1) Students will be exposed to a wide range of skill-building activities crucial for their careers including good project management practices (daily reporting and reflection), and research problem solving. (2) The program will train top national research talent in key emerging areas of energy, critical for maintaining national preeminence. (3) Participants will learn the importance of outreach by participating in a service learning activity to improve awareness of energy technologies among high-school students and community members. (4) Participation of under-represented groups in engineering research will be increased, thereby contributing to building a more nationally diverse workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tennessee Technological University (TTU) REU Site focuses on introducing cutting-edge energy technologies to aspiring engineers and scientists. Sustainable energy generation and storage strategies are becoming increasingly important as the world's conventional supplies of fossil resources dwindle. Ongoing research advancements in the energy sector are needed if our nation is to obtain energy independence and maintain preeminence in technology and economic leadership. These factors generate a need for trained personnel in energy related research areas. The REU students will perform research on topics related to energy harvesting, (solar energy, biomass pyrolysis, piezoelectric transducers, electricity from salinity gradients) grid integration (solar power generation and transmission, electric vehicle grid integration) and cost-effective storage (lithium-ion and lithium-air rechargeable batteries and direct formic acid fuel cells). A dedicated group of faculty at TTU is working in close collaboration in related energy areas. Our goal is to introduce the interns to immersive research through an "Intelligent Research" course and "Professional Development" workshops along with the proposed research topics. The PI team will also offer lessons on topics pertaining to effective research, attributes of a good researcher, interpreting data and information effectively, efficient recordkeeping, developing reporting and writing skills (diary keeping), effective dissemination of results, qualities of an excellent presenter, ethical decision making and professional growth and development. Field trips to ORNL and industries will also be arranged to expose the students to energy related career opportunities and collaborations. The REU Site will promote and encourage strong participation of women, minorities, veterans and institutions with limited research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
