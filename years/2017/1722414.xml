<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will allow highly cost effective, 2-way communications to be delivered to machinery and ?Things? over extremely long distances using underutilized frequencies and new hardware and software techniques. The resulting technologies will provide 2-way connectivity where cellular does not exist and where other techniques (satellite) are too expensive. This will result in near universal availability of the Internet-of-Things at costs superior to legacy approaches and which are appropriate for applications typically seen in Internet-of-Things. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will create a new system of hardware, software, frequency and operating techniques which will allow underutilized spectrum to be used to deliver 2-way communications to very remote machines and things. The work will involve the creation of a small hardware platform, the creation of embedded software and the modification of existing software and the creation of techniques for detecting and avoiding current users of spectrum, Devices will be created and field deployed to assess efficacy. A number of test routines and procedures will be run during the work to assess how well the technology will work, what performance can be expected, how well operations will fit into existing Regulatory frameworks, what sort of capacity can be expected and what the overall economics of the system will be. We expect to build a significant patent position as we pursue the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Nature of the Project  This project targeted a problem identified by the principals during previous work experience. Specifically, it was identified that very remote sites did not have good (viable, reliable, affordable) communications options.  The work undertaken was to evaluate whether a new system of devices, software, systems and spectrum techniques could solve the problem of affordable, reliable 2-way connections to the remote Internet of Things.    Objectives  Devise a new communication platform (software) to implement the technology required to establish and manage 2 way links using unusual spectrum Evaluate the use of spectrum techniques and blocks not commonly used  Create, develop and test software that uses that spectrum in non-intrusive ways permitting sharing in a un-conflicted way Design and build a proof of concept device  Evaluate the design of the device and the overall support system on the economics of the eventual product / service Test the above on the bench and in the field On the basis of the test, perform an assessment of likely performance and capacity to evaluate the viability of the proposed business   Outcomes  Devised a software and signaling architecture to support the spectrum and loads targeted Built a software platform to implement the architecture developed. Software platform evolved through 6 revisions over the year of the work.  A bench and field hardware platform was constructed using commercially available single board computers and off-the-shelf radio equipment. Using off-the-shelf equipment allowed rapid fielding and testing while the proof-of-concept hardware was in development. The platform steadily improved over the year and validated that a modest size load running on standard hardware could support the algorithms necessary to deploy the proposed system Assessed the spectrum targeted and demonstrated viability of using it for our intended application and market.  A purpose built proof-of-concept hardware device was designed and built to validate that an inexpensive, compact radio could be built which supported the end point requirements.  Both in the hardware work as well as in analytical efforts we assessed the economics of the production end device and the overall system. We proved that a device can be made at a reasonable price point for the markets we are targeting and a service delivered to support such an end device could be offered at an attractive price.  We performed field tests to assess the range and likely performance of our links. Our experience validated the efficacy of the techniques we developed in addressing the needs of our target market including specifically reaching out to very remote devices.   We studied that capacity of the techniques we employed and found that there should be sufficient capacity to build the business forecast.    Our work indicated that the technologies will work, will solve the unmet need we have identified and should do so with satisfying economics. We therefore intend to proceed in our development of the business.       Last Modified: 09/13/2018       Submitted by: Robert S Stevenson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
