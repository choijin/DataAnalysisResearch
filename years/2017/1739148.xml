<AbstractNarration>This travel grant would support US participation in the Gender Summit, a conference focused on discussing and highlighting the importance of women in science with representatives from academic, governments and industry. The conference is designed to advance the research agenda in the following areas : (1) national, regional and global communities as agents of change; (2) evidence-based consensus on the actions needed and the ways of implementing them in specific national or regional contexts; (3)  positive effects of gender balance and gender diversity in research and innovation process; and (4) integrating gender dimensions in research and innovation content to improve the quality of results and outcomes for society?s benefit. The dissemination of research in this venue will contribute to the increased visibility of broaden participation efforts in STEM that will support economic, food and community security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The participation of US experts in women in STEM in this conference will contribute to the successful promotion of solutions to societal problems, e.g. urban quality; human adaptation; food security; transport and mobility to increase the rigor and reproducibility of science and engineering. By ensuring US participation it will ensure engagement in creating regional and global multi-stakeholder communities committed to enhancing scientific excellence; removing gender bias from science knowledge making; advancing gender equality in science structures and practices; and applying understanding of gender issues to advance more sustainable and effective research and innovation.

I organized and moderated a highly successful plenary session entitled "Gender-based Research and Innovation" at Gender Summit 10 (GS10), Tokyo, Japan, May 25. The GS10 theme was "Better Science and Innovation through Gender, Diversity, and Inclusive Engagement": http://www.gender-summit10.jp/ I delivered a paper entitled, Gendered Innovations, for this plenary session. at the Gender Summit 10.  I also delivered a keynote speech at the U.S. Embassy and Tokyo Institute of Technology in Tokyo entitled, Gendered Innovations in Science, Engineering, and Environment, May 24.  In conjunction with the Gender Summit 10, the U.S. Embassy in Japan sponsored a "pre-Summit" event that underscored their support for gender equality in Japan and highlighted the importance of the GS10 meeting. The Embassy?s Science and Public Affairs sections invited me to deliver the keynote address for this pre-summit event. This event highlighted the Gender Summit and continued to emphasize the need to make Japan (and the U.S.) more gender equitable societies. My lecture for the Embassy will be published as Londa Schiebinger, "Gendered Innovations in Natural Science, Medicine, and Engineering," Trends in the Sciences, Vol. 22, No. 11, 2017 (forthcoming). I am told the Japanese title of this journal is: Gakujyutsu no Doko.    These lecture and panel emphasized the need to make Japan (and the US) more gender equitable societies.
