<AbstractNarration>As computer technology becomes increasingly pervasive in all aspects of our lives, it becomes critical for the researchers who develop algorithms to work closely with the domain experts who have a deep understanding of the underlying systems.  The purpose of the NSF Algorithms in the Field (AitF) program is to fund collaborations between theoretical computer scientists with other computing researchers.  Via this meeting, the program is providing an opportunity for its principal investigators to share and discuss their latest advances, demonstrate technical accomplishments, and inform NSF on promising future research directions.  The technical program agenda will highlight the contributions of the participating NSF divisions and address the research themes of the AitF program.  Student researchers will also attend and present their work.  This provides a valuable training opportunity and will contribute to the foundation for an enduring AitF research community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Algorithms in the Field (AitF) project at the NSF was created to encourage "closer collaboration between two groups of researchers: (i) theoretical computer science researchers, who focus on the design and analysis of provably efficient and provably accurate algorithms for various computational models; and (ii) applied researchers including a combination of systems and domain experts (very broadly construed &ndash; including but not limited to researchers in computer architecture, programming languages and systems, computer networks, cyber-physical systems, cyber-human systems, machine learning, database and data analytics, etc.) who focus on the particular design constraints of applications and/or computing devices. Each proposal must have at least one co-PI interested in theoretical computer science and one interested in any of the other areas typically supported by CISE."  An meeting of the pricipal investigators (PI) was conveened in order to facilitate exchange of information between projects and to foster creative thinking about career paths for graduate students engaged in this cross-disciplinary work.  The PI meeting included representatives from 25 of 28 funded projects.  Talks where held on March 30 and 31 of 2017.  Many graduate students were in attendance and many of the presentations were given by graduate students.  In addition, there was a panel where NSF officers discussed the future of AitF at the NSF.       Last Modified: 01/14/2018       Submitted by: Martin Farach-Colton]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
