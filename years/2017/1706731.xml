<AbstractNarration>Recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are effective in curing many diseases, including several types of cancer. The effectiveness of mAbs is closely related to the pattern of decoration of the mAb surface with sugars. This project attempts to understand and ultimately predict how mAbs are decorated with sugars in specific locations on the surface. Such knowledge would fill a significant gap in current industrial practice on mAb quality control and improve the development and manufacturing of such therapeutic molecules. The research team will also provide STEM training opportunities through undergraduate research, recruiting minority students, developing new biomanufacturing courses and lectures, and supporting outreach activities for K-12 students and general public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful control and optimization of mAb glycosylation is currently hindered by limited understanding of how glycosylation responds in vivo to culture perturbations. This research proposes to tackle the challenge by exploring intracellular metabolic mechanisms that link media supplementation in to glycosylation.This should eventually lead to the establishment of  a model to predict glycosylation variation in cultures and accommodate a control methodology via media supplementation. Mechanistic insights into the cellular physiology critical to glycosylation will be achieved by multi-omics approaches. This will pave the way to developing intracellular metabolic models which connect media supplements, intracellular properties, and glycan profiles, an to developing control strategies for glycan attributes via media supplementation. If successful, these results should enable the reproducible generation of fully active monoclonal antibodies, increasing the efficacy and decreasing the cost of this important human health therapy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The research goals are to investigate the intracellular mechanism of post-translation modification and develop a control methodology via media supplementation for biotherapeutics development and production. In pursuit of these goals, the project team has developed in-house analysis method of N-linked glycan and key nucleotide sugars. In addition, to these typical extracellular components being analyzed, the intracellular component counterparts are analyzed within the maturation profile of the Golgi Apparatus and Endoplasmic Reticulum. The team has conducted cell culture to study the glycan profiles over time and under the fed conditions, and established a mechanistic understanding into a mathematical kinetic model by fitting the model with experimental data to different host CHO cell line (CHO-GS, CHO-DG44, CHO-K1) to study the differences amongst the CHO cell line and to create a model that is robust enough for general public use. A major decrease of galactosylation was seen over the course of batch culture. The feed of galactose was found to mitigate the decrease of galactosylation. The feed of manganese was able to increase galactosylation to a substantial level and overcome the decrease of galactosylation over the culture process. Furthermore, with multiple feed of supplementation, nucleotide sugar also increased linearly as the concentration of galactose increases, as well as significant expression level activity of transferase increase; it is an indication via more supplementation can indeed mitigate galactosylation decrease by providing enough substrates. A kinetic based glycosylation model framework has been established with the following items to predict N-linked glycan form profiles:   A dynamic flux balance model describing glucose, glutamine and galactose extracellular medium components to be used as a prediction for the cells? density, mAb production and by-products.   Captured the intracellular nucleotide, precursors of nucleotide sugar donors, of their concentrations in the cytoplasm based on monod kinetics from extracellular medium component conditions.   Major contributing nucleotide sugar donors for glycan synthesis was modeled based on a simplified KEGG network map to account for the consumption/formation from intermediate components/transportation reaction rates from a cell?s cytoplasm to the Golgi.   Generated a dynamic distribution of glycan form accumulation in the Golgi over a cell batch culture time.   Accounted for both extracellular manganese or galactose feed as a dynamic change to a batch culture to model the effects for glycan form distribution.   Three different cell line pertaining to CHO-GS, CHO-DG44, and CHO-K1 with different cell culture conditions were predicted well with the model established for extracellular production, cell growth and by-product formation; demonstrating a robust general model can be utilized for adaptation to different cell line without the modification of the structural network.   The project has provided following opportunities for training and professional; development  The work provided graduate students opportunities to gain understanding in cell culture, concepts of glycosylation and learn lab skills in cell culture and technologies of HPLC, spectrometry, affinity purification and so on.  Skills utilized and improved in using Matlab and gPROMs, including coding mathematical models, parameter estimation and so on.   This training provided a connection from what is theoretically learned in chemical engineering course, such as enzymatic reactions rate laws, to an actual application in research problem.   The project has nurtured a teamwork in a multi-disciplinary environment by bringing together graduate students and post-doc from different specialties.     Based on the project outcomes, the team has submitted three federal research proposals. One proposal based on the progress of the current project that is a continuation of the current project is under preparation, which will be submitted to NSF.  Seven journal articles were published using the research outcomes of the present project.  A poster presentation was received by the ECI Conference, Cell Culture Engineering XVII.
