<AbstractNarration>As part of its overall effort to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. In alignment with these aims, the University of Washington will design and pilot an innovative leadership development program, NextGen Broadening Participation in ISE Professional Learning Program, to develop the leadership capacity of mid-career professionals, primarily from underrepresented groups in STEM, whose work focuses on broadening participation in informal STEM education (ISE). Unlike most existing ISE leadership models, this pathways project will employ a bottom-up, iterative design approach to engage program participants and garner new insights. Formative data and analysis will be used to better understand the broadening participation context, inform the model, and develop strategies and resources necessary to best support a more diversified next generation of ISE leaders. This pilot study is timely and significant. There is currently a substantial dearth of literature on the intersection between broadening participation and mid-level professional leadership development. Likewise, there are few comparable models in the current AISL portfolio. As such, the findings from this pilot will address critical gaps in the AISL portfolio and in the field, at large. It has the potential to markedly transform the capacity and impact of next generation ISE leaders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over an eighteen-month period, this feasibility study will design, implement and test key aspects of the model to determine its potential for short and long term success. Using a competitive application process, twenty ISE mid-career professionals, who work primarily within broadening participation in STEM contexts, will be recruited to participate in the NextGen Broadening Participation in ISE Professional Learning Program. The year-long program includes four core components: (a) 4-day workshop, (b) four online webinars, (c) pilot projects carried out in participants' home institutions, and (d) poster presentations of projects at a national conference. A small cohort of faculty-mentors -- leaders from both research and practice in ISE broadening participation efforts -- will serve as participant mentors and play an integral role in the design and implementation of the program. Evaluative efforts will focus on documenting the efficacy of the design strategies (ex., recruitment, mentorship, social networking), the interests, needs, and professional growth of participants and the implications for broadening participation in STEM. The evaluation will be informed by data collected via interviews, surveys, focus groups, observations, content analyses of discourse, and participant deliverables. Formative and summative external evaluations will be conducted by the Garibay Group.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The One Sky Institute was a pilot professional learning project, funded as an Exploratory Pathways grant through the NSF Advancing Informal Science Education division.  The 18-month program served 20 early/mid-career science communication professionals whose work focused on institutional efforts related to inclusion and equity in science education. The central premise of the program was that building participants' (1) social networks, (2) familiarity with relevant research and theory, and (3) understanding of the history of equity work in the field would help to build, over time, a next generation of more equity-centered leaders for the field of science communication.  Through a competitive application process, twenty individuals were selected to participate in the pilot; eight of the participants were early career (&lt;10 years) and 12 participants had been in the field for 10 or more years. Three quarters identified as BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color). About a third of participants worked in museums; others led outreach efforts for scientific research organizations or worked in or led science programs at community-based afterschool organizations or libraries. All considered themselves educators in informal environments.  Participants attended three multi-day workshops, monthly webinars and working group meetings, and led mini-pilot projects participants carried out at their home institution that explicitly intertwined theory and practice related to equity and inclusion. Participants read and discussed a few key research papers, were mentored by leading experts (both researchers and practitioners) in equity and science learning, and shared the approach and results of their theory-based practical projects at a poster session at a professional conference for science communication experts.  The final evaluation found that participants highly valued their program experience, reporting an expanded understanding of issues of equity and inclusion, greater awareness of relevant research and theory, and enhanced social networks.  (The evaluation, led by Garibay and Associates, has been uploaded to informalscience.org.) Notably, the evaluation documented the institutional marginalization experienced by early/mid-career staff committed to equity, and its negative impacts on those staff members' morale within their workplaces. These feelings of marginalization were compounded by the incremental and under-resourced approaches their institutions took to the work of engaging marginalized communities, which were often the same communities that the participants came from.   It also identified the following set of professional learning needs, particularly for science communication professionals from communities of color:   Support for navigating feelings of marginalization within their institutions. Mentorship from experienced leaders in equity-focused STEM work, particularly from faculty from communities of color. Expanded social networks, particularly in connecting with others also focused on equity and inclusion. Ongoing engagement with research and practice related to equity and inclusion.     Recommendations for future development of a professional learning program for early/mid career science communication professionals focused on equity and inclusion include:    Requiring participants to attend in teams, so that they can have ongoing support in their home institution. Providing more frequent in-person meetings to allow for ongoing and deeper engagement with key concepts. Budgeting sufficient time and funding for faculty mentors to participate in an ongoing manner. Providing more structured program experiences focused on navigating institutional practices related to equity and inclusion. Providing and budgeting for opportunities to create collaborative projects across participants' institutions.             Last Modified: 12/21/2020       Submitted by: Bronwyn Bevan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
