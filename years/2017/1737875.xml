<AbstractNarration>The award supports the attendance of students to the International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC) which is a top-notch technical forum for the presentation of new and exciting advances in the understanding of emerging computer applications and workloads). The conference will be hosted in Seattle, Washington, USA during October 1-3, 2017. Students have much to gain from attending IISWC like learning state-of-the-art methodologies, being exposed to novel techniques, and interacting with senior researchers in their chosen area of expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IISWC is a top-tier conference on workload characterization research with a long and successful history. The conference is often used as the primary venue for interaction between academic and industrial researchers and designers. Historically, the conferences have attracted top research papers from both academia and industry, and many innovations published in the proceedings have been influential in the understanding of emerging applications and computing systems. Increasing the attendance of students in IISWC will expose more students to the exciting developments in the field and in the long run will help to build a broad base of expertise in the field, which will impact both industry and academia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC) is a premier international symposium for the presentation of research results in understanding and characterization of workloads that run on all types of computing systems. This project?s goal was to support students in their research and career pursuits by defraying the costs of attending the 13th IISWC conference from October 1-3, 2017 in Seattle, WA. The motivation behind this project was to encourage and enable the attendance of students who otherwise would not have the opportunity to participate in such a premier conference.   Traditionally, students have attended IISWC as full participants and presenters of the symposium. This year was no exception. Students were welcomed at all technical sessions, breaks, and the banquet. This project achieved two primary direct benefits. First, IISWC was further strengthened as a premier venue in its field as a result of the greater attendance by students working on the various aspects of workload characterization. Second, students benefited from the opportunity to interact with their peers and experts in the field, and from establishing connections that will help their professional careers. Students met and mingled with professors and researchers throughout the duration of the conference and were exposed to new research ideas at the technical sessions and keynotes.   Of the students that attended the conference, 22 were partially or fully reimbursed for the costs of traveling to and/or attending IISWC'17.  Among the student attendees that received travel grants, a number belong to minorities and groups traditionally underrepresented in Computer Science (including 6 female students, two Hispanic students, and one identifying as LGBT).  One of the travel grant awardees presented a tutorial at the conference and 12 presented their papers at the technical sessions.  As a condition of the travel award, the students were required to submit a brief essay on their experience.  All award recipients were confirmed to be full-time students by their graduate advisers and were reimbursed for their expenses according to the NSF guidelines by the Research Foundation at Stony Brook University.  Overall, the project was a success, with IISWC 2017 matching the previous record of 31 student attendees.  More broadly, this project has additional indirect impacts. Exposing and encouraging student participation (especially women and underrepresented minority groups) in IISWC-focused areas is critical to exposing the next generation of researchers to the current state-of-the-art. Such exposure is critical for inspiring students to carry forward research in these areas. The research results presented at the symposium, as well as the emphasis on interaction between academic researchers and industrial designers, is carried back by attendees to their home institutions, resulting in heightened awareness and interests in characterizing and understanding modern computer applications in commercial and scientific computing.
