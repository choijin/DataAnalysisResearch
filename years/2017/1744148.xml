<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project would be in the development of a new approach to anti-fouling that can be used synergistically with other existing approaches. Surface fouling is encountered in a vast range of situations: biofouling of ships, biofouling of medical implant devices, thrombus formation on blood-contacting surfaces, mineral scale formation, and a variety of foulants in the food and chemicals industries. Surface fouling has high costs ranging from increased fuel cost in ships, poorer heat exchange in the chemical industry, infection or repeated surgery in the medical contexts, and increased equipment costs in water treatment. The technology offers wide-ranging benefits to society ranging from reduced infection of implanted medical devices, reduced operating costs in membrane filtration, and longer equipment life in the chemical industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project seeks to evaluate the commercial potential of a new approach to anti-fouling surfaces. The fundamental principle underlying the strategy is to focus mechanical stress to the interface between the foulant and the surface, and thereby force deadhesion of the foulant. Successful in vitro experiments have been conducted showing that this principle can greatly reduce the fouling of surfaces placed in contact with blood or with platelet-enriched plasma. These results suggest that the principle can be applied regardless of the chemical nature of the surface.  The anti-fouling principle is purely mechanical and therefore may be used in conjunction with chemical modification approaches, such as fluorination. The technology is presently being evaluated with other foulants in a non-medical context, for instance in algal growth or mineral scale formation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Fouling of surfaces in contact with fluids is ubiquitous in the chemical and food industries, medical sector, and marine industries. Most current technologies for anti-fouling surfaces rely on chemical modification to prevent adhesion of the foulant. This I-Corps grant was awarded to gauge commercial viability of a new, and purely mechanical, approach to anti-fouling. Early during the I-Corps Lean Launchpad curriculum, we narrowed down to applications where surfaces placed in contact with blood experience fouling, first due to platelet deposition and eventually to thrombus formation. We conducted 100 interviews across a broad range: surgeons, radiologists, nephrologists, operating room nurses, purchasing managers, device vendors, experts on the FDA approval process, and contract manufacturers of medical device. Based on these interviews, we concluded that the field of vascular prostheses - synthetic grafts for vascular repair, vascular shunts used for emergency medicine, or arteriovenous grafts used by diabetic patients - could support a viable business model. In particular, if our technology can extend duration for which such prostheses remain open to blood flow, the corresponding devices would have an excellent chance to become commercially successful. Furthermore these interviews also highlighted the critical need to keep device costs low since the medical market is becoming increasingly price-sensitive. With this information, our team has now started a company, Aruga LLC, to commercialize vascular grafts. We have already obtained limited funding, and are seeking more funding, via SBIR or STTR grants, private investment, or through military research programs, to continue research and business development.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/01/2019<br>      Modified by: Sachin&nbsp;S&nbsp;Velankar</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
