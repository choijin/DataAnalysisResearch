<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award supports the acquisition of a state-of-the-art nanoindentation system to catalyze fundamental research leading to more resilient infrastructure, novel materials, advances in medical treatment and energy production, and enhanced vehicle and aircraft design.  Nanoindentation is an important tool for measuring mechanics at a small scale; this instrumentation has nanomechanical characterization capabilities that are not available at the University of Washington (UW) or the Pacific Northwest. It will enable multidisciplinary research, education and outreach at the UW and partner schools. More than 10 research associates and 50 graduate researchers will be trained on the instrument annually, greatly expanding the next generation of researchers with nanomechanical characterization experience. The system will facilitate educational programs at four regional partner institutions and public outreach events in the annual "Meet the Mammals" family day at the Burke Museum and "Engineering Discovery Days" of the UW College of Engineering. These activities enhance public understanding and help to attract the next generation to careers in science, technology, engineering and math.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hysitron TI 980 Triboindenter, with an ultra-low noise floor down to 1 nN force and 0.01 nm displacement, is equipped with a powerful multi-head base capable of seamlessly operating multiple measurement modes such as nanoindentation, nanoscratch, and nanowear. Complemented with high temperature, high/low load, conductive and submerged indentation options, the system will enable researchers to pursue advanced knowledge from the nano and molecular levels in energy and health, to the micro and larger scales in aerospace and infrastructure renewal. It will enable engineers to study biological, cementitious and granulated materials, composites, metals and polymers, and medical, health science and dental researchers to investigate the biomechanics of cells, tissues to whole organs. It will facilitate fundamental understanding in pulsed-laser strengthening of metallic multi-layers, the properties of nanohelical ferromagnetic robotic actuators, and the mechanical performance of semiconducting organic polymers, high temperature composites, and polymer composite sensors. The instrument will also enable studies aimed at extending the durability of next-generation li-ion battery electrode materials. Lastly, new research will be possible regarding strategies for age-related degradation of hard tissues, for improving adhesive bonds to hard tissues, and for remineralizing hard tissues assisted by amelogenin-derived peptides. The system will become a major regional resource to researchers at the University of Washington and the greater Pacific Northwest.</AbstractNarration>
