<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a new disruptive approach to enable the digital transformation of US industrial infrastructure through extreme low latency, highly reliable and secure wireless networks. The proposal aligns closely with U.S. government programs such as Manufacturing USA and the National Robotics Initiative. The World Economic Forum reported recently that manufacturing has been immensely important to the prosperity of nations. This has never been more true than right now as countries compete to make huge investments in the digital transformation process of their manufacturing firms. The innovation provides significant advancement that is expected to boost U.S. worker productivity, advance wireless innovation and increase cost savings and business agility. The Industrial Internet of Things drives new investment in automated factories, industrial digital networks and integration with real-time edge computing. Data expansion at the edge of today's networks are new challenges for industrial firms that seek to deploy flexible and economically viable digital infrastructure. The company provides an innovative solution that enables wireless edge computing. Instead of expensive and inflexible wired networks, this new technology unlocks the full potential of wireless sensor networks for automation and control systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will demonstrate the company's concept of ultra-secure, highly reliable, time-sensitive/synchronized wireless protocol for Industrial IoT markets. The novel system design is a general purpose, extremely low latency, wireless communications link that supports real-time connection to industrial devices. The company's technology operates chaos-based spread spectrum communications links, functional chaos-based IIoT sub-nets with anticipated scalability of a plurality of sub-nets operating within unlicensed bands. Enabling an extreme precision time synchronization is critical to industrial systems and network applications in time-sensitive edge computing networks. To date, standard access technologies such as Ethernet are not deterministic and clock synchronization protocols are fundamentally limited by the characteristics of packet switching or efficient access to reliable clocks. In particular, legacy network's jitter, packet buffering and scheduling in switches and network stack overheads add non-deterministic variances to the round trip time, which must be accurately measured to synchronize clocks. This proposal is for a wireless-based synchronization technology that uses more granular timing mechanisms to achieve nanosecond precision. The company introduces a clock synchronization protocol that uses wireless chaotic waveforms that connects to network devices for decentralized clock synchronization. This eliminates the need for wires and non-deterministic elements in clock synchronization protocols.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Chaos Prime has completed research on a new wireless waveform technology for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) supported by a NSF Small Business Innovation Research Phase I. Grant. The objective was to proof a system for highly reliable and deterministic wireless IIoT connectivity using enhanced physical layer chaotic waveforms. During the funding period the company has conducted feasibility studies, simulations and prototyping work and discussed use case requirements with leading industrial firms.  FINDINGS - The US Manufacturing market continues to grow driven by industrial firms? need to connect assets, to automate key parts of its operations and to introduce new robotic/autonomous systems. Industrial OEMs and machine builders are focused on improving customer experience, increasing productivity and driving up overall equipment effectiveness through increased use of E/E solutions.  Industrial networking technologies have been developed in the past almost specifically designed for single use cases. A variety of protocols and technologies are available to connect devices or machines via Fieldbus and Industrial Ethernet (IE), but only very few wireless technologies (e.g. ISA100) are available. These systems provide a closed E/E design with PHY+MAC+Software layer technologies, some even providing data management or application integration.  During the research it was recognized that physical-layer feature requirements could not be developed independent of designing a system that addresses specific customer demand/use cases of a wireless technology and balances features such as latency, power, range and error rates.  Chaos Prime received detailed feedback throughout its customer dialog that a comprehensive industrial-grade E/E solution is required for the IIoT managing complex environments and addressing real business issues.  Current industrial automation and control solutions are limited to inflexible and reactive services based on small sets of asset data. New electronics and machine learning capabilities are creating demand for new applications such as Predictive Maintenance, Remote Diagnostics and Condition Monitoring solutions.  RESULTS - Chaos Prime has successfully completed its research of a chaotic-inspired wireless system: The novel IIoT-based system is a general purpose, extremely low latency, wireless communications link that supports real-time connection to virtually any combination of embedded industrial sensors, actuators, or other devices.  Wireless physical layer design and prototype development completed demonstrating unique features such as ultra-low latency, high reliable wireless connectivity, robust signal for industrial environments Successful customer lab testing of chaotic wireless technology in heavy interference impacted machine equipment settings Collection and validation of concrete customer use cases and related technical requirements for later product design through lead customer engagements   The research project has demonstrated that chaotic waveform technologies have superior properties and metrics compared with today?s wireless technologies. Chaos Prime?s invention is highly disruptive and provides significant potential advancement that could boost U.S. worker productivity and cost savings for the transforming the overall U.S. economy. The new technology perfectly supports US initiatives such as Manufacturing USA and the National Robotics Initiative.  Chaos Prime has identified an increasing industry demand of highly adaptable connected systems throughout its research that range from unsupervised systems up to fully autonomous systems. The number of industrial and collaborative robots in U.S. manufacturing is growing at a high CAGR over the next 5-7 years, which all have to be connected and integrated into legacy environments and new application domains.  A robust industrial-grade E/E platform technology is required, which enables a reliable connectivity, management of data and the inter-process communication between smart sensors and machine learning systems.
