<AbstractNarration>This NSF SBIR Phase I project takes a unique holistic approach to both tumor imaging and cancer drug delivery.  This approach harnesses cancer cell proteins already in the body to allow selective delivery of tumor imaging agents or cancer-killing drugs to, and into, cancer cells.  By choosing cancer-specific targeting proteins, the drugs will be transported primarily into cancer cells and undesirable off-target enrichment will be diminished.  The goal is to mitigate drug uptake in non-cancerous fast-growing cells like; heart cells, bone marrow, skin or hair follicles.  Treated patients will benefit from improved effectiveness of their cancer therapies.  Such selective delivery should permit lower dosages of drug to be administered while also lowering the risks of unwanted, problematic side-effects. This cost-effective approach is well supported by the NSF?s core mission for the technical development of innovative drug delivery systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It remains challenging to provide sensitive tumor diagnosis and near-simultaneous assessments of response to cancer treatments in treated individuals.  Of all the standard monitoring modalities, radiographic examination has been the most widely used to measure treatment response.  However, some studies suggest up to 10-40% of cancers may not be measurable by currently available technologies.  Various delivery approaches have been used to take advantage of endogenous molecules to transport imaging agents or drugs with increased specificity into cancer cells.  Most of these approaches utilize macromolecular ligands or cell surface receptor binding approaches.  This proposal takes a mechanistically innovative small-molecule approach.  By harnessing the activities of endogenous inflammatory proteins produced in abundance by cancer cells and by cells within the tumor micro-environment, small molecule cancer drugs can be transported with efficiency to the site of their intended effect.  Selective and accurate placement of a chemically-related diagnostic agent into cancer cells should allow a cost-effective, more personalized and exceedingly sensitive view of treatment response.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Despite great progress in cancer therapeutics over the last decade, current cancer drugs may still cause harm and great distress to significant percentages of treated individuals. People treated for cancer should not lose their hair when there are no cancerous cells in their hair follicles.  Children treated for cancer should not suffer lasting heart damage when there are no cancerous cells in their hearts. Individuals undergoing cancer treatment should not suffer from painful and disfiguring whole-body rashes, peripheral nerve damage, nor GI problems. We need cancer therapies that target cancer cells with more precision so healthy cells remain healthy during an individual?s cancer treatment. Ideally, cancer therapies would not cause harm to healthy cells.  With the assistance of our NSF Phase I SBIR grant, RJSBIO, Inc. (Seattle, WA) is creating a new way of directing chemotherapeutics to cancer cells while decreasing the unwanted side effects on normal cells.  At RJSBIO we make cancer drugs that are more capable of specifically delivering themselves to, and into, cancer cells.  We have focused our NSF funded research efforts on engraving a tumor delivery functional element within small molecules as a requisite component of future cancer drugs and tumor diagnostic agents.  Adding these elements to cancer drugs results in more precise and specific delivery into cancer cells.  With our current NSF funding, we have created fully synthetic, non-peptide, small-molecule tumor imaging agents.  These small molecules incorporate our delivery elements and radioactive tracers which allow us to track compound localization within tumor bearing mice.  We have demonstrated a 1.7 fold enrichment of our addressed molecule in tumors representing lung cancers vs the parental non-addressed molecule (Fig. 1).  More cancer drug on point within a tumor means less drug in the wrong place. Giving cancer drugs instructions on where they need to go is a good thing.  Broader Impacts:   1) The primary impact of our proposal is to provide a cost-effective, broadly applicable platform technology for the rapid development of improved cancer diagnostic agents and more precise cancer drugs.  2) RJSBio?s fully-synthetic, small-molecule, approach represents a paradigm shift by targeting cancer promoting pathways and manipulating these paths like Trojan horses to instead deliver tumor imaging agents and cancer drugs.  3) By pairing companion imaging agents with RJSBIO?s delivered cancer drugs, it will be possible to provide a more accurate picture of a cancer patient?s disease status, treatment options, and prognosis.  4) The long-term impact of this technology is expected to extend well beyond the bounds of cancer and will likely reach across into other indications, in particular inflammation.  5) More accurate cancer drugs should be more predictable in the clinic.  This predictably should dramatically reduce the costs of bringing new cancer drugs to the market.     We are most grateful to the NSF for their assistance.
