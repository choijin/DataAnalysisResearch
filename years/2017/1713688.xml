<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this technology is to advance the performance of the common bandage with low-cost production of a bandage that actively facilitates wound healing. The typical bandage wound dressing provides physical protection, but does not actively participate in wound healing. Additives that might actively facilitate wound healing can add prohibitive cost to an inexpensive device. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), are sulfated polysaccharides that are ubiquitously present in the extracellular matrix of mammals. GAGs have been shown to facilitate wound healing, but because of the high cost of animal extraction, they are not used in low cost wound healing applications. The proposed technology utilizes sulfated cellulose as low cost GAG-mimics. The low cost of these mimics allows them to be used in bandages that will reduce healing time and reduce scaring.  These GAG-mimics may also be useful in reducing the costs of more complex devices such as dermal regenerations, constructs for burn wounds, and dressings for decubitus ulcers, and diabetic wounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-CORPS project is based on results of research designed to investigate the use of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) mimics in the development of tissue engineering scaffolds as extracellular matrix (ECM) mimics for cartilage regeneration. GAGs are present in nearly every tissue in the body, and they play an important role in stabilizing important cell signaling proteins and presenting those signal molecules to cell receptors. Sulfated cellulose based GAG mimics were identified based on the similarity in molecular structure between the native GAGs and the sulfated cellulose. It was demonstrated that the biological activity of sulfated cellulose mimicked the biological activity of native GAGs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of our project was to explore the commercialization potential for the Glycosaminoglycan mimics we developed in the lab. We had already shown that these materials could enhance wound healing. With this grant we developed a business model canvas which outlined our key hypotheses on how we could commercialize these materials. Through our customer discovery exercises, we found that our initial customer hypothesis , use by end users, was not valid. A more viable customer base which better fit the value propositions for our product were surgeons who were making larger (greater than 7 centimeter) incisions. We also found that our proposed additive could be used in more complex wound closure procedures such as dermal regeneration constructs. With the I-Corps program we were able to better formulate &nbsp;our potential marketing strategies. We became better acquanted with the process of new product development. Through interviews with potential customers, competitiors, and other market participants, we also learned about the FDA regulatory pathway that might be required for our proposed product. In addition, we were able to secure important contacts in a variety of biomedical companies who were able to explain the milestones we would have to achieve to gain traction with them. Ultimately we plan to continue to develop the data to meet the milestones and re-engage with the companies that expressed interest in the outcome of the development of our research.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/22/2017<br>      Modified by: Michael&nbsp;Ehrlich</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
