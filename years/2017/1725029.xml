<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be a transformative approach at fabricating novel smart multi-functional nanostructures that meet the needs of next generation advanced materials by providing a process that is green, cheap, fast, and versatile.  This approach to nanostructure synthesis has applications in biotechnology, energy and tooling, among others.  For example, in the healthcare field each year nearly one million people in the United States suffer from an infection related to medical implants. Additionally, implants in bone can loosen over their lifetime due to poor tissue integration, resulting in inflammation and pain, and possibly requiring additional surgeries. These issues can potentially be solved through the synthesis of inherently anti-bacterial biomaterial surfaces that enhance biological tissue integration.  The commercialization of this technology has the potential to redefine industrial material design paradigms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based around a form of plasma processing of materials called Directed Irradiation Synthesis (DIS) and Directed Plasma Nanosynthesis (DPNS).  This technology is able to change the inherent properties of a material surface by creating customized nanoscale topographies (pores, rods, cones, ripples, etc.) and chemistries (stoichiometry, oxidation state, etc.) by exposing the surface to a controlled flux of ions, electrons, and neutral particles with controlled mass, momentum, and fluence, among other conditions.  This allows a new level of fidelity with atom-by-atom control using self-organized arrangement in irradiated surfaces that is dominated by ion-induced erosion and surface diffusion.  This technology will transform the synthesis and design of nano-structured systems by leveraging the composition-dependent mechanisms that drive self-organization on micro- and nano-structures to enable tunability and control of their biological properties.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Editekk team including Jean Paul Allain (PI), Edwin Moore (IM), Zachariah  Koyn and Dongyan Chen (Co-ELs) have been successful in the completion of the NSF I-Corps Program.  Editekk?s participation in the NSF National I-Corps program included 108 interviews with a variety of players in the spine implant value chain. The interviews included implant manufactures, hospitals, purchasing administrators, surgeons, insurance companies, key opinion leaders, and surface coating companies.  After the completion of the I-Corps program we have a better understanding of our target customers and their main pain points.     Initially, the team had the assumption that Editekk would provide a surface modification process for all biomedical implant manufacturers to reduce infection and biofilm formation without any cost increase. After 108 interviews we realized that most manufacturers are not focused on reducing the already low infection rates that occur during implant placement due to the significant regulatory hurdle in making such a claim.  However, we found that the rate of implant-bone integration and its stability is a significant pain point for spine implant manufacturers.  Currently, spine implant materials that are surface treated with some type of roughening method (e.g. acid etching, grit blasting, or spin coating) to increase bone integration suffer from limited control of the body?s immuno-response to the implant. Coatings that mimic bone, such as plasma-sprayed HA (hydroxyapatite), have produced increased bone integration, but sometimes delaminate in a patient?s body, causing inflammation that could loosen the device. This represents a critical need in the spinal implant space for tighter and faster bone fixation in clinically-relevant materials (e.g. Ti) and higher-fidelity control of the patient?s immuno-response to implants. Through our interviews we believe we found a market fit for our technology.  Our patented atomic-scale additive plasma nano-manufacturing process to tailor enhanced surface topographies can speed up mineralization of implant materials and therefore enhance bone tissue growth and fixation.  We also found that lead surgeons and KOLs have a significant impact on which technologies companies pursue and which medical devices other doctors use. Most implant manufacturers follow KOLs? advice concerning technology innovation trends. This demonstrated that we need to establish a strategic relationship with KOLs in order to target implant manufacturers as customers.     Currently, the team is generating more data in the area of tissue integration, including both in vitro experiments and initial in vivo testing. We are also working to establish a Quality Assurance system for the process and a regulatory strategy.  Since the end of the program we have also prepared and begun talking to potential investors and customers openly about the capabilities of our technology.  Several groups have expressed interest on both fronts and this is helping provide a direction for our internal development.
