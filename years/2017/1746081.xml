<AbstractNarration>1745941 (Phelan)/1746081 (Hu). This workshop will address the science and engineering research questions motivated by designing and operating buildings for both energy efficiency as well as for the health of the occupants. A diversity of researchers from both the buildings and the public health R&amp;D communities will be brought together to determine optimal approaches for integrating health and energy efficiency to promote the development of new human-centered design paradigms and building technologies. Other participating federal agencies include the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the US Department of Energy (DOE). The industry partners include the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and the American Institute of Architects (AIA). The workshop will leverage a two-year DOE project that created a vision for buildings in 100 years, and the ongoing "Health in Buildings Roundtable" organized by NIH and CDC. The workshop will be hosted by NIH at the Natcher Conference Center in Bethesda, MD, in July, 2018. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. population spends perhaps 87% of their time inside buildings, and consequently it is reasonable to assume that building environments have a correspondingly large impact on occupant health. At the same time, the construction and operation of buildings has a large environmental impact: globally, buildings are responsible for approximately one third of primary energy consumption, and one third of greenhouse gas emissions. In the USA, building energy costs in 2016 were ~$408B annually, while annual healthcare costs were ~$3.2T in 2015. Additionally, potential worker productivity gains from improved indoor environments have been estimated at up to ~$230B (in 2016 dollars). Clearly, improving building sustainability while at the same time improving health outcomes would have significant economic impacts. Furthermore, by bringing together researchers from the typically separate fields of sustainable buildings and public health, the organizers are targeting to influence the education of future researchers by broadening their perspectives to consider these diverse but interrelated fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  The NSF Workshop on Health In Buildings For Today And Tomorrow was held on July 19-20, 2018 in Bethesda, MD. Its objective was to address the science and engineering research questions motivated by designing and operating buildings for both energy efficiency as well as for the health of the occupants. We bruoght together a variety of researchers from both the buildings and the public health R&amp;D communities to determine optimal approaches for integrating health and energy efficiency to promote the development of new human-centered design paradigms and building technologies.  Other participating federal agencies included the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the US Department of Energy (DOE). The industry partners include the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and the American Institute of Architects (AIA). The workshop leveraged a two-year DOE project that created a vision for buildings in 100 years, and the ongoing "Health in Buildings Roundtable" organized by NIH and CDC.   The workshop was motivated by the continuing growth of inquiry of relationship between "green" or sustainable buildings and "healthy" buildings. On the one hand, for example, reductions in air infiltration rates caused by energy efficiency measures that tighten building envelopes without adequate consideration for appropriate ventilation may lead to "sick" buildings.  On the other hand, studies have shown a positive correlation between several other building energy efficiency measures and occupants' health and productivity.  Such energy efficiency measures with noted positive impacts on human health and productivity include energy-efficient lighting, outside air economizers, nighttime precooling using outside air, efficient windows, etc. Therefore, the fundamental question that the proposed workshop seeks to address is this: can buildings be designed and operated sustainably, while at the same time providing superior health and productivity benefits for their occupants?  MAIN OUTCOMES  The detailed Workshop Program is provided in Section 2 and may also be found at  https://hibr.nih.gov/conference/2018-hibr-conference. All presentations were recorded and can be accessed from this web site: https://videocast.nih.gov/summary.asp?Live=28238&amp;bhcp=1  The major outcome of the Workshop is the current report and the special issue based that will be published in 2019 by Building and Environment, which is based on panel discussion and individual breakout session.     RECOMMENDATIONS  An overarching recommendation is for the National Science Foundation to support fundamental and applied research in new areas and research directions that directly affect healthy buildings and built environment and, more broadly, Healthy and Sustainable Built Environment. It is important to recognize the multi-disciplinary nature of this research and the need to promote and facilitate the collaboration of researchers from all relevant disciplines. At the same time,  it is important to realize that such research activities must take place in an environment that brings together all the Healthy Building stakeholders, including community governments and leaders; academic researchers who can develop and test new technologies, economic mechanisms, and policies; and private industry which is best suited for the deployment of specific technology-based solutions.     RESEARCH DIRECTIONS     Can buildings be sustainable and healthy at the same time? Can energy-efficient design features such as daylighting, increased thermal mass to minimize temperature fluctuations, and windows with high thermal resistance and minimal glare also enhance occupant health?     The availability of data motivates data-driven approaches for resource allocation at all levels of the Smart City infrastructure. Therefore, research is necessary to develop such data-driven resource allocation mechanisms.   Indoor environmental conditions (temperature, relative humidity, fresh air) are controlled based largely on comfort conditions, but are those the healthiest conditions for the building occupants?  Case studies have shown the ?soft? benefits (such as well-being and productivity) of green, efficient buildings, however, a consistent way to measure the long-term health outcomes has not yet been fully developed.   Buildings are usually considered as one-off projects, and anecdotal evidence and a limited number of case studies are inadequate to suggest changes in the mainstream design practice, in which decisions are primarily influenced by building economics and regulations.  The papers in this Special Issue include a discussion of HVAC controls, building accreditation, lighting impacts, energy efficiency and worker productivity, healthcare settings, and other subjects that are only a subset of the emerging topics that encompass the broadly interdisciplinary subject of healthy, sustainable buildings.     Research is needed for integrating algorithmic solutions in health care that aim at predicting and preventing rather than acute treatment. Algorithmic solutions are scalable and offer personalized attention to each patient?s record, which the health care system does not have the means and the bandwidth to provide.
