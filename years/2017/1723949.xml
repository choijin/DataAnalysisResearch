<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction: The Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation at the University of Pittsburgh and the Steinbrenner Institute for Environmental Education and Research at Carnegie Mellon University co-hosted Engineering Sustainability 2017: Innovation and the Triple Bottom Line (ES17) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, April 9-11, 2017. ES17 brought together engineers and scientists from academia, government, industry, and non-profits to share results of cutting edge research and practice directed at development of environmentally sustainable buildings and infrastructure, especially urban water infrastructure.   Intellectual Merit:  The conference, held biannually since 2005, is unique in its focus on environmentally sustainable engineering for the urban environment, and its ability to bring together engineers, architects, economists, and urban planners and managers.  The ES17 conference demonstrated success in attracting participants from many professional realms to focus on issues related to engineering sustainable built environments and water infrastructure.  These topical areas are inherently interdisciplinary, but also have engineering as the foundation for progress.  Plenary talks and concurrent oral and poster sessions were organized around the following themes:  green building design and construction; greening the indoor environment; sustainable distributed power for the built environment; sustainable urban drinking water, stormwater, and wastewater infrastructure; design of more sustainable transportation grids; using principles of sustainability to foster innovation and new product development.  The interdisciplinary presentations, the mixture of disciplines and backgrounds represented among the participants, and the networking opportunities provided by the conference enabled participants to leave the conference with new information and ideas about research needs and opportunities.  This strengthened the ability of the participants to develop novel and impactful proposals to NSF and other organizations funding research in sustainability science and engineering.  In addition, we held our pre-conference Michael Horman Sustainability Symposium the day before Engineering Sustainability 2017.  With fifty attendees and eight Universities present, we convened a robust symposium that centered on innovative research methods and science communication in the area of sustainable engineering and science.  The agenda consisted of a creative networking activity, faculty lighting talks, small group facilitated discussions, and a culminating report back to the entire group.  The goal of the grant was to bring junior researchers (namely students and young faculty) to Pittsburgh so that they could actively participate in the conference through poster and oral presentations, hence enlivening both and providing professional development for these younger folk.  Broader Impacts: The themes represented at the conference, namely green building design and construction; greening the indoor environment; sustainable distributed power for the built environment; sustainable urban drinking water, stormwater, and wastewater infrastructure; design of more sustainable transportation grids; using principles of sustainability to foster innovation and new product development, all have the p[otential to create a healthier environment for the citizenry, reduce energy use, and eliminate hazard while maintaining a robust economy. In 2017, ES17 attracted 225 attendees including 50 who attended the Horman pre-conference symposium.  As a direct result of NSF funds, we were able to make 89 travel awards, which included 4 undergraduates, 64 PhD students, 3 postdoc and 18 faculty from 31 different universities.
