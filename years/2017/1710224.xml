<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B and the Chemical Measurement &amp; Imaging Programs of the Chemistry Division, Professor Janet R. Morrow of the Department of Chemistry at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York is developing new classes of iron (Fe) complexes as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents.  The goal of this research is to obtain new iron-based agents that produce effective MRI contrast at the field strengths found in the newest MRI scanners.  Iron is a biologically relevant metal ion that may be an alternative to the currently used gadolinium, which has tolerance issues in imaging.  The project lies at the interface of organic and inorganic chemistry, as well as physiology and imaging physics and is therefore well suited to the education of scientists at all levels.  Professor Morrow has a strong record of educating a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students.  Outreach activities involving K-12 students and their science teacher are also be part of the funded project.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Macrocyclic Fe(III) complexes are being developed as MRI contrast agents with the goal of obtaining agents that produce effective T1 contrast at the clinically relevant magnetic field of 3 Tesla (T). The complexes contain highly stabilized Fe(III) centers that do not produce reactive oxygen species.  Complexes that contain one bound water or no water ligands are to be studied to assess the effect of outer versus innersphere water on T1 relaxivity.  A second emphasis is to develop Fe(III) contrast agents that change paramagnetic properties with temperature and pH.  These spin state changes interconvert Fe(III) paramagnetic CEST (Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer) agents and T1 contrast agents. EPR (Electron paramagnetic resonance) and Mossbauer spectroscopy will be used for characterization of the complexes. To study the magnetic field strength dependence of relaxivity, the complexes will be studied on MRI scanners at 1.5 T, 3.0 T and 4.7 T.  A nuclear magnetic resonance dispersion spectrum will be obtained for selected Fe(III) complexes.  The most effective Fe(III) contrast agents will be studied and compared to Gd(III) contrast agents in biological samples.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Several new trivalent iron (Fe(III)) complexes with either high-spin or low spin states have been prepared towards the development of new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probes or contrast agents.  To produce effective contrast agents that change the relaxation rate of protons in water, six-coordinate, high spin Fe(III) macrocyclic complexes that contain a bound water molecule were studied.  None of these complexes had a rapidly exchanging water ligand, but still showed substantially higher proton relaxivity than complexes that lacked the water ligand. This suggests that the bound water ligand produces both stronger second-sphere water interactions and ligand proton exchange that contribute to enhanced relaxivity. A few of the Fe(III) complexes were as effective as clinically used gadolinium complexes in blood serum as shown on a small animal MRI scanner at 4.7 T.  Low spin six-coordinate Fe(III) complexes produced paramagnetically shifted proton resonances and a weak chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) effect, as an alternative type of MRI probe. The series of Fe(III) complexes studied here are important for the development of smart contrast agents that act as temperature and pH responsive probes for detecting disease states.   In mice, the biodistribution and clearance of the Fe(III) macrocyclic MRI contrast agents can be modulated by simply changing the ancillary group.  Moreover, the unusual coordination chemistry of Fe(III) may lead to new strategies for imaging probes including labeling of yeast and glucan nanoparticles for imaging infections and tumors. In image 1, we show how nanoparticles from yeast may act as carriers of the iron contrast agents.  In image 2, we show enhanced MRI contrast of kidneys in mice following tail vein injection of an Fe(III) complex.      Broader impacts include our progress towards the long-term goal of replacing gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents in humans.  Gadolinium retention in humans following administration of contrast agents is a concern that drives the development of alternatives. Iron is a naturally occurring metal and the body may more safely handle the iron complexes.  Our research has led to efforts to commercialize iron-based contrast agents through a new start-up company.  Seven graduate students and seven undergraduate students have participated in this research project.  Further, we have developed new lecture and lab materials to better educate high school and undergraduate students in the importance of paramagnetic metal ions in chemistry and biology.  The K-12 studies were part of a collaboration between graduate students and a high school teacher from the Buffalo public school system.
