<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an environmentally benign yet highly effective marine antifouling coating for the American yacht market. The coating is a non-biocidal, foul release surface which does not require the vessel to move to obtain antifouling protection. It is a non-ablative multi-modal coating that will deter settling marine larvae when the vessel is stationary and will eliminate any attached marine organisms, such as barnacles through self-cleaning (e.g. fouling release) while underway. The commercial impact of the innovation will be in reducing consumption of non-renewable resources through increased fuel efficiency and possible expansion into additional markets. Such additional markets would include those for commercial vessels, Navy vessels, bridges, windmills, etc., while successfully reducing harmful chemicals in the marine environment. The market for these coatings is expected to double in the next four years, currently being at $10.2 billion. The findings from this development work will also be incorporated into research based educational programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is the development of a promising synthetic conopeptide analog to the noradrenaline (NA) molecule. Prior art has shown that NA, when bound to a surface (or included as part of a coating covering a surface), deters fouling marine invertebrates from settling, thus preventing biofouling. Another distinct advantage of using conopeptide based systems is their stability in the marine environment. The current efforts are focused upon improving the efficacy and antifouling performance of these molecules. The phase I research objectives are (1) conjugation of the bioactive conopeptide additive to the current foul release coating; (2) demonstration of antifouling efficacy and proof of concept by bioassay; (3) development of batch coatings for scale-up for marine field tests. The results will be useful for designing new test coatings for scale up and testing in the marine environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Engineered Marine Coatings Inc (EMC) completed the award, STTR Phase I: Marine Antifouling Deterrent Coatings for Quantum Paints, granted on July 1, 2017.  EMC partnered with The Okeanos Research Laboratory, located in the Department of Biological Sciences at Clemson University.  The intellectual merit outcome results provided a working proof of concept.  EMC was successfully able to develop a highly effective antifouling coating that can be further developed for the marine market.  The contniued development will provide an antifouling coating that is also safe for the environment.  Broader outcomes discovered during the research included the enhancement of continued education for the University and an expressed interest in the technology from worldwide companies currently in the marine industry.  This technology will ultimately eliminate the need for materials currently added to antifouling that have long harmful affects to marine life.  EMC initially tested multiple marine coating formulations to identify the highest quality coating that would accept the patented technology from the University.  Once this objective was completed, EMC began settlement testing.  EMC and the University performed multiple bioassays utilizing this technology along with controls.  Bioassay testing proved 98-99% settling stage barnacle cyprids were deterred from settling onto the treated surfaces.  Due to the support provided from the Phase 1 grant and the team at NSF, EMC was successful in meeting all objectives of the grant.  EMC plans to scale up to continue development and begin third party testing in industry standard testing facilities.
