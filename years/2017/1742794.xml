<AbstractNarration>Finalized Abstract for 1742794/Snair &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;There have been a number of disasters around the Nation where NSF has funded, through its RAPID mechanism, fundamental science to assist in disaster response. Several Federal agencies have responded to these disasters and have worked collaboratively to help in recovery. To facility collaboration in future disasters as well to affect a more efficient response, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) has organized a Standing Committee on "Medical and Public Health Research during Large-Scale Emergency Events? where the Federal Agencies can provide guidance in the preparation, response and recovery in future disasters. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The direct involvement of two NSF programs, Environmental Engineering and Environmental Sustainability, relates to the two overarching goals of programs to protect public health and environmental health. Although response to recent emergencies has typically used the best science available at the time, additional research, done in parallel with and immediately following the response is often essential to address the most pressing knowledge gaps presented by public health emergencies and to ensure that they are addressed before another disaster strikes. Traditionally what has been lacking is the infrastructure to rapidly mobilize these information gathering resources in response to an on-going emergency. The National Academies have a long tradition of providing advice from a national perspective. This tradition rests on the ability of the institution to convene committees of experts who are charged to deliberate important issues of health and health care policy in an objective and independent environment that assures rigorous analysis. It can serve an important function by bringing representatives from diverse groups together to achieve consensus on complex issues. The Standing Committee builds on prior work and activities of the Forum on Medical and Public Health Preparedness for Disasters and Emergencies, which has identified the need for sustainable infrastructure to conduct important medical and public health research and gather needed information during and immediately following large scale emergencies.</AbstractNarration>
