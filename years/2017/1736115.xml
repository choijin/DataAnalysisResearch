<AbstractNarration>This grant provides financial support for the conference entitled The 4th World Congress on Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME2017) to be held from May 21-25, 2017 in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Building on the success of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd World Congresses on ICME (held in 2011, 2013, 2015), ICME2017 is the premier forum for sharing and dissemination of the latest scientific and engineering advances in this field. Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) is an approach that uses computer modeling programs to predict the behavior of materials and integrate this information into the overall materials, processing, and manufacturing design cycle. ICME has received international attention due to its great potential to shorten product development time, while lowering cost and improving design and manufacturing outcomes. ICME2017 will bring together researchers, professionals, and engineers in a setting which facilitates rich discussions and interactions, and aims to highlight the important advances in ICME on a global scale. Student participation is greatly encouraged in order to give students exposure to recent advances in ICME, and thus help prepare the next generation of leaders in this field. This meeting is open to all interested individuals, including a mixture of attendees from academic research, government, industry, and educational professions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of ICME has helped to revolutionize materials and manufacturing design by providing the potential to shorten product development time, while lowering the associated costs. The key topical areas that will be considered at ICME2017 include: (1) the wide range of materials programs where an ICME approach validated by experimental efforts is applicable, (2) individual computational methods utilized in ICME, (3) the roles of ICME in graduate and undergraduate courses, (4) digital infrastructure required for information sharing and model integration, (5) ICME implementation strategies, (6) verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification, (7) interoperability and communications standards, and (8) ICME networking initiatives worldwide. This world congress will include over 200 presentations comprising three concurrent sessions, with 140 podium speakers and a robust poster session. The program has been designed to maximize interaction among modelers and experimentalists and provide a balance between breadth of information and depth of discussion and interaction opportunities; various types of institutions across academia, government, and industry will be represented. ICME2017 will attempt to provide the most advanced technical meeting possible, with a mixture of senior and junior investigators, post-doctoral trainees and students</AbstractNarration>
