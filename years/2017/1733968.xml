<AbstractNarration>1733968 Niemeyer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to support the costs of the meeting and the travels of the participants who will attend the workshop on Building a Sustainable Combustion Research Community. This proposed workshop will be held on April 22 and 23, 2017, prior to the 10th US National Combustion Meeting in College Park, MD. Workshop participants will consist of junior faculty members who just started their academic careers in the field of combustion and fire research. In the U.S. nearly 70% of energy conversion is accomplished by combustion. Hence the advancement in combustion science is crucial to the society. The workshop discussion will be focused on the future challenges in the field from the perspectives of early-career researchers, who will be the workforce to address these future challenges in their careers. Workshop findings will be documented in a report that will be disseminated to the wider technical community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combustion is a key technology for power generation, and this will remain the same for decades to come. However, the combustion research community is facing various technical and non-technical challenges. The goal of this workshop is to identify challenges, educate the early-career researchers about these challenges, and discuss possible solutions. Discussion around technical issues will include brainstorming of novel, possibly cross-disciplinary research areas for future work. On the other hand, various non-technical issues will also be discussed, including communication with the general public and lawmakers and attracting and retaining talented researchers of diverse backgrounds. Results of this workshop are expected to help build a more productive combustion research community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported a two-day workshop for US-based early career faculty researchers and researchers working in the area of combustion and fire, held in April 2017 in College Park, Maryland, USA. Using an unconference format, the 38 participants discussed issues facing the field clustered into two thrusts: cultural and technical. The discussion topics included attracting and retaining a more diverse community, public engagement, improving educational outcomes, hostile and confrontational climate, publishing (open data, open access, open software), collaboration, what does "combustion science" encompass?, and balancing fundamental and applied research.  Outcomes of the project include a number of recommendations for the community to address each of the issues we discussed, and specific impacts directly resulting from efforts of workshop participants. These include:  Establishment of an early-career advisory board reporting to the executive committee of the Combustion Institute, whose membership includes four participants of the workshop. Establishment of an early-career advisory board reporting to the US Section Board, whose members include five participants of the workshop. Public announcement of code of ethics at the opening of the US National Meeting, by the conference host, at the behest of members of the workshop. Similar announcements were made at both the Eastern and Western States Section meetings in Spring 2018. Nomination and subsequent election of early-career researchers onto Combustion Institute section boards, resulting in the following numbers of current board members: eight in Western States, two in Central States, and seven in Eastern States. Development of diversity and inclusion activities within the US sections of the Combustion Institute. Workshops focusing on mentoring, diversity, and inclusion at both the Eastern and Western States Section meetings in Spring 2018. Several research collaborations have arisen from networking opportunities at the workshop, including coordinated CAREER proposals (Jacqueline O?Connor and Richard West) and others. Addition of new Education and Outreach colloquia in combustion-related meetings, including a WiPP track at the Combustion Symposium.   The workshop also created a close-knit community of early-career combustion researchers who have kept in touch since the event. The community often communicates on Slack, a popular team-based communication platform, informing each other of news from the community, grant opportunities, upcoming conferences, and more. Several scientific collaborations and friendships were forged at this meeting, which will undoubtedly enhance the quality of the field going forward.  Intellectual Merits: Discussion around technical issues included brainstorming of novel, possibly cross-disciplinary research areas for future work. The workshop was limited to junior researchers, who may be more open-minded to alternative research directions, and also may possess different skill sets compared with established, senior researchers. In addition, important technical topics for discussion included how to encourage better practices in computational science, including ensuring reproducibility of results, and how to encourage best practices around open sharing of research products.  Broader Impacts: The proposed project resulted in the following broader impacts to society:  Old and outdated educational content currently poses a challenge to training students in combustion research with respect to modern techniques&ndash;in particular those involving computation. The workshop initiated the creation of a community of practice around developing, sharing, and incorporating such material in curricula. One primary goal of the workshop was identifyying ways to attract and retain more diverse researchers in combustion and related fields, in terms of both demographics and background. In addition, we discussed ways to increase representation of such groups in leadership positions, such as in the Combustion Institute, conference committees, and journal editorial boards. One major topic of discussion was how we can encourage the combustion community (and related fields) to embrace openness. This includes practices such as sharing data and research software openly, and ensuring written material (e.g., journal articles, conference proceedings) are available openly as well. Strategies for the latter include increasing awareness of preprint/eprint services. The workshop discussed how researchers can engage more with the public, to help people outside the field better understand this exciting and important research area. Workshop participants discussed strategies to increase the diversity of the combustion research community, in terms of demographics/background and socioeconomic status. This includes ways to collaborate with primarily undergraduate or non-doctoral (i.e., non-R1/R2) institutions.
