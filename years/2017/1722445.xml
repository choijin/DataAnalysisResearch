<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable doctors to maximize the diagnostic information extracted from costly Pediatric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. Annually, approximately 3.5 million brain MRI scans are performed with average prices with interpretation from $500 - $2,000. Even though the scans are expensive to acquire and interpret, doctors generally only use visual inspection of the images to diagnose abnormalities. The proposed software will be relatively cheap compared to the overall cost of an MRI and is expected to let doctors make accurate measurements of key structures in the brain. This is important because developmental and other diseases can cause small volume and surface area changes that cannot be easily seen by the human eye. By detecting these changes early, doctors should be able to treat the disease at early stages, potentially leading to better quality of life and financial savings. The proposed tool is also expected to enable doctors to better track treatment outcomes, by measuring the effect a drug or treatment has on particular structures in the brain. Ultimately, it is expected that the proposed technology will improve quality of care as well as reduce healthcare costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project leverages current advances in computational technology such as machine learning and computer vision to automatically measure volume, surface area and shapes in critical parts of the brain in children. These measurements are then compared to a large database of children over the ages of 0-12 years to determine if they have deviated from normal. Although MRIs have been increasing adopted as the diagnostic tool of choice for childhood brain disorders due to the lack of radiation, there has yet to be a tool that allows doctors to accurately measure changes in a child's brain from MRI scans. Because, in children, the brain is rapidly changing as she/he grows, it is difficult to determine visually whether the changes are due to normal development or disease. By measuring the brain accurately and comparing it to a large database already collected by the proposing team, it is expected that a pediatric doctor will be able to determine whether a child's brain has deviated from normal. It could also allow physicians to better select treatments and monitor the patient response to a specific therapy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   When a child receives a brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) for a suspected neurological issue, currently the radiologist - a specialist doctor - performs a time-consuming, qualitative, visual assessment by  checking hundreds of 2D images to reconstruct what is happening in the 3D brain. However, the anatomical abnormalities caused by many diseases or conditions can be subtle, particularly early on in the course of the disease, and can be challenging or impossible to detect visually. In addition, diagnosis often requires a highly specialized and experienced pediatric neuroradiologist, not available in many hospitals, particularly those who primarily see adult patients.   Our software, ClickBrain, uses machine learning to outline brain structures in children's brain MRIs, and provides reproducible quantitative assessments of the size of each brain region compared to what is expected in healthy normally developing children of the same age and gender. This saves  doctorstime by allowing them to focus on regions of the image that are abnormal, to enable earlier and more consistent diagnosis regardless of the doctor's experience, and to monitor treatments.   For this project, we (1) built our automated machine learning based outlining system, (2) manually outlined several key brain structures in a large database of healthy children's brain MRIs on which we trained our algorithm, and (3) successfully tested the system in the clinical setting on a small dataset of patients from the Children's Hospital Los Angeles database. This proof-of-concept study allowed us to: 1. Test the quality of our annotation on research data; 2. Adapt and fix the algorithms for the messier clinical environment.    TRAINING: The project also provided training opportunities for several undergraduate and masters students as well as an engineering postdoc at Children's Hospital Los Angeles in brain image segmentation and anatomy, machine learning and graphical user interface implementation.    COMMERCIAL: Through interactions with Dawnbreaker's market analysis team, we also were able to better narrow down our target market. We?ve also started to build a network of key opinion leaders to help guide development and identified a set of early adopters.    PUBLICATIONS: We submitted a paper (currently in first round of revisions) based on the results of our I-Corps and Beat-the-Odds customer discoveries to  the Journal of the American College of Radiology, which is published by the Radiological Society of North America, on "International Trends in Adoption of Post-Processing in Clinical Medical Imaging". Our soon-to-be-published normative curves for brain development will allow researchers to quickly compare volumes obtained through ClickBrain or other means of segmentation to normative data.
