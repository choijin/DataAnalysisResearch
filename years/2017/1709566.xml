<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Camden and Svarovsky of the University of Notre Dame will undertake a study of the analytical applications of the surface-enhanced hyper-Raman scattering (SEHRS) effect and implement a student-driven program to monitor the concentration of uranium in ground water sources.  SEHRS is a technique provide unique information about molecules adsorbed on a surface. The success of this work has the potential to impact a wide range of studies, especially the geometry of a molecule adsorbed on a surface differs in complex environments.  It can also make a difference in deep-tissue imaging.  Furthermore, Professors Camden and Svarovsky and their groups also work on ways to reduce the cost of SEHRS spectrometers, making SEHRS accessible to a wide range of researchers and analytical problems. Students working in these two labs have a great opportunity to learn different skills through collaboration. As a way to engage a new and national K-12 audience in outreach efforts, Professors Camden and Svarovsky also plan to work with the University of Notre Dame's Center for STEM Education together and launch a new Citizen Science project called U-Watch. The program will bring the benefits of surface-based spectroscopy research supported by this grant to a broad audience and could identify potentially dangerous levels of contamination, such as uranium, in ground water drinking sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this work, SEHRS is used to provide information that is not available via other techniques. New methods for single-molecule SEHRS are used to probe nanoparticle-adsorbate interactions at the level of single molecules in complex chemical environments.  SEHRS nanoparticles also serve as a platform for near-infrared and short-wave-infrared (SWIR) (0.8-2.5 Pm) sensing, imaging, and authentication. The Notre Dame groups also plan to develop the characterization methods needed to pursue the rational design of SWIR tags and apply them to deep-tissue imaging studies.  A comparison of SEHRS and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) shows that SEHRS can be more sensitive than SERS in certain situations. Lastly, they explore the potential for hand-held, field-portable devices capable of recording SEHRS spectra with continuous-wave lasers. Through the supported research, the groups will demonstrate SEHRS as a powerful and practical analytical approach to ultrasensitive detection, imaging, and the elucidation of surface structure and environment.</AbstractNarration>
