<AbstractNarration>The proposal will fund a four-day interdisciplinary workshop on "The Great Plains: An Environmental History." The University of Oklahoma will host the workshop in May 2017. This interdisciplinary workshop will explore the environmental history of the North American Great Plains from western Texas to southern Canada. This workshop will enhance interdisciplinary dialogue in environmental studies. It will expand academic knowledge of the Great Plains. The workshop will be free and open to the public. It will be podcast and tweeted live. The published book will inform contemporary policy debates on the environment. It will explain why certain technologies succeed and others fail in regards to human habitation and resource management. It will provide an opportunity to members of the public to consider the Great Plains as a complex ecosystem that includes human interactions from a historical perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary workshop will offer a scholars the opportunity to re-conceptualize the Great Plains from the perspective of technological adaptations rather than only ecological disasters. By exploring the elemental and persistent themes of water, grasses, animals, and energy, the workshop will discuss the complex ways in which shifting technologies sustained human life, advanced diverse societies, and altered human relations with the region's myriad ecologies. The workshop will integrate the perspectives and research methodologies of different fields to forge an analysis of the Great Plains at the intersection of environment, culture, and technology. The workshop will involve scholars from environmental history, energy history, anthropology, geography, sociology, Native American studies, and environmental science, policy and management.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Across centuries, technological adaptations to the distinctive water, grass, animal and energy systems of the Great Plains have guided its environmental history as much as, and arguably more than, the ecological disasters that too often have formed the overarching narrative of the region. This reality provides a starting point and unifying theme for sixteen essays that have been submitted for publication in a single volume that explores the environmental history of the Great Plains.  This project was made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation which was used to fund a workshop held in May of 2017.  The participants contributed essays that collectively sought to redefine the region by exploring how the Great Plains environment was shaped by technological adaptations rather than by disasters and responses to such crises. The workshop integrated scholars in an interdisciplinary fashion by combining their perspectives and research methodologies to better understand the intersection of environment, culture, and technology.    At the workshop, contributors presented first drafts of their contributions to the volume and received critiques.  With Internet broadcasts and social media, the group engaged as wide an audience as possible. Visits to museums and archives on the campus of the University of Oklahoma would inform their revisions.  On the third day of the workshop, scholars loaded into several vehicles and drove toward Pawhuska, Oklahoma.  Along the way, they traveled through different environments that embodied many of the technological adaptations that have occurred for centuries across the Plains.  The group passed through densely populated urban and industrial environments such as Oklahoma City and into grasslands burned by wildland fires in the preceding months. On the prairies, pumpjacks bobbed up and down, as they have for decades, to extract oil from the earth.  As oil fields faded from view, the group traversed miles of rolling hills populated with new "farms" where turbines captured the energy of the wind. The Tallgrass Prairie Preserve outside Pawhuska offers thousands of acres of grasslands, a remnant of an ecology that once dominated much of the plains.  Some 2,500 bison roam the site, a small portion of a species that once populated the region from Canada to Texas in the millions.  Participants in the project learned about the ways humans have employed "controlled" fire in this ecology, as a technology to feed themselves and as an often futile means to suppress more dangerous fires.  At the Osage Nation Museum, tribal members explained their experiences living on this land and the adaptations they and their ancestors have made over the centuries, from burning prairies to embracing oil extraction in the twentieth century.   The project?s emphasis of "regionalism" with regard to the Great Plains considers not only whether there exist specific issues and characteristics that separate the area from places west of the Rocky Mountains, or east of the Mississippi River, but whether past interactions reveal complex, constantly shifting adaptations to an equally complex ecology by diverse human communities.  In focusing on such adaptations, the published volume also seeks to counter earlier notions of the Plains as a region of ecological disaster.  Collectively, the participants in this project argue that the way to understand the Great Plains is through the technologies people have employed to survive and, at times, thrive. This understanding must come from an analysis of the methods that succeeded and failed along with such technological developments that altered the landscape in both intended and unexpected ways.  As we contemplated these historical adaptations, the four themes of water, grasses, animals, and energy emerged as subjects for the published volume of essays.  Each essay involves the complicated intersection of two or more of these elements, thereby illuminating the concepts and issues that are distinctive to the region.
