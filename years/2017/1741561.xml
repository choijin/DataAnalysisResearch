<AbstractNarration>It is important to understand how doctoral scholars of color are able to integrate cultural identity and self-efficacy in contexts where stereotype threat might be prevalent, such as higher education, STEM programs, and intensive research labs. This project seeks to identify, understand, and describe the interplay between the sense of identity, self-efficacy, metacognition of modeling formalisms, and stereotype threat. Specifically, the goal is to understand how thinking and narrative identity evolve over time and how the process of coaching scholars of color in a supportive academic context might strengthen the value proposition of entering the professoriate. The key objectives of this project are: (1) to implement a collaborative approach to the development of highly skilled and competitive graduate scholars; and (2) to broaden participation among underrepresented minorities (URMs) in the engineering professoriate, with a specific focus on African Americans. Success of the project will be evident by an increased participation of these scholars in high-impact activities such as scholarly publications, progress toward degree, and applying to academic positions. Additionally, this research project will help to strengthen institutional capacities, particularly of a Historically Black College/University (HBCU). It will also link parallel efforts at NC A&amp;T State University (a public HBCU) and George Washington University (a private Predominantly White Institution/PWI). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a quasi-experimental design, pre- and post-test control group design, the proposed research project is a first attempt to integrate anticipatory cognition development and stereotype threat reduction in full immersion of engineering modeling that aligns with NSF's Research and Related Activities (R&amp;RA) programs. The investigators will also create a proof-of-concept that evaluates different adaptive learning formalisms to identify effective strategies to aid students' capabilities to develop and apply mathematical models for problem solving in engineering. The role of anticipatory cognition is to influence students' reasoning about the problem content prior to the development and application of the mathematics-based approach. A stereotype minimization coaching model will be implemented and performance and social learning variables (e.g., stereotype threats, identity, and engineering modeling self-efficacy) will be compared across both institutions. There is an implicit hypothesis that additional factors may emerge because of the differences between the institutions. Such emerging factors as critical mass and social class may be identified. The effectiveness of the coaching model will be assessed through a quasi-experimental design, pre- and post-test control group design at the two sites. In so doing, the proposed research project has two concomitant efforts - one focused on an R&amp;RA program to develop subject matter expertise in engineering model development, and the other a pilot study to compare an intervention to optimize anticipatory cognition and minimize stereotype threat among these same graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

However, its strength is dampened by the influences of prior knowledge related to the STEM fields by the participants.  With the aid of monthly skype meetings between the teams at the two institutions, consistent data collection on participants’ activities, coursework and research efforts, the project highlights the criticality of the fitness of the students being hired into advanced degree programs. We emphasize that while the dearth of underrepresented minorities in the engineering domain may be addressed, it is crucial to implement more concerted efforts at much earlier stages in their career progression such as in high schools or even earlier on in their bachelor’s degree studies.  Additional anticipatory constructs were also discovered. These include:  Perseverance/Determination- derived from      narratives that speak to participants’ continuing in school, class, and      their research project despite encountering obstacles. Isolation/Loneliness      (Academic Disconnect) - derived from narratives that speak to      participants’ difficulties with family and friends lack of understanding      about what it is they are doing and/or having the time to talk to or      associate with family and friends. Previous      Knowledge-derived      from narratives that speak to participants’ discussions about things they      knew prior to joining this research study that may help them with their      research project/dissertations. New Information-derived from      narratives that speaks to what the participants have learned in various      courses each week. Future      Planning/Thinking (academic "to-do") - derived      from narratives that speak to plans the participants make for improvement      during this process or narratives that regard what they think will happen      as they progress in their respective programs. Problem-Solution      Focus-derived      from narratives that identify problems the participants may have      encountered thus far and their plans to address or correct those problems.   Over time, some of the broad outcomes from the more than 400 video transcripts include: (a) true progression as the students shift from new students with limited knowledge (or academic novices) to seasoned graduate students who have a better understanding of the challenges, and (b) it was also observed that their academic self-efficacy in their abilities and capabilities particularly in recognizing that obstacles were less about their own abilities and more about the type of research activities they are engaged in. The outcomes of this project have been disseminated through three outlets: (i) a presentation on the metacognitive development of the students was given at the 2019 PKAL Network Conference on May 14th, 2019; (ii) five peer-reviewed scholarly publications including one at the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE); and (iii) an opportunity for career advancement for at least one of the students through his affiliation with Idaho National Laboratory on research exploration due to the opportunity provided by this award.
