<AbstractNarration>The Massachusetts Computing Attainment Network (MassCAN) at Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC), proposes to address the national need for a more strategic and systemic approach to computer science (CS) education by bringing together multi-sector teams from 10 states that have demonstrated leadership in developing strategic approaches to effect statewide impact on K-12 CS education. The MassCAN/EDC project team will synthesize the states' strategic approaches and develop multi-dimensional models for effective strategic action, which they will then be disseminated to other states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the two-day Workshop and four one-day follow-up sessions (spread out over the year), the 10 teams will share Best Practices, address common challenges, and build their capacity for continued leadership. The Workshop will focus on four dimensions that states have identified as key to a strategic plan: (1) informing state-wide leadership, (2) engaging business leaders, (3) creating broad-based coalitions to lead state K-12 CS education, and (4) ensuring that equity is a central principle of all implementation strategies.</AbstractNarration>

SUMMIT: In 2016 and early 2017, more than half the states in the country were engaged in an array of grassroots activities to promote K-12 computer science (CS) education, including teacher professional development programs, public awareness campaigns (e.g., Hour of Code), expansion of CS course offerings, and CS clubs. To provide a venue for exploring CS efforts across a variety of states, Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC) and Google held a two-day Summit for 10 state-based CS leadership teams. The impetus for this meeting was the mounting recognition that, as important as grassroots efforts are, states must develop complementary strategic, state-wide initiatives to guard against systemic problems overwhelming or stalling local programmatic efforts to promote CS education for all students.   The 10 teams were composed of stakeholders from education, business, government, and beyond. The Summit featured four panels of nationally recognized speakers who addressed key topics for promoting equitable, state-wide, K-12 CS education: Business Leader Engagement, Government Leader Engagement, Statewide Coalition Building and Engagement, and Attaining Equitable Outcomes.

FOLLOW-UP INTERVIEWS: Summit participants reported that the meeting was very useful and generative with regard to their state coalition's capacity to provide both strategic and systemic leadership. In follow-up interviews several months later, a number of participants noted that the Summit provided a much- needed chance to field a larger team to work together on moving their CS agendas forward for their whole state.  The biggest benefit for us was having that quiet time, being . . . in a room to think about [the] problem in more detail with some of the key decision-makers, like the chair of the state board; to strategize about how do we start to build the political will and the political coalition to help advance some of these initiatives at a political, legislative . . . level. The opportunity for our team (some of us who had never met) to have the gift of time to talk/dream/plan together is likely the biggest catalyst that will drive us to action. Out of our discussions, new alliances, and deeper understandings will come action.  Additionally, interviewees responded that equity played the largest role in driving their CS missions. At the same time, a number of attendees noted that equity represented a different type of conference topic than the other three, serving more as a guiding principle for social justice that undergirds and informs all other policies, plans, and actions. The Summit experience strongly suggests that early-stage strategies for providing equitable CS education for K?12 students contribute to raising visibility and providing a range of new resources. However, while these foundational approaches and tools have made critical contributions, they are insufficient to address the broad-based and deeply rooted institutional and cultural factors that make attaining equitable K-12 CS education such daunting challenge. The Summit's explicit emphasis on equitable outcomes for K-12 CS education might serve as a model for bringing together large teams of diverse stakeholders to identify near-term and long-term research, program, and policy strategies to advance the equity agenda.  CS DATA WORKING GROUP: The third project activity was to convene a group of Massachusetts K-12 CS leaders to provide feedback and recommendations to the state?s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) about the kinds of data we are currently collecting as a state, and additional data needs in support of decision-making related to equitable CS education. The CS Data Working Group made several recommendations to the state, including:  Improving the reliability of data the state collects about CS courses offered by: (1) developing better K-12 course code information and (2) making available more crosswalks of CS curriculum materials and the Massachusetts Digital Literacy and Computer Science Standards. Improving public access to data the state already collects regarding CS instruction and student outcomes (e.g., teacher demographics and certification, longitudinal information about student course-taking, students' recruitment into CS courses, business involvement in CS education).
