<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable the automatic analysis of human motion using visual information gathered at high frequency. Within the manufacturing context?which represents 11% of US GDP [Bureau of Economic Analysis]?the collection and interpretation of this new set of large-scale time-and-motion data enables dramatic improvements in the understanding of assembly processes and optimization of human productivity. In addition, manufacturers can use this system to flag process errors or deviations?ideally in real time?allowing for mitigation before the deviations propagate further down the value chain. Just these two capabilities enable manufacturers to avoid costly rework and recalls, improve worker accuracy, discover new opportunities to optimize processes and generate revenue generation, and flag worker safety issues. As a result, workers and management become aligned around shared goals of efficiency and competitiveness?reducing fears of automation while dramatically improving productivity and possibly protecting jobs. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will improve the robustness of a prototype deep learning back-end for automatic action recognition from a stream of video data. While object recognition is now commonplace, action detection?e.g., inferring the behavior and intentions of actors and objects over time?has not yet been solved or commercialized. In fact, it is still an active research area. Solving this problem requires overcoming technical hurdles in industrial settings that include changing actors, lighting conditions and camera perspectives; manual labelling of large volumes of video data; transmitting large volumes of data to and from the cloud; accurately inferencing with high levels of confidence; and developing intuitive human/system interfaces that may, in the future, include unconventional channels such as AR/VR, text-to-speech, haptic feedback, amongst others.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Industry 4.0 technologies are generally focused on tasks performed by machines. Today, the volume of data derived from machine sources dwarfs the volume of data derived from tasks performed by humans -- even though humans are by far the biggest contributors of both value and variability. (Boston Consulting Group estimates that up to 90% of global factory tasks are still performed by humans.) Thus, despite their oversized contribution to value creation, manual processes have been effectively invisible to analytics. As a result, major manufacturing business decisions are based on data that?s incomplete and biased, and thus fundamentally erroneous. This leads manufacturers to overinvest in the 10% of manufacturing tasks that are easily quantified (robots, automation) or to optimize for costs (offshoring, layoffs). Which, in turn, drives factory workers to fear for their future and to resent new technology, with troubling economic, cultural, and political implications. At the highest level of abstraction, the work performed as part of Drishti?s Small Business Innovation Research Phase I made it possible to create an AI-driven system that helps line operators build better products, quicker and with greater consistency. From the standpoint of intellectual merit, the two major innovations include the development of deep learning-based architectures to accurately recognize human actions on the factory floor at a low cost, and the generation of a searchable video system of records. Essentially, the creation of a dataset of "people at work." Drishti believes the architecture that has been developed is transformative in its potential. This architecture may have advanced the state of the art in accuracy for action recognition. Additionally, this architecture attains its dual goal of accuracy and cost reduction, and also solves the myriad of technical problems associated with a system for streaming and processing video. Looking at the broader impact of this innovation, Drishti sees two main areas of impact beyond the advancement of technology: business and human resources. On the business side, this technology and the dataset that it creates are expected to enable American manufacturing to be more competitive with that of other countries. Specifically, it enables American manufacturers to improve the efficiency and precision of individual operators (who are often more expensive than their counterparts in other countries). It is also expected to be applied by managers and engineers to identify opportunities for sweeping increases in productivity and quality, as well as to provide traceability that can reduce indirect labor significantly. Drishti has seen two forms of evidence from the business world to affirmatively assess the success of this project. The first is from customers that are adopting this technology. The second is from premiere Silicon Valley venture capitalists like AndreessenHorowitz and Emergence Capital, who are investing in Drishti. Finally, on the human resources side, Drishti?s advances in computer vision and AI boost human cognition. They help operators perform their tasks with greater precision and efficiency, as well as to surface and validate creative solutions by individual operators that accelerate the plant?s goals for continuous optimization.  Thus, we believe that, on the broader scale, Drishti has the potential to change the conventional wisdom that AI is a tool for displacing humans, by demonstrating how AI collaborates with humans, making them more competitive against automation.
