<AbstractNarration>Bacillus plays a vital role in microbiology research. This widespread and diverse group of bacteria synthesizes a large array of antibiotics, fine chemicals, vitamins, and industrial enzymes. Bacillus bacteria serve as production platforms for biofuels and ecofriendly pesticides. Some species are useful as probiotics or in vaccine production; others play important roles in health care, food safety, and bioterrorism prevention. Bacillus research provides deep insights into the physiology, development, and behavior of bacterial cells. The Bacillus Genetic Stock Center (BGSC) maintains a centralized collection for useful Bacillus strains. Each year, BGSC strains are used for hundreds of innovative projects nationwide, resulting in peer-reviewed publications and US patents, undergraduate teaching lab experiences, and high school science fair projects. NSF support will strengthen the nation's scientific infrastructure by ensuring that this resource remains available to America's scientific research and education communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BGSC will collect, maintain, document, and distribute Gram-positive, endospore-forming bacteria, not only from Bacillus but from many closely related genera. The backbone of the collection is devoted to B. subtilis, a model organism and biotechnology workhorse. Included are two complete knockout libraries covering every non-essential gene in the organism and a third "knock-down" library covering the essential genes. A wide variety of genetic tools for modulating gene expression and for constructing new strains are also stocked. The collection is rounded out with sizable holdings of the biopesticides B. thuringiensis and Lysinibacillus sphaericus, the thermophile Geobacillus, the food spoilage organism B. cereus, the plant growth-promoting Paenibacillus, and other important species. Cultures will be collected and stored cryogenically at a secure site at the Ohio State University and made available to qualified scientists and educators. Strain data will be made publicly available on the BGSC website (http://bgsc.org) and integrated into Bacillus gene and genome databases in the USA and Europe.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  The primary goal of the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center (BGSC) is to "maintain genetically characterized strains, cloning vectors, and bacteriophage for the genus Bacillus and to distribute these materials without prejudice to qualified scientists and educators throughout the world." The BGSC serves the scientific research and education communities as the steward of the rich legacy of strains that have been produced by previous generations and the exciting new tools that continueto be created in our day. This project has allowed the BGSC to continue to expand its collection, to develop new products, and to extend its services to a growing community of educators and research scientists.  Intellectual Merit  During the twelve-month funding period, the BGSC demonstrated its ability to support advances in both basic and applied microbiological research. It maintained and distributed strains from the world's largest collection of documented, curated stocks from the important model organism, Bacillus subtilis. It acquired:  three novel genome-sequenced bacteriophages that infect the model organism Bacillus subtilis 168; twelve vectors designed to display foreign proteins on the crust, or outermost layer, of the B. subtilis spore, with many possible applications to biotechnology;  an mCherry version of the popular pXFP_Star plasmids, which labels proteins with a bright red fluorescent tag; a set of 28 "parts" in the Bacillus BioBricks 2.0 collection, designed for synthetic biology studies in B. subtilis; many more individual strains and small collections of bacterial isolates or genetic tools.     During the funding period, BGSC bacterial strains have been used in at least 99 peer-reviewed publications and 18 US patents. These figures demonstrate the merit and usefulness of the BGSC collection.  Broader Impacts  The BGSC is a significant part of the infrastructure supporting microbiology, biotechnology, and science education. This award enabled the BGSC to provide several tangible benefits to society. The collection enhanced the research infrastructure, providing standardized, carefully curated bacterial strains to academic and industrial scientists. It improved the repeatability of published results by making identical stocks available for other investigators. It served STEM education, making safe, documented, affordable strains from a model organism, B. subtilis, available to science educators and their students at all levles.

It promoted the well-being of individuals in societyby facilitating research to address current issues in health care, climate change, food security, and national security.
