<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2017. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The host institution for the fellowship is the University of California, Riverside and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Daniel Koenig.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Barley is the world's fourth most important grain crop, and is unusually robust to a diversity of environmental stresses earning the moniker, the crop at the edge of the desert. Understanding the genetic basis of crop performance in variable environments is imperative, but long-term studies translating genotype to phenotype are exceedingly rare. To fill this gap, the genetic basis of local adaptation will be explored in a near century long agricultural experiment, the barley composite cross II (CCII). The CCII was initiated in the 1920's and has been allowed to adapt to the local conditions in Davis, CA for over 50 generations. With this unique resource, cutting edge high-throughput phenotype and genotype characterization methods will be employed to elucidate the genetic basis of agricultural performance.  The ultimate goal of this study is to predict successful genotypes in variable environmental conditions. Thriving during climatic extremes will minimize potential food insecurity arising from environmental factors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project will focus on the characterization of 1000 individuals drawn from four time points in the CCII experiment to elucidate the effect of local selective pressures on phenotype and genotype. Phenotypic data will be collected at three resolutions: single time point measurements of whole plant and inflorescence traits, temporal growth rate measurements using webcam monitoring, and inflorescence 3D renderings using CT scanning. Using a combination of genome-wide SNP discovery and ascertainment strategies, adaptive shifts in phenotype will be linked to specific genetic changes. The results of this project will be shared with the general public through multiple outreach programs, increasing the understanding of how crops adapt to changing environments.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project &ldquo;Elucidating the Genetic Control of Long-term Success in a Near Century Long Study of Barley (Hordeum vulgare)&rdquo; used the Composite Cross II population with four main generations (F18, F28, F50, and F58) and the 28 parental varieties with next generation sequencing to compare genomics and phenomics to identify the genetic basis of local adaptation. This project had three distinct goals: 1) characterize the genomic diversity and highlight patterns through generations, 2) use daily phenotypic measurements to characterize developmental differences between generations and parental lines, and 3) use micro CT-scanning to mathematically define seed/spike differences between generations and parental lines. For goal one, using reduced representation genome sequencing on 221 individuals for each generation we observed a reduction in genetic diversity over time. Progeny from F18 were the most diverse of all progeny, whereas for F58 only a handful of genotypes comprised the majority of the samples. In a common garden experiment, single time point gross phenotypes were scored including flowering time, plant height, seed production, and spike numbers. Genome wide association identified loci involved in changes in morphology. Flowering time has been extensively looked at it in many species, and the candidate genes discovered in the association analyses were known genes impacting flowering time. For goal two, we used the LemnaTec automated platform to obtain daily measurements for 60 days in both visible light and the fluorescent spectrum. Similar to the results from goal one, we see a reduction in morphology space, meaning that individuals from F58 or more similar to each other than individuals from F18. Using development though time plots, we can trace trajectories of all the traits measured. We were able to identify changes in leaf color and photosynthetic capacity across generations which may suggest additional avenues of adaptive success that do not rely on agronomically important traits. For part three, over 200 genetic accessions with three replicates per generation were scanned in a CT-scanner to produce 3D reconstructions of the spikes. Using mathematical equations to describe the shape of the seeds and spikes we see a reduction in variance from early to late generations.
