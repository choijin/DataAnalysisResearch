<AbstractNarration>Federal and international drinking water standards do not specifically address hexavalent chromium despite its known carcinogenic effects. Evidence for naturally occurring sources and ubiquitous distribution of hexavalent chromium and other contaminants in aquifers in North Carolina has increased public awareness and calls for regulation of hexavalent chromium in drinking water. Yet the lack of data on the overall distribution and sources of hexavalent chromium in groundwater has caused ambiguity in the decision making process. The proposed EAGER project will provide state and federal agencies the needed information to evaluate and predict the occurrence of hexavalent chromium and other naturally occurring contaminants such as arsenic and vanadium in drinking water wells in the Eastern U.S. This information is critical for assessing the risks of hexavalent chromium and other naturally occurring contaminants and thus will provide better assessment on the associated human health implications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed EAGER project aims to evaluate the factors that control the occurrence of hexavalent chromium, arsenic, and vanadium contaminants in groundwater from different aquifers in the Eastern U.S. The project will establish a comprehensive geochemical database, combined with isotopic fingerprints (87Sr/86Sr) for tracing the aquifer lithology from which the contaminants are mobilized. The project will establish a geochemical model for the prediction of the occurrence of hexavalent chromium and other naturally occurring contaminants in groundwater that incorporates multiple factors (geology, hydrogeology, redox state, pH, water chemistry) that control the speciation and solubility of these contaminants in groundwater resources.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is a groundwater contaminant that is potentially harmful to human health. The co-occurrence of Cr(VI) and other oxyanion-forming elements like arsenic (As), vanadium (V), and uranium (U) in drinking water may pose combined and enhanced risks to human health beyond the effects of the single contaminants. Understanding the occurrence of Cr(VI) and other oxyanion-forming elements in groundwater resources is critical for evaluating their risks to human health. This NSF project aims to evaluate the occurrence of Cr(VI), As, V, and U in groundwater across North Carolina, and the factors that control their distribution in groundwater. The study is based on a large dataset (n=1494) of water quality including Cr(VI) and other oxyanion-forming elements concentrations in public, private, and monitoring wells from different aquifers across North Carolina. These water quality data come from new and previous measurements conducted at Duke University, as well as data reported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, and the U.S. Geological Survey. Through geospatial and geochemical analysis, this project evaluates the effect of aquifer lithology and geochemical conditions on the prevalence of the oxyanion-forming elements in groundwater. The data show that Cr(VI) is the predominant species of dissolved Cr and the oxyanion-forming elements occur mostly in groundwater from fractured igneous and metamorphic formations throughout the Piedmont and Blue Ridge regions, with different concentration distributions in different lithologies and higher concentrations than groundwater from the coastal plain. Additionally, groundwater pH and oxidation state were found to be important factors governing the occurrence of these redox sensitive elements in the groundwater. Though there is only one exceedance of the U.S. EPA Maximum Contaminant Level (100 ppb for total chromium) in the dataset, over half of all wells measured for Cr(VI) (470 out of 865) in the dataset exceeded the North Carolina Health Advisory Level of 0.07 ppb.&nbsp;&nbsp;Using information from this dataset, the study explores three different approaches to predicting Cr(VI) in groundwater: (1) total chromium concentrations as a proxy for Cr(VI); (2) exceedance probabilities of health goals for groundwater from aquifers located in specific geologic areas; and (3) censored linear regression using commonly measured field parameters (pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen) with relationships to Cr(VI) as regressors.
