<AbstractNarration>The Santa Fe Institute (SFI) will host the Harold Morowitz Symposium in August 2017. This Symposium will honor the long career of a major figure in the origin of the fields of biophysics and genetics, who also played a significant role in science policy. The two-day Symposium will be divided into two separate sections: first an opportunity for personal recollections of Morowitz's contributions and influences on the participants and second, a focus on a selection of major areas where Morowitz started new fields or made major contributions: genetics, biophysics; and science policy. Morowitz was a leading figure in shaping not only the scientific but also the popular understanding of the geochemical origins of life on Earth. He was a good communicator of science at the popular level and his work resulted in many nontechnical articles and a permanent exhibit on the origin of life at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science. The proposed Symposium will include participants from diverse community of fields, genders and career stages. The results of the event will be published in one of SFI's Intelligence Reports disseminated to a wide variety of readers including those in academia, business and the general public&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morowitz's early academic research and writing often dealt with thermodynamic themes and the pervasive roles of physical principles in biology. Increasingly throughout his career, he turned from searches for minimal life forms to more and more comprehensive attempts to frame the nature and origin of life. Starting in the late 1960s and continuing through the end of his life, Morowitz was a leading figure in shaping the scientific understanding of the geochemical origins of life on Earth. In particular, his writings played a significant role in elaborating one of two frameworks that has become important for understanding life's origins: known as "metabolism first", this view tries to anchor specific, universal features of biochemistry in geochemical constraints, as a precursor and foundation for the later information-dominated view termed the "RNA world".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly cofounded by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physics of Living System in the Division of Physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On 10-12 August 2017, the Santa Fe Institute hosted a symposium to honor the life and work of Harold J. Morowitz, and to map the frontier of innovation in fields of biological research that have been changed by his contributions.  Morowitz was a pioneer in biophysics, computational biology, and the origin of life, whose work across more than six decades witnessed the shift of most major paradigms of biology, from the birth of molecular biology to the modern understanding of bioenergetics and the discovery of the deep suboceanic biosphere that is our best current model for early life.  He was also a prolific and effective writer of science for the public, a witness and advisor serving the engagement of science in society, and a mentor to generations of influential scientists.   The symposium participants, comprising historians, scientists, philosophers, program officers, and business leaders, reviewed shifts in the major currents of thought and policy in biology in the second half of the 20th century.  Important changes in that time include much tighter collaborations, and overlap of principles, across biology, physics, planetary science, and computer science, all directions that Prof. Morowitz had espoused and that many of the participants had been instrumental in bringing into existence.  Perhaps the most central theme in the second half of Morowitz's career &mdash; the origin of life &mdash; has also been one of the most profoundly changed.  First gaining acceptance as a serious area for scientific study only in 1953, it is now a flourishing transdisciplinary, worldwide enterprise.  The search for the origin of life has also shaped our understanding of the nature of life, as we have learned of much closer and more detailed connections between life's chemistry and its planetary context than were known when Morowitz's career began.  The closing discussions of the symposium aimed to capture and organize the intellectual merit of its diverse presentations.  Many important synergies or convergences were noted that define the modern forefront of research.  These include the role of studies of planets outside the solar system in shaping our understanding of Earth, and of planetary science in shaping our understanding of life.  Also noted were the integration of physics, chemistry, and information theory into modern biology, certain convergences between our established theory of matter and our search for a theory of non-equilibrium dynamics, and the way modern theories of cognition illuminate core functions in life.  Intriguing questions were raised, such as whether planets as a whole can senesce, placing the origin and the persistence of life into different contexts.  A session devoted to scientific funding also discussed how these insights could contribute to a coherent and innovative yet grounded framing of scientific priorities in biology and origins studies in the coming decades.  A parallel theme in the symposium to scientific research and science policy was education and high-quality, responsible engagement between scientists and the larger public.  One of Prof. Morowitz's major accomplishments in the first decade of the 21st century was his design of a teacher-support and museum outreach program at the Santa Fe Institute, as part of the Broader Impact of work on the Origin of Life supported by the National Science Foundation.  The program was a four-way collaboration of ongoing educational efforts at SFI, the NSF supported researchers, the Media Arts department at New Mexico Highlands University, and the New Mexico Governor's Office of Cultural Affairs.  The program included intensive week-long workshops at SFI or at Morowitz's home institution of George Mason, in which high school teachers created new curriculum in collaboration with project scientists, and NMHU students designed museum exhibits using the same materials, one of which now stands as a permanent installation in the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science.  The architects of these projects were participants in the symposium, and their work has since grown into long-term educational support for Computer Science educators in New Mexico, and has been mutually supportive with projects at SFI that led to an NSF-sponsored program designed to attract New Mexico girls to careers in science, technology, engineering, math, and information and communications technology.
