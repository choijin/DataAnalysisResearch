<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the integration of people and computation in the context of qualitative inductive methods (QIMs), in which experts deeply engage with text corpora such as open-ended surveys, transcribed interviews, or collections of social media content. This engagement can produce insights, but constraints on expertise and time make these methods hard to scale to large datasets. Technologies like machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), which can mine certain kinds of patterns from text data at scales not feasible for even large teams of humans, may offer a way forward; however, machines make mistakes understanding the nuances of language, lack the context and expertise of human analysts, and may fail to detect interesting small-scale patterns necessary to solve particular problems. The goal of this project is to scale up the use of QIMs by inverting traditional models where humans are used to verify computational results ("human-in-the-loop"), starting instead with human insights that can be amplified through computational models, support, and suggestions for analysis ("computer-in-the-loop"). Working with collaborators in domains including mental health, public health, disaster response, policy making, and philanthropy, the team will conduct qualitative studies of their QIM practices and needs, then develop and evaluate systems with the goal of improving both the quality and scale of the insights experts can generate.  The team will produce publicly available versions of the tools and disseminate them through an online community for interested researchers from all fields.  The project activities will also inform courses on information visualization, human computer interaction, and applied machine learning, along with workshops aimed at recruiting high school women to careers in computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is organized around three main threads.  The first thread is to conduct a deep analysis of qualitative work processes, using both existing accounts of qualitative work in the literature and participant observation methods with at least 10 teams who approach QIM from a range of disciplines, domains, and scales. Through analysis of interviews, logs, and artifacts, the team will generate rich descriptions of these work processes that will further both understanding of QIMs as a method and identify open problems amenable to computational support. The second thread is to develop computational models of QIMs that align with analysts' processes and judgments around qualitative data, using a variety of datasets from the research team and their partners. Because many QIM methods label specific text passages as relevant to a specific concept, taking those as positive examples and nearby, unlabeled data as negative examples may allow QIMs to be modeled as a series of binary classification problems.  This will allow the team to use NLP methods guided by domain knowledge and insights from the first thread to generate features for machine learning-based models. The third thread involves connecting these models to analysts' processes through a series of passage-level, document-level, and theme-level visualizations that leverage the models' predictions to suggest other passages relevant to a concept in a given document, hierarchical aggregation of patterns across documents to support the extraction of higher-level themes along with ways to merge and divide concepts, and statistical analysis of the prevalence of themes in corpora-level analysis. The algorithms and tools will be evaluated through a series of offline tests against existing analyzed datasets, short analysis challenge contests in workshop settings to evaluate usability and reactions to the tool, longitudinal three-month deployments with partners that involve weekly semi-structured questionnaires about their usability in practice, and in an online community to both provide support for and collect feedback about the system while growing a methodological community of practice around this style of big data analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
