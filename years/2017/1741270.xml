<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project entails increasing the ability of commercial users of mass spectrometry to bring better products to market through the use of technology that better molecular identification and quantification. Commercial users of mass spectrometry include pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology firms, and other companies that have a direct impact on public health and wellbeing and are currently limited in social impact and revenue, in part, due to the inability to accurately identify and quantify molecules in mass spectrometry samples.  Specific applications for the technology includes research and development on a variety of products, including diagnostic tests, novel drugs, and personalized medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will investigate the commercial delivery of mass spectrometry data processing services. The underlying technology advances current capabilities by combining advanced statistical methods, additional information present in mass spectrometry signals but not used by current approaches, and novel methods for interpretation to identify more molecules than current mass spectrometry approaches with more quantitative accuracy than current approaches. The research is particularly capable of detecting low abundance molecules, which are exceptionally difficult to detect with current methods, and are more likely to have biological significance than high abundance molecules. Corporate mass spectrometry users can use accurate identifications and quantifications of low abundance molecules to shorten time-to-market, reduce development costs, and increase the production throughput and significance of innovations across a broad spectrum of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The objective of this project was to investigate the commercial prospects of mass spectrometry signal processing research. As part of this project, we (1) completed lean-launch boot camp training and (2) conducted customer discovery through more than 100 face-to-face interviews with scientists who use mass spectrometry software. The lean-launch training was attended by two university professors, one graduate student, and one established entrepreneur. Participants learned about the startup search process for product-market fit, value proposition definition, and how to use the customer canvas to explore potential customers through interview-based experimental hypothesis testing. The graduate student and the PI were able to develop their networking and interviewing skills as they proceeded through the scheduling and interviewing process. We spent two months on the road visiting cities around the country to conduct interviews. One principle finding of the study was that users of mass spectrometry software have markedly different perceptions of the state of the art than the developers of that software. Another principle finding was that almost all users of mass spectrometry software are hindered in their ability to analyze experimental results by the unintuitive and limited behavior of current offerings.
