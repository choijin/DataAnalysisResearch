<AbstractNarration>NSF 1627693&lt;br/&gt;Bruce Western &lt;br/&gt;Harvard University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an era of historically high US incarceration rates, the transition from prison to the community of released prisoners has had far-reaching effects on the population and poverty dynamics of neighborhoods of concentrated disadvantage. Despite a large body of research studying the effects of incarceration, relatively few studies have analyzed in detail the process of leaving prison and entering a community. In this context, this project extends prior research by offering innovative new analyses of data and the creation of publicly available data files from the Boston Reentry Study (BRS), a longitudinal study of 122 Massachusetts state prisoners newly-released to the Boston area that yielded an unparalleled response rate of 94 percent through 4 waves of follow-up in the year after prison release. The current project will thus provide a unique data set, including rich quantitative and qualitative information for the analysis of community return for a sample of newly-released prisoners under contemporary conditions of mass incarceration.  The current project---including new analysis and data dissemination---will greatly expand the scope of the study's influence by informing policy debates on programs for transitional employment after prison, social supports for families that do much of the caring work immediately after incarceration, and for recidivism reduction, identifying key vulnerabilities in the year after prison release. The research will also play an important role in the academic development of students with interests in poverty and incarceration by involving them in the analysis of data and preparation of papers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current project will broaden understanding of the connection of a highly marginal population to mainstream social institutions, allowing in particular new analyses of family relationships, employment, and recidivism. The project comprises two main parts. First, new data analysis will capitalize on a variety of unique features of the BRS data. Income data are available monthly and include measures of wages, public assistance, support from families and illegal earnings. Data on families and children includes all sources of family support including the parents of released prisoners, and all children, allowing a complete mapping of multiple partner fertility. The analysis of recidivism will combine quantitative criminal record information with qualitative accounts including re-incarceration interviews yielding a new understanding of the social process of returning to custody, particularly for those who are relapsing to addiction or violating the conditions of community supervision. Second, archival work on the BRS will involve the preparation of a public-use data set, restricted-use data files including criminal records and other sensitive data, and qualitative materials including interview transcripts or audio tapes. The dissemination of these data will allow a wide variety of analyses of the process of social integration after incarceration, will promote mixed methods research that combines statistical analysis with the interpretative analysis of recorded and transcribed interviews and will contribute a unique public good to the community of scholars working on the problems of incarceration and poverty.</AbstractNarration>

Briefly summarize the outcomes of your award (200 &ndash; 800 words) covering the entire life of the award      This project yielded a book publication and new analyses in the areas of neighborhood attainment and attachment, parent-child relationships, drug use, incomes and employment, and health. It also archived the Boston Reentry Study?s unique and rich dataset through digitization and a public-use data file.   The Boston Reentry Study (BRS) combines an intensive one-year panel survey of 122 formerly-incarcerated men and women. It interviews people a week before their release from prison, and an additional four interviews over the 12-month period post-release.  The great richness of the BRS data sheds new light on the immediate period following release from prison, the role of criminal justice institutions in poor communities, and its effects on the daily lives of formerly incarcerated men and women.   A key goal of this project has been to analyze the Boston Reentry Study?s high-frequency data in key topical areas, including employment, neighborhood attainment, and drug use. Throughout the grant period, results have been disseminated through a book, and several published and working papers.   The book, Homeward: Life in the Year after Prison, was published by Professor Western in May 2018 with the Russell Sage Foundation press. Homeward details the stories of the men and women of the Boston Reentry Study, capturing their experiences not only during the year after leaving prison but also during childhood and adolescence. The book indicates that imprisonment is followed by deep poverty and demonstrates how these men and women also struggled greatly with human frailty &mdash; mental illness, addiction, and physical disability &mdash; that threaten success after incarceration and impair the effectiveness of programs.     Analysis of the parent-child relationship and patterns of parental involvement of men and women coming out prison revealed the unevenness of social support across children, and variation over the first year after prison release. It indicates that contact between formerly incarcerated parents and their children are closely associated with housing instability, complexity of family relationships, and drug use and crime. These results are described further in the paper, "Formerly-Incarcerated Parents and their Children," published in Demography.  A second paper, "Place after Prison: Neighborhood Attainment and Attachment During Reentry," published in the Journal of Urban Affairs, analyzes the disparities in neighborhood attainment and challenges in neighborhood attachment. It shows how neighborhood detachment is a function of conditions of material hardship, mental illness and addiction, limited access to housing via residential households, and criminal justice involvement after prison release.  A paper analyzing patterns of drug use post-release and its association with risk factors such as addiction history and childhood is currently under review. Preliminary analysis of the health data reveal higher prevalence of mental health conditions in the sample than the general population.      Another paper currently under review focuses on the BRS analysis of incomes and employment integrated all sources of monthly, including off-the-book earning and family support, to model the income trajectories and to capture derivations of economic hardships in the first year after prison release. These papers speak to important policy questions about the scale of incarceration and measures to ease the transition from prison to community.   As part of this project, the Boston Reentry Study dataset was also archived. This included digitizing the BRS records and creating a public use data file. Digitizing the records has facilitated the mixed-methods analysis of researchers participating in the project. The creation of the public-use data file was completed. This dataset will provide researchers with a rich, high-frequency dataset that will allow them to examine the dynamics of prisoner reentry, to study how events and experiences early in the process of transition are related to those later on.  Leaving prison presents the formerly-incarcerated with the challenge of social integration, of establishing membership in free society, of forming or re-establishing relationships and learning new social roles.  These new BRS analyses will contribute significantly to policy debates about incarceration at a time when momentum is gathering for criminal justice reform and the deposited data will provide a public good of broad use to social scientists conducting research on crime and criminal justice.
