<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel funds for U.S.-based graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the mathematical sciences to attend the Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF) during September 24-29, 2017. The HLF brings together Laureates of the most prestigious awards in computer science and mathematics to spend a week interacting with approximately two hundred early career researchers. As these researchers represent over forty different countries, in addition to the scientific exchanges with the Laureates and with each other, they gain a valuable global perspective on current research in computer science and mathematics. Modeled on the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, the HLF provides graduate students and postdoctoral researchers with extraordinary access to a group of scientific role models through lectures, small group discussions, and casual conversations. Such experiences can have a profound impact on the development of an early career researcher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) recruits a highly qualified and diverse applicant pool for the Forum using social media, on-line forums, and listservs. Applicants undergo peer review for final selection. There are many exceptionally promising early career researchers who have little or no opportunity to interact with the Laureates of the major prizes in the computer and mathematical sciences. The HLF is a unique opportunity for these individuals, one that can energize and steer future research. The recruitment and selection of participants emphasizes the potential benefits of the opportunity for the researchers, as well as the overall goal of ensuring a broadly inclusive group of participants. ORAU provides logistical support both prior to and during the forum, arranges additional on-site enrichment activities, and performs an assessment of participant experiences to document the impact of the Forum.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award funded three PhD mathematics students to attend the Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF) held in Heidelberg, Germany from September 23 to September 29, 2018.  This delegation of the future American mathematicians was enabled with the opportunity to interact with Laureates of prestigious computer science and mathematics awards - namely the Abel Prize, Fields Medal, Nevanlinna Prize, and the A.M. Turing Award - and with other high caliber graduate students from around the world. This was an unusual year in that very few PhD mathematics students from the US were accepted to the Forum and most of those who were accepted received funding from an alternative source. The few slots available to US students and are highly coveted. The selection process is rigorous due to the prestige of the Forum.  HLF provided opportunities to form new research collaboration with Laureates and other students.  Participants gained a valuable global perspective on mathematics that prepares them for leadership in the global community.   The philosophy of the HLF is rooted in the words of the late Dr. Klaus Tschira, forum founder. He wrote: "Mathematics and computer science pervade all aspects and spheres of life.  They provide the foundation for today's highly engineered and modern society, and they belong to our culture.  Their social relevance will continue to grow."  In that spirit, the meeting connects these young researchers to collaborate and further the discipline as they mature professionally and to bridge the gap between the generations of mathematics research.   The HLF gave participants an opportunity for interaction that is typically not available within their normal university environment, whereby Laureates provided formal plenary lectures and led small group discussions with topics driven by a combination of prepared presentations as well as student questions.  The Laureates presented on a broad selection of topics related to mathematics. This year?s events included poster sessions, a Women in Math exhibition, and several networking events.
