<AbstractNarration>Image reconstruction and feature extraction have been important aspects in various applications such as medical resonance imaging (MRI) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). However, these procedures involve challenges. Different applications may vary in data acquisition (sampling) domains, levels of detail required, and processing domains for the features of interest. The data acquisition is usually under-prescribed and noisy. The sampling domains and/or processing domains may not be well suited for the underlying question. All of these make the problems ill-posed, and various regularization techniques are necessary to study the problems by formulating them as convex optimization models. This project will develop an integrated framework of investigating such convex optimization models. The project will provide graduate students with opportunities for training through research involvement and will prepare them for careers in science and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs aim to propose a systematic way of evaluating various regularization techniques in such models, conduct a rigorous numerical analysis of the models, and develop efficient numerical algorithms of solving the models. Specifically, the PIs will address the following technical questions: (1) What constraints must be placed on the collected data in order to construct a numerically robust approximation to the underlying function? (2) How quickly and in what sense does the approximation converge? (3) Are the corresponding numerical algorithms developed for the fidelity and regularization terms viable? (4) How well are perturbations from the original data tolerated? The project aims to provide answers to all of these questions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Compressive sensing (CS) is a widely used tool for solving inverse problems, especially in situations where the acquired data are under-sampled, noisy, or otherwise difficult to directly invert.  Although CS enjoys success for a number of application domains, there are issues of robustness, accuracy, and efficiency that still must be addressed.  In particular, the method often depends on the fine tuning of parameters to ensure the proper balance between the fidelity and regularization terms.  Moreover, sometimes what is intended to be sparse is not actually measurably sparse.  Finally, false information, whether intentional or as a consequence of machine error, can greatly impact the accuracy of the result.   The outcomes of the investigations supported by this funding award have led to more robust regularizations when some underlying feature of a function (image) are presumably sparse.  When multiple measurements are available, the newly developed variance based joint sparsity algorithm provides a robust, efficient and accurate image reconstruction.  Efficiency is further improved because the costly l1 regularization term can be replaced by a weighted l2 term.  The method has been tested on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and parallel MRI.   There are also applications for solving conservation laws in partial differential equations that admit shocks.  Most important, perhaps, is that the parameters for the problem are much more automated, and do not have to be tuned for each application.  Recent work at the AFRL Wright Patterson has used the VBJS method to develop a classification strategy for automatic target recognition.
