<AbstractNarration>1705823 (Sassenrath).  Claypan soils cover approximately 4 million hectares in the US and are characterized by a highly impermeable layer below the topsoil. This impermeable layer may create lateral flow within the soil matrix that increases the rate of erosion of the topsoil. Surface vegetation increases the erosion resistance at the surface of claypan soils; however, the limited topsoil continues to diminish annually. This research addresses the need to identify the mechanisms that are causing this sediment loss and restore the ecological function of soil and water ecosystems before the topsoil is irretrievably lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to test the hypothesis that the impermeable claypan layer is increasing soil erosion by undermining topsoil. This will be achieved by measuring the erodibility and strength of soil samples from areas where soil management practices are identical yet soil loss is variable. The variability has been identified by aerial imagery, terrain analysis, yield maps and surface conductivity measurements. Geotechnical delineation of erodibility will be measured using a variety of geotechnical methodologies, including an Erosion Function Apparatus in the laboratory and a Jet Erosion Test in the field. The primary hypothesis of this research is that topsoil is undergoing undermining erosion within the soil core which is further reducing its shear strength and thus increasing the erodibility. Measured strength and erosion parameters will be used to better predict sediment loss. The research plan has been developed in close collaboration with local landowners. The understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that are resulting in the claypan erodibility phenomena will be shared with landowners so appropriate land use management practices can be developed and implemented. The multidisciplinary leadership team of an agronomist, a geotechnical engineer, and a mass communications specialist will work closely with Extension personnel, conservationists and landowners to address this multifaceted problem and implement change.</AbstractNarration>

Erosion around buildings and engineered systems creates instability. Soil loss impairs the productive capacity of agricultural lands. This research explored the mechanisms of erosion processes in claypan soils, specifically in agricultural lands.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Claypan soils are characterized by an abrupt change in soil texture from an impermeable layer within the soil profile. Claypan soils are found in over 4 M ha (10 M acres), primarily in the central US. We tested the hypothesis that the clay layer contributed to erosion by undermining the surface soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Geophysical methods were used to spatially map soil changes and identify areas for further study. The apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measurements mapped soil characteristics over large areas of land to identify regions of variability for further study (Figure 1, lines). Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) measured changes in soil characteristics through a slice into the soil profile. ERT surveys were performed along transects in the fields, and showed changes in soil texture with depth in the soil profile (Figure 2). Previous research has shown that the depth to the clay layer can change throughout the field. However, our ERT results indicated that the clay layer, thought to be continuous throughout the region, varied in depth and at some locations was not present. Changes in soil erodibility were then examined with depth at these locations. Additional samples were collected for laboratory erosion tests (Figure 2, boxes), and in-field erosion tests were conducted (Figure 2, arrows).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Soil erosion occurs when the applied stress on the soil surface is greater than the soil?s resistance against external stresses. The stress at which soil resistance is overcome and erosion begins is the critical shear stress. The higher the critical shear stress, the more resistant the soil is to erosion. Two erosion methods were used to determine the critical shear stress and identify the variability in soil erosion with depth, including the erosion function apparatus in the laboratory (EFA; Figure 3) and the jet erosion test in the field (JET; Figure 4). The EFA test was used to measure critical shear stress of the claypan because it can test at very high stresses. The JET was used in the field to measure the rate of soil erosion at both the soil surface and at lower points within the soil profile. Soil samples were also collected to determine the soil type (based on particle size and plasticity), strength, and permeability.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The results from the laboratory and in-field erosion testing indicated that the soils with higher plasticity and lower permeability had higher critical shear stress, and thus were more resistant to erosion. Conversely, the soils with lower plasticity were more permeable, with lower critical shear stress. These soils were more likely to erode. The unique finding from these results was the large variability in erosion at spots relatively close to each other. &nbsp;At select locations, the JET test indicated a lower critical shear stress at the surface and a higher critical shear stress 25 cm (10 inches) below the surface. This supported our hypothesis that the underlying claypan may enhance erosion due to undermining of the more permeable soil at the claypan interface. The structure of these claypan soils, with a more permeable and erodible soil layer overlying a less permeable and more erosion-resistant claypan layer, enhances erosion of the permeable upper soil layer. We identified that the claypan is increasing the amount of soil loss per year at rates of six to ten times higher than the rest of the field. Furthermore, these results highlighted that the claypan was not found throughout the field, but rather in discrete locations identified by ERT.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The results of this research contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of soil erosion in claypan soils and will improve management of these soils to reduce sediment loss and improve water quality. The research was delivered to landowners through in-field demonstrations (Figure 5), extension presentations, and stakeholder groups, reaching an estimated 700 landowners. The research was developed into classroom presentations for Civil Engineering (CE 816: Advanced Testing in Geosystems, KSU, 7 graduate students; CE522: Soil Mechanics, KSU, 100 undergraduate students) and Agronomy (AG655: Terrain Analysis; 20 students; Iola Community College, 12 students).
