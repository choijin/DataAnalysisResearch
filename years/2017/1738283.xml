<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is catalyzing the shift from mobile to spatial computing through enabling Augmented Reality (AR) technology.  AR has a broad impact across many use cases such as instruction, visualization, and entertainment.  AR offers an intuitive visualization that decreases the cognitive overhead for the user, thus providing an environment with less manufacturing mistakes, better-visualized parts, or real-time data visualizations for example.  Such technology enhances the abilities of people by showing the relevant information when it is needed to the user. This context-aware visualization tool offers a personalized experience in a way that brings digital content into the physical world in an intuitive, spatially consistent manner. This growing new technology has the potential to change how people interact with digital content in the physical world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project addresses the problem of estimating a partially observable three-dimensional manifold in conjunction with a full 6-degree of freedom pose from inertial measurements and sequential two-dimensional luminescent representations of semi-static observations - a fundamental problem for Augmented Reality (AR).  Inertial observations alone provide minimal uncertainty for up to a tenth of a second using commercially available and ubiquitous hardware, thus limiting the accuracy pose estimation and, for practical long-term applications, necessitating visual input to be jointly fused in.  This project focuses on ubiquitous handheld computing platforms, inducing resource constraint considerations for both accuracy and human interface experiences.  Further computational considerations need to be made for enabling parallel application-specific processes, thus further limiting available resources.</AbstractNarration>

This I-Corps project explored the commercialization potential of an emerging technology that provides the real?world context for learning. The technology concerns the tracking and situational awareness algorithms that work on existing commercial hardware (mobile phones with cameras and internal sensors). As a result, this is a generic solution for interactive Augmented Reality via a regular mobile phone cameras which allow anchoring and interactions with the real world.      As a result of the training, a company was formed and through the customer discovery work during I-Corps identified a compelling customer target and value propotions (product-market fit) . After completing I-Corps the company wassuccessful in developing the technology to the point of practical applications.  It raised over $3 million dollars in angel and Venture Capital investments.  It created 6 jobs. The company was then acquired and up to 40 new positions will be created specifically related to further growth of the technology by the new owner.
