<AbstractNarration>The workshop "Simulating QCD on Lefschetz thimbles" will be held between June 28 and June 30, 2017, at the European Centre for Theoretical Studies in Nuclear Physics and Related Areas (ECT*). This workshop will bring together researchers in the area of Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) to study a promising new approach to solving QCD on the lattice that is expected to alleviate deficiencies of current methods. Developing reliable methods of calculating the properties of QCD is important, because QCD is the theory of strong interactions that binds fundamental particles known as quarks and gluons into protons and neutrons, the building blocks of atomic nuclei. If successful, the new approach will have significant impact on the experimental program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop represents a good opportunity for junior researchers to further their training and improve their careers. To make this possible, NSF funding will provide partial travel support for junior scientists, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, to attend this workshop. The focus of this activity on new methods to solving Lattice QCD at finite density is expected to improve the understanding of experiments at relativistic ion colliders that study the quark-gluon plasma properties and the location of the QCD critical point.</AbstractNarration>
