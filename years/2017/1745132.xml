<AbstractNarration>The organizers of this workshop will convene a forum of women of color who hold Full Professor rank in engineering programs as well as their peers from the Diversity Committee, Women in Engineering, and Minorities Divisions of the American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE).  The workshop is intended to advance knowledge and understanding of evidence-based strategies for increasing the entry, retention and advancement of African American women in the engineering academy. The quality of previous work done by the proposers as well as the resources available to them means leadership in this effort by a highly qualified team that has key insights into the challenges of this population. The proposers have national resources and relationships to broadly disseminate the outcomes as well as access to institutions and organizations where these strategies can be implemented. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will result in models for enhancing the participation of African American and other underrepresented individuals in engineering as faculty and leaders. This forum is likely to produce collaborations and alliances that will result in future efforts for implementing organizational change strategies to address inequities.  The results will be disseminated broadly and will result in actionable proposals to enhance the participation in engineering by individuals traditionally underrepresented in engineering.   The longer term potential benefits to society include increasing role models in engineering and increasing the diversity in the innovation sector.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Diversity of thought is a vital component of the nation's ability to reach its greatest potential in the advancement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  This ideal can be supported by ensuring that the composition of STEM professions, particularly higher education, is representative of the population. However, a number of groups, including African American women, are significantly underrepresented in this realm. In 2017, fewer than thirty African American women held the rank of Full Professor in engineering programs throughout the United States.  There is a need to understand and address the challenges facing female engineering faculty of color.  This project was developed to support the assembly of African American women in engineering programs at the 2017 American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) Annual Conference in Columbus, Ohio. The attendance of members of ASEE's Diversity Committee, Women in Engineering, and Minorities Division, as well as those likely to occupy key roles in the professional advancement of African American women in the academy was also encouraged.  The objective of the meeting was to provide a forum for candid discussion of the individual and collective experiences the women incurred when seeking advancement within the academy.  Through the discussion, factors that enhanced their opportunities and obstacles that deterred their advancement would be identified in an effort to develop strategies that promote gender and racial equity.  The forum was successfully convened the evening of Monday June 26, 2017. In total, 32 individuals from a number of institutions across the United States participated, including then ASEE President-Elect, Dr. Bevlee Watford, who would become the first African American Female President of the ASEE.  As intended, the forum created a national resource, or "Think Tank," of women of color who have succeeded in the academy. It also provided an opportunity for those in academic leadership positions (i.e. department chairs and college deans) to hear this conversation, an essential component of systemic change. The discussion was grounded in authentic, personal experiences, and a consistent strategy of creating a "professional and technical career support network" was identified as critical to the success of each of the women.  This network consisted of mentors, advocates, and peers.  In order to increase access for women of color in engineering education and leadership, it was determined that the creation of this network should be formalized, especially for African American women faculty who have not yet achieved tenure and/or the rank of Full Professor.  The forum served as a first step in formalizing strategies critical to the recruitment, retention, and advancement of both African American women and individuals from other underrepresented groups, and the idea to formalize the creation of support networks was developed into a larger research proposal to the National Science Foundation.  The success of the forum also resulted in a subsequent discussion the following year at the 2018 ASEE Annual Conference in Salt Lake City, Utah, which was televised on a regional news program.  The development of a practical guideline that can be disseminated nationally and internationally to academic leadership, search committees, and search firms is currently being developed in an effort to increase diversity within STEM higher education.
