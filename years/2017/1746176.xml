<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will advance understanding of how game-based methods can be effectively used to help schools bring social emotional learning (SEL) instruction to all students. The end goal of this SBIR project is to create and test a game-based intelligent social tutoring system (ISTS) that both assesses and improves the behavioral readiness and social emotional (SE) skills of Kindergarten and 1st grade (K1) students. SEL is a critically important component of early education for all students, and efforts to bring SEL to the nation?s vulnerable early learners would be particularly impactful, especially in helping to foster equity in academic achievement. The proposed system will guide early learners to learn, and then practice SEL skills in controlled, engaging social simulations. This will provide schools with an easily administered, scalable tool to fill a niche for which there is considerable market pull. In addition to addressing significant societal and market needs, research findings from this SBIR will be used to more broadly inform the efforts of the game development community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a first step in this R&amp;D effort, this SBIR Phase I project will (a) develop a game prototype consisting of six game-based scenes designed to assess essential SE skills linked in the literature to school readiness and positive behavioral functioning for young students (e.g., Emotion Regulation, Empathy, Impulse Control); (b) conduct game prototype test groups with K1 students to assess the usability and acceptability of the game as well as gather independent parent ratings and behavioral observations of children's SE skills; (c) develop prototype educator dashboard materials for administration of the SEL game with students, including resources to reinforce and extend SEL beyond the game; and (d) conduct a test of the game and dashboard prototypes with teachers and other educators who represent likely purchasers and/or users of the product with students to assess the feasibility and potential value of the proposed product.</AbstractNarration>

PHASE I WORK PLAN        Each of these Phase I objectives was successfully completed, and the research with both K-1 students and educators produced compelling evidence that we can achieve our broader innovation R&amp;D goals. Below is a brief summary of key results (complete details follow in subsequent sections).  Zoo Academy?s composite assessment of children?s      social skill performance was significantly correlated with two independent      measures external to the game. The six independent social skill scores      that contribute to this composite showed high internal consistency      (Cronbach?s alpha =.82).   We found significant grade differences      where 1st graders scored higher than kindergarteners.   We saw no significant gender or race      subgroup differences in game performance, supporting our goal for an      assessment free of bias.   When we asked 126 educators if "I would like to use a game like this as      an SEL teaching tool with my students", 120 (96%) responded ?Agree? or      ?Strongly Agree? (mean score 4.5 / 5).              Last Modified: 10/31/2018       Submitted by: James M Thomas]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
