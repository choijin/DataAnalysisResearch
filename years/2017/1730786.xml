<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation by early-career US-based researchers in a high-profile international meeting on set theory to be held July 3-7, 2017 under the auspices of the European Set Theory Society, in the Alfred Renyi Institute Budapest. This meeting, the 6th European Set Theory Society Conference, provides opportunities for early-career researchers to interact with experts in the field, to attend tutorials on recent techniques, and to hear reports of the latest research being undertaken. The homepage of the meeting is: https://sites.google.com/site/6thestc/home&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in the recent decade in set theory have been rapid. New techniques in previously impenetrable areas have exposed interplay between the prima facie disparate areas of forcing axioms, infinite cardinal combinatorics, and inner model theory. Although there have been some tremendous progress on the core problems of set theory, still some fundamental problems remain a mystery. The scope of the conference will include: the theory of definable actions of Polish groups, the structure and classification of their orbit spaces, the closely related study of definable equivalence relations and complete classification problems (in model theory, computability theory, groups representations, topological dynamics, ergodic theory, operator algebras, and combinatorics), advances in the study of PCF theory, cardinal arithmetic, the determination of the consistency strength of combinatorial principles, and application to other fields of mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

The main objective of the meeting was dissemination of new ideas and techniques, as well as providing an occasion for colleagues to interact, and particularly for younger colleagues and early career researchers to make contacts and hear about new research. A highlight of the meeting was the awarding of the biennial Hausdorff Medal for outstanding contributions to set theory for the most influential work in set theory published in the five years preceding the award of the medal. On this, the third occasion of its award, the Hausdorff medal was awarded to Maryanthe Malliaris and Saharon Shelah for their work outlined in the papers: General topology meets model theory, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 110 (2013), no. 33, 13300-13305, Cofinality spectrum theorems in model theory, set theory, and general topology. J. Amer. Math. Soc. 29 (2016), no. 1, 237-297. The Laudatio can be seen at https://ests.wordpress.com/2017/07/05/third-hausdorff-medal-2017/ Professor Malliaris received the prize on behalf of both winners, and gave the Hausdorff Medal Lecture on the second day of the meeting.   Three of the five mornings started with a Tutorial series given by Assaf Rinot (Bar Ilan) on Strong Colourings. These consist of particularly wild colourings or partitions of an uncountable graph, which can be used to answer questions as to whether the product of two kappa-c.c. partial orders is again kappa-cc. Or to answer the question whether there exists a regular hereditary separable topological space which is not Lindel&ouml;f. The tutorial presented techniques in constructing such colourings and how to derive algebraic or topological structures  from them.   There were 21 plenary talks given by senior mathematicians in a variety of areas in modern set theory. These could be roughly classified as follows.   Combinatorics:  A Dow., P. Komj&aacute;th, D. Soukup, P. L&uuml;cke.  P. L&uuml;cke introduced a recent notion of being definably weakly compact which potentially can hold at successor cardinals, but this cannot be decided by large cardinals in the case of aleph_2, for example. D. Soukup spoke on combinatorics arising from techniques using trees of submodels to give proofs of paradoxical subsets of the plane (inter alia).   Applications to Descriptive Set Theory: M. Doucha, V. Fischer, M. Malicki, B. Miller, J. Moore, S. Slowecki, S. Unger.  V. Fischer, following on work of Shelah and Horowitz, showed the existence of large sized, but definable maximal cofinitary groups. J. Moore showed it was consistent relative to a supercompact cardinal that there were no minimal non-sigma-scattered linear orders. S. Unger gave a completely constructive solution to Tarski?s  Circle squaring problem.   Forcing Theory: M. Golshani, M. Hru&scaron;ak, D. Mejia-Guzman, I. Neeman, D. Raghavan.  M. Golshani, in joint work with S. Shelah, showed that any countably closed forcing notion of size continuum being forcing isomorphic to Cohen forcing for adding a new Cohen subset of &omega;1, does not imply the Continuum Hypothesis. This extends  a consequence of PFA to higher cardinals &ndash; a topic much currently discussed. D. Raghavan reported on a new method for proving consistency results involving cardinal invariants, both at &omega; and at uncountable regular cardinals.    Set Theory and Model Theory:  M. Kurili?, M. Malliaris.   M Kurili?  used forcing notions derived from relational structures to give some classification, interpretability and definability results. M. Malliaris in her Hausdorff Medal Lecture spoke on how Keisler?s order connects the set-theoretic study of regular ultrafilters to the model-theoretic study of first-order theories, allowing each to illuminate the structure of the other.    Inner Model Theory and Singular cardinal Combinatorics:  O. Ben Neria, Y.Hayut, T. Usuba. O. Ben Neria addressed the question as to what extent does a compactness properties at a cardinal imply the combinatorial diamond property to hold there. Y. Hayut (joint with Golshani) showed that a countable initial segments of the singular cardinals could all have the tree property at their successors by forcing relative to large cardinals.  T. Usuba  spoke on his recent proof that the grounds of a model of set theory are directed closed; that the intersection of all grounds is a ground (if some large cardinals are available). He mentioned some connections to Woodin?s HOD Conjecture via pseudo-grounds.   There were in addition 32 contributed talks organised in two parallel sessions, and 7 posters produced by PhD students. One objective of the meeting was to allow time for discussion: these were effected via two hour lunch breaks and a free afternoon midway through the meeting.
