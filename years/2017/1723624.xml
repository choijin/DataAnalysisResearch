<AbstractNarration>The memory subsystem of modern computing systems has seen tremendous innovations, incorporating new features to aid programmers in creating fast, secure, correct, and power-efficient software.  Unfortunately, harnessing these features is a challenge, as programming languages do not expose advanced abilities of the memory subsystem to programmers.  This project focuses on the interface between programming languages and memory hardware. The intellectual merits include the creation of a rigorous semantics for memory features, so that programmers can reason about individual features and their composition; and the creation of compilation tools and run-time systems that allow programmers to use new memory features, in isolation or combination, for maximum gain.  The project's broader significance and importance are its impact on the software and hardware industry, by facilitating rapid adoption of new memory features; the education and training of graduate students; and the creation of a tutorial to aid in dissemination and adoption of the developed tools and techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hardware implementations of memory features are typically fast but limited by physical capacity, and the precise semantics of features are often vendor-specific.  The theoretical portion of the work will create rigorous semantics for memory features, which transcend individual implementation and allow programmers and static analysis tools to reason about a program's interaction with memory.  The research will construct virtualized run-time systems to overcome hardware constraints, and to emulate features when they are not present.  Its implementations will employ run-time adaptivity to fine-tune themselves to a given system's feature availability, support for composition of features, and hardware/workload characteristics.  A custom compiler infrastructure, built atop the LLVM system, will provide a lightweight syntax through which programmers can easily add support for memory features to their existing codes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project studied fundamental challenges involved in employing new hardware features, with a specific focus on new types of memory that are emerging in cutting-edge systems.  The project considered four primary types of memory: non-volatile memories, which preserve their contents after power is lost; transactional memories, which can be accessed by multiple processors simultaneously; secure memories, which protect against malicious attacks; and scratchpad memories, which enable programmers to optimize performance when they know that features of a primary memory, like persistence and write-back, are not needed.  This research project looked across the entire "systems" stack, considering applications, programming languages, compilers, and the hardware itself.  Among the most significant outcomes of this research were the invention of new techniques for improving the reliability of non-volatile memory; programming language support for transactional and non-volatile memory, techniques for accelerating workloads through new memory prefetching strategies, and the design and simulation of a new scratchpad memory that can be attached to existing general-purpose processors.  During the course of this research, roughly a dozen research papers were published in journals, highly selective conferences, and workshops.  The algorithms and software artifacts developed during this research have been released as open-source software, available worldwide, and have been shared with several companies, including Intel and Oracle.  Four Ph.D. students and several undergraduate students were directly supported during portions of their education through this research.  This research also led to the initiation or strengthening of research collaborations with Intel, Oracle, Facebook, and several universities.  This grant also supported efforts to substantially enhance education at Lehigh University, through the creation and/or redesign of courses with significant emphasis on computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems.
