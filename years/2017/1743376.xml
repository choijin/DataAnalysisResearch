<AbstractNarration>The ACM MobiCom conference is the leading international conference focusing on systems issues in mobile computing and wireless communications. The topics addressed by MobiCom 2017 are at the core of the current wireless network evolution. The conference attracts research contributions spanning multiple disciplines, including wireless networking, vehicular communications, mobile sensing, personal area networks, mesh networks, distributed algorithms, scheduling, sensors, and signal processing. In addition to the main session, the conference also provides good opportunities to students and researchers to participate in panels, workshops, demos and startup competitions that bring in brilliant ideas and applications in mobile, wireless networking and computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF travel grant program will help increase representation and participation of United States-based graduate and undergraduate students at this conference, and enable sharing of information and preliminary research results among participating students. Participation of top conferences like ACM MobiCom is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing students with an opportunity to interact with more senior researchers, and exposing them to leading edge research in the field. The award will enable graduate students who would be otherwise unable, to attend the main MobiCom 2017 and the associated workshops.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This travel grant award supported participation of graduate students from US institutions at the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking (ACM MobiCom 2017) held between October 16 and October 20, 2017, in Snowbird, Utah, USA. The MobiCom conference is dedicated to addressing the challenges of mobile computing and networking and has emerged as the leading conference covering networks, systems, algorithms, and applications that support the symbiosis of mobile computers and wireless networks. The rich program of the ACM MobiCom 2017 and associated workshops exposed students to new ideas and cutting-edge research and allowed for interaction with leading researchers from all over the world.  Through this award, the ACM MobiCom 2017 conference was able to stimulate several intellectual activities by allowing students to participate in the mobile app competition and the student research competition. The participation of graduate students in MobiCom had an important impact in shaping their careers by meeting leading senior researchers and creating opportunities for future collaborations. A particular emphasis of this grant was to broaden the participation to the first-time attendees and under-represented groups (women, minorities, and people with disabilities). Over 50% of the travel grants were given to students in these two categories.                      Last Modified: 09/27/2018       Submitted by: Mike P Wittie]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
