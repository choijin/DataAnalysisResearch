<AbstractNarration>This project will secure an endangered collection of approximately 500 diverse, living strains of a fungal group known as chytrids.  As the world's largest collection of chytrids, it serves as a resource to the research community by providing cultures to biologists in both academic and industrial settings, resulting in biological insights found in over 200 published articles.  Although these microscopic fungi reproduce with a swimming spore they occur in soils as well as in fresh and saline waters; they fill important ecological roles as parasites and also by degrading substrates such as pollen and other plant material, insect exoskeletons, hair, etc.  Chytrids are notorious for their role in the global decline of amphibians; the collection contains over 180 strains of the amphibian pathogen from around the world.  This collection was developed and maintained by Joyce Longcore at the University of Maine without institutional support for more than 25 years.  To safeguard the chytrid collection, it will be moved to the University of Michigan's recently remodeled Research Museums Complex where it will be stored in a state-of-the-art cryopreservation facility and managed by the University's Herbarium unit. The collection will be a resource for the scientific community involved in research on chytrids and their function in terrestrial and aquatic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chytrid fungi require special growth and maintenance conditions, because they are aquatic fungi that reproduce with flagellated, wall-less zoospores. Most of the University of Maine collection is cryopreserved, making inter-institutional transfer in a frozen state possible, however, approximately 12% of the collection is routinely transferred in liquid cultures, because it has not been amendable to freezing. The first goal of the project is to move the collection in Maine to the Research Museums Complex in Ann Arbor where fungal strains will be stored in liquid nitrogen freezers.  Cryopreservation in the vapor of liquid nitrogen stabilizes samples at -193 degrees Celsius; because inadvertent exposure to temperatures above -80 affects the viability of frozen cultures, storage in liquid nitrogen is safer than storage in typical ultralow freezers with electrical compressors.  A second goal of this project is to develop methods to freeze and secure the remaining 12% of strains that have been resistant to cryopreservation.  To verify taxonomic assignments of the culture collection and to better characterize its contents, DNA barcoding will be performed by sequencing and making accessible the 18S and ITS ribosomal RNA gene regions.  Finally, this project will transform the collection into a public resource by making additional data about the strains accessible online and improving the distribution and maintenance of the cultures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Chytrids are fungi that grow in aquatic and terrestrial habitats and play diverse ecological roles. At times they may be of major societal importance, such as the agent of the pandemic of amphibian disease caused by a chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. The fungi produce swimming spores and are microscopic, making them poorly known and mostly the study of specialists. Much of the existing diversity of culturable chytrids has been through the work of a single researcher, Dr. Joyce E. Longcore, at the University of Maine. Dr. Longcore has for decades developed a collection of over 900 strains, but the stability of her collection was unclear due its age and the lack of institutional support. In this project, we transferred the Longcore collection to the University of Michigan&rsquo;s Herbarium and created a subcollection called, the Collection of Zoosporic Eufungi at the University of Michigan (CZEUM). The CZEUM has received over 700 Longcore collections which we validated as active and stored in multiple vials in the state-of-the-art cryopreservation facility at the U. Michigan Research Museums Complex. The collection includes over 230 strains of Batrachochytrium. We have fully characterized the collection using DNA barcodes, making nearly all isolates associated with genetic information at three ribosomal RNA loci. The collection data is now made publicly available at czeum.herb.lsa.umich.edu and is positioned to handle requests for isolates. This collection is and will continue to support research on the group and preserve this legacy collection which contains dozens of valuable type strains representing the concept of several species. Efforts are underway to expand the collection through addition of strains to improve the utility and centralization of this resource. This project supported the training of 6 scientists in collections-based research, including curation of biological resources, taxonomy, and molecular biology at the postdoctoral, graduate, or undergraduate level.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/15/2020<br>      Modified by: Timothy&nbsp;James</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
