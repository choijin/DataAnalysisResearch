<AbstractNarration>An estimated 10-15% of the U.S. energy consumption is devoted to industrial chemical separations. Petroleum refining fractionates crude oil to make gasoline, diesel, fuel oil, as well as chemical precursors that serve as the feedstocks for the majority of consumer goods. Among these petroleum-derived chemical feedstocks is a chemical intermediate, called para-xylene, that is mainly used for the production of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) plastic fibers, films, bottles and packaging materials. With the widespread use of PET, the demand for para-xylene will exceed 60 million tons, with a market value exceeding 60 billion US dollars, by 2022. Prior to its conversion to textiles and packaging plastics, para-xylene must be separated other very similar molecules, called isomers, that differ only by the positioning of a few atoms within the molecule. Given their near-identical chemical structure, it is impractical to separate para-xylene and its isomers from each other by distillation, as their volatilities are very similar. The current state of the art to purify para-xylene is to utilize adsorption and/or crystallization, but both processes are energy intensive. This research project is developing new membranes with high permeance and selectivity that allow continuous separation of para-xylene from its isomers with improved energy efficiency compared with the current state-of-the-art. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zeolites are hydrated aluminosilicates that are commonly used as cation exchange resins, catalysts, and due to their highly controlled pore size, molecular sieves. Zeolites are stable in organic liquids and vapors at high temperatures and pressures, but until recently, were found only as three-dimensional crystals, which are unsuitable for making thin membrane films. Current zeolite membranes remain too thick to allow high flux of a target molecule and are thus not cost-competitive with other technologies. This research projects is exploring fundamental research on zeolite nanosheet synthesis to make the zeolite crystal ultra thin, which will enable a 10-fold reduction in membrane thickness and a corresponding 10-fold increase in permeance through the membrane. Simultaneously, the research is seeking to reduce membrane defects which is anticipated to increase the separation-factor of para-xylene relative to its isomers 20-fold. Through collaboration with the GOALI industrial partner, Exxon-Mobil, the first-ever systematic permeation measurements are being conducted at the high temperatures and high xylene pressures found at industrially relevant conditions and being coupled with membrane microstructure analysis and quantitative permeation modeling. The work is using electronic structure calculations and molecular simulations to aid in the characterization of the membranes and to predict accurate adsorption-diffusion properties, which will aid in further material design and process optimization. This research on alternative separation technologies is being incorporated as examples in the undergraduate and graduate curriculum and as projects in the process and product design senior undergraduate courses at the University of Minnesota.</AbstractNarration>

This work explored fundamental research on the synthesis of zeolite nanosheets and their use to prepare thin zeolite membranes. Zeolite nanosheets are high-aspect-ratio nanometer-thick crystals that can be made by exfoliation of layered zeolites or by direct seeded synthesis developed at the University of Minnesota. Through collaboration with ExxonMobil, permeation properties of these membranes were determined at high temperature and pressure, i.e., conditions that are encountered in industry. The membranes achieved unprecedented selectivity for separating the components of industrial hydrocarbon mixtures, like xylene isomers, that are difficult to separate by other methods. Membrane performance indicates that an industrial implementation of the technology is feasible.  High resolution electron microscopy revealed unique microstructural characteristics including the weaving of slightly distorted more selective pores within a majority of less selective ones. Electronic structure calculations and molecular simulations were performed to aid in the characterization of the membranes and to predict accurate adsorption-diffusion properties, which guided further material optimization. Major findings are illustrated in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHjZo880x8E.   A key outcome of this research is a novel strategy for making molecular sieve membranes with tunable ultra-selective separation performance that can be sustained under industrially relevant (high temperature and pressure) conditions. The strategy relies on intergrowing one- and two-dimensional porous materials at the single-unit-cell level.   The postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, faculty and industrial collaborators formed a research team with complementary skills and interests ranging from applied separations to molecular simulations and nanostructured materials synthesis. Progress was achieved through continuous research interactions and exchange of ideas. This synergistic experience was an important human resource development contribution. One graduate student and three postdoctoral fellows contributed to this project. The postdoctoral fellows started tenured track academic careers. The graduate student completed the Ph.D. studies and is pursuing post-doctoral training.  This work promoted the development of energy efficient membrane separation processes that could contribute to pollution reduction and sustainable development.
