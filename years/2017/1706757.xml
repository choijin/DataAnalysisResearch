<AbstractNarration>Approximately 80% of the energy consumed in the United States annually is produced through combustion processes, and soot (or black carbon) is a by-product of incomplete combustion. Soot is known to have harmful impacts on the earth's climate and human health, and climate scientists have found that black carbon is the second most important man-made climate-forcing agent, falling between carbon dioxide and methane. Small-sized particles, of which soot is a dominant contributor, are thought to be responsible for a range of cardiovascular and respiratory problems and may act as a carrier for toxic combustion by-products, introducing further health effects. Thus, reducing emissions of soot from combustion processes is a critically important goal, and developing a fundamental understanding of the chemical and physical processes in combustion systems that lead to soot will be necessary. In this project, researchers are performing laser-based optical diagnostic studies aimed at understanding a critical phase in the soot formation process. These experiments are being complemented and informed by computational chemistry calculations. The results of the project will include data that will be of relevance to the combustion research community, as well as other scientists exploring the role of black carbon precursors in interstellar space and their potential use here on Earth in electronics and solar energy conversion. Finally, this project is helping to train and prepare graduate students for careers in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is based upon the hypothesis that soot inception begins with the agglomeration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) species that are large enough to "stick" at flame temperatures. This project involves several new experiments designed to address this idea as well as competing models for particulate inception, and they are: (1) Broadband, cavity-enhanced absorption/extinction measurements in the near infrared spectral region for both molecular and particulate species. (2) Two-dimensional excitation/emission studies through the ultraviolet and visible to gain insight in aromatic electronic structure. (3) Wavelength-agile, angle-resolved scattering measurements to define particle fractal morphology. (4) Extension of the computational chemistry to evaluate electronic structure's role in thermodynamic stability, band gaps, and spectroscopic properties of PAH and their aggregates. (5) Application of a suite of solid-state diagnostics to thermophoretically sampled particulate including infrared and Raman spectroscopies and optical and electron microscopies.</AbstractNarration>
