<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is providing an affordable and effective means to produce freshwater supplies from brackish water sources. Freshwater shortages have pushed many communities to increasingly rely on groundwater supplies. Several hundred million people worldwide already experience serious water-stress, and their numbers are expected to increase as freshwater availability declines owing to increasing demand.  While available fresh groundwater aquifers are limited, there exist considerable amounts of low-to-intermediate salinity brackish groundwater sources that remain unused. Unfortunately, existing desalination technologies are either too energy intensive, have low water recovery rates, or are prohibitively expensive. There is a significant need and commercial opportunity for new technologies that can efficiently convert brackish aquifers into viable freshwater supplies. This project allows for the development of a robust, low cost, energy efficient brackish water desalination technology with potential use beyond drinking water treatment, including food processing, agriculture, and other industrial applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will evaluate the commercialization potential of a new technology that will potentially lower the cost of brackish water treatment by reducing the capital, operation and maintenance, and waste management costs compared to existing alternatives. The lower capital cost is achieved by using novel composite electrode materials developed using inexpensive and industrially-scaled precursors. The reduction in operation and maintenance costs are benefits from realizing unique operating modes made possible by the novel electrodes. The new operating modes also eliminate need for harsh chemicals, and instead use low-voltage electricity to regenerate the electrodes after they have captured the dissolved salts from the water being treated.  The regeneration leads to a reject stream of concentrated brine, while the adsorption leads to a stream of treated water that is fresh (less saline than the inlet water). The higher water recovery rates in this system minimize the amount of waste generated, subsequently allowing for cost savings in waste management.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report for the General Public  Document for NSF Award Number 1745725     Project Title: I-Corps: Water Treatment using Electrically Regenerated Ion-exchange     Project end-date 12/31/2018.  PI Prof. Ashok Gadgil, UC Berkeley     This NSF award is for participation in a program called NSF I-Corps.  In this program teams are formed each comprising researchers and one business-person.  These teams work intensely under guidance and direction of experts with substantial experience in technology-startups.  The major goal of this program was to help technology researchers develop necessary skills for taking a technology through a successful startup phase.  The benefits are the skills themselves, not necessarily the technology being used for learning.  The skills stretch the researchers to look beyond their current immediate research.  Nevertheless, the skills development is based on the current technology identified and being developed by each team.  The businessperson and the senior technology researcher participate without remuneration (except reimbursement of travel costs).  The junior researcher, the one with the longest future ahead of him or her, gets their salary (i.e., time and effort) also paid with NSF funding for the duration of the program.     Our team used a novel desalination technology developed at Berkeley as the platform to learn the skills relevant to understanding the market, willingness-to-pay by potential customers, , generate a high-level map of the technology ecosystem including manufacturing and distribution partners, developing a credible and viable business model for technology commercialization, iterate and improve the business model based through continued intensive customer discovery interviews, and tailor the development of the technology to align with the interview findings.     In the assessment of the PI, and other members of our team, this was a truly terrific learning experience.  We learned entirely different, and extremely useful, ways of thinking about technology development that changed our then-current thinking, and has changed our subsequent thinking and actions in inventing and developing novel technologies.      Photo shows our team (the 1000th team in the NSF I-Corps training) at launch of the intensive learning effort. Left to Right: Mark Stephenson, Ashok Gadgil, Chinmayee Subban.
