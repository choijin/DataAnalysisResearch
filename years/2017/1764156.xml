<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for graduate students and junior researchers to attend the "XVII International Conference on Hyperbolic Problems: Theory, Numerics, and Applications" (HYP2018) held at the Pennsylvania State University, University Park on June 25-29, 2018. The conference highlights recent advances in the fundamental theory of hyperbolic partial differential equations, as well as related mathematical models that have experienced sustained activity and exciting recent progress. Hyperbolic problems are ubiquitous in modern science and engineering, ranging from the mathematical theory of fluids, to collective motion of animals (such as flocks of birds), to traffic and pedestrian flow. The meeting is expected to have considerable impact on future developments of applied mathematics in academia, industry, and national Labs in the United States. The conference website can be found at http://www.hyp2018.psu.edu/&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;One of the conference's objectives is to bring together researchers, students, and practitioners with interest in the theoretical, computational, and applied aspects of differential equations of hyperbolic type. HYP2018 is the seventeenth meeting in a biennial series with varying venues, whose last United States meeting (the twelfth) was held in 2008. The conference series is unique in its emphasis on encouraging interdisciplinary collaborations that involve sophisticated mathematics applied to challenging problems of great contemporary interest. Among the topics highlighted at the conference are: the mathematical theory of fluids, with new engineering, medical, and biological applications; hyperbolic equations on networks, with a variety of applications, most notably to traffic flow on a network of roads; kinetic and fluid models for collective dynamics of many-body systems; transport equations, with particular focus on optimality and mixing; the equations of general relativity; and control problems for hyperbolic partial differential equations and differential games. The list of plenary and invited speakers includes leading world experts in these scientific areas. Special panel sessions will be devoted to framing open problems to attract the attention of junior scientists in the audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project received NSF support for the organization of the 17-th International Conference  on ``Hyperbolic Problems: Theory, Numerics, and Applications" (HYP2018), which was held at  the Pennsylvania State University, University Park,  on June 25--29, 2018. The  HYP2018 conference was part of a series started in 1986 in St.Etienne (France).   These meetings, which take place every two years, represent the most important international forums on the subject. They bring together researchers, students and practitioners, with interest in the theoretical, computational and applied aspects of hyperbolic problems.     The theory of hyperbolic equations is a classical field of mathematics, that can be traced back to Euler (1755). Starting the 1940's, with the dawn of supersonic flight, the field has experienced a vigorous development, motivated by the study of gas dynamics and shock waves. Nowadays, partial differential equations of of hyperbolic type have found a very wide range of applications. They  arise in models of fluid flow, elasticity, granular flow, nonlinear wave phenomena, complex fluids, multiphase  flows,  combustion and detonations, with applications to  aerospace engineering, mathematical biology, materials science, oil recovery, models of blood flow,  traffic flow, etc...  A number of specific topics were highlighted in the HYP2018 Conference, namely:   - The mathematical theory of fluids and their applications to biological and engineering problems.  -  Recent progress on the Einstein equations of general relativity.  - Modeling and optimization of traffic flow on a network of roads.  -  Advances and challenges in the modeling and simulation of oil reservoirs.  - Collective dynamics of a large number of interacting agents, modeling pedestrian flow, the motion of flocks of animals, etc...  A large number of talks were also devoted to computational algorithms, with industrial applications.  The HYP2018 conference was attended by over 230 participants from 21 different countries. It featured 7 plenary and 17 invited lectures, while 170 contributed talks were given within special sessions. In addition, a poster sessionwas organized, with prizes given to the best posters among junior participants.    NSF funding was used to support the participation of students and young researchers from the US, who were encouraged to showcase their work in posters or short talks.  As a result of this strong participation, among the 170 contributed talks, about half were delivered by junior participants.   The latest advances in the field, presented at the conference, have now been collected in a volume of Proceedings. This volume, including contributions from nearly 90 participants,  will be published electronically by the American Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) by the end of 2019. It will be put on-line, with free access to everyone.            Last Modified: 08/10/2019       Submitted by: Alberto Bressan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
