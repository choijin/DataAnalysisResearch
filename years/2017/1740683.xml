<AbstractNarration>A major need in the geosciences is to reduce the amount of time geoscientists spend on "data wrangling" tasks (finding, accessing, subsetting, gridding, processing, reformatting, visualizing) so that they can spend more time on complex scientific analysis. This project will develop a means for scientists to document and interact with all of the data management and analysis tools that they need to create a scientific result, and it will add tools to find common patterns in their work to help find tools that could reduce the time needed to produce the result. This work may also help to make moethods and analyses more transparent by providing the means to track the steps in creating a scientific result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on relationships among cyberinfrastructure experts and geoscientists examine current scientific workflows and the integration of EarthCube tools.  The work will include a workflow sketching interface to specify the steps, dependencies, current tools, current duration, and other important aspects of a scientist's workflow.  As part of the proposed pilot project, the team will examine two geoscience use cases (hurricane risk and water resources) in detail and assign cyberinfrastructure experts to integrate EarthCube tools into these science workflows, to demonstrate the increases in productivity that are realized.  In addition, the team will conduct a workshop/clinic at a major geoscience conference to collect additional use cases from the community, where geoscientists will describe their workflows and receive personalized advice on the use of EarthCube tools.  If successful, the researchers may expand on this pilot project to conduct many more workshops at other venues and to map many more scientific workflows to corresponding EarthCube technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed a framework for scientists to capture complex analytic processes as workflow sketches.   The project developed the ASSET workflow sketching tool as an interactive web-accessible prototype sketching tool that enables scientists to create workflow sketches.  A workflow sketch is a visual graph where each node can be a step in an analytic process, whether done by hand or automated, or a dataset.  Scientists can add details to describe each step, for example what specific software was used, how it was invoked, and what version.  The ASSET tool allows scientists to specify the steps in their workflow, and the software tools and data sources that are used in each step.  The ASSET tool offers scientists a palette of commonly used data science software, as well as geosciences tools from the NSF EarthCube program that they can consider using for specific steps.  Workflow sketches can be exported and shared among ASSET users.  Workflow sketches facilitates collaboration among scientists.  For example, a scientist can work on expanding some steps of the workflow, leaving others to expand other workflow fragments.  Workflow sketches also help students get from their advisors a structured description of the data and code they are supposed to use.  They also help scientists write papers by reporting the methods they used as a visual graph of steps with more information attached to them.  The project also held several training sessions to teach scientists about the importance and value of capturing their analytic workflows and how to use the ASSET sketching tool.  The training sessions are available on line to any scientist.  Through these sessions and other community events, we collected workflow sketches in many different areas of geosciences that will enable further work on facilitating the creation of scientific workflows.
