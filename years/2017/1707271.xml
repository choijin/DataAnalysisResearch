<AbstractNarration>This award supports a program of theory and experiments to develop detailed understanding of waves and particle confinement in a plasma -- a gas of freely interacting electrically charged particles -- placed in a magnetic trap.  The studies will characterize wave damping caused by individual particles bouncing end-to-end in the trap at different frequencies.  The plasma transport and loss caused by internal magnetic irregularities will also be analyzed and measured. This research program has broad connections to fluid physics, atomic physics, anti-matter production, and fusion plasmas for power generation, and provides a stimulating environment for graduate and undergraduate student education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experiments will be performed on two non-neutral plasma devices: the camera-diagnosed electron plasma apparatus "CamV" and on the laser-diagnosed Magnesium ion plasma apparatus "IV". Analytical theory and medium-scale simulation results will be directly compared to the experiments over a broad range of parameters. The goal is to identify limitations in the theory, and to stimulate new theory where needed. In particular, this research will elucidate the effects of internal potential variations, as bounce-harmonic Landau damping depends sensitively on the particle trajectories. Further, magnetic irregularities leading to topological separatrices are endemic to both quasi-neutral and non-neutral plasmas, and the novel "chaotic superbanana" transport to be studied here occurs even in nearly collisionless plasmas.  This award to support an undergraduate student is made under the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering and is complementary to a DOE award made under the joint program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF grant for $15,000 over 3 years enhanced the undergraduate education related to federally-funded research on Fundamental Processes in Plasmas at UCSD.  A module on current research was incorporated into the annual upper-division class "Introduction to Plasma Physics", and an enrichment tour and discussion of the DIII-D tokamak was arranged  (pictured).  Students who expressed interest were invited to participate in the PI's research group discussions, and were provided mentorship to perform experiments on a research-grade plasma confinement apparatus.  The apparatus incorporates ultra-high vacuum systems, power magnetic systems, and myriad electronic modules, all under the control of special-purpose computer control and data-acquisition programs.  The students discussed possible experiments, operated the apparatus, analyzed their data, and discussed and reported their results and failures.     Four undergraduate students completed this program, of which two are women.  One student extended the summer support into academic credit, and thereby completed an Honors Degree in Physics.  Two students travelled to and presented their research results at the annual APS Division of Plasma Physics Conferences.  Two students have continued to participate in (Zoom) research group meetings even after graduation.  Two students have proceeded on to enrollment in graduate degree programs.  All students received valuable experience in hands-on experimentation, as well as an appreciation for the challenges and rewards of physics research.
