<AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation award funds Student Travel Fellowships for US students attending BIRTE 2017, the 11th International Workshop on Real-Time Business Intelligence and Analytics.  The student fellowships helps cover the travel costs and registration fees for US students, enabling them to present their work and receive constructive feedback and mentoring from established researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BIRTE workshop provides a forum to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in the different facets of real-time operation and business intelligence, from data acquisition, to processing, to transformation and analysis, to data visualization. The research paper presentations, keynote addresses, panel and other sessions provide opportunities for students to meet academic and industrial researchers as well as industrial practitioners, and be inspired by them to follow careers in this area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The goal of this project was to encourage graduate students and young researchers to get involved in the area of bussiness intelligence and real-time analytics. Towards this a limited number of travel scholarships were provided to US students to attend the 11th and 12th Workshops on Real-time Business Intelligence and Analytics (BIRTE 2017 &amp; 2018).  BIRTE provides a perfect forum to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in the different facets of business intelligence, from data acquisition, to processing, to transformation and analysis, to data visualization, applied towards the real-time enterprise. Participants have the opportunity to present their current work and innovations in the context of real problems to which they have applied their solutions, innovations and infrastructure and discuss challenges, opportunities and advances in this field. At the same time, as with any other workshop, it provides the right environment to network with people working on the workshop topics, fostering future collaboration and the consolidation of a solid community that sets the path towards the future of this increasingly important field. Towards the latter, special effort is made to involve students and young researchers.  The selection of students to receive the travel scholarship was performed by a three-member committee consisting of two university professors and a researcher from industry. Priority was given to supporting students who are either members of groups that are under?represented at the workshop (i.e., undergraduate students, women, or members of other minorities), or they would be attending the BIRTE for the first time to present their work (paper or demo).  A total of 10 applications were received, out of which 6 students were selected to receive the NSF travel scholarship.  All students were asked to provide testimonials so that we can evaluate the impact of the travel scholarships in their professional development. As evidence of the significant impact, we reproduce three such testimonials next.           ?I would like to say that this conference/workshop is my first overseas conference as a PhD student, but I truly believe it won?t be my last one. The knowledge I gained was immense. This travel scholarship provided me with the opportunity to gain firsthand experience at a moment when I am working on my first paper... I feel even more motivated and inspired to succeed in what I am doing and come back to BIRTE at VLDB, but this time hopefully presenting my own paper.?       "During BIRTE I also got exposed to the direction in which the database and data analytics community is moving.  All of the talks and discussions enriched my knowledge and perspectives on time series and data streams analysis, data exploration and helped me plan my future research tasks and my works towards my PhD thesis."      ?BIRTE 2018 NSF scholarship has significantly encouraged, motivated, and charged my spirit to further challenge my academic limits and endeavors. I strongly believe that it has cleared my vision towards my academic goals and complimented my knowledge in other specialties within the same field of databases and data exploration. Moreover, it has helped me establishing some connections with colleagues from both the academic and the industry community."
