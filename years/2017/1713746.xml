<AbstractNarration>Oscillators, by virtue of their periodic behavior, provide a way to tell time, as illustrated by the movement of a clock's pendulum. The study of coupled oscillators and their mutual synchronization has remained a problem central to physics for centuries, but has only recently captured the imagination of biologists. One example of synchronized oscillators are the biological clocks found in living cells. Biological clocks are pervasive in their effects from genes to ecosystems. Biological clocks affect the health of humans, animals and plants and they are being engineered for timed delivery of therapeutics, algal bioreactors for biofuel production, and crop improvement. The clock, through its light entrainment feature, impacts the genetic dynamics of bacterial assemblages in the world's oceans and hence may affect carbon cycling in marine ecosystems. Understanding how cell populations synchronize their clock oscillations, to give rise to a functioning "biological clock", is the central focus of this project. The project will also develop an innovative interdisciplinary "Clock Collaboratorium" graduate student research training course that will make extensive use of cyber-learning tools. Investigators will invite undergraduate and high school students to their labs to work on research related to this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent evidence suggests that single-cell oscillators of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa (N. crassa) are stochastic on a single-cell level, while measurements on populations of millions of cells indicate that their clocks are synchronized. In order to understand this synchronization, a novel droplet microfluidics platform is deployed for high-throughput, high-precision measurements on a controlled number of living N. crassa cells. Single-cell measurements will confirm whether circadian rhythms exist on a single-cell level and the extent of stochasticity. Multi-cell experiments will probe communications and synchronization between single-cell clock oscillators. Signaling molecules responsible for synchronization will be identified using nuclear magnetic resonance on exo-metabolites from living cells. Stochastic resonance, a fundamental concept from non-linear-systems physics, will be tested as a possible clock synchronization mechanism, against multi-cell measurements, using novel ensemble simulation modeling approaches. This project is is expected to advance systems biology research on clock systems through (1) tight coupling of modeling and experimentation, and (2) opening up a new frontier by pushing the scale of measurements to single cells. A detailed understanding of the clock's single-cell regulation in N. crassa will provide new insights into clock mechanisms, regulatory clock controls, and physiological consequences in other organisms, ranging from plants to humans.</AbstractNarration>

We succeeed in using this new method to detect how metabolties respond in a density-depedent  manner and as a function of genetic mutations, thus linking genes to metabolism.  The evidence for these communication mechanisms involving a response to cell density are sometimes referred to as quorum sensing.  We used nanotechnology to provide independent evidence that single cells phase synchronize using a quorum sensing mechanism.  The results of this project were generated through the transdisciplinary training of 2 high school students, 4 undergraduates, and 10 graduate students pursuing their PhDs during the course of the project.  In addition, the project also supported the development of a cyber-learning tool to personalize the education of students from diverse backgrounds called Adaptive Learning in an Interdisicplinary Collaborative Environemt  or ALICE.
