<AbstractNarration>Courts often reproduce existant power differentials; it is difficult to make legal claims in court from more powerful groups.  This research finding has been addressed in multiple venues and across multiple areas of law.  It has not been tested  historically, nor do we know enough about what that means when members of disadvantaged groups take court cases in local courts against people who may only be marginally more advantaged, or may differ in legal status.  Yet in multiple jurisdictions, members of minority groups have used the courts to make claims and vindicate interests.  Finally, the framework remains underexplored in explicit comparisons across types of legal regimes. This project will test the significance of both legal status and jurisdiction in making claims in the courts, comparing across common-law and civil-law regimes. Civil law jurisdictions organize legal claims making differently from common law systems.  People who took cases to court varied by legal status.  That variation will allow the project to evaluate the significance of legal status in making legal claims, both in process and outcomes.  Litigation indicates that the legal system was not solely the province of the elite.  Reimagining members of subordinated groups as shrewd litigators will complicate our interpretation of power and will serve as a model for understanding the legal action of other subordinated groups.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will generate a dataset of all extant lower court cases involving black litigants in four counties (about 2,000 cases), preserving records that are fragile and making them more broadly available.  Unpublished local court records stored in courthouse basements and storage sheds are rarely accessed and rapidly deteriorating.  These records  represent an important resource for understanding the relationship between legal systems and formally legally marginalized peoples in stratified societies.    The project will also contribute to the training of a student in the social sciences.  In addition the project will allow improved teaching of undergraduates concerning legal stratification and use of the courts.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&ldquo;Variation in the Use of Courts by Legal Status and Jurisdiction&rdquo; is a historical and socio-legal study of free and enslaved African Americans&rsquo; use of the local courts in the antebellum U.S. South. The project investigated trial court records from the Natchez district of Mississippi and Louisiana between 1800 and 1860 in which free blacks and slaves sued whites and other African Americans. The research in unpublished lower court records stored in local courthouse basements and storage sheds includes over 1,000 examples of black litigants using law on their own behalf&mdash;often successfully. Although they present technical and interpretive challenges, local court records are an essential resource for understanding the relationship between legal systems and formally marginalized peoples in racially and economically stratified societies.</p> <p>Discovering 1,000 previously unknown trial court records involving black litigants in civil cases and compiling them into a database represents the first of this project&rsquo;s major achievements. Many of these records have not been opened and read since they were filed nearly 200 years ago. The bulk of these materials are neither published nor housed in any traditional archive and instead remain in the possession of the county clerk's office (typically in basements, attics, and sheds without fire or flood protection). They are often moldy, torn and falling apart, incomplete, and disorganized. Over the years, they have suffered from war, theft, rot, fire, flood, and general neglect. Yet court records, especially the records of the civil courts, reveal hundreds of people of African descent&mdash;free and enslaved&mdash;suing white people in all-white courtrooms.</p> <p>The second major achievement of the project is a published monograph that reconsiders African Americans' relationship to law in the slave South. To date, much of our understanding of black Americans&rsquo; experience with the antebellum southern legal system stems from a focus on criminal law (black people as defendants) and restrictive legislation (black people as objects to control). The emphasis on criminal rather than private law has important consequences for how we view African Americans&rsquo; relationship to law and the courts, revealing a long history of linking black people to criminality and regulation. Yet, as this project demonstrates, the black legal experience in America cannot be reduced to white regulation and black criminality. Examining African Americans&rsquo; involvement in private law reveals a different picture. Free blacks and slaves were not only defendants or objects of regulation; trial court records reveal them to be prolific litigators as well. They were parties to civil suits in their own interests and directly active in legal proceedings.&nbsp;</p> <p>This project has four broader impacts. First, it gives a historical account of how underrepresented groups participated in the creation of America&rsquo;s legal culture. African Americans were not outsiders to the southern American legal system, but at the center. Revealing an unknown world of black legal activity&mdash;and demonstrating that black people were not merely objects of law&mdash;is consequential for understanding the long history of race, rights, and civic inclusion in United States. Second, this study informs social science scholars of law, history, anthropology, political science, and sociology, among others, and serves as a model for understanding the relationship between subordinated groups and the law. Examining the role of law in the lives of antebellum black Americans has the potential to shift our understanding of the modern treatment of black people by the legal system, as well as the treatment of other subordinated groups. Participation in the legal system by those with limited legal rights indicates that the legal system is not solely the province of the elite. It is also a tool of the subordinated. Third, this project (and the discovery of new documents) brings awareness to rapidly deteriorating records involving marginalized peoples (people of color, women, immigrants, and the poor) and will attract the attention of future researchers and preservationists interested in a broad range of topics. Finally, the dissemination of the research through a published book helps ensure that teachers and students from a variety of fields will hear anew the voices of previously marginalized peoples and account for the importance of access to courts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/21/2018<br>      Modified by: Kimberly&nbsp;Welch</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1700856/1700856_10293890_1526917083055_IMG_4647--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1700856/1700856_10293890_1526917083055_IMG_4647--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Court Record Conditions I"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1700856/1700856_10293890_1526917083055_IMG_4647--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Court Record Conditions I"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Fragments of a Freedom Suit</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kimberly M.
