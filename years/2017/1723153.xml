<AbstractNarration>The International Conference on the Foundations of Computational Mathematics 2017 is the ninth of a successful series and will be held in Barcelona, Spain from July 10 to July 19, 2017. This award funds the attendance at the meeting of at least twenty junior U.S. participants, including graduate students,  postdoctoral fellows, and early career tenure track faculty.  The conference features seventeen plenary speakers, eight of whom are from the US, and 21 workshops where the junior participants participants will be able to present a talk or a poster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of constantly increasing computational power has changed the relationship between mathematics and computation. New  applications such as encryption, large scale data management, and signal/image processing, inevitably led to the study of the  computational tools themselves, creating and reinvigorating a rich spectrum of mathematical disciplines. Mathematicians now increasingly recognize that, besides its value as a numerical and experimental tool, computation is a significant theoretical tool in its own right. This conference aims to further the understanding of the connections between mathematics and computation, including the interfaces between pure and applied mathematics, numerical analysis and computer science. This is reflected in the diverse and vibrant research areas covered by the 21 workshops which are organized by world experts,  including many from the US. This award is  instrumental in enabling  the participation of many US young researchers at this renowned and exciting conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference website: http://www.ub.edu/focm2017/</AbstractNarration>
