<AbstractNarration>The broader/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to significantly improve fertilization and crop yields in legume agriculture and other crops.  Application of light-activated inoculates for crop fertilization will result in an increased legume production and will potentially benefit other crops that are grown in the same fields after harvesting the legumes, as legume crop remnants left in the fields may fertilize those additional crops. The potential customers for this novel technology are the soybean farmers of the Midwestern states and the alfalfa growers in the southwestern USA. The expected yield enhancements using this technique will potentially result in higher profit margins in these important crops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The I-Corps project develops an innovative way to process bacterial inoculates currently used to fertilize legumes. Legume crops are sprayed with bacteria that live inside the plant roots providing the plant with fertilizing compounds that they produce from air nitrogen. The core technology involved is based on a recent discovery that illumination of these bacteria is required to activate their capacity to penetrate the roots. Spraying the fields with light-activated inoculates constitutes a new, state of the art methodology that could significantly improve fertilization and crop yields over current yields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal focused on training a group of scientists to commercialize their discovery of a new technology applicable to legume agriculture.  This technology transfer from the research laboratory to the agriculture industry is relevant to human nutrition and has technological applications.  In legume agriculture nitrogen fertilizer is provided to the plant by the bacterium Rhizobium that lives in symbiotic association with the plant inside its roots. Our new technology consists of a process of light activation of the bacterium capacity to associate with the plant. The Rhizobium bacterium lives in small nodules present in the roots of legumes such as beans, alfalfa, and peanuts. Rhizobium synthesize organic nitrogen compounds by trapping nitrogen gas from the air.  This process, called Nitrogen fixation is energy-intensive and  the bacteria take carbon compounds from the plant to fuel it.  The bacterium passes the nitrogen compounds to the plant, serving as the plant fertilizer.  This bacteria/Plant association is called both a symbiosis and a mutualism, because both associated partners gain from the interaction.  Rhizobium  has been studied for over a century because of its importance in agriculture. However its sensitivity to light was not discovered. We showed that light-enhanced Rhizobium/plant symbiosis relies on light activation of a  bacterial protein, which we named   a LOV protein (because of its ability to sense Light, Oxygen and Voltage). This initial event is followed by subsequent steps in which the activated LOV protein reacts with other cellular components that enhance the bacterium capability to penetrate the plant root membranes and to resist against attack by the natural plant defenses to repel bacterial invasion. When we disabled the LOV-domain protein gene in Rhizobium, its capability to associate with the legume plants&mdash;measured as the ability to reproduce efficiently inside the plant roots&mdash;dropped to less than  50% of normal, "wild-type" bacteria.  In a simple experiment Involving placing  a layer of lightblocking aluminum foil, we obtained a similar drop in bacterila/plant association ability, demonstrating that Rhizobium depends on sunlight to establish symbiosis with the legume plants.  Following the I-Corps program we recruited a technology transfer team composed of a technology transfer graduate student, an Industrial Mentor, and the PI to participate in a series of training sessions to develop an  applicable business model for the eventual commercialization of the technology. We participated in the initial training sessions with the teaching staff of Venture Well Corporation in Dallas, TX.

We encountered difficulties to complete timely this task. As a consequence of this deficiency the program director discontinued the grant funding, which was returned to the NSF program and our project was terminated after 4 weeks of operation, without reaching any of the projected goals.  Broader Impact: Created a new technology that  may revolutionize legume agriculture.  On education has trained undergraduate students both in scientific endeavor and in the process of commercialization.of our technology.
