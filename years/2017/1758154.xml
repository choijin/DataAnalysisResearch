<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project derives from its potential applications that enable a better understanding of, and treatments for, brain disorders.  Last year, over 50 million U.S. adults were afflicted by a central nervous system disease such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, depression, and autism. Particularly as the population ages, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are rapidly increasing. This project further develops an innovative technology that, for the first time, enables scalable, cost-effective, GMP-compliant generation of human brain organoids.  The technology will facilitate the development of applications for human brain organoids both for basic research, including drug discovery and disease-in-the-dish modeling of neurological disorders, and clinical applications, where the human brain organoids may be developed as a source of therapeutic cells for transplantation.  This technological advance, furthermore, promotes the advancement of personalized medicine approaches to both therapeutic development and brain cell transplantation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is focused on the production of human brain organoids as an enabling technology for advancements in basic science discovery, neuropharmaceutical discovery, and therapeutic cell production for a wide variety of human brain disorders.  The project further develops an improved method for the generation of human brain organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells. The technology has several advantages over previously described methods including improved simplicity and efficiency of organoid production, documented consistency of the product, production method using only a chemically defined hydrogel matrix and cell culture medium, and improved scalability of manufacturing.  Taken together these features enable, for the first time, a commercially viable means of brain organoid production.  The method is also amenable to cGMP-compliant manufacturing which enables the development of therapeutic cell products from the organoids.</AbstractNarration>

Our team, comprised of PI Timothy D. O'Brien, Entrepreneurial Lead Beth Lindborg, Co-Entrepreneurial Lead Amanda Vegoe, and Industry Mentor Greg Molnar, participated in the I-CORPS programs held in Washington DC on January 29-31 and March 12-13, 2018.  During the course of this program we accomplished over 100 voice of the customer interviews exploring various customer niches for brain cell products derived from our iPSC-derived brain organoids.  Our team tested multiple hypotheses regarding the need, applications, regulatory landscape, payer landscape, supply chain, and market acceptance for experimental and therapeutic products.  Early on it was apparent that the overarching consensus was that the market for brain organoids or other 3-D cell culture products in the pharmaceutical industry sector was not currently well-developed enough to find wide-spread adoption of our technology.  In contrast, there was strong interest and acceptance for cell-based therapeutic approaches to degenerative neurological disorders such as Parkinson?s disease, Alzheimer?s disease, genetic disorders such as adrenoleukodystrophy and Hurler?s disease, and others.  Therefore, we set aside our exploration of the pharmaceutical sector and focused the majority of our efforts to assess the therapeutic applications of our organoid-derived cells, particularly for the treatment of Parkinson?s disease.  The need for improved therapeutic options was a repeated theme in our interviews and there was a great deal of enthusiasm for cell based therapies despite the likely need for brain surgery to introduce therapeutic cells into the brain.  Despite the very positive feedback from multiple sources including neurosurgeons, neurologists, nursing staff, caregivers and patients, it was evident that our current product was not yet sufficiently refined to provide a minimum viable product and the result was a No-Go decision for our group for a product launch at this time.  Over the past year we have continued to do voice of the customer research to fine-tune the development of these products and have continued bench research to improve our production methods and cell product manufacturing.  The I-CORPS program provided our early stage start-up company invaluable experience in, and guidance for, conducting insightful product research which has helped us to shape our product development and strategic plans.
