<AbstractNarration>This project supports travel for early- and mid-career female researchers in robotics to attend a full-day &lt;br/&gt;workshop at the Robotics Science and Systems (RSS), which runs July 12-16, 2017 in Boston MA.  The need for a&lt;br/&gt;"Women in Robotics" workshop is compelling: of the 20 workshops at last year?s RSS, 5 had no female speakers&lt;br/&gt;and 9 had just one.  The workshop will feature keynote speakers, panels on academic and entrepreneurial career&lt;br/&gt;paths, and a poster session by female graduate students who are new to the RSS community.  While open to the&lt;br/&gt;whole RSS community, the focus of the workshop is on broadening participation of female researchers in &lt;br/&gt;robotics, and all the speakers and invited participants will be women.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Robotics is undergoing tremendous growth in recent years, over a wide range of important areas, from transportation, to manufacturing, service, entertainment, space exploration, healthcare, and education. While the field is progressing forward, both in academia and industry, the percentage of female roboticists continues to lag far behind their male counterparts, as with many other STEM fields.      We organized the third Women in Robotics Workshop at R:SS 2017 to:   raise visibility of women in robotics, strengthen the community and provide an opportunity for networking, foster mentorship of junior female researchers, and ultimately, increase the number of women in robotics to close the gender gap.   This was a mixed-audience, women-only speakers workshop. The workshop featured two panels on academic career paths and robotics entrepreneurship, invited talks by early career academics, poster presentations by junior researchers, and a keynote talk addressing gender diversity in robotics and science in general. The keynote talk by Radhika Nagpal was particularly popular and was later repeated at the Cornell Inaugural Engineering &amp; Diversity seminar organized by one of the workshop organizers.        The workshop was attended by around 75 people. 26 junior researchers presented posters about their research and 18 students were supported with travel funding to attend the conference for the first time.
