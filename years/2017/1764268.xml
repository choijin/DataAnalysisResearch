<AbstractNarration>The Texas A&amp;M Engineering Experiment Station, Angelo State University, El Centro College, West Texas A&amp;M University, Del Mar College, Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville, Texas Tech University, Texas Woman's University, and the Texas Association of Chicanos in Higher Education, will conduct a conference titled Stakeholder Perspectives on Challenges and Opportunities for Improving Undergraduate STEM Education at Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). Up to 140 students, faculty, staff, administrators, advocates, and funders will identify challenges and opportunities for improving STEM education at 2- and 4-year HSIs, building capacity for and student participation in STEM research, and implementing institutional change for addressing barriers to Latinx student success in STEM. Nationwide surveys of stakeholders will further explore themes from the conference, and results will be disseminated to the HSI community and NSF to inform funding and institutional initiatives.  The conference was proposed in response to a Dear Colleague Letter issued by the National Science Foundation (NSF) calling for submission of conference proposals to inform the design of NSF's new Hispanic-Serving Institution program, to be established in fiscal year 2018.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will 1) identify the specific challenges 2- and 4-year HSIs face in adopting evidence-based institutional changes for improving STEM education and Latinx student success, with a specific focus on areas the National Science Foundation could potentially address through targeted funding opportunities; 2) identify challenges and opportunities for 2- and 4-year HSIs in building capacity for research and expanding STEM instruction and other Latinx student supports through collaborations with other institutions and by pursuing appropriate funding opportunities; 3) solicit Latinx STEM student and alumni perspectives on barriers to success in STEM and psychosociocultural tailoring of institutional changes to meet Latinx student needs and improve STEM education at HSIs; and 4) conduct a follow-up survey of stakeholders at 2- and 4-year HSIs across the country to capture a more representative cross-section of their needs, challenges, and priorities based on themes developed through focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and conference discussions. Attendees and presenters will participate in focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and roundtable discussions that will generate key themes of interest to NSF and the broader HSI community, and these themes will be integrated in a stakeholder survey to quantify related 2- and 4-year HSI needs and priorities. Results are expected to inform NSF's new HSI program and contribute to an improved understanding of institutional barriers/opportunities and student perspectives on improving Latinx student recruitment, retention, and advancement in STEM.  In addition to informing NSF's new HSI program, conference and survey results will be disseminated to all HSIs and the broader student success research community by making reports available online, presenting results at relevant conferences, and publishing in peer-reviewed journals.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Higher education and the experiences of students in it have been  subjects of research for decades. However, very little is known about  Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) and the students they serve. This  project supported two forms of activity, a conference at which  challenges faced by HSIs in STEM disciplines and research activity were  discussed and an extended, multi-step investigation of HSIs and their  students. The conference included round-table discussions and focus  groups which were the first information gathered for the study.  Following the conference, administrators, faculty, and students at HSIs  were interviewed as were several representatives of non-profit  organizations that provided educational programming for Hispanic  students. The information from the focus groups and interviews was  analyzed and the results from that analysis was employed to produce two  surveys, one for faculty, staff, and administrators and the other for  students. The two surveys were distributed to individuals at 122 HSIs in  a seven-state region (AR, CO, KS, LA, NM, OK, TX). There were 403  usable responses received from faculty, staff, and administrators and  464 from students. A second survey for students was devised to follow-up  on the first. It was distributed to students at a regional state  university and three community colleges in the university's service  area. The data gathered in this multi-step process significantly expands  the knowledge base regarding HSIs, their personnel, programming, and  the perspectives of their employees. The interviews and surveys with  students at HSIs further expands the knowledge base regarding HSIs and  their students by providing information about the students as well as  about&nbsp; the institutions, their faculty and staff, and their programming  from the perspective of the students. This material provides insights  that can facilitate improvement of services at HSIs and better  understanding of the needs, concerns, and perspectives of the students  they serve.
