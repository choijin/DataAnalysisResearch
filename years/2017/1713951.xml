<AbstractNarration>Northwestern China is considered to be an important area through history, becoming a gateway through which trade was conducted between most of Eurasia and the rest of China. Even during the Neolithic period (8500-1500 BC), many cultures seem to have participated in exchange of goods, such as the Majiayao cultural complex (3100-2700 BC). Archaeologists are now able to use geological chemical signatures to identify the origins of objects, such as ceramics. Using a specific type of analysis, X-Ray Fluorescence, painted pottery from various archaeological sites of the Majiayao will be examined in order to identify if painted pottery found can be assigned to either local production or trade, placing these objects in time and space. This research will be conducted at Peking University in Beijing under the supervision of Dr. Jianfeng Cui. Dr. Cui has worked with chemical analysis of material culture previously, and many of the anticipated ceramics to be examined are already at his lab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will specifically examine chemical patterns to determine the provenience of the ceramics, paying close attention to trace elements which can give clues to the relationship between sherds, and where those samples may have come from. An XRF analyzer will be used, followed by analysis and discussion of results. The results will be compared with prior geological knowledge in order to determine local production or importation of these ceramics. From this, potential trade systems can be established to observe which sites might be importing or exporting goods, and if materials are coming from even further away, potential contact and trade with outside groups. This will improve our knowledge of trade in the Neolithic period, and how this might affect interaction and trade in later periods as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and China's Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Using a chemical analysis strategy called X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), research was performed on over a hundred ceramics from two cultures of the late Neolithic period of China. The Majiayao culture (3300-2000 BC), and Qijia culture (2200-1600 BC) overlap in time, and were relatively close geographically. During this period of time, archaeologists have determined that there was likely a sort of proto-Silk Road in which people and goods moved around the region of northern China and beyond. By looking at the chemical composition of ceramics found at the Majiayao culture site of Majiayao and the Qijia culture site of Lajia, the research hopes to be an initial step in further work on discussing the migration of people and trade of goods and materials in this area. Chemical analysis alone will not be able to solve this alone, but proves to be a good first step in establishing possible patterns in technology and materials which will lead to further conclusions. In addition to the XRF analysis, thin section petrography, which includes looking through a microscope at the minerals and physical make-up of the ceramics, were also done on ten samples to help understand the chemical results. From the results, the researchers noticed that certain elements tended to be considerably higher in certain Lajia sherds than in Majiayao sherds. From this initial analysis, as well as the initial thin section results, it is difficult to determine if there was much trade or movement of people. Further analysis and review of literature will be needed in order to make such determinations. However, considering the site of Lajia does come at the end of the Majiayao culture, and noting similarities between both painted and unpainted sherds, we are able to say initially that the level of technology employed, as well as the general skill of the potters, is somewhat comparable. It does seem, however, that Majiayao pottery tended to be more similar to each other than Qijia, which seems to have a higher degree of differentiation. The initial results and interpretations help to build a base of knowledge for the technology, skills, and materials used for ceramic production in these cultures in late Neolithic China. This work will work well as a larger part of an investigation on the movement of people and goods of this region and time. The project overall is important for both American and Chinese audiences as a way of better understanding early pre-dynastic China. With such a massive influence historically, and with a major place in the world today, understanding China&rsquo;s history of people and arts is incredibly important. It also serves as a way to introduce a different avenue in which archaeology can be explored. Chemical analysis is an important way for archaeologists to come to new interpretations, and thus creates a new field in which more collaborative and accessible work in the field can be done.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/15/2018<br>      Modified by: Eric&nbsp;Carlucci</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
