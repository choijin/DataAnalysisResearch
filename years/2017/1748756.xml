<AbstractNarration>The very success of the industry sectors that produce information technology (IT) and the pervasiveness&lt;br/&gt;of IT products and services in daily life can obscure the interacting roles that industry, government, and&lt;br/&gt;academia play in conducting IT research and translating results into new products, services, and&lt;br/&gt;industries. This project will update earlier illustrations of such phenomena such as how much industry&lt;br/&gt;builds on government-funded university research, the long incubation periods sometimes needed for&lt;br/&gt;research to be translated into major industry activities, the steady work and funding required to get from&lt;br/&gt;initial exploration to large-scale commercial deployment, the interdependencies between research&lt;br/&gt;advances in different subfields, and the complex nature of the IT research "ecosystem." This project will&lt;br/&gt;also build on earlier work by adding updated examples of research investments and impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine committee will update the "tire tracks"&lt;br/&gt;figure published in CSTB's 2012 report Continuing Innovation in Information Technology. Drawing on a&lt;br/&gt;literature review, input from experts, and suggestions solicited from the relevant communities, it will&lt;br/&gt;identify emerging research areas and significant new industries, products, and firms. Using a graphical&lt;br/&gt;approach similar to that used in 2012, it will depict the interconnections across research areas and with&lt;br/&gt;the creation and evolution of IT industry sectors. It will illustrate the roles of industry, academia, and&lt;br/&gt;government in computing innovation and the development of IT products, services, and industries and&lt;br/&gt;consider if and how these roles may have evolved since the last report. In addition to presenting&lt;br/&gt;established computing research areas and industry sectors, it will also consider emerging candidates in&lt;br/&gt;both categories. A National Academies report will be prepared containing the figure together with a&lt;br/&gt;review of lessons learned about the structure and nature of information technology research and its&lt;br/&gt;impacts. Two derivative products will be prepared: (1) a brochure containing the figure and a summary of&lt;br/&gt;the report's analysis and (2) a Web interactive infographic that links the figure to more detail on selected&lt;br/&gt;topics and connections drawn from earlier Academies work and other sources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A study committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine prepared and published a report updating earlier Academies work describing key patterns in how research over time has significant cumulative impact and exploring the impacts of IT innovation on major U.S. industry sectors. It provides an overview of the broad impact of IT research and the university-industry-government partnership that has long yielded U.S. leadership in IT.  It extends earlier work in this area by describing key patterns in how research over time has significant cumulative impact and exploring the ultimate impacts of IT innovation on major U.S. industry sectors:   Resurgence--where progress in a research area slows and the activity of researchers or funders falls off, to be followed by a blossoming of interest and fruitful application later when new ideas or enablers emerge Confluence--where multiple streams of in- novation in IT, innovation within sectors, and innovation in how IT is used to solve problems and create new capabilities in those sectors are combined and lead to transformative impact   The report provides case studies of resurgence in the areas of virtualization, virtual environments, and formal methods as examples of resurgent research topics over the past decades of computing research. It provides a deeper exploration of the resurgence of research in artificial intelligence across a number of intersecting threads: machine learning, reasoning, natural language, computer vision, and robotics. The report provides case studies of confluence for the following industry sectors: e-commerce, automotive, health care, sports, and agriculture.
