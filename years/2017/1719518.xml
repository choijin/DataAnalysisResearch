<AbstractNarration>The severe shortage of qualified STEM teachers necessary to educate and inspire the future technical workforce undermines our nation's economic competitiveness and its scientific and technological leadership. The situation in physics is particularly alarming. Fewer than half of all high school physics classrooms are led by a teacher with a degree in physics, and physics is the number one shortage area for new K-12 teachers.  Since 2001, the Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC), led by the American Physical Society (APS) and the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT), has been working to engage physics departments in establishing the infrastructure needed to address the national physics teacher shortage. Building on the widespread engagement of the physics community and project experience and knowledge from dozens of successful programs, this award funds the thirteenth national PhysTEC Conference. This conference will bring together leaders of PhysTEC Sites, faculty from PhysTEC Member Institutions, and other members of the physics teacher preparation community.&lt;br/&gt;Conference goals include:&lt;br/&gt;1. Provide professional development for physics teacher educators&lt;br/&gt;2. Foster networking among PhysTEC community members&lt;br/&gt;3. Support faculty learning communities for PhysTEC Site leaders&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will provide an opportunity for approximately 100 leaders and participants in the PhysTEC community to update and expand their knowledge regarding effective practices and research in physics teacher preparation. An evaluation plan will investigate the effectiveness of the PhysTEC Conference to engage physics departments, develop capacity for change, and improve physics teacher preparation, and result in a survey instrument that can be used for future conferences. Participants will lead their institutions in adopting research-based practices, including instructional practices shown to increase student learning and develop knowledge and skills for teaching physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The NSF grant supported two national meetings of the Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC) project.  The annual PhysTEC Conference is the nation's largest meeting dedicated to the recruitment and preparation of K-12 physics teachers. The conferences held February 17-18, 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia and February 9-10, 2018 in College Park, Maryland each attracted about 100 participants. The annual PhysTEC Conference is an integral activity of the larger PhysTEC project (see www.phystec.org), and is central to the dissemination of knowledge and practices regarding successful programs at PhysTEC Sites. The PhysTEC Conference engages and supports faculty, administrators and staff in physics departments at colleges and universities to make teacher education part of their mission and address the severe national shortage of qualified K-12 physics teachers. The PhysTEC conferences featured plenaries, workshops on effective practices, panel discussions by national leaders, a poster session, networking opportunities, and professional development opportunities for physics teacher educators. The external evaluator reported a number of positive findings that indicate the conferences were highly effective:   Participant-centered sessions that included concrete data and valued strategies;   Frequent use of effective professional development strategies;   High degrees of interactivity at conference sessions;   Equitable connections among many types of attendees;   Sizeable learning gains across almost all topic areas;   A strong sense of belonging and community among participants;   Support for follow-up actions through sharing of concrete strategies;   Enhancement of participants' motivation and confidence in their ability to lead change;   Inclusion of high school teacher perspectives.
