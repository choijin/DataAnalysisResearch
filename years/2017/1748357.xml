<AbstractNarration>This awards supports "The Ninth Annual Graduate Student Mini-conference in Computational Mathematics", held at University of South Carolina at its Columbia campus on February 17-18, 2018. The conference webpage is at http://imi.cas.sc.edu/events/ninth-annual-graduate-student-mini-conference-computational-mathematics/. The conference will promote the progress of science by bringing together a wide group of students and researchers working at the frontier of computational mathematics. Topics include recent advances in the theory and implementation of numerical solutions to partial differential equation models for, but not limited to, materials science, turbulence, biomedical flows, climate simulation, and data rich phenomena. The conference series has established a unique role as a comfortable forum for culturally diverse graduate students and recent Ph.D.s to present their work, learn of recent advances, form collaborations, and network to advance their career opportunities. The Ninth Annual Graduate Student Mini-conference will continue this tradition. The conference organizers are committed to supporting the participation of graduate students, recent Ph.D.s, and researchers from underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organizing committee anticipates approximately 55 participants in attendance, to include 1 senior and 1 junior plenary speakers, 30 graduate students (10 from USC), and their advisors (5 from USC). The conference consists of 2 forty-five-minute-long plenary talks, approximately 16 fifteen-minute-long contributed talks, and 1 two-hour-long discussion session. In particular, one plenary talk will be given by a senior computational scientist from Argonne National Laboratory, the other will be presented by a junior postdoc fellow at USC; all the contributed talks will be given by graduate students, and the discussion session will focus on the career development for graduate students and postdocs. The student speakers will be selected from attendees based on their CVs and by consulting with their advisors about their research achievements.</AbstractNarration>
