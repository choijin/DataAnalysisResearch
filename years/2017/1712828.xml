<AbstractNarration>This project includes a multi-institutional team of scientists who are making advanced in-situ atmospheric measurements to investigate questions relevant to ozone formation and the occurrence of high concentrations of atmospheric ozone that can be damaging to human health.  The Lake Michigan Ozone Study includes remote sensing activities being supported by NASA and the US EPA.  The project will provide training for graduate and undergraduate researchers in atmospheric chemistry and build regional capacity in atmospheric science through a collaboration between university, state, and federal stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of the proposal are to: (1) establish concentrations and speciation of key ozone-related chemicals (volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen oxides (NOy), and VOC oxidation products) at a representative coastal site where high ozone levels commonly occur; (2) quantify and explain the role of the above species in dictating the production efficiency and NOx sensitivity driving coastal ozone; (3) determine the particulate and ozone influences of biogenic-rich and biogenic-poor regional air masses, urban plumes, localized emissions, and shipping for regional atmospheric chemistry; and (4) diagnose shortcomings and advance model skill for simulating critical aspects of coastal meteorology and chemistry in the current and future atmosphere.  The results will improve the ability to predict high ozone episodes that may be harmful to human health and the environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientists supported by this award will deploy a Proton Transfer Reaction Quadrupole Interface Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer, an Iodine Chemical Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer, and off-line measurements of aerosol chemical and physical properties during the summer of 2017 at the Zion site in Illinois? Lake County, located approximately 1000 m from the Lake Michigan coastline in the Illinois Beach State Park.  The data collected will provide the additional information needed to address the important questions related to coastal ozone chemistry and its representation in current chemical transport models.</AbstractNarration>
