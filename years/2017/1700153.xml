<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the conference "International Conference in Approximation Theory" that will be held from May 8 - 11, 2017 at Georgia Southern University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the field of approximation theory.   A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.   The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.

We especially encouraged the participation of women and otherwise members of minority groups. Among other activities, the conference hosted a panel on the subject "Women in mathematics". The moderators included well established women mathematicians (Olga Holtz, Martha Abell) as well as a junior faculty (Ha Nguyen). The figures&nbsp;attached show the count of participants in different categories. More than 50% of participants were non-senior faculty, with a 16% women participants out of plenary&nbsp;speakers. The young researchers participation stands at 37%. We have made an effort&nbsp;to balance the list of speakers in terms of geographic locations. We had 9 speakers from the US, 2 from Canada, 5 from Europe (Poland, Spain, Ukraine), and 1 from the Middle East (Israel). We had 3 female speakers.&nbsp; Among 13 poster presenters there were 2 females and one disabled person.
