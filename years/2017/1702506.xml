<AbstractNarration>Ecologists are increasingly using computer models, involving extensive observations obtained through environmental sensor networks, to study lakes and forests and predict future change. Conducting this modeling, as well as understanding the model results, requires skills in data analysis, quantitative reasoning, and computing. However, modeling and computational skills are rarely taught in undergraduate classrooms, representing a major gap in training students to tackle complex environmental challenges. This project will develop a training program that teaches thousands of students across the U.S. the foundations of macrosystems ecology through simulation modeling. Through the program, instructors and their students will learn how to quickly and efficiently run the models by using new resources emerging from computer science. Thus, students will simultaneously learn the core concepts of macrosystems science and develop the skills needed to conduct the next generation of environmental research. These concepts and skills will be embedded within teaching modules centered on the frontier of macrosystems ecology, enabling undergraduate students to contribute to high-level macrosystems research. Engaging undergraduate students in hands-on modeling activities with real-world applications translates into a workforce with increased data science, systems thinking, and quantitative skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will create a training program (MacroSystems EDDIE: Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry &amp; Exploration) that connects undergraduate students with new computing tools to teach them the foundations of macrosystems science using simulation modeling. These tools will be embedded in stand-alone teaching modules that will be widely applicable to a suite of disciplines and undergraduate student experience levels. The proposed modules represent the first formalized macrosystems science curriculum for undergraduates, which will be rigorously assessed, revised, and disseminated broadly for maximum impact through a partnership with the Science Education Research Center. The modules will be designed around areas of active research inquiry e.g., interacting local and regional effects on lake temperatures, carbon cycling, the incidence of algal blooms, continental-scale water policy and students will be encouraged to develop novel questions at the frontier of macrosystems science that they will answer using simulation models. As part of the training program, the students will share their results with Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) scientific working groups to advance ongoing macrosystems research. The proposed program represents an innovative approach for teaching macrosystems biology to undergraduates and has the potential to advance undergraduate STEM education across the U.S. A minimum of 750 students will participate in the MacroSystems EDDIE modules during this project, with the potential for several thousands more through dissemination by Science Education Research Center. student participation in the Macrosystems EDDIE modules will generate scientific discoveries that will advance our understanding of macrosystems bio</AbstractNarration>
