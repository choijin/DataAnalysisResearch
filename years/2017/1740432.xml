<AbstractNarration>The PI will construct the smallest reported light source with emission similar to laser light. Its brightness will be at least two orders of magnitude higher than state of the art fluorescent nanoparticles of similar size. Such a nanoscopic laser source will be valuable in guiding and assisting microscopic surgery, specifically in the brain.  The PI has a well-established record of mentoring and outreach. The PI will continue these activities, e.g. mentoring a summer undergraduate student during the proposed research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The small size of the nanolaser will enable accessing the spaces between cells. The high brightness will enable triggering local photochemical reactions. Such a remote light source could photo stimulate a single synapse, a step towards wireless remote information exchange between the nervous system. This could also produce chemical species which selectively destroy cancer cells targeted by the nanolaser particles. The nanolaser is a unique molecular structure, its material scaffold being a virus shell. The advantage of using such a bio-enabled approach is due to the inherited molecular precision in structural organization and from self-assembly, which occurs spontaneously from simple, benign reagents.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ When R. Dicke predicted almost 70 years ago that multiple quantum radiators in a common field should lock phases and emit coherently at much higher rates than if they were independent, super-radiance was suggested as a way towards generating short coherent pulses of light, without a cavity. The initial enthusiasm was dampened by the realization that processes responsible for dephasing, such as phonon collisions, would effectively suppress the coherent, collective emission effect. Because of this impediment, the vast majority of studies were performed at very low temperatures. Nevertheless, a large body of spectroscopic work on the mechanism of energy transfer in light harvesting complexes of photosynthetic bacteria indicated in recent years that quantum coherence can occur at room temperature, and in soft matter.  Stimulated by these ideas, we have set out to create an array of chromophores on a biological template provided by a symmetric virus particle. The accurate molecular architecture and symmetry of the virus ensures optical indistinguishability of chromophores -- we found this is key for establishing coherence.  Our work suggests a way towards novel, virus-enabled imaging vectors with qualitatively different optical properties than state-of-the-art fluorescent agents. Such biophotonic particles could be of interest for laser-guided surgery, optogenetic manipulation, and other applications that would benefit from bright, deep-subwavelength light sources.
