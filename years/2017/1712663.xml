<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the conference Algebra Extravaganza which will take place on the main campus of Temple University on July 24-28, 2017. Algebra is a very broad and vital part of mathematics which involves everything from the study of solutions of polynomial equations to the study of subtle abstract algebraic structures. It lays the necessary foundation for other branches of mathematics such as algebraic geometry, number theory, representation theory and algebraic topology. This conference is devoted to the recent research activities on the interplay between Noncommutative Algebra with Invariant Theory, Representation Theory, and Algebraic Geometry. Many recent conferences in these areas of algebra have focused on parts of these connections, but this conference will be unique in that it will feature talks on a large variety of topics.  The conference will feature over 20 lectures from world-renowned experts, and should attract around 75-100 participants from the international mathematics community. In addition to regular talks by experts, the conference will feature a poster session as a networking opportunity for junior participants. Funding will be prioritized for junior participants and for women and underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will bring together research leaders in Noncommutative Algebra, whose expertise have connections to Invariant Theory, Representation Theory, and Algebraic Geometry. Focus topic areas include:  algebraic deformation theory; cluster algebras and cluster categories; Hopf algebras and their actions on algebras; noncommutative invariant theory; noncommutative projective algebraic geometry; noncommutative resolutions of singularities; and  Poisson algebras and Calabi-Yau algebras.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The conference "Algebra extravaganza!" was an exciting event which brought together research leaders in Noncommutative Algebra, whose expertise have connections to Invariant Theory and Representation Theory. The conference took place at Temple University on July 24-28, 2017.   There were 72 participants from different places in the US and some places from abroad (Austria, Canada, China, Great Britain, Israel and Korea). The conference featured 26 talks and 12 poster presentations. Over a third of the speakers and close to a third of the participants, were from underrepresented groups.   The following topics were presented at the conference:   1) Hopf algebras and noncommutative invariant theory,  2) noncommutative algebraic geometry with noncommutative resolutions of singularities,  3) multiplicative invariant theory,  4) matrix factorizations generalized to the noncommutative setting,  5) algebraic deformation theory,   6) finite dimensional algebras and (quantum) cluster theory.  Selected outcomes of the conference include:   1) Sarah Witherspoon met with her collaborators Sian Fryer, Ellen Kirkman, and Anne Shepler to work on a paper about color Lie rings and PBW deformations of skew group algebras (another coauthor, Tina Kanstrup, was not at the conference). The paper was submitted to arxiv in January of 2018.   2) Xingting Wang's paper "Calabi-Yau property under monoidal Morita-Takeuchi equivalence" was published in Pacific Journal of Mathematics. The results of the paper were presented at the conference.   3) During the conference Xingting Wang came up with an idea that started a joint project with Sarah Witherspoon. This project is about the conjecture that the cohomology of a finite dimensional Hopf algebra is finitely generated.   4) Don Passman wrote a preprint "Permutational and rewritable groups". He intends to submit this preprint to a journal. The results of his work were presented to the conference.   5) Several talks have had an effect on the presentation of certain topics in Martin Lorenz's book "A Tour of Representation Theory" (to be published by the AMS). Examples include the lecture by Georgia Benkart on a tensor analog of Molien?s formula in invariant theory, the lecture by Gail Letzter on the role of coideal subalgebras in certain quantized enveloping algebras and the lecture of Jason Bell on the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence.   6) Ryan Kinser had a chance to reignite his collaboration with Chelsea Walton and they expect to finish a paper during this semester.  7) Kenneth Brown and Milen Yakimov had a chance to discuss aspects of their ongoing research collaboration on the representation theory of PI algebras during this conference.  8) During the conference, Chelsea Walton, Xingting Wang and Milen Yakimov worked on a project on "Poisson geometry and representations of PI 4 dimensional Sklyanin algebras" which resulted in the preprint arXiv:1802.06487.   9) The poster session was an important networking event for junior mathematicians.  10) Slides of selected talks were posted on the website of the conference:   https://math.temple.edu/events/conferences/k-l/    This online resource is very helpful both for established researchers and for young mathematicians.
