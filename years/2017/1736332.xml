<AbstractNarration>The health and function of the ocean is controlled by the production and consumption of a broad spectrum of chemicals. While stable chemical species can be measured using traditional methods of water collection and either shipboard or lab-based analyses, this approach is not amenable to chemicals that have lifetimes on the orders of hours or less. Due to their rapid production and consumption, these reactive compounds are short-lived and typically exist in low levels within the ocean; yet, they have a disproportionately large influence on their surrounding environment. In fact, there is an emerging recognition that these short-lived reactive chemicals may even be essential to the overall efficiency and health of the ocean. The intrinsic difficulty in measuring short-lived species has been a crippling constraint on measuring these important chemicals, and has thereby limited the ability to predict their role in the health of the ocean and its inhabitants. Thus, this research will develop, build and validate a remotely-operated, underwater chemical sensor that will enable direct measurements of these key reactive chemicals in the ocean. The instrument will be initially designed and tested using the targets hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, two reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are notoriously difficult to measure and yet are key to the health and biogeochemistry of the ocean. This project will also support collaborative education efforts with the Boston Green Academy by introducing high school students to the world of deep-sea instrumentation and its importance in understanding our ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to design, develop and validate a biogeochemical sensor for marine research, in the form of a submersible oceanic (chemi)luminescent analyzer of reactive intermediate species (SOLARIS). The SOLARIS will combine an advanced and adaptive fluidics system with a highly sensitive photodetection analyzer, comprising a submersible in situ chemiluminescent sensor. This instrument will extend analytical capabilities toward an ability to characterize the dynamics of reactive chemical species in environments that have been heretofore out of reach, in particular the deep sea. The SOLARIS will represent the development and integration of four modules, which together comprise an analytical platform capable of calibrated in situ measurements at pico- to nano-molar detection levels. These modules will include custom designed software controllable pumping and valve manifolds, allowing careful control and on-the-fly modification of fluid transfer and pumping configurations for calibration, background measurements, and standardization. At its hub the underwater photodetection system will involve the development of a transparent, pressure-bearing sapphire flow cell to be integrated into a pressure housing containing a highly sensitive photomultiplier tube. Together with an integral spectrophotometer used for conducting calibrations and analyte decay measurements, these systems will comprise the analytical module. The SOLARIS will be configured and deployed in both a rosette-mounted "pelagic mode" for examining water column dynamics in coastal and more offshore waters, as well as in a "benthic mode" while integrated onto a submersible vehicle for preliminary investigation of deep sea biological communities. Both of these platforms will be validated as part of an integrated science plan to make the first in situ measurements of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide - research that will enable scientific exploration of the role of ROS in controlling the elemental cycling, carbon degradation, and organismal health throughout all depths of the global ocean.</AbstractNarration>
