<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Southern California is located in Los Angeles, CA. The site supports the training of 10 students over 10 weeks during the summers of 2018-2021. Professor Kyung Jung leads this site which is supported by the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Science Directorate. The site offers original research projects on a wide array of chemistry related topics. Student participants are paired with one of 32 research-active faculty members to pursue unique projects, collect and analyze data, and organize results for reports and presentations. Prior to the start of the program, students participate in a newly designed, preparative pre-summer REU program. Students develop skills necessary for professional chemistry careers by engaging in long-term mentoring relationships and taking part in faculty-led seminars and discussions on topics like responsible conduct in research, choosing a graduate school, and careers in chemistry. Students also build a cohesive community of peers, mentors, and graduate student advisors through participation in social activities. This program is committed to expanding access to research experiences among underserved and minority students from Southern California community colleges and primarily undergraduate institutions, first-generation college students, veterans, and people with disabilities. The program helps students become role models for their peers and attract other students to science programs. This synergy contributes to human resource development by improving the national pipeline into advanced education and career success in STEM fields.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU program provides students with intensive hands-on experience in a wide array of chemistry sub-disciplines, including organic synthesis, reaction catalysis, mechanistic chemistry, biochemistry and biophysics, materials chemistry, theoretical chemistry and reaction dynamics, and ultra-fast spectroscopy. Examples of projects include the conversion of solar energy in chemical bonds, molecular synthesis, and visualizing molecular interactions between drugs and biological targets. Each participant conducts independent research in a participating faculty group and is trained closely by a faculty advisor and assisted by a graduate student mentor. This model empowers students to conduct individual research projects in their choice of research area. Students are encouraged to disseminate their work through publication in peer-reviewed journals or presentations at scientific conferences. To ensure a quality program, this site is evaluated annually in collaboration with the USC STEM Education Research Group and is refined accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
