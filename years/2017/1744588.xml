<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to host a workshop that will advance the technology transfer mission of federal laboratories, which constitute an important component of the U.S. national innovation system. In 1980, Congress enacted two landmark pieces of legislation, with strong bipartisan support, to facilitate technology transfer from universities and federal laboratories to the private sector. The first was the Bayh-Dole Act, which applied mainly to universities. The second was the Stevenson-Wydler Act, which applied to federal labs. This was followed by two additional pieces of legislation that were also designed to facilitate the commercialization of research at federal labs, the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 and the Technology Transfer Commercialization Act of 2000. Bayh-Dole unleashed a substantial rise in university technology transfer, which has been studied intensively by academics. Unfortunately, much less is known about technology transfer at federal labs. It also appears that technology transfer outcomes at federal labs have lagged behind those achieved by universities. Also, managers at federal labs have few analytical tools and little existing research to help them manage technology transfer effectively. This workshop will fill this gap by developing a research agenda that will be useful to scholars, lab managers, and policy makers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will specifically address organizational issues, which have been shown to affect university technology transfer performance, including the propensity of academic scientists and engineers to engage in technology transfer. These include macro or institutional factors, such as strategy, structure, organizational culture, and inter-organizational relations. Organizational issues also include micro or individual-level factors, such as whether scientists perceive that they are being treated fairly in the workplace, incentives for faculty engagement in technology transfer, and struggles that scientists have with their new role as academic entrepreneurs. These types of issues, as well as others, are also likely to be relevant to federal labs. By considering both micro- and macro-level issues, the workshop will be highly interdisciplinary in nature. The workshop will convene: (1) leading academic experts on organizational issues in management, psychology, strategy, sociology, public policy, and economics; (2) the relatively few academics who have conducted research on technology transfer at federal labs; (3) editors of top journals in innovation and management studies and other thought leaders in management, sociology, and public policy; (4) doctoral students from leading schools of public policy and management, and (5) managers of major federal labs and the federal agencies that sponsor them. A key goal of the workshop will be to develop a research agenda that will simultaneously advance academic research on organizational issues in technology transfer, while at the same time, identifying tools and tactics to enable managers of federal labs to advance their technology transfer mission and fulfill the spirit of Stevenson-Wydler and other legislation that is designed to stimulate the commercialization of research at federal labs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There were four key outcomes of the workshop:  1) A new paper on organizational issues in academic entreprenurship emerged from the workshop, which highlighted the importance of foreign-born status in academic entreprenurship.  This paper is titled "Entrepreneurial Identity, Immigration Status, and Academic Entrepreneurship: Empirical Evidence From University Scientists." We presented this paper at the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management (APPAM) conference in Washington, D.C. last November and at the Academy of Management Specialized Conference on "Start-up to Scale-up" in Tel Aviv in December 2018.  2) We organized a session at the Academy of Management Specialized Conference on "Start-up to Scale-up" in Tel Aviv in December 2018 on "Multi-Disciplinary Perspectives on Knowledge Worker Entrepreneurship," involving Shiri Breznitz (University of Toronto), Gideon Markman (Colorado State University), Phil Phan (Johns Hopkins University), Janet Bercovitz (University of Colorado), and Rajshree Agarwal (University of Maryland). This symposium featured multi-disciplinary perspectives on entrepreneurship involving knowledge workers in a variety of sectors. Several presenters will focus on key organizational and strategic issues relating to academic entrepreneurship and the commercialization of science, while others focused on the private sector. A variety of 'micro' and 'macro' concepts and tools were discussed, including perspectives from economics, strategy, psychology, organizational behavior, human resource management, geography, and public policy.0  3) Two grant proposals on organizational issues in academic entrepreneurship also emerged from the workshop.  Both of these proposals are with Marie Mitchell, who attended the NSF Workshop in November 2017, in her role as Associate Editor of Personnel Pyschology.  Marie was able to connect our work on informal technology transfer or "bypassing" the technology transfer office to her research on organizational deviance.   The first proposal, titled "Psychological Processes Before the Entrepreneurship Decision (or not): A Mixed Methods Study of Postdoc Scientists," was submitted to the Kauffman Foundation.  The second proposal, titled "Investigating the Role of Championing Leadership in Formal and Deviant Technology Transfer Processes in University and Federal Labs," was submitted to NSF's Science of Organizations Program.  4) ASQ/JMS Workshop-Another key outsome of the NSF workshop is a follow-on workshop on "Agents and Institutions Engaged in Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Sustainability: Bridging the Micro/Macro Organizational Divide." The workshop is jointly sponsored by Administrative Science Quarterly (2017 Impact Factor-5.878) and the Journal of Management Studies (2017 Impact Factor-5.329), which is managed by the Society for the Advancement of Management Studies (SAMS-see http://www.socadms.org.uk/).  SAMS is providing financial support for the workshop.           Last Modified: 01/01/2019       Submitted by: Donald S Siegel]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
