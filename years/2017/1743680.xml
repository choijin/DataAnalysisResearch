<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in the arena of energy-efficient solid state lighting. It has been estimated that 20% of all electricity generated in the US is for lighting purposes. Solid state lighting uses far less energy to produce the same amount of effective lighting than incandescent or fluorescent bulbs. Additionally, it neither poses the environmental risk of releasing elemental mercury, nor does it require restricted disposal as do compact fluorescent bulbs. Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) are more energy efficient and flexible than simple Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), which are made of brittle inorganic materials. OLEDs are &gt;90% more efficient than incandescent light bulbs, and have the potential to be &gt;98% more efficient. Therefore, OLED technology has the potential to dramatically reduce lighting costs and the associated electrical generation preventing the release of billions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. OLED screens are steadily displacing other technologies used in portable, battery-operated devices such as cell phones, laptops, and tablets, and in TV's, airplane cockpits, and cars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project addresses a technological bottleneck for current OLED devices in the materials used for the generation of blue light. The materials currently in use have a fluorescent emission, which requires higher voltages resulting in greater energy consumption, more heat generation, and faster breakdown of the material in the device. Current manufacturers have adapted by using a layer of blue material that is twice the thickness of that in the red and green diode, which poses challenges for engineering the device structurally. The red and green diodes use a phosphorescent material requiring less voltage for generating the emission, thus, reducing energy consumption and heat generation. This project will evaluate the market potential of a new phosphorescent, true-blue emitting material for commercial applications that has greater thermal and chemical stability and is highly quantum efficient. During the project period, the team will gather information from OLED manufacturers to device makers to discern the need, cost-point, and interest for new raw materials, and how to fine tune the materials to better suit applications.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) are the most energy-efficient modern, light producing method. A challenge in current OLED technology is the lack of stable, efficient, true blue emitting material for manufacturing OLEDs. Through previous NSF funding T. Keith Hollis, the PI, has developed a unique ligand architecture that allows for synthesis of air stable, long lasting, and patented true-blue emitting materials. Along with the PI, Theodore Helgert, the Hispanic Entrepreneurial Lead (EL), and Carl Hagstrom, the Business Mentor (BM), the team full participated in the Kick-off workshop and get-out-of-the-building activities in the San Francisco Cohort in July 2017. The training sessions and contacts with potential customers in the region were extremely fruitful. The EL rapidly improved in giving business-level presentations and discussions under the tutelage of the instructors, the BM and the PI. Having travelled to the west coast, the team went directly to the Los Angeles region to conduct more customer interviews over the next three days. The EL gained many valuable experiences in later travel to meet with prospective customers. It was learned at the last minute that a critical contact from a large multi-national conglomerate would be at a business conference in San Diego, so the EL quickly booked a flight and flew there arriving in the wee hours of the night. He was able to meet face-to-face with after several weeks of failed attempts due to the timely travel afforded by the award. Discussions with this contact continue. In another example, while preparing for a meeting in Atlanta, the water main broke. He improvised and purchased all of the available bottled water at the hotel to shower. A total of 105 interviews were conducted. The team attended the Lessons-learned workshop reaching a consensus opinion that a go-decision was viable. The business contacts and oral communications skill development, particularly effective communication with a non-scientific audience, were invaluable in aiding the progress of the ELs professional career and successful search for a permanent position in a chemical company. Minimum viable products (MVPs) of OLEDs were prepared from the relevant materials and are illustrated below. The team has successfully competed for an award to complete development of materials for commercial viability and to have portable MVPs to demonstrate the technology to potential investors. A start-up LLC has been formed based on the award, which has now taken a near-term pivot to market the chemical technology developed in the PIs lab as a specialty and research chemical, with the target of reaching OLED commercial emitters remaining the ultimate goal. One of the key lessons learned was that there is a great deal of entrenchment of current technologies and resistance to new participants. Therefore, one of the principle routes to entry is to seek a competitor to current market leaders who wants to develop the next-generation technology to disrupt the current market place.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/25/2019<br>      Modified by: Thedford&nbsp;K&nbsp;Hollis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743680/1743680_10490310_1556220097112_Blue-emitter-OLED-MVP--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743680/1743680_10490310_1556220097112_Blue-emitter-OLED-MVP--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Blue OLED"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1743680/1743680_10490310_1556220097112_Blue-emitter-OLED-MVP--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Blue OLED"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Blue OLED MVP demo.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lifeng Huang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Thedford&nbsp;K&nbsp;Hollis</div> <div class="imageTitle">Blue OLED</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
