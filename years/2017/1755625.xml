<AbstractNarration>This proposal explores opportunities to improve cybersecurity systems by encouraging cooperation and stewardship, whereby people work together for mutually beneficial cybersecurity outcomes. For example, coworkers could provide accountability for one another in keeping their software fully up-to-date, or a trusted expert might remotely configure the security settings on a new laptop for a consenting non-expert. Many existing security systems, by contrast, are not designed to enable or encourage social interaction, a situation that often results in confusion and non-compliance. This proposal will involve studies with people to understand how and when cooperation and stewardship might be beneficial, along with the development of a platform that facilitates the evaluation and construction of such systems. The proposed work work should add to our understanding of how to design and engineer effective real-world cybersecurity systems by incorporating social interaction. Furthermore, this project will provide both undergraduate and graduate students an opportunity to participate in interdisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This proposal marries ideas from social psychology, human-computer interaction, and design to tackle a simple and timely question in usable security: How can we create systems that facilitate cooperation and stewardship in end-user cybersecurity systems in order to encourage better cybersecurity behaviors? In the context of this proposal, end-users can be thought of as people who directly interface with a security system to protect their own assets; cooperation in end-user security systems allows people to act collectively towards mutually beneficial security goals or benefit, and, stewardship in end-user security systems allow people to act on behalf of others' security goals or benefit. The union of such cooperative and stewarded systems can be said to be sociopetal, or designed to bring people together. The proposed work will encompass three interacting research thrusts: (i) running group interviews and diary studies to model end-users' day-to-day security activities and how they relate to a broader social context; (ii) developing novel sociopetal cybersecurity systems and evaluating those systems with real user groups; and, (iii) creating and releasing a platform for facilitating the development and evaluation of future sociopetal cybersecurity systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PI Sauvik Das used this award to initiate his research agenda within  the  broad field of social cybersecurity as an assistant professor at   Georgia Institute of Technology.   The outcomes of the effort supported by this award include a best  paper honorable mention at ACM SIGCHI -- the flagship conference for  human-computer interaction; three PACM HCI CSCW papers -- a top-tier  venue for work that spans social computing and human-computer  interaction; one SOUPS paper -- a key venue for usable privacy and  security scholarship; a systematization of knowledge paper that is  currently under revisions for IEEE S&amp;P -- the flagship venue for  security and privacy research; two papers currently under submission at  USENIX Security -- a premier venue for security and privacy research;  and, two ongoing projects that PI Das expects to submit for publication  by the end of 2021.   Intellectual merits: Through the ongoing and published research  supported by this award, PI Das and his students and collaborators have  made the following key intellectual contributions: (i) an understanding  of how small, social groups jointly navigate securing collectively owned  and shared digital resources; (ii) the inadequacies of existing  security and privacy controls at supporting socially nuanced S&amp;P  decision making in small group settings; (iii) a design space to  scaffold the exploration and creation of social S&amp;P controls to  better support the needs of small, social groups; (iv) a model for how  social triggers motivate expert-recommended S&amp;P behaviors (e.g.,  enabling two-factor authentication and using a password manager) among  non-experts; (v) design knowledge for how collectives of individuals  might jointly author demands for redress in the face of institutional  privacy violations; and, (vi) knowledge of how dynamic audience  selection tools on social media services might help or hinder people in  setting access control policies for content shared on social media.
