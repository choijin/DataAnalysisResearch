<AbstractNarration>This is a pilot study to investigate the chemistry occurring within clouds that can lead to the formation of secondary organic aerosol in the atmosphere.  It is expected that chemical reactions taking place within fog and cloud droplets are responsible for much of the differences in the predicted and measured mass of atmospheric organic aerosol.  The results of the project will lead to a better understanding of how clouds can affect air quality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary hypothesis of the study is that organic compounds within cloud-processed aerosols will be more soluble as a result of oxidation reactions and that cloud droplet residuals (the aerosols remaining after cloud droplets evaporate) will be higher in organic mass than aerosols being drawn into clouds from below the cloud-base. The results of this study will lead to improved modeling of the heterogeneous chemical processing of organics within clouds.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>This grant helped to support a pilot study at the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC) Whiteface Mountain  (WFM) research observatory in the Adirondacks of New York State to evaluate Chemical Processing of Organic matter within Clouds  (CPOC), which took place August 11-25,  2017. Chemical observations during the CPOC pilot study confirmed that  organic matter is now a dominant component of both aerosol and cloud  water, with organics comprising 66-93% of the submicron aerosol mass  throughout the pilot study, in contrast to measurements from 25 years  ago when inorganics (especially sulfate) dominated the aerosol and cloud  water composition. During CPOC, cloud water was collected at 1-hr time  resolution to supplement the long-term routine 12-hour sampling, and  simultaneous below-cloud and in-cloud chemical measurements were  obtained to provide further insights into chemical processes leading to  the observed long-term trend toward higher organic mass fractions at  WFM.&nbsp; Cloud droplet size distributions were also measured at the summit (for the first time, to our knowledge) and were used to assess the  accuracy of the liquid water content measurements that have been and  continue to be used to control the cloud water collection system.&nbsp;  Size-resolved measurements of cloud condensation nuclei and aerosol  particle size distributions were obtained at both the summit and  below-cloud from the ASRC Sprinter Van mobile research facility, to assess the vertical transport  of aerosols at the mountain top and within the lower part of the  clouds.&nbsp; Weather balloon (radiosonde) and LIDAR measurements were  obtained for meteorological assessment of the winds, humidity, and temperature vertical profiles, to further evaluate the connection between  summit and below-cloud measurements.&nbsp; A manuscript is being prepared for  submission to the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society  describing the pilot study observations.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> A pilot study was recommended by participants of the NSF-supported  cloud chemistry workshop that took place at WFM in 2016.&nbsp; Due to  elevator renovations that began in late 2017 and are currently underway  at WFM (which greatly impede transport of large equipment and supplies to  the summit) the pilot study needed to take place in the summer of 2017  or wait until summer of 2019 (and perhaps longer).&nbsp; At a critical  moment, the CPOC pilot study demonstrated the ongoing value of the longterm cloud  water sampling at WFM and its relevance to the broader scientific  community, adding leverage to a subsequent request for funding from  the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority for continued support of cloud water collection and analysis  efforts, awarded in 2018 for five more years under the new guidance of  Dr. Lance.&nbsp; For the CPOC pilot study, several graduate (4) and  undergraduate (3) students gained research experience and contributed to  research at all levels, from instrument deployment, forecasting and  data acquisition to data analysis and scientific  presentations/publications.&nbsp; Preliminary results were presented by a SUNY-Albany  undergraduate student at the 2018 American Meteorological Society annual conference and research from the pilot study has featured prominently in the PhD prospectus of a SUNY-Albany graduate  student.&nbsp; Dr. Lance  presented preliminary results from the pilot study at several local  meetings (NYSDEC, NYSERDA) and national conferences (2017 AGU &amp; 2018  AMS Cloud Physics) in the year since the pilot study concluded.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/28/2018<br>      Modified by: Sara&nbsp;Lance</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1753278/1753278_10516367_1543450624388_RB_170813_1723--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1753278/1753278_10516367_1543450624388_RB_170813_1723--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Rooftop Instruments in-cloud"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1753278/1753278_10516367_1543450624388_RB_170813_1723--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Rooftop Instruments in-cloud"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Rooftop instruments in-cloud at the summit of Whiteface Mountain during the CPOC pilot study in 2017.</div> <div class="imageCredit">R.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: This grant helped to support a pilot study at the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC) Whiteface Mountain  (WFM) research observatory in the Adirondacks of New York State to evaluate Chemical Processing of Organic matter within Clouds  (CPOC), which took place August 11-25,  2017.

Cloud droplet size distributions were also measured at the summit (for the first time, to our knowledge) and were used to assess the  accuracy of the liquid water content measurements that have been and  continue to be used to control the cloud water collection system.   Size-resolved measurements of cloud condensation nuclei and aerosol  particle size distributions were obtained at both the summit and  below-cloud from the ASRC Sprinter Van mobile research facility, to assess the vertical transport  of aerosols at the mountain top and within the lower part of the  clouds.  Weather balloon (radiosonde) and LIDAR measurements were  obtained for meteorological assessment of the winds, humidity, and temperature vertical profiles, to further evaluate the connection between  summit and below-cloud measurements.  A manuscript is being prepared for  submission to the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society  describing the pilot study observations.    Broader Impacts: A pilot study was recommended by participants of the NSF-supported  cloud chemistry workshop that took place at WFM in 2016.  Due to  elevator renovations that began in late 2017 and are currently underway  at WFM (which greatly impede transport of large equipment and supplies to  the summit) the pilot study needed to take place in the summer of 2017  or wait until summer of 2019 (and perhaps longer).  At a critical  moment, the CPOC pilot study demonstrated the ongoing value of the longterm cloud  water sampling at WFM and its relevance to the broader scientific  community, adding leverage to a subsequent request for funding from  the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority for continued support of cloud water collection and analysis  efforts, awarded in 2018 for five more years under the new guidance of  Dr. Lance.  For the CPOC pilot study, several graduate (4) and  undergraduate (3) students gained research experience and contributed to  research at all levels, from instrument deployment, forecasting and  data acquisition to data analysis and scientific  presentations/publications.  Preliminary results were presented by a SUNY-Albany  undergraduate student at the 2018 American Meteorological Society annual conference and research from the pilot study has featured prominently in the PhD prospectus of a SUNY-Albany graduate  student.  Dr. Lance  presented preliminary results from the pilot study at several local  meetings (NYSDEC, NYSERDA) and national conferences (2017 AGU &amp; 2018  AMS Cloud Physics) in the year since the pilot study concluded.
