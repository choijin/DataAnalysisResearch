<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is the development of a new class of semiconductor laser based on intersublevel transitions in engineered quantum nanostructures.  Both self-assembled and nanolithographically defined quantum dots will be investigated for their potential as mid-infrared gain media and for integration into semiconductor laser structures.   The intellectual merit of the program lies in the development of a new type of gain media which can be incorporated either mid-infrared lasers for sensing and lab-on-a-chip applications, or into cutting edge mid-infrared metamaterial and plasmonic structures.   The investigation of optically efficient nanolithographically defined quantum heterostructures will, in addition, prove to be an enabling technology, not only for mid-infrared frequencies, but in other, technologically important frequency ranges such as the terahertz and telecom frequencies. The broader impacts of the proposed work lie in the societal benefits associated with the potential integration of this new gain medium into medical diagnostic, environmental sensing, and security and defense technologies.  Furthermore, the development of optical gain will be mirrored by an educational plan designed to integrate academic gain into the local K12 and university community, with an emphasis on developing core competencies among young undergraduate and high-school science students.   In summary, the program will develop a transformative technology to demonstrate intersublevel gain in engineered semiconductor quantum nanostructures, and integrate this new gain media into devices and structures for mid-infrared photonics applications.  The technical proposal to develop optical gain is mirrored closely by an educational plan to demonstrate academic gain among local K12 and undergraduate science students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This program aimed to develop new types of mid-infrared semiconductor sources based on intersublevel and/or interband transitions in engineered quantum nanostructures.  We have investigated a wide range of quantum dot and quantum well materials over the course of the program.  Early work demonstrated electrically active quantum dot emitters fabricated via top-down nanolithography.  We later demonstrated the ability to engineer energy states in submonolayer quantum dot structures. However, the most significant strides were made in the development and characterization of type-II quantum dots and InAs quantum wells grown on InP substrates using metamorphic buffer layers. In the former, we demonstrated strong emission from InSb insertion layers in InAs matrices, and noted the formation of quantum dots upon introduction of Ga into the InSb insertion layers.  We were able to characterize and engineering carrier lifetimes in these insertion layers, and determine a grpwth parameter window for the formation of quantum dots emitting at mid-IR wavelengths.  We were able to demonstrated significant improvement in the temperature dependence of the mid-IR emission, with only a factor of 5 quenching of emission moving from 77 to 250K.  We also showed significant improvement in carrier lifetimes by formation of InGaSb nanostructures.  Electroluminescence was demonstrated from In(Ga)Sb emitters in InAs matrices.  Finally, in collaboration with the Lee group (then at Yale, currently at UIUC), we were able to demonstrate the utility of metamorphic buffer layers for the growth of mid-IR optoelectronic materials on InP substrates.  We first demonstrated strong photoluminescence from InAs quantum wells on the metamorphic buffer layers, followed by strong electroluminescence.  Finally, we were able to demonstrate room temperature pulsed lasing at 2.7&mu;m from our emitters, and continuous wave lasing up to 200K.  In total, this program has resulted in a new class of mid-IR lasers grown on metamorphic buffer layers, operating up to the ~3&mu;m range of the mid-IR.  This approach opens the door to new classes of materials grown on highly mismatched, but technologically mature substrates, perhaps extending to even longer wavelengths.  In addition, this program has demonstrated quantum dot materials emitting at mid-IR wavelengths, with improved minority carrier lifetimes and temperature performance.  These materials hold promise as potential active regions for a new class of mid-IR light emitting diodes or lasers, as well as potential point sources for mid-IR quantum optics investigations.
