<AbstractNarration>This project develops mathematical representations and computer algorithms for three-dimensional forms that can be assembled from a collection of flat pieces without incurring material stress, known as piecewise developable geometry. These will drive new developments in the emerging industry of advanced 3D manufacturing: Not only can developable geometry easily be cut from a rich array of thin flat materials like plywood or sheet metal, but it can also provide a novel geometric approach to tool path planning that improves the efficiency and accuracy of shapes fabricated via computer-controlled flank milling.  Such processes offer a competitive advantage for manufacturing in the US by reducing cost, increasing complexity of fabricated forms, and automating tasks previously only achievable by hand (e.g., robotic folding of developable forms).  A fundamental issue addressed by the research is automatic approximation of an arbitrary curved surface by a small number of developable pieces---at present this process must be carried out laboriously by expert engineers and designers, severely limiting the scope and impact of developable manufacturing processes.  More broadly, algorithmic models of developable geometry enrich basic understanding in the area of discrete differential geometry, which seeks to reformulate classical geometric knowledge from a discrete, algorithmic point of view.  This area provides a crucial link between modern geometric theory and industrial/applied applications that need to incorporate data and computation, and students trained in this project will be well-equipped to contribute in 3d manufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on foundations from smooth and discrete differential geometry: rather than view discrete meshes as mere numerical approximations, the unifying goal is to develop data structures that directly encode the most salient features of piecewise developable geometry.  Two key observations are that (i) flattenability alone is not a sufficient characterization for discrete developability, often leading to nasty "crumpling" behavior and (ii) the curvature of a piecewise developable surface is encoded entirely by the shape of its patch boundaries, a fact often exploited in garment design.  These observations lead to two primary thrusts, namely (i) representations for discrete developability that naturally avoid crumpling by guaranteeing the existence of discrete "ruling lines," and (ii) efficient algorithms for developable surface design based on sparse descriptions of curvature along critical feature curves.  A cross-cutting theme is physical considerations for fabrication, e.g., translation between simple geometric models and material/constitutive properties relevant to the production of physical artifacts.</AbstractNarration>

In particular, it addressed a growing need for computational tools that facilitate the design and fabrication of piecewise developable surfaces, i.e., objects that can be created by cutting, bending, and joining thin flat materials such as sheet metal, paper or thin plywood.  Developable shapes are also relevant for manufacturing technologies like computer-controlled milling, and because developable surfaces have useful dynamical properties (e.g., they can be given an outer coating by rolling them across a flat surface).  By accelerating the design and deployment of developable structures, this work helps transform industries ranging from industrial manufacturing, to robotics, to architecture. The main outcomes were novel computational representations and algorithms that enable new tools for developable design, with a focus on automatic conversion of arbitrary free-form shapes into easily fabricable developable structures.  The basic computational questions addressed in this project also help to more broadly improve algorithms for working with 3D geometry by extending them to new kinds of datasets, by robustly handling defects and errors in data, and by scaling to larger problem sizes.  Outcomes were broadly disseminated through outreach activities and distribution of free software, and evaluated via and collaboration with industry partners. The intellectual merits of this project were new digital representations and algorithms for designing, processing, and analyzing three-dimensional geometric data.  One key development was a definition of developability for unstructured triangle meshes: by optimizing a given mesh to match this definition, one can translate any free-form input shape into a collection of developable pieces.  Such tools significantly expand and accelerate developable design relative to, e.g., designing developable spline patches by hand.  Several tools for developable design were built around the idea of cutting and flattening a given three-dimensional shape: by finding flattenings with almost no distortion (stretching) of the input, one obtains a very good developable approximation of the original geometry.  The project showed in particular that ideas from conformal geometry are quite powerful for this problem, enabling one to directly optimize cuts toward developability, and to solve the long-standing open question of how to optimally place so-called cone singularities (akin to "darts" in tailoring).  It also explored how flattened designs could be automatically deployed into a three-dimensional configuration via mechanisms like inflation and loading under gravity, and prototyped designs via laser cutting flat inextensible material.  The project also improved software tools for surface parameterization based on a boundary-first flattening algorithm.  Finally, the project developed basic geometry processing tools that benefit both developable design, as well as broader geometric algorithms.  In particular, it explored how a principle of geometric computation based on short-time diffusion can be extended to vector-valued data, enabling a wide variety of geometric algorithms typically available on triangle meshes to be executed on other data structures, like point clouds or voxel grids.
