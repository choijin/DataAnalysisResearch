<AbstractNarration>PI Name:  Kelsey Hatzell/Marta Hatzell&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1706956/1706290&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;There is a growing need to develop low cost and modular water reuse systems to promote optimal reclamation and treatment of discharged water from industrial, municipal, agricultural and energy generation sites. Targeting strategies that optimize water usage could significantly alleviate stresses at the core of the food-energy-water nexus. The development of new water deionization technologies which can be easily scaled to meet the decentralized demands is imperative for water sustainability. Capacitive deionization is a cost effective and low energy electrochemical approach for treating brackish water streams; however, there are fundamental limitations to this approach because the process is not continuous. In this project a novel flow-electrode-based architecture is examined as a means for both continuous and scalable deionization and energy recovery.  The researchers plan to collaborate with local organizations (Georgia Intern Fellowship for Teachers and Vanderbilt School for Science and Math) in order to design an experiential curriculum on brackish water treatment to increase water literacy in the Southeast. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to advance fundamental understanding of the design of flowable electrode architectures for ion removal processes. The PIs plan to study the concept of flow-electrode capacitive deionization (FCDI) for water treatment.  FCDI systems have three flow channels, two of which serve to transport suspended activated carbon particles, which remove or electroadsorb ions, and a center channel where the feedwater is directed.  To date, few studies have explored the fundamental mechanisms which promote efficient charge transfer and storage within flow electrodes. Specifically, understanding the influence of hydrodynamics within a flowable electrode and its effect on the formation and disruption or percolation networks can potentially increase material utilization and control electrochemical penetration depths. The PIs seek to define a new theoretical framework to describe charging and electron conduction processes at the particle-particle level in order to elucidate idealized operating conditions that promote energy efficient ion removal processes. The PIs will investigate the percolation network of carbon particles in a flow electrode using computational fluid mechanics, advanced in-situ characterization, and bench scale experimentation to obtain new fundamental and applied knowledge regarding this emerging deionization technology. Direct interrogation of the electrical, mechanical and microstructural properties of flowable electrode percolation networks will be obtained through advanced synchrotron-based techniques. The work has the potential to guide the design of a new process for water purification and may have broader relevance for other environmental technologies involving energy storage, energy conversion, and desalination.</AbstractNarration>

The long-term goal is to aid in the development of technologies that enable greater access to renewable driven water desalination. The work took place from 2017-2019, and resulted in three primary outcomes which extend our understanding of energy transfer processes within capacitive colloidal-based desalination systems.</p> <p>The first outcome of this work emphasized the important energetic losses that occur in a flow electrode capacitive deionization system due to unwanted water transport across non-perfect ion exchange membranes. We showed the water transport is a competing process that decreases the system stability, energy efficiency, and energy recovery. To overcome this variability, we detail the importance of matching ionic strength between the flow electrode and the feed stream in order to minimize diffusive transport and maximize electromigration-based transport. Validation occurred through theory and experiments. &nbsp;Next, we aimed to characterize the colloid-based flow electrode structure. To accomplish this, we mapped the percolation pathways between particles using an advanced three-dimensional imaging technique called x-ray tomography. X-ray tomography allowed us to map for the first time, the complex and dynamic structural properties of the flow electrode. The discerned structural properties include the electrodes pore size distribution, pore tortuosity, and particle connectivity. Finally, using the three-dimensional images as an input to a computational model we then developed a way to extract relevant electrochemical properties of the flow electrode. Through capturing the structural and electrochemical properties, we were able to survey various material systems and identify the chief electrochemical-based losses.</p> <p>Developing ways to remove salt from water using only renewable energy is important in order to meet rising water demands without straining our energy infrastructure. Electrochemical technologies such as capacitive deionization are well suited to meet this need, as electricity provides the driving force for desalination. Despite the potential advantages of electrochemical technologies for renewable desalination, these systems suffer from low energy efficiency and low salt removal. This limits the system to the treatment of brackish water. Thus, there is a need to improve systems-related inefficiencies, and develop new materials to increase salt removal. The proposed research activities aided in advancing our understanding of these energy losses through identifying two important losses related to membranes and electrodes. The research efforts also demonstrated an increase in salt removal capacity, with treatment extending from brackish waters to seawater. Finally, key results served as the foundation for new educational modules for an undergraduate electrochemistry class.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/18/2019<br>      Modified by: Marta&nbsp;C&nbsp;Hatzell</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1706290/1706290_10513477_1566168372034_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1706290/1706290_10513477_1566168372034_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Radiographic image"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1706290/1706290_10513477_1566168372034_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Radiographic image"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A radiographic image demonstrates contrast between carbon and water.
