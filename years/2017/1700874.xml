<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Complex functions, operators, partial differential equations and applications to mathematical physics" that will be held June 12-16, 2017, at the Mittag-Leffler Institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of complex analysis, partial differential equations, and mathematical physics. A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.   More information will be made available at: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.mittag-leffler.se/konferens/complex-functions-operators-partial-differential-equations-and-applications-mathematical-physics</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The grant supported U.S. participation in a conference organized jointly by a group of scientists at Stockholm University, Baylor University, U.C. San Diego, and Florida Atlantic University. This international event was held at the Mittag-Leffler Institute in Sweden, June 12-16, 2017.  The conference brought together researchers with diverse backgrounds from 6 countries (Norway, Sweden, Ireland, Spain, Israel, and the U.S.) to discuss complex function theory, operator theory, partial differential equations, and mathematical physics. The participants included leading experts in these areas and some of the founding figures in the theory of quadrature domains, a topic bringing together these disciplines.  Presentations at the conference included talks on complex analysis, operator theory, and potential theory, accessible to young researchers including graduate students.  Special attention was given to some of the recent breakthroughs on classical problems in Physics, e.g., Hele-Shaw flows, localization of eigenfunctions, and gravitational lensing.  The congenial atmosphere of the Mittag-Leffler institute (and the helpful administration and staff) promoted discussion and interaction among the participants. Ample time was set aside for collaboration and to reserve time and energy for an open problem session as well as informal social events.  The organizing committee made an effort to choose members of under-represented groups as principal speakers who were able to make contact with graduate students and pre-tenure researchers.  Half of the key note speakers (who gave 50 minute plenary talks) were female.   Proceedings of the conference including a summary of the open problems session will be published in a special issue of the journal "Analysis and Mathematical Physics".
