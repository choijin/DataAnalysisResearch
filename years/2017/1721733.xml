<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to investigate the feasibility of enhancing the core individual user application and commercial backend portal products as required to enhance and measure the efficacy of innovative addiction treatment and recovery support tools. If successful, the investment will enable healthcare stakeholders (e.g., individuals, addiction and mental health institutions and providers, health researchers and universities, government agencies, and payers) to leverage technology-enhanced addiction treatment innovations such as mindfulness training, contingency management, medication-assisted treatment, peer support, and adaptive interventions that show promise for improving health outcomes and delivery efficiencies. The proposed innovation will help to determine the feasibility of developing, testing, and commercializing innovative technologies that improve the efficacy of existing health IT solutions and to create new solutions for the range of stakeholders exhibiting increasingly high demand for effective interventions and tools required to develop, provide, and assess effective addiction treatment and recovery support services in a mix of research and delivery settings and the ability to generate significant revenue across the mix of public and private addiction recovery delivery settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will entail rapidly assembling the technical foundation and then testing the feasibility of supporting deployment and assessment of novel, evidence-based addiction treatment strategies and recovery interventions. There are four key research objectives: (1) design, develop, and test a mechanism to create statistically significant cohorts; (2) discern and test methods to measure participant recovery and sobriety success; (3) conduct internal treatment campaigns; and, (4) create a researcher application program interface to enable addiction researchers to connect with the system. Currently, there is no commercially viable platform for surfacing, implementing, and tracking the efficacy of optimal therapies and tools in an application environment. Phase I will focus on determining the feasibility of this technology for unlocking scientific interventions that can be clinically validated as successful in order to expand work in phase II to prove the capacity of this system to deliver single or bivariate therapy campaigns to users while also establishing the clinical efficacy for improving health outcomes sufficient to support interventions nationwide through cost-effective treatment solutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Foundational Work  Sober Grid, Inc. has built a mobile iOS and Android application that enables individuals in, or seeking, recovery from drug and alcohol addiction to connect for 24/7 peer support no matter their location. The application features a newsfeed, a geo-location based "grid" of nearby members, private and group chat messaging, and an "SOS" button enabling members to alert the community when they are in need of support, as well as numerous other evidence-based features geared to aid individuals in their recovery from addiction.   Sober Grid has achieved success in establishing user engagement and retention metrics that exceed established benchmarks for social media applications, and has grown the user base of the application to over 130,000 registered members. This sizeable user base has resulted in one of the largest data sets available on mobile application support utilized by individuals in recovery from substance use disorder (SUD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD), which can be of significant interest to researchers.     NSF SBIR Phase I Project  In its Phase I project, Sober Grid successfully demonstrated the feasibility of enabling addiction researchers to uncover innovative means of intervention and recovery support. Sober Grid accomplished this by facilitating access to an existing, hard to reach population within the context of a dynamic, addiction recovery-focused mobile social platform.  Our project assessed the feasibility of developing tools to enable researchers and care providers to access de-identified data from Sober Grid members, create and recruit cohorts of populations meeting specific criteria from the broader Sober Grid mobile application population, deliver content tailored to those populations to provide support or intervention for recovery from substance use disorder, and to assess the effects of that content related to desired outcomes for the cohort.     Intellectual Merit  We have integrated into the Sober Grid app the ability for researchers to conduct retrospective, cross-sectional, and prospective studies using commonly used measures to rapidly and efficiently gain new insights in recovery. Studies can be conducted by multiple researchers simultaneously, with various aims and foci. Evidence-based positive results from these studies can then be rapidly implemented within the recovery community. This capability will advance the field of smart and connected health by delivering a novel means for the research community to access an otherwise hard to reach population of individuals within the SUD/AUD population in the context of an existing, fast growing population on the Sober Grid application. Coupling this access with cutting edge study recruitment, management and assessment tools presents a new path to accelerating advancements in addiction research.     Broader Impact  Sober Grid?s mission is to continue to develop effective interventions to prevent addiction relapse and to develop new features to effectively support and engage individuals in their recovery.  Over the course of this NSF funded Phase I project, Sober Grid has established numerous relationships with leading addiction researchers including Dr. Brenda Curtis at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Dr. Warren Bickel at the Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute, and Dr. Brandon Bergman of Massachusetts General Hospital's Recovery Research Institute. Through these partnerships, and in interviews with numerous other addiction researchers, we learned that they face significant challenges reaching the populations they wish to study, recruiting participants for their research, and retaining these participants in their research studies. Sober Grid?s therapeutic networking application engages and retains members in a manner that is highly desirable to these researchers (and other stakeholders) making the study results more powerful and cost effective to implement and manage.  We therefore developed a Cohort Recruitment Tool (CRT) to accelerate new developments in addiction research and recovery support by opening up our platform to addiction researchers who wish to study this population and to access our large, unique data set. The CRT has the following features: (1) create de-identified data cohorts using an intuitive user interface (UI) that filters the Sober Grid dataset according to characteristics of the study populations of interest; (2) measure member?s mental status and recovery success using widely accepted measures, including the the AUDIT, DAST, Brief COPE, and PHQ assessments;  (3) create private, HIPAA compliant study participant "groups" within the production application coupled with a dashboard interface which researchers can use to monitor and communicate with cohort members; (4) utilize a new API task that links individuals to the de-identified in-app Sober Grid data and survey responses; (5) create custom assessments using a generalizable model for implementing various surveys; and (6) prompt study participants to complete assessments using an updated UI.  In addition to its value to researchers, Sober Grid sees significant potential for supporting health care insurance payers including Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) and other federal and state agencies that will benefit from (and have expressed interest in) our ability to advance research and clinical practice standards that have direct impacts on health care delivery, efficacy, and cost.
