<AbstractNarration>This 12-month RAPID project will organize unmanned aerial system (UAS) data from 119 flights at Hurricane Harvey and 247 at Hurricane Irma, in order to make the data available to researchers. The project will (1) screen for personal privacy identification and applicable state laws, and make available to researchers, (2) host a virtual workshop to introduce the dataset and access procedures for researchers, and (3) host a follow up workshop at the 2018 IEEE International Symposium on Safety Security and Rescue Robotics to discuss the results by researchers using the datasets and how to acquire datasets in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The datasets were collected by the Texas A&amp;M Engineering Experiment Station and Florida State University who co-deployed to Fort Bend County, Texas, and Putnam and Collier Counties, Florida. They are unique because they (1) reflect the largest number of flights for public officials; (2) represent a diversity of UAS platforms (10 different models) flying at different altitudes and for eight distinctly different missions; (3) consist of video, still imagery, and photogrammetric data products based on mission; and (4) include flights before the event, during the response phase, and through the restoration phase. However, the datasets require some additional work to screen content for privacy, to complete meta-data, to be consistent in naming conventions in order to facilitate access by external researchers, and to set up controlled access. The datasets are ephemeral because the missing meta-data of pilots, platforms, and flight times for each mission will be lost in the memory of the pilots and because the datasets are needed to enable other researchers in computing and engineering use the data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   RAPID: Collaborative Research: Unmanned Aerial System Datasets from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma (NSF 1762139) was a collaborative effort between the Humanitarian Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (HRAIL) at Texas A&amp;M University and the Center for Disaster Risk Policy (CDRP) at Florida State University.   During Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, teams from these institutions deployed to support state and local emergency management officials with small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS). Completing over 200 flights between the two disasters, the teams captured video and still imagery while working with search and rescue teams, emergency managers, and damage assessment teams. The data was utilized at the local and state levels to coordinate search efforts and better understand the impacts the storms had on the community. NSF 1762139 was awarded to organize, categorize, and publish the datasets for future use by practitioners and researchers. The dataset for Hurricane Irma was published at http://cdrp.crasar.org, and includes all imagery collected, organized by mission and flight, with all personal identifiable information removed. This dataset includes categorization of the flights by mission type, aircraft utilized, and other factors and supported the following research goals: 1. Demonstrate that small, inexpensive commercially available sUAS are effective in supporting disaster management. 2. Provide a dataset of imagery and supporting descriptive data to future researchers. The support from this NSF award allowed CDRP to analyze imagery for personally identifiable information that could not be released due to privacy concerns; categorize the data by mission type, purpose, aircraft, date, time and mission assignment; and develop a web presence to make the dataset publicly available. The project will enable future research on the utility of sUAS in disaster and emergency management and will guide future field research toward gathering data appropriate to disaster and sUAS research.
