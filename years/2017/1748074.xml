<AbstractNarration>Part 1&lt;br/&gt;Czujko and Nicholson, 2010 reported that of all (about 460) universities that award bachelor?s degrees in geoscience, four universities (Jackson State, Mississippi State, Pennsylvania and Savannah State) top all in awarding bachelor?s degrees to African Americans and they are the only ones that awarded more than 10 bachelor?s degrees to African Americans in geoscience over the 5 years (2004-2008) combined. Together, the four universities accounted for 19% of all geoscience bachelor?s earned by African Americans and Jackson State University is a top producer in both physics and geoscience. Over the last 5 years combined, about 300 universities with geoscience degree programs awarded no bachelor?s degrees to African Americans and about another 95 awarded only one geoscience bachelor?s to an African American.&lt;br/&gt;Not surprisingly, three of the four top producers of African Americans earning geoscience bachelor?s degrees are of Historically Black Colleges and University (HBCU) status (Czujko and Nicholson, 2010) yet there are fewer than 10 degree-granting geoscience departments at HBCUs. However, several HBCUs offer related geoscience programs and degrees based on the classification of geoscience instructional programs (Status of the Geoscience Workforce, 2016). Organizationally, HBCUs structure does not include geoscience departments, schools, or program classifications such as biogeosciences, ocean science, etc. Historically, most African Americans who chose geoscience pathways at the graduate levels and who become practicing geoscientists or counted as part of the workforce received their undergraduate training at HBCUs. Recognizing that obstacles to the recruitment, training and retention of underrepresented minorities (URMs) in geosciences exist at all educational levels, concerted and sustained efforts are needed to increase ethnic diversity in geoscience and related sciences, and to understand why so few minority students choose to go into this discipline.&lt;br/&gt;A community of stakeholders representing higher education including HBCUs, professional societies including NTA, NOBCCHE (National Organization for the Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers), BEYA, to name a few, and organizations, governmental and private entities will convene during a one-day workshop to lay the foundation for a sustained effort to strengthen geoscience (and STEM) education and research among HBCUs to catalyze these institution?s contribution to broadening participation in the education and workforce sectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2&lt;br/&gt;The number of African Americans receiving undergraduate and advanced degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) by all accounts is disproportionately low. According to an American Institute of Physics report (Czujko and Nicholson, 2010), physics and geoscience consistently rank near the bottom among all disciplines in their ability to attract and retain African American students. In an effort to address this pervasive issue, the National Technical Association (NTA) in collaboration with Morgan State University proposes to host a day-long workshop during the NTA 89th Annual Meeting on September 20-22, 2017 in Baltimore, Maryland. This workshop will provide a forum to convene geoscience and STEM stakeholders to discuss the status of HBCU education, research and workforce in these disciplines, facilitate collaborative efforts and establish a geoscience agenda that contributes to broadening participation.&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the 2017 workshop are to:&lt;br/&gt;- Create a shared understanding among participants of geosciences disciplines, education, research and workforce with the context of STEM and non-STEM discipline.&lt;br/&gt;- Review the current status of geosciences (and STEM) education and research within HBCUs and simultaneously consider current gaps and potential opportunities from which an action agenda can be established.&lt;br/&gt;- Draw on and leverage the expertise of institutional and individual stakeholders engaged in related geoscience and STEM activities and document lessons learned and best and emerging practices for broadening participation.&lt;br/&gt;- Present/offer for consideration an interdisciplinary approach as a framework for advancing geosciences and more broadly STEM initiatives within HBCUs.&lt;br/&gt;- Explore prospects and strategies for collaboration among various entities?academic institutions, professional associations, federal agencies?to enhance the contribution of HBCUs to the broadening participation and inclusive science agenda.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF grant was used to organize two workshops.  The first workshop was on "Maximizing Geosciences, Education, Research and Workforce Opportunities through Interdisciplinary Engagement" at the NTA 89th Annual Meeting, Friday, September 22, 2017, Morgan State University.  A follow up workshop was conducted with a supplemental request for funding and co-sponsor by the North Carolina A&amp;T State University: "Broadening Participation in Geosciences at HBCUs" on Tuesday, May 15, 2018.  The NTA 89th Annual Meeting featured a National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored day-long workshop on Friday, September 22, 2017, 8:00 am-4:30 pm as an overall effort to address the racial/ethnic underrepresentation in the geosciences specifically and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM ) broadly.  A total of 52 participants attended the day-long workshop on Morgan State University campus.    At the end of a productive day attendees left with commitments to take action, with agreements to work together on collaborations and partnerships, plans to generate proposals, and to identify ways to build geosciences capacity at HBCUs. Among the themes that consistently resonated with the group was the importance of viewing HBCUs as more than a training ground for STEM professionals, but also as partners in geoscience and STEM research and development.  One major finding emerging from the workshop is the recognition of the need for high-level support from the provost/dean levels to sustain geosciences at HBCUs.  Another factor identified is that it takes a champion or nucleus of champions to initiate and sustain geosciences effort and that a departure from the traditional business model is essential to gain traction. There was general recognition that once initiated, stakeholders will ultimately adapt the business model (build it and they will come), but most are unwilling to continue the conversation if the traditional business model is not the starting point.  To better understand, document and lay the foundation for future initiatives, workshop participants shared their perspectives via two surveys. Findings from the pre-conference survey was incorporated in the discussions that occurred during the workshop regarding topics such as program design facilitators, barriers, challenges and funding.  The feedback and results from the immediate post-conference survey produced important data about participant?s perspective and responsiveness to the workshop as well as insights into their next steps. A six-month follow up survey will generate information about subsequent activities and actions taken by attendees to address the geosciences and STEM within and across their respective organizations.  The one-day follow-up workshop was hosted by North Carolina A&amp;T State University (NCAT), Greensboro. Working objectives of the NSF, NTA, HBCU Geosciences Working Group (HBCU-GWG) is to create a vision and goals for geosciences at HBCUs in general, to state the imperative and urgency of expanding geosciences opportunities at HBCUs, and to provide leading evidence-based reporting on the needs and capacities of HBCUs as untapped resources to meet the challenges and opportunities of geosciences teaching, research, community engagement and workforce development. A total of 40 participants attended at least some portions of the workshop.    In general, participants? impressions of the workshop were positive about it being an excellent discussion and networking opportunity. Moreover, there was a great appreciation for the frankness of discussions and learning about issues facing HBCUs and NSF relationships, and the "real process".
