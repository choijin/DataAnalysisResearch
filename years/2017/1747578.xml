<AbstractNarration>The Designed Quantum Materials Workshop will play a key role in identifying new directions for research on next generation electronic devices. It will promote interactions between leading researchers, will explore new device concepts and technologies and will focus on the technical challenges and barriers of transitioning such research results into nanomanufacturing. The highlights of the symposium will be accessible through a report on the workshop and its findings that will be published in a readily accessible public medium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funds to support graduate student and invited researcher participation, as well as conference organization expenses in a workshop to be held January 23-24, 2018, at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The Designed Quantum Materials Workshop will address the questions of precise placement of dopants in semiconductors for better spin-orbit coupling, as well as the study of two-dimensional (2D) properties and related nanomanufacturing aspects. Approaches to be considered include (1) improved accuracy of dopant placement for Hubbard model experiments; (2) study of designed 2D materials and verification of various solid state physics models; (3) development of concepts that generate technologically relevant nanomanufacturing approaches.  New types of fundamental physics studies and the possible development of new regimes of metamaterials will be discussed and explored along these lines. These will also be considered in terms of innovative technologies for the nanomanufacturing of new devices and materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      The purpose of this project was to hold a two-day workshop with the goal of examining the commonalities of fabrication, theoretical prediction, and alternative technical approaches that give rise to tunable quantum metamaterials.  In particular, several different approaches were surveyed.  They included semiconductors doped with atomic precision, optical lattices and cold-atoms, trapped ions, superconducting circuits, quantum dot approaches, and finally photonic system approaches.  These areas of science and engineering make possible new engineered structures identified as quantum metamaterials.  They offer unusual properties, involving fundamental concepts such as entangled quantum states, superposition, quantum coherence, analog quantum simulation, and so forth.        The workshop was held at the National Institute for Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA.  Of the 87 registrants in attendance, 32 professionals were from government laboratories, agencies, and industry; 55 were professors, postdocs, and students from academia, and 5 were international participants.      The three most important outcomes of the workshop were as follows:         1. The experts participating in the workshop arrived at the general consensus and conclusion that a new era of technological advancement is possible using quantum metamaterials.         2. Of the several approaches considered for forming quantum metamaterials, there was not a consensus about how to answer questions as to which of the various approaches would ultimately become the most effective. Various technical arguments were presented that showed how more research and development needs to be done to answer questions of this nature.         3. The output of the workshop was collected in a new book entitled "2D Quantum Metamaterials," eds. Wiley P. Kirk, John N. Randall, James H. G. Owen. The book is scheduled for publication by World Scientific, September 2019, 146 pages, (ISBN 978-981-120-605-4).  The manuscript covers the key scientific ideas, various technical approaches under investigation, and the potential technological outcomes in a new field of research.  An image of the book cover is enclosed.          Last Modified: 09/05/2019       Submitted by: Wiley P Kirk]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
