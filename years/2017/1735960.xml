<AbstractNarration>This project examines shallowest structure of the United States using a novel approach that utilizes EarthScope USArray seismic data. Depth-dependent estimates of both compressional- and shear-wave speeds will contribute not only to the studies of the subsurface imaging, but also to seismic hazard assessment and earthquake engineering.  The new method is non-invasive, such that well drilling or field experiments using explosives are not necessary, and can be applied to any site with a single seismic station or dense arrays. Furthermore, if depth dependence is not sought, easy-to-install and inexpensive instruments can be used, allowing detailed variations&lt;br/&gt;in the soil/crust structure to be revealed at low cost. The near-surface structure obtained from this study can be used as an input model for ground motion simulations, and will contribute to such programs as earthquake early warning that requires shaking predictions at critical locations. This project will also promote multidisciplinary research on the geological study of the continental United States. Since the technique can resolve seismic structure of top few kilometers or less, the lateral variation revealed from this study can be compared to and interpreted with geological provinces observed at the surface. The shallowness of the target also starts to bring together the global seismological analysis (using distant earthquake data) with near-surface critical zone studies, and contribute to our understanding of complex processes that occur at the Earth's surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new technique utilizes body-wave polarization to resolve wave speed immediately beneath a seismic station.  Seismic wave polarization information has been relatively unexploited compared to other quantities such as travel times, and the essential theoretical framework for relating the polarization information of teleseismic body waves to near-surface wave speeds will be established and tested. Counter-intuitively, the polarization of teleseismic P waves is sensitive to shear-wave speed, while that of S waves is sensitive to both compressional and shear-wave speeds. Moreover, examining the frequency dependence of the polarization data allows a depth-dependent wave speed model of the shallow subsurface to be constructed. The method will be applied to the USArray data to produce the near-surface wave speed model of the continental United States. The spatial variation of the wave speeds, in both vertical and horizontal dimensions, will be studied at different scales through different frequency filters and combination of data from Transportable Array, Reference Network, and Flexible Array. The results will provide better constraints on the crust properties, and can be used to improve crustal corrections used for other types of studies such as global or regional seismic tomography.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project resulted in a development of a novel and non-invasive technique to investigate the near-surface structure using motion of the ground as seismic waves arrive from far-away earthquakes.  It was applied to Japan using more than 700 stations that exist throughout the country and 234 earthquakes that were located far from Japan, occurring at depths greater than 60 km, and with magnitudes greater than 6.  The near-surface P and S wave speed values were tested against the in-situ borehole measurements that were available at every seismic station.  The results agree very well, confirming the efficacy of the approach.   The above application provided a single wave speed value beneath the station while we expect the wave speed value to vary with depth.  An extension to the method has been in development, where the frequency content of the observed signal is used to investigate the near-surface structure at different depths.  This analysis is being applied to the full USArray data, and preliminary results show strong lateral variability as well as depth dependence.  At some stations, the wave speed models indicate the existence of low-velocity layers, implying that the method could be used to investigate processes that occur close to the Earth's surface such as hydrological cycle. As a side product of the above investigations, the project also provided a new means to monitor data quality of seismometers.  The method was tested against the Japanese data where there are daily calibration pulses to benchmark the results.  The identification of instrument problem periods are in great agreement with the changes in calibration signal, and there were few additional time periods where the seismometers had gain issues.  This opens up a better monitoring for instruments that are hard to access without requiring the calibration signal to be inserted into ground motion recordings.
