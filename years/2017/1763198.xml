<AbstractNarration>Professor Herschel Rabitz of Princeton University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models, and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry.  The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms - A program co-funds the proposal. Rabitz seeks to understand the fundamental principles of using tailored laser fields to control phenomena at the molecular scale. Starting in the latter half of the 20th Century and accelerating to the present time, there is an increasing interest in using modern laser technology to directly manipulate the motion of atoms and molecules. Many experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of this concept.    Rabitz's research seeks a fundamental understanding for why such experiments are successful.   This understanding helps to provide a roadmap for performing new classes of laser experiments in the future. This roadmap includes the goal of achieving new laser-driven atomic and molecular scale transformations which are not achievable by any other means.  Furthermore, Rabitz's research findings are expected to be applicable to many domains of science where controlled manipulation is required to achieve the desired outcome, even without the aid of lasers, including in the chemical and biological sciences.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The control of quantum phenomena entails interceding in the normal evolution of atomic and molecular dynamical events generally through the introduction of external fields. Quite surprisingly, finding optimal fields for this purpose is proving to be far easier than anticipated, both in simulations and in the laboratory. Professor Herschel Rabitz undertakes fundamental research to understand the origins of this behavior. To address this matter at the most basic level, Rabitz explores the structure of the control landscape, which is the physical observable as a function of the control variables. The most fundamental circumstance will receive special attention, which the landscape associated with one quantum system controlling another. Rabitz will employ a family of theoretical and computational tools to analyze the landscape's topology, aiming to identify the basic rules for controlling quantum phenomena. Part of his effort includes the development of special techniques to reveal the mechanisms by which control is achieved. The outcome of Rabitz's research is expected to be a deeper understanding of controlled quantum phenomena along with specific guidance towards promising future experimental directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
