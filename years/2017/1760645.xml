<AbstractNarration>Hurricanes are a devastating natural disaster.  Forecasters at the NOAA Climate Prediction Center have predicted an above-normal hurricane season this year. This prediction is already proving accurate as evidenced by the two massive and devastating recent hurricanes: Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma.  It is urgent and time critical to develop, refine and test systems that can improve the ability of first responders and emergency management agencies to identify emergent crises before, during and after hurricanes.  The research objective of this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) is to develop a crisis detection, tracking and visualization system.  Social media data collected before, during and after Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma will be used to develop and retrospectively validate the system.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will improve the detection, tracking and visualization of emergent crises in hurricanes and other large scale natural disasters in the future by enabling the pinpointing of extreme crisis areas in the midst of an overall emerging crisis.  This will be accomplished without prior definition of crisis topics to enable the detection of unexpected crises that are clustered in space and time, potentially leading to more lives saved.  It will further provide first responder and emergency management agencies with a new understanding of the role spatially-referenced social media can play in increasing the effectiveness of disaster response efforts. The research findings and the detection, tracking and visualization system will be disseminated in presentations to emergency responders in coastal urban areas to demonstrate the system and encourage its implementation in future tropical cyclone seasons.</AbstractNarration>

We developed methods of identifying crises that were not well-represented, or simply absent, from the social media datastream.  We developed an algorithm for identifying geographic areas that lost the ability to contribute to social media through loss of energy infrastructure or wireless internet.  We also developed a method for ascertaining the steady state social media activity across a scalable, uniform grid of a city and using that steady state to identify areas of significant perturbation during a large-scale emergency.  The areas of significant perturbation as defined by deviation from steady state were significantly correlated with areas of major building level destruction, as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  We have additionally developed methods of ascertaining the importance of considering areas on small and large scales that have substantially decreased social media activity during a hurricane, how to differentiate these areas from those that have evacuated, and how best to visualize the representational capacity of existing social media streams for use by emergency responders.    In terms of broader impacts, we disseminated our results to numerous first responder and emergency management agencies. The identified emergency situations developing within a larger disaster context can inform resource-constrained disaster managers and first responders when and where a hurricane-related emergency is, the emergency details and sentiment level, and how the emergency evolves over time--even if the emergency is unexpected/unknown, and even if the area has been suddenly cut off from energy or the internet. By highlighting the importance of these techniques and the capacity for their use in emergency responder tools, we are increasing the quality and types of useable information that can be gleaned from the social media stream and have expanded the horizons of social media information for crisis informatics.  Beyond showing that these analyses are possible, we have additionally shown that they are necessary.  We have provided evidence for policy-makers that unsupervised learning techniques and steady state deviation metrics need to be considered in future crisis detection metrics.  The developed framework can enable more intelligent disaster informatics and agile pre-, during- and post-disaster management, and contribute to building more resilient communities in the context of natural disasters.  The development of this system has increased the availability of usable, equitable, and relevant information through social media to emergency responders.
