<AbstractNarration>The International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software (ISPASS), a premier forum for sharing advanced academic and industrial research focused on performance analysis of computer systems and software, seeks to increase student participation in symposium and the field. The conference will be held from Apr 23, 2017 - Apr 25, 2017 San Francisco Bay Area, California. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed funding would support the travel of up to 15 eligible US students to the symposium. Support from this grant will be distributed to students who may otherwise be unable to attend ISPASS. The grant selection process will give priority to US citizens and permanent residents, with special consideration to members of underrepresented groups and participants from universities that do not have a strong tradition in the ISPASS research domain. Furthermore, support from this grant will also be available to provide companion funding for attendees with disabilities and/or parental responsibility for an infant less than one year old. These efforts are anticipated to broaden the participation in the conference and, by extension, the research field.</AbstractNarration>
