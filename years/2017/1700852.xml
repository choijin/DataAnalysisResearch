<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1406593, Principal Investigator: Gang Liu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kahler manifolds are a basic building block in the string theory model of the universe. This project studies the global structure of Kahler manifolds.  In particular, conjectures on the uniformization of Kahler manifolds will be addressed. These conjectures generalize the classical uniformization theorem in one complex variable.  In the PI's project, there are many interactions among several branches of mathematics, e.g. algebraic geometry, analysis, topology and differential geometry. Wider applications of the PI's field include the structure of molecules, the large scale structure of the universe and the liquid gas boundary.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to work on three projects which involve function theory and geometry on Kahler manifolds. The first project is to study problems which are closely related to the uniformization conjecture of Yau. These problems include the finite generation of the ring of holomorphic functions of polynomial growth, sharp dimension estimates for holomorphic functions with polynomial growth on manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature, and a conjecture of Ni on the equivalence between average curvature decay, maximal volume growth and the existence of holomorphic functions of polynomial growth. In the second project, the PI will seek obstructions to Kahler metrics with nonnegative scalar curvature. The PI also plans to show that the Kodaira dimension of compact Kahler manifolds with nonpositive bisectional curvature is a homotopy invariant. The main tool is the PI's structure theorem for these manifolds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit:  In this project, the PI proposed to study polynomial growth holomorphic functions on complete noncompact Kahler manifolds with nonnegative bisectional curvature. The center of this project is Yau's uniformization conjecture: Complete noncompact Kahler manifolds with positive bisectional curvature is biholomorphic to complex Euclidean space.      Here are the major results obtained by PI during the period of the NSF award:     1. The PI provided a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of nonconstant polynomial growth holomorphic function on complete Kahler manifolds with nonnegative bisectional curvature. This solved a conjecture of Lei Ni.     2. The PI proved the following: On a complete noncompact Kahler manifold with nonnegative bisectional curvature, the ring of polynomial growth holomorphic functions is finitely generated. This confirms a conjecture of Yau.     3. By using the technique above, the author further proved the following: If M is an n-dimensional complete noncompact Kahler manifold with nonnegative bisectional curvature and maximal volume growth, then M is biholomorphic to the complex Euclidean space. Furthermore, one can find n polynomial growth holomorphic functions which give the global coordiate. This result is a partial confirmation of Yau's uniformization conjecture.  4. The PI also extended the techiniques above to complete Kahler manifolds whose bisectional curvature is not necessarily nonnegative.      In summary, the PI has built some new powerful techniques in studying complete Kahler manifolds with nonnegative bisectional curvature. These have major implications in uniformization type conjectures.     Broader impact:  The PI has disseminated the ideas and some details in many places. In particular, he gave an one-month mini-course in Tsinghua university of this subject. The major audience are graduate students and senior undergraduate students.
