<AbstractNarration>Heritage commercialization has frequently been promoted as a critical strategy for development in indigenous communities. The view that culture is a critical resource for poverty alleviation among indigenous communities has become so widespread that some organizations, such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank, compel nation-states to participate in these initiatives. Despite the prevalence of such development schemes, the communities targeted continue to face high indices of poverty and vulnerability. This research sets out to understand why such inequalities remain entrenched, and how that entrenchment varies among communities. This project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, will test whether current investments in such heritage-based development initiatives contribute to or impede economic welfare objectives in three different contexts. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations interested in development and poverty alleviation efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ana Hasemann, under the supervision of Dr. Monica Udvardy of the University of Kentucky, will explore whether participation in heritage commercialization and development efforts contributes to economic welfare. This research will be conducted in three Lenca communities located in Southwest Honduras, which are chosen because of their extensive participation in development initiatives. The researcher has engaged in preliminary fieldwork in the region, has gained familiarity with national legislation and development bureaucracy, and has acquired significant contacts with local informants since 2008. The researcher will conduct prolonged visits in each community, during which she will collect information through interviews, surveys, and personal narratives, in order to empirically explore and identify how indigenous women and their communities respond to and negotiate their participation in development interventions. Findings from this research will ascertain the importance of public policy on heritage and culture as driving forces in local development, which is sometimes the only means of survival for poor communities. They will also provide insight into how the political and economic agendas of contemporary national governments and transnational organizations influence the degree of attention paid to ethnic/minority peoples, their livelihoods, and their development.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Ana Eugenia Hasemann Lara completed her doctoral dissertation research 'Evaluating what Factors Contribute to Effectiveness in Heritage Commercialization', with support from the National Science Foundation Dissertation Research Improvement Grant. During the award period, Hasemann spent twelve months in Southwest Honduras, working in three indigenous communities with crafts cooperatives. Her ethnographic research explored the on-the-ground reality of Lenca communities, specifically Lenca women, participating in 'development with identity' schemes; and Lenca women's responses to the corresponding state-sponsored initiatives.</p> <p>Through several months of fieldwork and data collection, which included participant observation, interviews, life histories, and household surveys, Hasemann has been able to examine the semantic spaces created by Honduran public policy, heritage commercialization, and the development industry, through which intercultural engagements take place with the indigenous feminine 'other', and the consequent effects on the identity discourses and political subjectivities put forth by Lenca women.</p> <p>Hasemann has been able to establish various implications and limitations of the Honduran state's recognition of indigenous women as rights-bearing subjects, as development beneficiaries, and as heritage entrepreneurs. She has been able to identify some factors that contribute to and impede indigenous women's negotiations with and control over the terms of their recognition, representations, and what it means to be indigenous within the development agendas of the Honduran state. And, she was able to procure indicators of social capital and material endowments within Lenca craftswomen's households to measure their economic welfare, as well as appraise the role of cooperatives within these cash-poor contexts with high poverty indices.</p> <p>Hasemann found that foreign aid plays an important role in advancing 'development with identity' initiatives, in some instances, outside of the purview of state public institutions and policy, and with unclear and contradictory involvement and support from the Honduran government. Yet, local municipal governments' support does play a significant role in the visibility of indigenous women in local formal and informal collective spheres, in promoting spaces of individual negotiation for indigenous women --however limited--and&nbsp; in strengthening cooperatives' relevance within and beyond their communities. Hasemann also found men and women strongly identify as Lenca, and emphasize on a specific human rights discourse endowed through their cultural heritage, territoriality and ethnicity. Lenca women, specially those who are currently involved in cooperatives, seem reluctant to continue to abide to development interventions, which are perceived as redundant and imposed top-down; whereas they view development initiatives and development workers as part of a industry that is self-seeking, unreliable, and hypocritical. However,&nbsp; still desire and actively seek a collective and individual inclusion and participation in such development interventions.</p> <p>Hasemann continues to collaborate closely with these three Lenca crafts cooperatives and with ICOMOS-Honduras, in strengthening the documentation respective to the candidacy dossier, to propose Lenca Pottery for UNESCO's World Intangible Cultural Heritage Declaration.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/02/2019<br>      Modified by: Ana&nbsp;Hasemann</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1756645/1756645_10530581_1559773303252_IMG_2888--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1756645/1756645_10530581_1559773303252_IMG_2888--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Pitos y Tejas"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1756645/1756645_10530581_1559773303252_IMG_2888--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Pitos y Tejas"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Tourism-oriented pottery/crafts (bird-shaped whistles) and utilitarian  crafts (artisanal roof tiles), in a Lenca craftwoman's backyard.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ana Eugenia Hasemann Lara</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ana&nbsp;Hasemann</div> <div class="imageTitle">Pitos y Tejas</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1756645/1756645_10530581_1559773581927_IMG_2044--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1756645/1756645_10530581_1559773581927_IMG_2044--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The View"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1756645/1756645_10530581_1559773581927_IMG_2044--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The View"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The view, a subsistence agricultural landscape framed by never-ending mountain ranges in Southwest Honduras.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ana Eugenia Hasemann Lara</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ana&nbsp;Hasemann</div> <div class="imageTitle">The View</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1756645/1756645_10530581_1559773902738_IMG_3118--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1756645/1756645_10530581_1559773902738_IMG_3118--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Political Rally"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1756645/1756645_10530581_1559773902738_IMG_3118--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Political Rally"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Community members gathered for local political rally supporting candidacy for town hall and departmental congress representatives, during the latest election year.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ana Eugenia Hasemann Lara</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ana&nbsp;Hasemann</div> <div class="imageTitle">Political Rally</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1756645/1756645_10530581_1559774309394_IMG_2902--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1756645/1756645_10530581_1559774309394_IMG_2902--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sopa de Gallina"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1756645/1756645_10530581_1559774309394_IMG_2902--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sopa de Gallina"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Preparing local delicacy, "sopa de gallina" (hen soup), cooked in traditional utilitarian clay pots--rarely used now.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ana Eugenia Hasemann Lara</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ana&nbsp;Hasemann</div> <div class="imageTitle">Sopa de Gallina</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1756645/1756645_10530581_1559774648731_IMG_2963--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1756645/1756645_10530581_1559774648731_IMG_2963--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Firing up the Pots"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1756645/1756645_10530581_1559774648731_IMG_2963--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Firing up the Pots"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Getting ready to cook clay pots, in a new oven provided by recent development initiative--funded through foreign aid--to this craftswoman for use in her personal workshop.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ana Eugenia Hasemann Lara</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ana&nbsp;Hasemann</div> <div class="imageTitle">Firing up the Pots</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
