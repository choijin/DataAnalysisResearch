<AbstractNarration>Over its seven years of existence, the SciSIP Program, which supports research designed to advance the scientific basis of science and innovation policy, has supported many studies which have utilized data on patents as their principal empirical probe. Sophisticated models, new methods and increasing computational power have been brought to bear to the examination of patenting activity, and as a consequence much has been learned. But over this time many have come to question the underlying utility of patents as a proxy measure for invention in light of changes to patent law and the evolution of patenting practice by firms. The workshop brings together leading academic researchers, patent legal scholars as well as representatives from the governmental agencies and businesses which use patents.  The results will help in formulating R&amp;D policy and allocating R&amp;D resources.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goals of the workshop are to identify research themes in which the use of patent data has been useful and appropriate; to discuss new research domains for which patents are an appropriate source of empirical analysis; develop an agreed understanding of the challenges and limitations in using patent data (particularly those limitations which may have been borne in recent years as the practice of patent law has changed the manner in which patents are pursued and ultimately authored); and lastly to offer ways in which various stakeholders regarding patent data can work to address and/or overcome these limitations and challenges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ What are the major goals of the project?  The major goal of the workshop was to bring together leading academic researchers, patent legal scholars, and representatives from the governmental agencies to:  Identify research themes in which the use of patent data has been useful and appropriate To discuss new research domains for which patents are an appropriate source of empirics To develop an agreed understanding of the challenges and limitations in using patent data, particularly those limitations which may have been borne in recent years as the practice of patent law has changed, and the manner in which patents are pursued and ultimately authored. To offer ways in which various stakeholders regarding patent data&mdash;researchers, the legal community, data providers, and patent offices&mdash;can work to address and/or overcome these limitations and challenges.    Answers, Outcomes and Recommendations   The following are assessments and recommendations regarding the use of patent data which were agreed upon by the workshop?s participants.   Individual patents should not be the unequivocal a unit of invention  An increase or decrease in patenting activity in a specific technological domain or industry should not be unequivocally interpreted as an increase/decrease  in inventive activity in that field.  Invention is not equivalent to Innovation. Historians of technology have traditionally made a distinction between invention and innovation, a distinction which needs to be taken more seriously by researchers who use patent data. Invention is the creation of something new: a new object, product, process, or artifact that previously not known. (Many inventions are of course just slight variations of existing objects, rather than fundamentally new creations. Others are new combinations of pre-existing components, perhaps modified for a different purpose.) In contrast, innovations are successful inventions: successful in the sense that they are actually put into production, become widely used or become economically profitable. A new invention consists of technologies, either new or already in use, brought together in a way not previously seen. The historical record on this process is extensive. Patents are a signifier of invention. Not of innovation. What was an acceptable level of understanding regarding the operations of the patent system three decades ago (when the NBER Patent Data File was first released) now constitutes unacceptable naivet&eacute;. Prior art citations cannot be unambiguously read as channels or knowledge flows given the legal requirements that prior art is intended to meet. Claims must be read carefully as they embody the legal essence of a patent and what is the inventive novelty that is being protected by a patent; sophisticated text mining algorithms do not obviate the need to understand what the legal language of claims is intended to do. Changes from the USPC to the CPC patent classification system (which went into effect in 2015) represents a major change in how the USPTO identifies the technologies responsible for a patented invention?s novelty and a major change in how the arrival of new technologies will be marked and codified in patent classification.  Patents data remains a vital indicator of inventive activity. Patents are not a tautological dead-end. The timing, distribution and accumulation of patents is suggestive of inventive activity when considered over historically meaning time-spans. However, more domain rich and nuanced knowledge needs to be brought to bear if valuable insights are to be generated.
