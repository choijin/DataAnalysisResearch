<AbstractNarration>The tissues of the body stiffen with age and also with the progression of numerous diseases.  It is now known that this change in stiffness can drive disease by causing cells within the tissue to adopt unhealthy behaviors.  However, tissues do not stiffen uniformly.  The tissues can develop numerous small foci of stiffness so that the stiffness varies markedly throughout. It is not yet known how cells respond to these distributed foci of stiffness that develop with age and disease.  This award supports the research necessary to understand how the process of aging contributes to the development of stiffness foci and how these stiff foci alter cell function.   The primary activity in this work will be on the development of mechanical stiffness foci within blood vessels and the evaluation of their effects on the cells within the blood vessel wall.  However, this basic research will have a broad impact on current understanding of physiology and pathology throughout the body, as changes in tissue stiffness with age can occur in multiple different organ systems.  As such, this work will have broad impact to society.  The project involves techniques from cell biology, materials science, optics, and microfabrication.   This multi-disciplinary approach coupled with research activities designed to involve diverse sets of researchers and students will help train engineers to think and work across disciplinary boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While "heterogeneity" is now appreciated as an important component of biology, the primary focus to-date has been on cell-to-cell molecular-level heterogeneities. However, heterogeneities also exist in the extracellular environment and have been largely overlooked. Many tissues display foci of mechanical stiffness - heterogeneities in stiffness that exist over just a few microns. This project will address the stiffness foci that develop in tissue and their effects on cell-cell adhesion and force generation. In this project, the major research goal is to characterize these foci and their biophysical effects on endothelial cell-cell adhesion using state-of-the-art tools including Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), microfabrication, and ex vivo models.  These studies have the potential to identify a novel mechanism by which age contributes to endothelial dysfunction. More importantly, this work will bring to light the role of mechanical heterogeneities within the matrix on cell biophysics. While the research here will be on the endothelium, it is expected that the results will be relevant to many tissues and pathologies including cancer and embryonic development where heterogeneities in mechanical properties also exist.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the progression of numerous disease, tissue can stiffen.  Atherosclerosis, for example, is classically referred to as "hardening of the arteries."  During cancer progression, solid tumors are often stiffer than the corresponding healthy tissue.  Our research has revealed that this change in stiffness is not uniform; tissue can exhibit ‘hot spots’ of stiffness that appear non-uniformly throughout the tissue. Prior to our work, very little was known about the effects of these stiffness hotspots on cell function. Through the work in this NSF-funded proposal, we built a system to mimic the mechanical heterogeneities found in tissue. We then utilized this system to investigate the effects of ‘hot spots’ of stiffness, using the blood vessel as our model system.      One of the primary functions of blood vessels is to control the movement of cells and materials from the blood into the surrounding tissue. We used microfabrication approaches to create a tissue-engineered model of the blood vessel wall that recreates the stiff and soft spots in the artery wall that appear with age.  Using this platform, we showed that even minor changes to the stiffness of blood vessels can disrupt the ability of the blood vessel wall to control the molecules and cells that pass through it. We created spots of stiffness in our model, and found that the ability of cells far away from the spot to regulate their barrier integrity is disrupted.  This disruption is mediated in part of the contractility of the cells which regulated the ability of cells to adhere to neighboring cells.      Our results have important implications for our understanding of the factors which regulate tissue integrity and cell-cell adhesion. They demonstrate that mechanical perturbation can cause long-range disruptions to cell function.  Notably, our data also suggest that these disruptions can be minimized by tuning cell contractility.     Through the course of this award, we also trained numerous graduate, undergraduate and high school student in biomedical engineering. We hosted bioengineering workshop events for local girl scouts to introduce them to STEM concepts with a focus on tissue engineering.
