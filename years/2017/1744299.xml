<AbstractNarration>This proposal will fund a two day workshop to bring together an interdisciplinary group of scholars who study high courts from a comparative perspective. The workshop will introduce scholars to various theories and methodologies used by the disparate group of scholars at the workshop. Workshop participants will identify new areas of study in order to move from country- and region-specific studies to a literature that truly involves comparative research, with the goal or fostering advancement of scientific theory through cross-fertilization of research perspectives. In addition to offering established scholars new perspectives on research, the workshop will facilitate collaborative research among junior and senior scholars, as well as graduate students. The workshop will develop a research agenda to bring new theoretical perspectives to the study of high courts from a comparative perspective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the study of courts other than the U.S. Supreme Court has matured and advanced both theoretically and methodologically, there is no unifying theory or concerted effort to develop a more integrated body of theoretical and empirical research of high courts. Studies of unique courts, or at best studies of courts from particular regions, dominate the various literatures. To address this limitation in the research, the workshop intends to facilitate truly comparative research that advances theoretical understanding as well as empirical data collection and verification. The workshop aims to bring together an interdisciplinary group scholars from various disciplines who focus on disparate theories and courts, offering an opportunity for dialogue and collaboration. The workshop will be hosted by Texas A&amp;M University in Fort Worth, Texas. The agenda will include an overview of dominant themes from various perspectives, a series of discussions on methodological and theoretical challenges, as well as theory building and new directions of research.</AbstractNarration>

These 44 participants were a mix of experienced scholars, young scholars and graduate students across relevant disciplines. The conference had two major goals: (a) production of the state of the art knowledge about theory of judicial behavior, empirical methodology and regional comparative analysis, and (b) promote a cross-disciplinary setup/environment to foster empirical research about courts at N level.The goals were achieved. According to the online survey (circulated after the workshop, anonymous), willingness to engage in comparative, large N, multidisciplinary coauthorship has increased significantly for participants. We had 28 surveyed participants (excluding the 3 organizers), concerning the overall impact of the conference, 23 said &ldquo;extremely satisfied&rdquo; and 5 said &ldquo;somewhat satisfied&rdquo;. Eleven graduate students participated actively in the event; they were asked to be the discussant in each panel; their participation was highly praised by senior scholars in the workshop; their feedback was very positive.
