<AbstractNarration>This award will partially support operations of the Duke Lemur Center (DLC).  The DLC is a unique living stock collection of the world's most endangered and biologically diverse primates, the lemurs of Madagascar.  The colony is the product of more than 50 years of captive breeding, institutional exchange, and initially, animals caught in the wild.  Lemurs are unique to the biodiversity hotspot of Madagascar, and due to their critically-endangered status, are not a renewable resource.  The DLC is an exceptional training ground for students across all ages and academic levels.  Over its 50-year history, thousands of students ranging from K-12 through postgraduate levels have been engaged in and inspired by their experiences at the DLC.  Also, hundreds of thousands of visitors from the general public have been exposed to the concepts of biodiversity discovery and conservation, as well as the power of biological research via their exposure to the DLC's staff, students, and collections.  The DLC serves as a living laboratory for advancing interdisciplinary research, scholarship, and biological conservation, covering biological disciplines ranging from behavioral ecology to brain sciences, evolutionary ecology, microbial metagenomics, comparative genomics, biomechanics, One Health disease dynamics, aging and demography, biodiversity conservation, paleontology, climate change, comparative physiology, speciation genetics, sensory biology, and more.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will help the DLC meet its short and long-term goals, which include improving support for undergraduate research projects, engaging in exchanges and loan agreements to maintain and enhance species and genetic diversity, and harnessing new technologies to improve comparative biological research involving lemurs.  The research and colony-care programs that will be supported by this project have oversight from a dedicated team of professionals who collectively represent five PhDs, three Masters degrees, two DVMs, and additively, more than two hundred years of direct experience with lemur research, health, husbandry, conservation, and captive management.  The DLC is the only place in the world where lemurs are readily available to investigators, and where biological samples, decades of medical records, fossil representatives of extinct taxa, and rich life-history are available for comparative studies.  Access to colony inventories, demographics, metadata and research opportunities is available on-line (lemur.duke.edu).  The DLC serves multiple educational communities, including the general public, K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students.  For K-12 students, activities include summer camps and a variety of classroom learning and interactive activities with increasing engagement in long-distance learning through on-line tools for educational outreach.  The veterinary department also supports educational activities via undergraduate work-study opportunities and veterinary student training.  Critically, the DLC is committed to conservation activities via both ex situ captive management and extensive community-based Madagascar programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Since its inception in 1966, the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) has advanced scholarship and biological conservation through interdisciplinary research on lemurs - Earth's most threatened group of mammals. In doing so, the DLC provides opportunities for scientists, conservation biologists, and educators to work - independently and together - to understand and protect these extraordinary animals. The DLC has assembled the largest living collection of endangered primates in the world, and strives to impact research, conservation, and education in the United States and internationally, particularly in Madagascar. The Center was founded on the principle that the study of lemurs and their close evolutionary cousins, the galagos and lorises, can inform larger questions in biology such as the genetic and biological underpinnings of the human condition, the generation and diversity of life on earth, and the relevance of biodiversity conservation towards preserving the capacity for evolutionary innovation. Investigators and students from around the world come to Duke to study the living and fossil collections of the DLC.</p> <p>One of the DLC's greatest priorities over the past two years was (and continues to be) increased collaboration with our colleagues in Madagascar. In addition to our <em>in-situ</em> conservation program in the SAVA region, we focused on an exchange program to encourage deeper engagement with our missions of research, education, and conservation. Two Malagasy veterinarians traveled to the United States, one for 3 months to work with the DLC's veterinary team; the other for 2 months for a combined veterinary and research internship, and the DLC sent a senior husbandry technician to Madagascar for a 10-month position as Technical Advisor at Zoo Ivoloina. In addition, at the invitation of Madagascar's Ministry of the Environment (MinEnv), DLC staff authored a Lemur Care and Management Manual in French, specifically for use in Madagascar where over 500 captive lemurs are held in a range of facilities. DLC staff held a workshop in Madagascar in June 2019 to solicit input on the Manual from stakeholders. Over 30 Malagasy staff from the captive facilities (veterinarians, managers and keepers), MinEnv, and local conservation associations participated. The Manual will serve as an official MinEnv document within the National Strategy and Action Plan for Biodiversity Conservation.</p> <p>The continued expansion and reorganization of the Research Department has fundamentally advanced research capacity at the Center. Two additional full-time Research Technicians were hired and, for the first time in over 20 years, Research Scientists joined staff. The three DLC scientists are studying unique aspects of lemur biology, with the goals of promoting next-level and long-term research and increasing data dissemination, scientific outreach, research resources, and funding. &nbsp;Over the past two years, 126 principal investigators from 58 academic institutions carried out 159 research projects, including 45 undergraduate and 29 graduate student PIs. The number of biological disciplines impacted continues to increase and includes areas as diverse as genomics, metabolomics, cognition, biomechanics, physiology, behavior, and ecology. With increased sophistication in non-invasive methods of data collection, the DLC serves as a model institution for the collection of maximum data while prioritizing animal welfare. Moreover, the non-invasive research methods employed contribute to the DLC's system for maintaining animals that are in optimum health, thereby assuring that investigators are retrieving data of the highest possible quality.</p> <p>The DLC also serves multiple education communities, including the general public, K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and post graduate students. Counting all tour types and the camp programs, the Center hosted an average of more than 25,000 visitors from July 2018- June 2019. In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced our doors to close to tours, camps, and all other in-person educational programming. This is reflected in the significant decrease in visitor numbers, with just over 16,000 students and members of the general public visiting the DLC from July 2019-June 2020. While our doors remain closed to visitors, likely until spring 2021, the DLC continues to engage with the public through social media and expanded online learning opportunities, such as virtual tours and private Zoom chats with lemur experts (http://lemur.duke.edu). Through such content, the Center has been able to continue our outreach capabilities during the pandemic, allowing us to communicate information relating to strepsirrhine biology and conservation to interested communities everywhere.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/07/2020<br>      Modified by: Anne&nbsp;D&nbsp;Yoder</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1756431/1756431_10552528_1602013074128__717771766863_lc7_4DH1707ED--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1756431/1756431_10552528_1602013074128__717771766863_lc7_4DH1707ED--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Lemurs at the Duke Lemur Center!"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1756431/1756431_10552528_1602013074128__717771766863_lc7_4DH1707ED--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Lemurs at the Duke Lemur Center!"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Twin ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) infants ride through the forest.
