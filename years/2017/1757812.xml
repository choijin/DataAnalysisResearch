<AbstractNarration>The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville (TAMUK) seeks to provide impactful summer research opportunities and experiences to underrepresented students in the emerging fields of sustainable energy and environment. This will enable them to understand their own levels of aptitude and interest in a career in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and give them the tools to prepare for the next stage in education and career development. The intellectual merit of this REU Site lies in constructing a new and critically needed pipeline for the next generation of sustainable energy researchers, equipped to address the broad theme of sustainable energy research and social and environmental issues, which is a theme of local significance and global implications. The research, educational, and career mentorship provided by the program is envisioned to stimulate the students to look at their academic work in a new light and to provide a spark for possible careers in academic research or industrial innovation. Participating students will tackle various research topics by working collaboratively with other participants, interact with faculty mentors and Ph.D. students from different engineering departments, and develop a holistic perspective of sustainable energy and environment research. The site is designed to guide students to work both independently and collaboratively, with each team consisting of two undergraduate students. Each student will be required to write a conference paper style report of their research for publication and deliver an oral and poster presentation of their summer research projects in the final competition at the end of 10-week program. The REU site fits within an initiative in the College of Engineering at TAMUK to involve undergraduate students in research and boost the participation of US citizens (especially Hispanic and female students) in graduate research. The REU site builds on a vision of grooming aspiring researchers from underrepresented groups to embrace the challenge of energy research and developing future leaders who proactively contribute to the nation's energy self-reliance agenda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site is designed to develop and implement a model environment for multidisciplinary collaborative efforts where research and education are tightly integrated around the different facets of sustainable energy and environment research. Ten students from various engineering and science departments will be recruited through a nationwide search with special emphasis on Hispanic and female students. It features a 10-week interdisciplinary team approach to mentoring students on different research projects. The proposed sustainable energy research consists of three major research areas: 1) Energy Harvesting, 2) Energy Utilization, and 3) Energy Policy, Environmental and Social Impacts. The specific objectives are: 1) providing research opportunities in the different aspects of energy research to undergraduate students, especially Hispanic and women; 2) increasing the number of underrepresented students who participate in graduate education; and 3) building collaborative links among faculty and students from different engineering departments at TAMUK. Through participation in cutting-edge research with faculty mentors working at the forefront of their respective disciplines, students will engage in complex scientific studies on sustainable energy and environment research topics. The program is structured to teach students how to formulate research questions and develop/modify research plans with the guidance of their research mentors. In addition to the hands-on collaborative research experience, technical and social activities will be incorporated into the program to provide students with a solid foundation in analytical, writing, and presentation skills, helping to enhance the interaction between REU students and faculty mentors. The students will also gain experience with reporting and discussing their research results in multiple settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
