<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I Project will enable rural areas of the United States and developing nations to leapfrog the need to build natural gas distribution infrastructure. High temperature heat is required to manufacture and process many day-to-day items, including food, clothing, and more. In regions of the world that do not have natural gas infrastructure, factories produce heat by burning petroleum-based fuel - fuel that must be trucked on-site. It gets expensive. This project will develop technology to capture high temperature heat directly from the sun at significantly lower costs than customers are already paying for fuel. It has the potential to spur economic development in rural areas in the US and other under-developed regions around the world by improving access and reducing the cost of high-temperature heat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop plug-and-play interfaces and techniques to connect advanced new fuel-less boiler technologies to existing / legacy thermal systems in commercial and industrial facilities. Current techniques require costly engineering and are prone to failure, forming a key barrier to the adoption of new fuel-less heat sources. This project will develop modular, scalable, and robust techniques to combine fuel-less boilers powered by the sun with traditional boilers powered by fossil fuels. It will include development and testing of both control systems and thermal balance-of-systems. The goal of the project will be to demonstrate integration of an advanced renewable heat source on a live industrial facility. This work is expected to reduce the cost of deploying such technology by 50% or more.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Skyven?s Intelligent Mirror Array (IMA&trade;) technology has the potential to produce high temperature thermal energy (up to 200&deg;C) from the sun at half the cost of fossil fuels such as propane and fuel oil.  The goal of this Phase I SBIR project was to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating an IMA system with commercial and industrial boilers &ndash; major users of high temperature thermal energy.  Existing solar thermal interfaces, otherwise known as ?balance of systems?, often account for 80% of the total all-in cost of today?s state-of-the-art solar thermal systems, driving costs above that of fossil fuels.  They also are incompatible with temperatures above 80&deg;C.  Both factors make state-of-the-art solar thermal technologies unsuitable for the industrial sector.   To drive down cost, increase temperature, and increase reliability, this SBIR project developed an innovative interface that injects solar steam into a traditional fuel-fired boiler.  The interface enable standardization among a diverse range of legacy thermal equipment found in industrial facilities, driving down system costs by avoiding the cost of a custom engineering.  It also ensures that the industrial facility is never without thermal energy despite the intermittent nature of sunshine.  As part of the interface, the Skyven team developed a wireless control that autonomously completes setup and calibration of large numbers of IMA collectors with the push of a button.  This control system was developed, tested, and debugged on a prototype IMA system of five collectors and is scalable up to systems of hundreds of collectors without additional development work.  In addition, a boiler interface plan for steam injection was defined, modeled, and tested.  The modeling work demonstrated thermal stability and feasibility of component sizing (heat exchanger, pumps, etc).  The testing work demonstrated functionality and outdoor on-sun performance of a simplified interface incorporating automated system-level controls and real-time performance monitoring.  As a key enabler of this work, Skyven also completed US-based contract-manufacturing of the first twenty IMA collector units.  Preliminary results from on-going reliability testing suggest that the lifetime of IMA collectors will be twenty years or more.
