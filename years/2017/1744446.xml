<AbstractNarration>Many urban universities offer precollege STEM programs aimed at broadening participation in STEM. These programs are designed to increase students' scientific content knowledge and skills, promote STEM engagement, increase self-efficacy, and prepare underserved and underrepresented minority high school students for success in undergraduate programs. However, even after demonstrating significant knowledge gains and success in these programs, students are often unable to authenticate their knowledge gains to receive favorable consideration on college applications. In fact, there is currently no systematic credentialing mechanism to assess and validate the scientific rigor of and competency gains within STEM precollege programs for college admissions purposes. This NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilot seeks to address this gap by developing and testing credentialing and badging processes for four STEM precollege programs. Working with College Admissions Officers and project partners, the University of Pittsburgh endeavors to employ a collaborative impact approach to build and document the collaborative infrastructure needed to support STEM precollege program authentication processes. This will seed the development of a networked improvement community that supports all aspects of the work from participant support to the collaborative impact to the greater network of urban education university ecosystems involved in the pilot. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over a two-year period, this pilot will examine a mechanism to strengthen the STEM pathway for disadvantaged and underrepresented minority students to enter postsecondary STEM programs and eventually STEM careers. Building on two social innovation theories, the technical approach will focus on four specific aims: (1) create a community engagement framework to recruit underserved and underrepresented high school students to STEM precollege programs, (2) develop a STEM Success Matrix that identifies student competencies acquired in precollege programs that prepare students for collegiate success in STEM, (3) credential precollege programs using the STEM Success Matrix, and (4) develop a student badging system for precollege program participants using the STEM Success Matrix.  Four University of Pittsburgh STEM precollege programs will serve as the context for development and testing with support from a range of partners representing the broader Pittsburgh STEM ecosystem. Approximately 300 high school students are expected to participate in the pilot, across the four precollege programs. Data will be collected via participant surveys and interviews. Formative and summative evaluations will be conducted by an experienced, external evaluator. Shareable metrics, tools, and processes will be developed and disseminated using various platforms and mechanisms. If successful, this pilot could be transformative - changing admissions considerations by credentialing STEM precollege programs and increasing student interest and motivation in STEM through student badging. It would also transform the STEM ecosystem of underserved and underrepresented minority students by creating an important STEM pathway from precollege to undergraduate admissions and ultimately, STEM Careers. This pilot could serve as a baseline for a more expansive alliance with other urban education ecosystems or assisting others interested in establishing their own collaborative infrastructure and networked improvement community model to achieve similar results.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Diversity in the STEM workforce is essential for expanding the talent pool and bringing new ideas to bear in solving society’s problems, yet there remain entrenched gaps between majority and minority students in STEM higher education. Many urban universities offer precollege STEM programs (PCSPs) aimed at broadening participation in STEM. These programs are designed to increase students' scientific content knowledge and skills, promote STEM engagement, increase self-efficacy, and prepare underserved and underrepresented minority high school students for success in undergraduate programs. However, participating underrepresented minoritized (URM) students, even when demonstrating significant learning gains, may not be accepted for admission to the institutions that host these programs due to policies that filter out applicants based on SAT scores and high school GPAs instead of prioritizing more culturally relevant criteria. In fact, there is currently no systematic mechanism to assess and validate the scientific rigor of and competency gains within PCSPs for college admissions purposes.

Intellectual Merit  This pilot investigated and articulated a mechanism to strengthen the STEM pathway for URM students to enter postsecondary STEM programs and eventually STEM careers.   Four University of Pittsburgh STEM precollege programs served as the context for development and testing with support from a range of partners representing the broader Pittsburgh STEM ecosystem.  This project: 1) Analyzed admissions and persistence data and found that standardized test scores are more predictive of the race/ethnicity than of persistence in STEM at Pitt. 2) Developed the STEM Success Matrix that identifies the skills, abilities, and habits-of-mind necessary for undergraduate student success in STEM. 3) Conducted a community framework analysis which identified PCSPs as an important link between urban communities and local research universities.  This resulted in a playbook for how urban universities can interface effectively with their communities through PCSPs and a manuscript that is under review at Connected Science Learning. 4) Identified and articulated a set of evidence-based quality standards for PCSPs that reflect critical program characteristics for broadening participation in STEM. These quality standards describe the structures and practices that may predict a program’s ability to engage and prepare URM students for success in a STEM field. 5) Created a mechanism whereby PCSPs can add value in college admissions decisions. As a result of our DDLP work, Pitt created an alternative admissions review for students that participated in one of four Pitt-supported PCSPs. (6) Transformed the conversation around equity in STEM education at The University of Pittsburgh. As a direct result of the work from our INCLUDES DDLP, The University of Pittsburgh created The Broadening Equity in STEM Center (BE STEM). This Center is significant because it provides an organizational hub for our work, support for our vision, and elevates the conversation around equity in STEM education on the Pitt campus and beyond.  Broader Impacts  Many STEM professionals credit out-of-school-time, precollege STEM experiences as a key influencer to pursue a STEM career, and recognize the value of PCSPs in their ability to prepare students for STEM.  This DDLP developed evidence-based quality standards for STEM precollege programs and contributed to a mounting body of research that calls for a transformation in college admissions processes to reduce bias, account for diversity, and maximize access of urban minority students to selective colleges.  This project resulted in the vision that successful participation in quality, accredited PCSPs will be a transformative alternative admissions metric. These outcomes form the basis of the NSF INCLUDES Alliance: The STEM PUSH Network.  Composed of PCSPs in urban STEM ecosystems, STEM and culturally responsive pedagogy experts, college admissions and higher education professionals, and embedded in the STEM Learning Ecosystem Community of Practice (SLECoP) national network, the STEM PUSH Network will build on the results of this pilot to transform admissions pathways for URM students across the country.  Together we will build both a powerful collaborative improvement space using the networked improvement community (NIC) model to strengthen PCSPs along the quality standards and develop a "next generation" accreditation model in partnership with Middle States Association that will serve as a mechanism for communicating the power of precollege programs to admissions offices.  Combined, this NIC + accreditation will change the university admissions review system by providing an evidence-based, equitable alternative to the current, culturally biased, standardized test score-based system.
