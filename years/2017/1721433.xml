<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a vastly increased market for millimeter wave imaging products due to the disruptive price and performance of this camera. This sensors technology project will demonstrate the first cost-effective video-rate millimeter wave camera that can image and resolve moving objects from 1-300 meters away. Millimeter wave light is often used for security screening because it is safe to use on people and can penetrate packaging, bags, and clothing to identify both metallic and non-metallic objects. The technology developed in this project makes this revolutionary security screening capability accessible to hospitals, schools, commercial buildings, and public spaces. While it is impossible to put a monetary value on tragedies averted and lives saved, improved public safety will reduce the effects of the fear these actions create on society and on economic growth. Market growth in people screening and security, as well as navigational assistance, is already proven (40+% annual growth rate) but is constrained by the size, cost, and slow speed of existing solutions. The portability, cost, and video-rate capability of this camera will expand the markets as well as enable new markets not yet served. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a demonstration of a novel component that enables video-rate millimeter wave imaging. Multi-pixel imaging in millimeter wave is cost-prohibitive since each pixel costs hundreds of dollars. This device enables the application of proven optical single-pixel technologies to millimeter wave imaging, thereby greatly decreasing the cost and increasing the accessibility of this technology. The research objective is to fabricate and test a series of designs that vary around the optimum design defined by the modeling, to refine the modeling, and then to repeat the fabrication, in a tighter range of geometries, around the new optimum. The result of this SBIR Phase I project will be a working prototype that can be integrated into an existing still-frame millimeter wave camera to create a millimeter wave video camera.</AbstractNarration>
