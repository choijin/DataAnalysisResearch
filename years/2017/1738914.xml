<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support for student participation in the 2017 meeting of the APS Division of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics. The conference program includes many of the research topics central to Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics and Quantum Information Science. The support of students through this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in atomic, molecular, and optical physics acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting is scheduled to be held in Sacramento, CA in June of 2017. It offers an opportunity for students to present their research results and to interact with senior scientists primarily from the United States, but also the broader international community. Support is provided only for US students (students enrolled in US universities).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to defray the travel costs incurred by students who attended the American Physical Society's (APS) 2017 annual meeting of the Division of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics (DAMOP).  This meeting was held in Sacramento, California during June 5-9, 2017.  This was done through travel grants of $600 awarded by the American Physical Society to 20 students who applied to attend the meeting.  The APS was reimbursed by funds from this grant for their support of these students.  Travel support to the DAMOP for students ensured that a diverse group of young researchers participated in a professional physics meeting.  This participation fostered the interchange of scientific information among these young scientists. It also offered them the chance to interact with more senior physicists in the particular area in which they are interested and to be exposed to new cutting-edge areas of atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics research.  These types of interactions are important for the vitality of AMO physics research in the United States.  These students were also afforded the opportunity to present the results of their own research while enabling them to broaden their knowledge their particular area by attending talks on subjects similar to their work.  In addition, a one-day graduate-student symposium in conjunction with the conference was organized. This symposium introduced students to cutting-edge topics in AMO physics. The support of students through this grant contributed to their education and training as future professional scientists.
