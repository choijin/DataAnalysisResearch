<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Professor Kerney Glover from Lehigh University and colleagues Bryan Berger and Damien Thevenin are upgrading a console for a 500 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer and also have equipped the spectrometer with a cryoprobe. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as studies of biologically-relevant species. In general, NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tools available to chemists for the structural study of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the changing interactions between molecules in solution.  The results from these NMR studies may have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by graduate and undergraduate students via independent student research and traditional academic coursework. The spectrometer is used to support academic institutions members of the Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges such as Lafayette College, Kutztown University, Cedar Crest College, DeSales University, Moravian College and Muhlenberg College.  Students from these institutions can enroll in an advanced laboratory class that utilizes the instrument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NMR spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. It aids researchers studying the molecular determinants for the homodimerization of the receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase J and the structure and topology of the protein caveolin-1 (as well as mutants of caveolin-1.) The spectrometer is also used for the determination of the structure of the RAMP1 transmembrane domain.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award allowed for the installation of a new nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) instrument in the Chemsitry Department at Lehigh University.  This instrument has capabilities that will allow cutting edge experiments to be perfomed.  The main feature of the instrument is the "cold probe" which greatly enhances the sensitivity of the instrument which will allow for experiments to be performed more quickly and with lower amounts of sample.  Importantly, this upgrade will allow for the three dimensional structure of proteins to be determined using the instrument.  The updated spectrometer has advanced the training and scientific capabilities of graduate students at Lehigh University and provided them with unfettered access to the instrument. The updated spectrometer has directly advanced teaching of undergraduates (primarily Chemistry, Biochemistry, Biology, and Bioengineering majors) who are enrolled in advanced laboratory classes or performing undergraduate research.  In addition, access to the instrument will be granted for local academic institutions so that undergradatuate students beyond those at Lehigh University  will have the opportunity to gain exposure to the instrument as well in both classes and research.  Lastly, this will undoubtedly both strengthen and facilitate networks and partnerships with local academic institutions and companies in the rapidly growing Lehigh Valley region.
