<AbstractNarration>Astronomical observations are now probing the early stages of the universe, in which galaxies developed and merged, and the formation of structure in the universe and its evolution to the present era was set in motion. An important part of this story is the chemical evolution of galaxies. The formation of the elements in stars and their subsequent dispersal are powerful tracers of structure formation and evolution.  This project will simulate on Blue Waters processes deep inside stars that play an important role in the heavy elements they generate. These processes are driven by mixing of gases at the boundaries of convection zones, which can bring new fuels into a convection zone, carrying them down into much hotter regions where they burn very rapidly and activate nuclear reaction networks in a special convective-reactive regime. In this regime, reacting nuclei are transported by the turbulent convection flow on about the same timescale as the reactions take place, so that significant departures from spherical symmetry, even in a statistical sense, can result.  This project will use the petascale capabilities of Blue Waters to simulate these brief events in 3D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project we will build on earlier work on Blue Waters to study a process where the O-shell convection zone in a massive star can work its way to the base of the C-shell convection zone above, leading to ingestion of carbon fuel and an ultimate merger of the two burning shells. The project will compute the resulting nucleosynthesis by following the concentrations of a large number of nuclear isotopes and computing their interactions on a 4-D grid of reduced resolution in space and time. A fine grid is required to accurately advance the turbulent convection flow and to compute the amount of fuel entrained in it at the convection zone boundary.  The study will follow the most important species on this fine grid, but will represent on the coarser grid the large number of nuclear reactions from which energy release is minor and has minimal back reaction on the flow.   This project will generate a large database of results from the 3-D simulations on Blue Waters of convective boundary mixing in stellar interiors. The project intends to organize this database so that the simulation codes can mine it automatically, comparing it to a variety of potentially useful 1-D models of the mixing process.  In terms of broader impacts, the project will make this database and tools available to the community on-line in a useful format, so that it will enable research by many others.  In addition, the project will work with the NuGrid collaboration to see that the results are incorporated into data sets that are available to the community for chemical evolution simulations of galaxies and structures in the early universe.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This single-year PRAC grant was a part of our extended project under NSF's CDS&amp;E program to explore convective boundary mixing and its consequences for i-process nucleosynthesis in stars.  A very important outcome of our work over this grant period has been to bring into productive service our completely new and restructured PPMstar code.  This code has been designed to support multiple grid resolution levels in the same problem, to produce an entire array of default data products as it runs, including volume rendered images that are easily combined into movies, and to incorporate our lessons from the last few years on code design for high performance on both CPUs and GPUs.  This code is constructed in a much more readable, maintainable, and clear way than its predecessor code, which derived from a highly time-constrained effort to exploit the power of Los Alamos' Roadrunner machine and its IBM Cell processor accelerators.  This very extensive code re-write has positioned us now to make much more rapid strides in attacking the challenging new problems, such as shell mergers in massive stars, that are now accessible with NSF's new Track-1 computing system, Frontera.  Graduate student Huaqing Mao has, through introducing several enhancements to this new code, become thoroughly familiar with it in a way that would simply have been impossible had we continued to work with our old Roadrunner code.  During this PRAC grant period we carried out multiple studies using our new PPMstar code on Blue Waters, which was possible due to this code's 4- to 6-fold improvement in overall computational efficiency over our previous code.  We were able to carry out the multiple long, high resolution simulations that allowed us to pin down with confidence the parameters and scaling relationships of an effective 1-D model of convective boundary mixing that we can use in our 1D-3D approach to attack problems involving the merger of 2 nuclear burning shells, each with its own convection zone (see Fig. 1).  We have also been able to carry out several high-resolution simulations of core convection in rotating massive stars that offer the potential for us to connect with new observational data from asteroseismology. Images from these simulations are included with this report (Figs 2-6).  Finally, we have been able to provide 3-D hydrodynamic simulations that support work of Herwig's team to investigate the role of rapidly accreting white dwarfs as sites of i&#8209;process nucleosynthesis in the early universe.  During our several years of computation on the Blue Waters system, our team produced multiple petabytes of simulation data.  In the last year, the need to sift through that data, deciding what to save and what can now be discarded has precipitated discussions with several other researchers faced with similar problems of data persistence.  The enormous capacity and tremendous convenience of the Blue Waters system's nearline tape storage system allowed us to put off decisions on data persistence.  The NSF's CDS&amp;E program, however, led us to focus specifically on issues of data quality, volume, and particularly sharing.  We believe that this focus has put us in a relatively good position to handle our very large trove of simulation data as the Blue Waters system nears the end of its period of service.  To this goal, we have developed special, very highly compressed data formats produced by our new PPMstar code.  We are also developing powerful tools to explore this compressed data and to produce visualizations, plots of radial profile data, and cross correlation data that can be used to validate statistical models (Figs. 4-6 were made using this highly compressed data).  In a Stellar Hydro Days V workshop that we and our collaborators have organized for June, 2019, we plan to demonstrate these tools to our immediate international research community.
