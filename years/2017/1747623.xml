<AbstractNarration>This project investigates how to foster the best science, given that most scientific research is done by teams.  The research investigates human behavioral patterns that indicate the production of impactful research and the ability to attract grant funding.  The objective is to discern characteristics of how research communities develop, form and operate to introduce novel ideas with significant impact. Results make the point that scientific success transcends institutional group boundaries and is a matter of larger communities that coalesce and have a high turnover of novel topics and members. The key objective of this project is a first quantification of patterns of human group dynamics and diversity of scientific content on scientific success in terms of garnering grant support and providing impactful science. Since NSF supports research at many different scientific frontiers, our results may allow the detection of patterns that are valid across many scientific fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project models a corpus of millions of research papers, integrating grant information of diverse scientific fields and scientific content. Research publications are used to construct co-authorship networks in different time windows and scientific fields. Groups in such networks will be detected by the use of contemporary clustering methods that will point to fission/fusion patterns of groups. Project data covering the last 25 years of funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and will be integrated with content information from the body of research publications. Results make the point that scientific success transcends institutional group boundaries and is a matter of larger communities that coalesce, split and have a high turnover of novel topics and members.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We investigated different factors associated with the success of scientific teams.  One factor investigated was the distribution of rewards.  We looked at two potential rewards that motivate effort on teams.  The probability of prizewinning and the probability of receiving grant money.  Regarding prizes, we looked at thousands of scientific prizes worldwide using the sample of prizes reported on wikidata/wikipedia.  We found that women and men now win prizes in proportion to their representation on teams.  However, when prizes are categorized by prestige, women are significantly underrepresented among the prestigious prizes and overrepresented among the low prestige prizes.  Women are also significantly overrepresented among service prize winners, and receive on average lower monetary rewards than men.  This work was published in Nature in 2019 (Ma, Fregolente, Woodruff, and Uzzi).   Regarding grant money, we used the NIH dataset on grant winning.  Focusing on first time NIH PIs at the Big Ten and Ivy League research universities, we matched men and women researchers by field, grant type, publication record, and university.  We found that depending on the grant and the university, first time women PIs on average receive significant lower amounts of grant money than their matched male counterparts on the same types of grants at the same universities.  These patterns persisted when looking at the 10 biggest grants (which make up 65% of grant dollars) and at certain but not all universities.  This paper was published in JAMA in 2019 (Fregolente, Ma, Woodruff, and Uzzi).          Last Modified: 01/16/2020       Submitted by: Brian D Uzzi]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
