<AbstractNarration>Keeping computers and information systems secure is a major challenge both in the United States and abroad. Business, industry, and government need a well-prepared workforce that can prevent, detect, and investigate cybersecurity breaches, and the growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have appropriate, specific knowledge and skills. The cybersecurity challenge does not respect national boundaries. The Internet has global reach, and many companies do business and employ technical workers around the world. To address cybersecurity concerns in the United States well, educators and employers need to build cooperation and understanding with their international counterparts. In this project, Highline College, in collaboration with CyberWatch West, will organize and host the first International Collegiate Cyber Defense Invitational (ICCDI) competition during the summer of 2017. This event, which will be modeled after the U.S. Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC), will bring together approximately ten student teams and their coaches from nations around the world to tackle real-world cybersecurity challenges in the context of a simulated corporate network. This hands-on experience and competitive practice cannot be replicated in a typical classroom, and it will provide students with better training and preparation for the workforce. The interaction of students and faculty who have different educational backgrounds, as well as experiences with different technologies, will prepare the students for the global cybersecurity environment in which they will work. During the competition, conference sessions will also be held to allow representatives from companies, governments, and educational institutions to share knowledge about cybersecurity challenges and solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ICCDI planning committee will build into the competition's structure opportunities for the students to broaden their knowledge of cybersecurity as it is taught and practiced around the world. These technical features of the competition environment will be supplemented by the opportunity to meet cyber-defenders from other countries face-to-face to discuss both unique and common challenges and to establish new lines of communication. Colleges and universities that have participated in the U.S. Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition have discovered weaknesses in their current curricula and have designed changes to address them. By following a similar approach, the ICCDI will enable participating colleges and universities to adjust their curricula to meet cybersecurity demands in their region and in the international arena. Each team will receive a detailed report about how it performed in the competition, along with a debriefing from the judges and the cybersecurity experts on the Red (penetration testing) Team. The project evaluator will use aggregated data on the performance of the teams and surveys of participants to answer such questions as: How did the students and faculty benefit from the exposure to participants from other countries? What particular nomenclature and skills did participants learn in the international context? What cross-cultural issues emerged as significant during the competition? How will faculty and students use the knowledge and skills that they gained? What curricular changes will be implemented?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes  The International Collegiate Cyber Defense Invitational (ICCDI) objective was to create collaboration between students and faculty from various countries in North America, the South African Development Community (SADC), Europe, and Asia. Highline College (HC) and the PI have long-established exchanges with schools in the various regions, which is where initial efforts began.  While people worldwide use common operating systems such as Windows and Linux, the terminology used and approaches to cybersecurity vary from country to country and region to region. By creating a typical Blue Team (student teams) and Red Team (professional penetration testers) event with participants from disparate locales, students, faculty, government, and industry participants learned from each other.  Outcomes:  Conducted three ICCDI events with NSF funding.     In 2017, four schools participated ? Namibia University of Science and Technology (NUST), the University of Central Florida, Brigham Young University (BYU) ? Utah, and the Politeknik Negeri, Medan, Indonesia. Due to visa issues, the Politeknik Negeri had to compete remotely. In 2018, eight schools participated and the event was held in two centers: Highline College and NUST.  Highline hosted two schools ? the Evergreen State College and BYU ? with the Politeknik Negeri again participating remotely. NUST had its own team and hosted University of Namibia (UNAM), Lingua College, and Delta Secondary School. In 2019, it was again in two centers with a smaller number of schools participating.     As a result of the initial post-event surveys, collaboration between the student teams became part of the scoring criteria. It was something students really enjoyed and valued. The student teams actually vote on the most collaborative, with the communications on the Slack and Zoom channels used to verify same. Use of Zoom and Slack by the judges and the White Team (scorers) encouraged collaboration between the industry and government professionals at the two centers. Government, police, and military in Namibia along with Washington State National Guard served as the Red Team in the events. It was very exciting on both sides to have the opportunity to interact with each other in such a supportive environment.  In 2018, with contributions from the Highline College (HC) ITS department and the HC student government, the HC team leader and the HC CISO were able to travel to Namibia to support the efforts in Windhoek, the home of NUST. In 2019, with help from a new sponsor, we were able to send tech support again. In 2018 and 2019, Highline College students created the scenario and the virtual corporate network that was used in the event. They had to learn cryptocurrency and block chain technology as a result of the scenario they chose. The students also learned the importance of clear communication when dealing with different cultures and backgrounds.  In 2018 and 2019 when recruiting schools to participate, the schools contacted in some other countries and in the U.S. were reluctant to participate due to lack of experience. One of the goals is to produce a flyer of what teams need to do to prepare for the event. Two HC students who were on the design team presented in a monthly NICE Competitions subgroup.   Dr. Amelia Phillips and Simone Jarzabek, both Highline faculty, had a booth at the ATE PI Conference in 2018 and 2019 to present results. Dr. Phillips, Kurt Giessel, and Mark Wynne, all from Highline College, presented the results of the 2018 event at the NICE Conference in Miami, which generated interest from some groups in Miami who had connections in Latin America and one contact who worked with a school in Turkey. The Highline IT staff and students have become more adept at hosting Red Team / Blue Team events in the cloud. Stronger relationships and collaboration between Highline College and NUST have been a direct result of this event          Last Modified: 12/30/2019       Submitted by: Amelia Phillips]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
