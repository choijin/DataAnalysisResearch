<AbstractNarration>The intense interactions between light and metal particles with nanoscale dimensions provide the foundation for transformative sensing, catalytic and photovoltaic technologies. Even though many such devices have been successfully prototyped from these so-called plasmonic nanomaterials, the fabrication techniques currently utilized, while well-suited to a research intensive environment, are incompatible with a manufacturing setting. This award supports a research effort aimed at defining a platform that replaces current best-practice techniques with those responsive to the scalability, throughput, yield and cost-effectiveness requirements of nanomanufacturing. If the nanomanufacturing platform is validated it could act as the synthetic foundation underpinning for: (i) sensor technologies able to detect various cancers, E. coli, explosives, drugs and heavy metal contaminents, (ii) catalytic surfaces geared towards environmental remediation or "green" chemical syntheses powered by sunlight and (iii) a new class of photovoltaics reliant on plasmonic materials. Research activities are being integrated with education initiatives through projects which train both undergraduate and graduate students in the design of instrumentation able to synthesize technologically relevant nanomaterials and provide real-time monitoring of manufacturing processes. Outreach initiatives are being directed toward the matriculation of women into the Engineering profession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research being carried out will define the nanomanufacturing platform needed to fabricate photoactive surfaces comprised of periodic arrays of complex three-dimensional nanostructures which express the intense plasmonic resonances needed to enable photovoltaic, catalytic and sensing applications. It will utilize an existing synthetic framework whereby: (i) lithography defines nanostructured precursors at site-specific locations, (ii) directed assembly transforms them into nanostructured templates with high crystallinity and pristine surfaces and (iii) solution-based syntheses sculpt these templates into complex nanostructures. The studies aim to: (i) validate this synthetic framework as an inexpensive nanomanufacturing platform able to fabricate functional photoactive surfaces consisting of periodic arrays of sub-50 nm nanostructures with pristine surfaces and unprecedented complexity, (ii) overcome existing knowledge barriers related to the maximum realizable array density and potential throughput bottlenecks which, if left unreconciled, challenge the viability of the nanomanufacturing platform, (iii) demonstrate a new set of instrumentation which is responsive to the scalability and throughput needs of a nanomanufacturing setting and (iv) establish an in situ optical diagnostic which can in real-time provide the feedback required to direct nanostructure assembly processes to programmed endpoints.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong><em>Intellectual Merit:</em> </strong>The CMMI Award aimed to establish the instrumentation and nanofabrication techniques needed to produce periodic arrays of complex noble metal nanostructures over square centimeter areas. The project has succeeded in that prior capabilities have been supplanted and the instrumentation developed (<em>i.e.</em>, nanoimprint lithography system, liquid-state synthesis chamber, and flow cell with <em>in situ</em> optical monitoring) is now used on a daily basis and acts as the cornerstone of the PI?s research program. The award has resulted in five publications in high impact factor journals (<em>Nanoscale</em>, IF 7.2; <em>Acta Mater.</em> IF 6.0; <em>ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces</em>, IF 8.1; <em>Nanotechnology</em>, IF 3.4) including an invited Account (<em>Acc. Chem. Res., </em>IF 21.0). This work has been disseminated at national, international, and internal meetings including invited talks by the PI at conferences of the Materials Research Society (MRS), European Materials Research Society (E-MRS), and American Chemical Society (ACS). The work has resulted in the Ph.D. of Eric Menumerov, who is now employed with Intel, and the M.S. degree of Spencer Golze, who is currently working toward his Ph.D. under the PI?s supervision. Specific research accomplishments include: (i) the first benchtop nanofabrication procedure that is able to define periodic arrays of noble metal nanostructures with an architectural complexity that rivals colloidal syntheses (see Figure 1), (ii) a synthetic method for transforming equiaxed nanostructures derived from dewetting into highly faceted structures, a procedure that can replace anneals lasting a hundred hours or more with a liquid-phase synthesis lasting minutes, and (iii) the demonstration of an inexpensive method for increasing the thermal conductance across semiconductor?metal interfaces, a property that is of vital importance when removing waste heat in electronic devices.</p> <p><strong><em>Broader Impacts:</em></strong> The prototyping of on-chip plasmonic devices has in many instances been stifled by the inability to form organized configurations of complex nanostructures over large areas. The capabilities demonstrated through the NM Award are, therefore, of relevance to the multidisciplinary audience working toward functionalizing such structures for chemical and biological detection as well as their integration with optical and scanning microscopy probes, electronic circuitry, biopatterns, microfluidics, and lab-on-a-chip platforms. The PI has also had an impact as a (i) 2017 MRS Spring Meeting symposium organizer, (ii) guest editor for a special issue of Particle &amp; Particle Systems Characterization, (iii) Scientific Advisor for the 2018 Advanced Energy Materials Congress, and (iv) session chair at MRS, E-MRS, ACS, and AEMC meetings. Highlights in terms of undergraduate student training include six undergraduate research internships and three design projects focused on solar panel installations, retrofitting the sample compartment of a spectrometer with a motorized stage, and the construction of a synthesis chamber for the fabrication of substrate-based nanostructures. The PI has contributed to community outreach through her participation in (i) Science Alive, (ii) Penn High School?s Technology Student Association, and (iii) the mentorship and judging of high school science fair projects. She is especially proud of her mentorship of the 2018 capstone senior design project of Emily Clements, an undergraduate in the Chemical Engineering Department. In the prior summer, Emily volunteered at Our Lady of the Road, which is a drop-in center that provides hot breakfasts, laundry services, showers, and donated clothes for those in need. Knowing that the PI taught the elective <em>Photovoltaic System Design</em>, she approached her and described an ambitious project that would see solar cells installed on the center?s rooftop, a project that would divert electricity expenditures toward the center?s core mission for the foreseeable future. Emily not only carried out a successful design project, but through a heroic effort that included fundraising made her dream a reality.&nbsp; On August 19<sup>th</sup>, 2018 the PV system that she designed was installed on the roof of Our Lady of the Road (see Figure 2). The PI considers it a privilege to have worked with an amazing engineering student who is intent on making the world a better place.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/14/2019<br>      Modified by: Svetlana&nbsp;Neretina</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1707595/1707595_10393388_1571073451819_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1707595/1707595_10393388_1571073451819_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SEM image of the framed structures"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1707595/1707595_10393388_1571073451819_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SEM image of the framed structures"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1.
