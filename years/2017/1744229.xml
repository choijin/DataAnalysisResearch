<AbstractNarration>The significance of this conference is to provide a forum for presentation and discussion of the latest research in emerging energy topics and the teaching and learning of energy. This award will support participation of a diverse group of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and early career investigators to attend the 2018 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and the preceding Gordon Research Symposium (GRS) in Physics Research and Education.  The teaching of energy is considered by physicists to be an important core concept to understand the material world, and by inviting cutting-edge scientists to speak on topics in energy research -- from energy harvesting to energy flow modeling -- transformative topics in energy research are made available for use as application examples in the teaching of undergraduate physics students and the general public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the theme of "Energy as a Subtle Concept", workshop topics are broken into fundamental and contemporary groups and each session is represented by both a physics education and scientific researcher. The conference goals are as follows: a) introduce participants to cutting edge research in the field of physics and education related to the theme of energy,  b) foster knowledge of new methods of energy research and pedagogical research on energy in order to provide new models for use in teaching by conference participants, c) encourage discussions and potential collaborations between conference participants in order to broaden the energy ecosystem to include scientists, educational researchers, and instructors, d) provide mentorship opportunities for conference participants, and e) create a community of practice around the teaching and learning about energy.  The conference will be preceded by a two-day Gordon Research Symposium entirely planned and executed by a group of post-docs and graduate students who are rising leaders in energy related research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Conference funding is was sought from NSF to provide support for registration fee and/or travel support for participants, with preference given to post docs, graduate students, Under-represented scientists, young career investigators, minorities, and faculty from PUIs, Tribal Colleges, minority serving institutions, and community colleges to attend the 2018 Physics Research and Education Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar.  One of the main purposes in bringing transformative research scientists to present cutting edge research is to provide cross-cutting examples of energy research for use in the teaching of physics.  By providing a broad audience of physics instructors and educational researchers from diverse institutions, energy researchers can inform, transfer ideas, concepts, and build knowledge in instructors and educational researchers which can translate down to classroom, and disciplinary literacy practices.  For this award, 32 participants were funded for full or partial conference fees for GRC from this grant, including 19 women, 2 Latino, 4 African Americans for a total of 26/32 funded participants being considered under-represented in science (female, Latino, African American).  Of the 31 participants funded, 17 were from PUIs, Tribal Colleges, Minority serving institutions.  There were 11 young career investigators and 5 post -docs or graduate students of the 32 funded participants.  The addition of the NSF funding allowed this conference to be one of the most diverse Gordon Conferences for Summer 2018, with 21/95 participants from PUIs, Tribal Colleges, Minority serving institutions, 36/95 women, 6/95 grad students or post-docs and 40/95 young career academics. In addition, the GRC organization offered a "Power Hour" which was an afternoon informal gathering during which participants can gather to discuss women?s issues in science.  This sesson was heavily attended with over fifty participants.     For the GRS, it was anticipated that this may well be the first meeting where graduate students and post-docs who are involved in physics research and physics education research meet and exchange knowledge and ideas. 19 participants were fully funded for the GRS meeting, and of these 17 of the 19 were underrepresented minorities in Physics, and all but two were post-docs, graduate students or lecturers.  To help break the misunderstanding that there is a set career path for physics PhDs, a panel of science professionals will discuss a variety of topics, including their disparate career paths during a mentorship session.  For the program, 10/22 invited speakers were women, and 7/10 were young career academics.  There were 5/9 session discussion leaders who were women, and the program included speakers from academia, government research laboraties and industry. The talks were cross cutting, and illustrated transformative ideas in energy research and he teaching of physics concepts.  Broader impact of the grant is seen through the combined scientific and educational talks, discussion and dialogue, where conference participants build subject content knowledge, align it to pedagogical practices related to use of language (metaphor development) in order to create new knowledge which can transfer to student activities at their home institution.    A second broader impact of the Gordon conference was the formal and informal mentorship that occurs at the conference.  In particular, minority and under-represented scholars may feel isolated in their academic position, and this conference will allow for formal and informal time for faculty and students to interact with potential mentors.  The conference program, diversity and interactions were highly ranked by the participants, with attendees noting the diversity of attendees and the opportunities to learn about energy research and teaching from each other.
