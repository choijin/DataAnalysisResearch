<AbstractNarration>Transitional justice has increasingly relied on the promise of dignity in post-conflict resolution efforts. But researchers are discovering that how dignity is pursued and achieved varies across different sociocultural contexts. Several existing studies have documented that many people inhabit conditions that preclude the possibility of a life with dignity. This project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, asks what factors foreclose the pursuit of dignity, and by extension, drive those individuals away from peaceful resolution of past differences. Understanding the causal relation between the pursuit of dignity and the turn to extreme or militant alternatives to attain it is critical for developing policies that can curtail the rise of such phenomena. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations interested in issues of human rights and post-conflict reconciliation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Douaa Sheet, under the supervision of Dr. Vincent Crapanzano of the City University of New York, will explore how multiple moral frameworks influence human behavior in the context of transitional justice efforts. This research will be conducted in Tunisia, which is selected as a research site because it is currently witnessing a resurgence of protests across the country reiterating the 2011 Arab Spring demand for "dignity, freedom, and employment," making it a particularly apt time to conduct this study. The research will focus on the Truth and Dignity Commission (TDC), a mechanism of international human rights where a locally elected commission is mandated to investigate the human rights abuses of the fallen regime and recommend reparations for its victims. While the TDC is mandated to recommend forms of redress for these victims, many of them are boycotting the TDC and turning to alternative ways of recovering their dignity. The investigator will visit the sites of renewed protests to collect testimonies of the experiences of humiliation re-fueling the demand for dignity, the moral traditions and theological concepts that victims mobilize to explain their reasons for boycotting the TDC, and the appeal of alternatives such as suicide and militant Islam or what they call jihad an-nafs (the struggle of the self). Through the lens of the TDC and the heated controversies that have surrounded its work, the investigator will explore the multiple moral traditions informing the notion of dignity. The investigator will interview civil society stakeholders, human rights lawyers, jurists, international rights experts, and the victims involved in the process to identify what sources might contribute to frustration with the TDC, when and how its mechanism are experienced as a form of humiliation, and the extent to which the aspiration for a future with dignity might inform the way Ben Ali's victims are responding to the TDC and refiguring the strategies through which they deal with their past abuses. Findings from this research will provide insight into the reasons dignity is such a valued aspiration, the social and economic costs of not conforming to the dictates of this moral tradition, and the reasons non-radical persons are turning to radical alternatives to reassert their dignity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This doctoral dissertation project is a historical and ethnographic study of ?dignity? (kar?m?): the moral and political demand that mobilized the 2011 Tunisian uprising and emerged to dominate the social and political scene in its aftermath. Through the lens of the Truth and Dignity Commission (TDC)&mdash;the heated controversies that have surrounded its work, the televised public hearings, demonstrations protesting its proceedings, interviews with its commissioners and staff, participation in its national consultations, and a close reading of its internal procedural laws and published reports&mdash;this study investigates the role of moral values in influencing human behavior and mobilizing social movements.  The main competing moral traditions that were examined in the Tunisian context include: the Islamic tradition that gained more dominance with the rise of the Islamist Ennahda party to parliamentary power after the uprising, the leftist understanding of dignity as employment and access to the job market, and the international human rights discourse of dignity as recognition of past abuses embodied by the TDC and the international non-governmental organizations guiding its proceedings.  The collected data detailing how differential conceptions of dignity in Tunisia are used as moral grounds to legitimize certain models of militancy and disparage others will be further analyzed to identify the role of moral values in mobilizing the 2011 Arab Spring. The project will advance studies of national reconciliation processes, social movements, the local adjudication of human rights violations, and the changing role of women in the Middle East and North Africa.  Based on this fieldwork, the co-PI will complete a dissertation monograph, and will be presenting the research findings through teaching, public conferences, and research journals.
