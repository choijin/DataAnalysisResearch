<AbstractNarration>A question of considerable importance in science concerns the stability of solutions to equations that model systems of interest. A general form of the question asks: Given an approximate solution, is there necessarily also an exact solution that is close to the approximate solution? This question has been studied intensively in many directions, with answers depending on the specific system and the exact meaning of "approximate solution" and "close." The current research project develops such a theory for equations in sets of permutations. This case is of special interest for two reasons: Firstly, it can be interpreted as a "local testability" question, a subject of great interest in computer science. Namely, it is part of a series of problems of the following flavor: a very large string of letters is given, and one wants to check its properties by knowing only a few of the letters. A second reason is that it turns out that the question under study in this project is intimately related to some deep concepts in abstract algebra. It is thus a project of a very interdisciplinary nature, involving a blend of several areas of mathematics and computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the project deals with property testing within group theory. Property testing is a direction of research in computer science that looks for methods to check a property of a given object, say a long vector of 0's and 1's, by looking only at a small number of random bits of it.  The following question is of this type. Given a word w(X,Y) built from elements X and Y of the symmetric group of permutations on a set T, assume that for two permutations A and B, w(A,B) leaves unchanged some randomly selected elements of T. Can it be inferred that w(A,B) is the identity, or at least, that A and B are close to a pair of permutations A' and B' for which w(A',B') is the identity? It turns out that the answer to this question depends only on the structure of the (usually infinite) group whose presentation by generators and relations is given by these words. This suggests a concept of testability (or stability) in group theory. The main objective of this project is to develop a set of tools to determine which groups are testable and which are not. The project will also explore connections with amenability, Kazhdan's Property (T), and sofic groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[        Graphs are mathematical objects which are used in many applications most notably in computer science. They gives a visualisation to relations between pairs of objects. Among them stand out EXPANDER GRAPHS which are sparse graphs with a high degree of connectivity. In the last 5 decades it was realized that expander graphs   have numerous applications in computer science and in pure mathematics.     The current project studied high dimensional versions of these graphs. These simplical complexes ( or : hyper graphs) treat relations between more than just two elements at a time. While our study started from several pure mathematcial problems, very quickly it became clear that these objects are going to play also a role in computer science.  Of particular interest is their potential use for Error Correcting Codes and its mathematical counterpart: Stability theory.       Our work advanced significantly the theory of high dimensional expanders. We led a year long program on the subject in which a good number of post-doc's joined the community of people working in the area. This led to a very fruitful collaboration between pure mathematicians as computer scientists.        Beside answering sveral open problems ( including problems of Grothenieck and Borel; two of the giants of the 20th century mathematicians) we advanced two directions of research in which we belive our work have made a real breaktrough:        We provided  the first examples of non-approximated groups.       We proved a  "first order rigidity for high rank lattices" - a result that opened a new direction of research combining group theory and model theory.      Few PhD theises were written and a good number of young post-doc's were involved in our project.      We also gave a large number of public lecture around the globe. Most notable a plenary talk atthe ICM 2018 in Brazil.           Last Modified: 09/17/2020       Submitted by: Alexander Lubotzky]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
