<AbstractNarration>This proposal is for support of a travel to The ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing 2017 (SoCC) is the eighth in an established series of symposia that bring together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners interested in data services and cloud computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACM SoCC is today a dynamic and comprehensive program for publication, education, and interaction. Its program includes research and industrial papers, poster sessions, and keynote talks by leaders in academia and industry.  The scope of SoCC is broad and encompasses diverse data management and systems topics such as software as a service, virtualization, scalable cloud data services, and data management and analytics at scale. Many facets of systems and data management issues must be revisited in the context of cloud computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides a concrete opportunity to broaden participation. Funds will be dispersed with preference given to students who would not otherwise be able to attend the conference, paying particular attention to diversity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The annual ACM SIGMOD conference is a leading international forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, exchange techniques and tools, and share experiences. The conference is co-located with the PODS conference, which focuses on the theoretical aspects of data management.  Thanks to the generous support from the National Science Foundation, SIGMOD, Microsoft, and other sponsors, we will provide scholarship awards to selected students attending the SIGMOD/PODS conference. The scholarships will include financial support for traveling and conference registrations.  Each awardee will receive a stipend to partially cover the expense to attend the conference.  Awardees are expected to register to the main conference and will have to make their own arrangements for travel and accommodation.  The travel award is possible due to generous sponsorships by NSF, SIGMOD, Microsoft, and other sponsors. We may pass on student winners’ contact information to corporate sponsors. Applicants will be asked whether they opt-in to this option.  Applicants need to be a full-time student (undergraduate or graduate). Applicants also need to be a SIGMOD member at the time of receiving this award (to become a member of SIGMOD, you don’t need to be a member of the ACM &mdash; students can join SIGMOD for $10).  Applicants are eligible to apply for the SIGMOD travel award even if they have submissions under consideration at other award granting events, such as the Undergraduate Research Program, the Programming Contest, or the PhD Symposium. However, an applicant cannot receive more than one travel award in total.  Applicants do not need to have an accepted paper to be eligible. However, students who are primary authors of an accepted paper in the main conference or the workshops are especially encouraged to apply. Junior students without papers accepted for publication at SIGMOD/PODS, but involved in research closely related to the topics of the conference are also encouraged to apply. Applications from female and minority students are especially encouraged.  Students whose advisor cannot provide financial support to attend the conference will be given priority.
