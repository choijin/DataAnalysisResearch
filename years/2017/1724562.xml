<AbstractNarration>DePaul University proposes to host a meeting for National Science Foundation (NSF) aspiring Principal Investigators. The NSF released a new solicitation -- Computer Science for All: Researcher Practitioner Partnerships (CSforAl:RPP, NSF 17-525) -- in November of 2016. It requires that proposals be submitted by partnerships of education researchers and practitioners.  Schools, districts, and even entire states are working to implement CS education across their classrooms but few of them are involved in Researcher Practitioner Partnerships (RPPs).  In order to help teams of researchers and practitioners build appropriate partnerships and generate strong proposals, the NSF is funding a series of three regional, informational workshops to provide technical assistance to aspiring Principal Investigators.  This is the third of those workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops will connect researchers with practitioners in order to explore the ways they could work together and the kinds of research questions that their collaborations might address. The content of the meeting (funded under a separate proposal), is designed to generate interest in the value of RPPs in supporting new efforts in sustainable, equity-oriented CS education, advance understanding on the formation and maintenance of robust RPPs, and support teams in the development of appropriate RPP research questions and project designs that could result in benefits to both practice and theory. The Chicago workshop will host 125-150 participants covering their travel expenses and local arrangements.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this proposal was to support Dr. Pinkard and Dr. Dettori in hosting a technical workshop for NSF's new solicitation NSF 17-525 Computer Science for All Researcher-Practitioner Partnerships.  The workshop was designed to support potential applicants in both conceptually understanding and designing proposal to address the call for research-practice partnerships to support the CS for All initiative.  Through a series of interactive workshops facilitated by leading researchers in the field, the meeting provided an opportunity for the CS research and practice community to deepen their knowledge about research-practice partnerships. The format also allowed for several opportunites for potential teams to work together to begin to define a research problem to work on and lay the foundation for their proposal.  Attendees also had an opportunity to learn more about the specifics of the new solicitation through several panels involving NSF officers.  Finally, the workshop provided opportunities for attendees to meet potential research or practice collaborators for the current or future grant opportunities, and for teams from the same region to discuss how the individual projects might fit together.  The workshop was hosted in Chicago on January 27-28 and saw the participation of 138 individuals. Attendees came from 68 different organizations and represented  39 potential RPP teams.
