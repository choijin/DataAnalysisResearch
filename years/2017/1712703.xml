<AbstractNarration>As computer technology becomes increasingly pervasive in all aspects of our lives, it becomes critical for the researchers who develop algorithms to work closely with the domain experts who have a deep understanding of the underlying systems.  The purpose of the NSF Algorithms in the Field (AitF) program is to fund collaborations between theoretical computer scientists with other computing researchers.  Via this meeting, the program is providing an opportunity for its principal investigators to share and discuss their latest advances, demonstrate technical accomplishments, and inform NSF on promising future research directions.  The technical program agenda will highlight the contributions of the participating NSF divisions and address the research themes of the AitF program.  Student researchers will also attend and present their work.  This provides a valuable training opportunity and will contribute to the foundation for an enduring AitF research community.</AbstractNarration>

A  meeting of the principal investigators (PIs) was convened in order to  facilitate exchange of information between projects and to foster  creative thinking about career paths for graduate students engaged in  this cross-disciplinary work. The  PI meeting included representatives from 25 of 28 funded projects.   Talks were held on March 30 and 31 of 2017.  Many graduate students  were in attendance and many of the presentations were given by graduate  students.  In addition, there was a panel where NSF officers discussed  the future of AitF at the NSF.       Last Modified: 02/08/2018       Submitted by: Sucheta Soundarajan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
