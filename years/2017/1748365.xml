<AbstractNarration>This research project investigates a new class of heterogeneous catalysts for the selective hydrogenation reactions of light hydrocarbons to higher-value chemical intermediates of value to the petrochemical industry. Selectivity refers to the ability of a catalyst to favor one product over another when multiple products are possible. As such, it is possible to control selectivity by changing the surface composition of a catalyst. This research project investigates a class of inorganic solids, intermetallic compounds, that have ordered assemblies of small metal clusters of various size and composition.  These intermetallic compounds have potential as highly selective catalysts for important hydrocarbon hydrogenation reactions. Computational studies and experiment studies are being combined to identify catalyst compositions that display both high catalytic activity and high selectivity toward the desired products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crystallographically well-defined intermetallic compounds are being utilized to understand the impact of catalytically-active metal atom nuclearity on catalytic selectivity. Intermetallic compounds are being synthesized with varying compositions across the gamma-brass phase to control both nuclearity and the number of clusters. Intermetallics of the form M-Zn (M = Pd, Cu and Ag) have been carefully chosen since they contain contiguous cluster sizes of catalytic metal from monomers to hexamers. M-Zn bulk intermetallics are being examined for partial hydrogenation reactions of mixed feedstocks (alkyne plus alkene and alkene plus aromatic). The results will demonstrate the impact of cluster size on catalyst selectivity. The results can be used to identify selective cluster sizes for hydrogenation that will then become targets for synthesis in a high surface area nanoparticle form. The study is being conducted in collaboration with an industrial partner (ExxonMobil) who provides access to synchrotron-based X-ray absorption catalyst characterization tools, while also delivering industrially-relevant guidance to the graduate students involved in the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A combination of experimental and computational catalysis techniques demonstrated the usefulness of intermetallics in elucidating active site requirements for adding hydrogen to specific chemical functionalities.  Hydrogenation reactions are used in petroleum refining and chemical synthesis to produce useful fuels and chemicals.  The ability to selectivity target specific functionalities can lead to process simplification and greater material and energy efficiency in processing.  Intermetallic catalysts, which combine multiple metal atom types in a well-defined structure, can be used to tailor the composition and structure of catalytic active sites.  In this project, we have demonstrated that subtle tuning of the relative concentration of palladium or zinc in intermetallics can be used to expose catalytic sites that isolate single Pd atoms or Pd3 trimers, surrounded by Zn atoms.  Zn serves as an inactive host to distribute these isolated Pd sites.  These isolated Pd or Pd3 trimers were then probed for their ability to serve as active sites for hydrogenation of different chemicals.  Isolated single Pd atoms were determined to be unable to hydrogenate C-C double bonds, whereas Pd3 trimer sites could add hydrogen to C-C double bonds.  Both single Pd atom and Pd3 trimer sites could add hydrogen to C-C triple bonds.  This difference in functionality was used to demonstrate that isolated Pd atoms could selectively hydrogenate the C-C triple bond in acetylene to form ethylene, without adding hydrogen to ethylene present in the same stream.  The ability to selectively hydrogenate acetylene is important to the process of polyethylene synthesis, as small amounts of acetylene present in the ethylene feed to this process will poison catalysts.  Beyond the Pd-Zn bimetallic systems, the ability to synthesize isolated Pd-M-Pd (M=Cu, Ag, Au) active was demonstrated, and the composition of these sites was able to be tuned to modulate catalytic rates and selectivities to desired products.
