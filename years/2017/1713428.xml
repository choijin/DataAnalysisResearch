<AbstractNarration>This ChangeMakers project builds on a 2016 National Academies report finding that scientific literacy can be understood at a community level as opposed to a traditional focus on the individual. This is important since scientific knowledge is often seen as abstract and distant from the daily concerns of average citizens. A community focus shifts the spotlight away from individual learning to collective learning facilitated by trusted cultural institutions serving as social assets. This work brings together scientific expertise and community organizations to advance operational science literacy--scientific ways of problem-solving--for community leaders and functional science literacy--information and skills people can use in their daily lives--among their service populations. This will be done by gathering and sharing knowledge and developing skills and abilities to contribute to the community's overall well-being. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New England Aquarium (NeAq) and Aquarium of the Pacific (AoP) will apply a community engagement model involving active listening, documentation, alignment of concerns and goals, and co-development of shared solutions that serves the needs of all participants. As part of the Advancing Community Science Literacy (ACSL) project, multi-disciplinary teams from NeAq, AoP and their regional partners will participate in training on the model. They will apply that training to build and implement action plans to advance community-driven responses to local environmental issues. Teams will be assessed with respect to how they use tools from their shared training, along with peer support and coaching, to make progress in engaging diverse community stakeholders. Results of the evaluation will offer insights and recommendations for informal science learning centers to serve their communities more effectively as engagement facilitators and change agents to support science literacy development and action. By applying techniques developed for cultural institutions to communicate about climate science, and combining those with techniques developed for libraries and other organizations to help meet emergent community concerns, such as storm surges and coastal flooding, it is possible to redefine the role informal science learning centers can play as part of a community culture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACSL is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program which supports projects that provide multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advances innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and develops understandings of deeper learning by participants.</AbstractNarration>

This capacity building program integraed strategic discourse &amp; community change theory as a new path for advancing community STEM literacies. The experiment pilot tested processe and monitoring tools&nbsp;that could bring partnerships between small non-profits working to address environmental justice and social disparities in areas threatened by climate change, and large aquariums that work to support informal STEM learning in their community. The project identified five strategies that can be explicity used to plan productive collaborations, and monitoring protocols to track progress toward co-created goals. In doing so, the project recognized the importance of addressing and working to align shared goals by exploring the asymmetries in mission, planing, funding, and competing priorities of community-based groups and large cultural institutions. The topic areas essential to success are summarized as:</p> <p><strong>Allocate Time to Build Relationships: </strong>Effective team work is required for senior parties in all partners to negotiate asymmetrical resources, power, and authority. The work requires authentic, inclusive, and thoughtful participation over at least one year of meetings, including shared project workshops, social engagement between leaders of these institutions, and budgetary process alignments.</p> <p><strong>Develop a Shared Definition of Resilience: </strong>The topics for this project demonstrated that ecological and social resilience represent different conceptual models when viewed through an organization?s mission. By focusing on the phenomenological experience of people living in ecologically vulnerable areas and the co-morbidities of low socio-economic status, historical racial inequities, and below average educational attainment, collaborative programming that focused on connectedness of human and environmental goals laid the foundation for productive co-programming and power sharing.</p> <p>&nbsp;<strong>Situate Community Aspirations as Context for STEM Learning: </strong>By focusing on community aspirations, a new power-sharing collaborative laid the foundations for highly engaging co-programming that drove interest in learning about the local ecology and how human actions can adversely or positively affect them. The community organizing approach helped situate the literacy advancement in meaningful action. In this case, the ISLCs, role moved to a supporting position, leveraging expertise as a complement that of community partners.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Redefine ISLCs? Role as Service not Destination: </strong>ISLC?s have the opportunity to leverage their trusted status in the local context by refocusing on organizing and supporting local social action organizations. This process helps staff at the ISLCs build cultural competencies that are not part of traditional training in informal learning intepretation. The project demonstrated that community organizing is a new field of study and practice for ISLC?s that requires, training, and preparation to develop proficiency it.</p> <p><strong>Commit to Transparency and Equity in Funding: </strong>The asymmetries in organizational resources require negotiation. Small local community action organizations rely heavily on volunteerism and social networking, but tend to be driven by funding to meet their social purpose. Without clear funding to support the community development and training meetings, local non-profits tend to distrust the larger ISLC, or divert their attention toother programs when funding becomes available. Transparency in funding and allocation of costs to offset community partnership development is essential to maintaining an effective collaboration.</p> <p>At the conclusion of the project, the team had developed the structural and organizational principles for managing asymmetrical partnerships, and monitoring tools that could assess a long term experiment.
