<AbstractNarration>This Noyce Capacity Building project at Southern Methodist University (SMU) focuses on helping to meet the need for secondary mathematics teachers in the Dallas area. This project aims to build capacity for a future Noyce Track 1 Scholarship program at SMU that will recruit and prepare locally-rooted mathematics teachers for placement in high-need schools within the Dallas Independent School District.  By collaborating with Dallas County Community College District (DCCCD), this project seeks to create a dual-enrollment recruitment program that prepares student scholars for dual degrees in Mathematics and Educational Studies at SMU. The project includes a collaboration with staff from the Budd Center, a unit of SMU's School of Education focused on bringing together educational non-profits in West Dallas.  This collaboration aims to facilitate student immersion in West Dallas throughout the program. The project will also work with representatives from Dallas Independent School District to make successful placements and provide ongoing support of the student scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will work to create a circular pipeline through which local students attending DCCCD would attend SMU, participate in a community-focused training program, and then return to teach in high-need schools in their home communities. As DCCCD has a highly diverse student body, this project also seeks to enhance the diversity of teachers in the Dallas-area. The project aims to educate and support the student scholars so that they will be well prepared to teach in the area schools and be more likely to stay in those schools. This influx of locally-rooted teachers could fill a need for committed mathematics teachers, especially teachers of color, in Dallas Independent School District. This project aims to develop a pipeline program for developing mathematics teachers that could be implemented in new communities in the Dallas area that have shortages of well-trained mathematics teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of the project was to design a scholarship program to recruit students from Dallas County Community College District (DCCCD), continue preparing them at Southern Methodist University (SMU), and support those mathematics teachers as they begin teaching in high need schools.  As part of our capacity building efforts, we conducted research on DCCCD student interest levels, mathematics preparation, and financial needs. These data indicate that a significant pool of potential SMU Noyce Scholars exists within the DCCCD system, but a successful program at SMU must (1) find ways to strengthen students' mathematical foundations through accelerated mathematics pathways (relative to DCCCD norms), and (2) bring down the cost of an otherwise desirable degree (relative to local alternatives). These two findings have significantly informed the design of our program.  In a significant component of our capacity-building efforts, we collaborated with SMU's Transfer and Transition Services and DCCCD's Transfer and Articulation Services departments, to create a Mathematics Education Pathway that guides DCCCD students in their course selection as students at DCCCD and at SMU.  The final significant piece of the capacity building was the re-design of coursework for pre-service mathematics teachers to strengthen preparation and facilitate graduation. The mathematics department undertook a major revision to accommodate double majors from across campus. We created a simpler and more flexible Bachelor of Arts degree, intended to house all of our double-majors by allowing two math-intensive courses from external departments to count toward a B.A. in mathematics.  In the department of teaching and learning we are leveraging existing mathematics-specific masters coursework to design and co-list undergraduate mathematics-specific education coursework.  We carried out extensive curriculum mapping to ensure that the new courses would still adequately prepare preservice teachers. Finally, because of the mathematics-specificity of the new courses, and the re-design of the mathematics major, students will now be able to count two of these courses toward their mathematics major, which will ease the burden of a double-major in mathematics and educational studies.  We are now in the stage of working to secure scholarship funding to support our efforts to recruite DCCCD students to attend SMU.  We will utilize the new degree plans in the meantime, but in order to recruit significant numbers of DCCCD students to SMU, we need additional scholarship money.
