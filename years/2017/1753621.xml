<AbstractNarration>Plants adapt to their soil environment through changes in patterns of root growth and chemical composition, which influence how plants take up nutrients and water. Poor understanding of how roots respond to stress is an obstacle to understanding plant responses to environmental change. In addition, how quickly roots decompose affects how nutrients are recycled from dead root tissues, which can further influence plant growth. However, current models of root decomposition are based on what is known about the breakdown of aboveground parts of plants, like leaves and stems. Furthermore, little is known about how root chemistry varies with local soil conditions which limits understanding of how plants respond to nutrient poor soils, or how this in turn influences soil nutrient recycling. This research will study how soil conditions and microbes influence root chemistry of important forest tree species in eastern North America. Results of this research will also improve models of root decomposition by incorporating root chemical composition. This project will also provide several benefits to society. It will create workshops for high school students and a summer course and curriculum development materials for K-12 teachers. It will also provide training for undergraduates, graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fine roots (less than 2mm diameter) have a disproportionately large influence on plant adaptation and key ecosystem processes, yet they remain one of the least understood components of Terrestrial Biosphere Models. Commonly used parameters, such as element ratios, that predict decomposition of aboveground tissues fail to adequately predict the decomposition of fine roots. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that this disconnect is due to the unique chemical construction of roots, which is shaped by their immediate biotic and abiotic soil environments. The PIs propose to investigate the chemical plasticity in fine roots of different tree species developed under different soil resource availabilities and associations with different species of mycorrhizal fungi. The PIs will link observed chemical plasticity to decomposition dynamics of fine roots using decomposition experiments and by utilizing advanced imaging and spectroscopy techniques. The PIs propose to develop parameters that incorporate root chemistry to improve predictions of fine-root decomposition. The proposed project would be one of the first attempts to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular-level chemical profile of fine-roots that facilitate plant stress adaptation, and to develop robust parameters to predict fine-root decomposition and soil organic matter formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>There is growing recognition that much of the long-term carbon that is present in soil comes not from aboveground plant litter inputs (i.e. leaves), but from belowground plant litter inputs (i.e. roots). Better understanding the ecological factors that control the decomposition of roots is critical to predicting how much carbon soils can hold under changing environmental conditions. In this research, we examined a range of plant traits that influence the speed at which roots decay at local and global scales. Using a meta-analysis approach, we found that root decomposition is strongly influenced by both temperature and precipitation at global scales, with roots decaying faster in hotter and wetter locations overall. At global scales, there were also a number of chemical traits that were important; roots with higher nitrogen and phosphorus content decomposed more quickly than those with higher lignin content. These chemical traits has similar effects at local scales. Unlike previous work, we found no relationship between root calcium content and decomposition rate at either global or local scales. Additionally, our work identified a new pattern at global scales; different fungal symbiotic associations were strongly associated with different rates of root decomposition. Specifically, we found that ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal roots decomposed significantly slower than arbuscular mycorrhizal roots. Unlike leaf decomposition, we found that woodiness was also a key trait driving root decomposition rate, being slower for more woody roots. Overall, our results suggest the chemical drivers of fine root decomposition parallel those of leaf decomposition, but that the best plant functional groups for predicting fine root decomposition (i.e. mycorrhizal type and woodiness) differ from those predicting leaf decomposition.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/24/2021<br>      Modified by: Peter&nbsp;Kennedy</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1753621/1753621_10533745_1624545055882_ScreenShot2021-06-24at9.29.11AM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1753621/1753621_10533745_1624545055882_ScreenShot2021-06-24at9.29.11AM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Effects of plant functional group on fine root decomposition"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1753621/1753621_10533745_1624545055882_ScreenShot2021-06-24at9.29.11AM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Effects of plant functional group on fine root decomposition"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Natural log of response ratios comparing fine root decomposition across various plant functional groups based on growth form, mycorrhizal type, leaf lifespan of woody plants and plant life cycle of herbaceous species.
