<AbstractNarration>This study will investigate whether pair programming, a collaborative form of programming in which two students work side-by-side on one computer, impacts the performance and retention of students with learning disabilities (LD) in computing courses. Growing post-secondary enrollment of students with LD has created a commensurate need for research on accessibility and success for students with LD in higher education. Students with LD who set out to pursue careers in computing often struggle with computing courses and abandon career pathways that would provide rewarding job opportunities. Pair programming has been used successfully with students without disabilities in computing courses. It has increased learning, decreased frustration, and reduced the confidence gap between male and female students while improving the confidence of all students. However, little research has examined the pair interaction involving students with LD. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project serves to develop and diversify the nation's computing workforce. To study pair interaction, participants will be engaged in collaborative problem solving.  Students enrolled in introductory information technology and programming classes will be randomly assigned to course sections that serve as control or experimental groups. Students in the experimental group will be trained in effective pair programming as well as how to fill the role of driver, the one who writes or types in the code, and navigator or observer, the one who reviews each line of code as it is entered and considers the strategic direction of the work. Partners will complete ten programming activities with two different partners, switching their roles (driver/navigator) every ten minutes. Researchers will observe and record participants' interactions. Data collection will include pre- mid- and post-test questionnaires to measure participants' programming experience, programming self-efficacy, attitude and motivation toward programming. Student learning outcomes will be measured through programming exercises, assignments, and midterm/final exam grades. A focus group will be held during the last class meeting in which participants will be encouraged to share their experiences. Open-ended answers to survey questions, focus group interview responses, and observation notes will be analyzed using qualitative analysis methods. Quantitative data will be analyzed using multivariate general linear models to compare groups. Research results have the potential to be applied in teaching high-school and middle-school students and used in K-12 settings to support students with LD or those who approach learning differently, increasing the likelihood that they will follow the path to computing careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Report  What are the major goals of the project?  This study investigates whether pair programming, a collaborative form of programming in which two students work side-by-side on one computer, impacts the performance and retention of students with learning disabilities (LD) in computing courses.   What was accomplished under these goals (you must provide information for at least one of the 4 categories below)?  Major Activities:  The data collection part of the pair programming project started in summer 2018 and ened in fall 2020.  Forty-eight (48) classes participated in the project; among them 34 sections were in the experimental group, and 14 were in the control group.  A total of 798 students participated in the pair programming experiments completed 10 pair programming exercises.   We collected data from forty-three (43) undergraduate students with LD and about 755 students without LD.   All students were asked to complete pre, mid and post surveys that assessed participant's programming experiences, programming self-efficacy, and attitude and motivation toward programming.    Specific Objectives:  The specific objective of the study is to help professionals understand whether pair programming is beneficial to students with LD as well as student partners without disabilities.  Significant Results:  Preliminary findings suggest that students as a whole value pair programming in the computer classroom and via virtual teaching during the pandemic season. While computing self-efficacy improved over time, attitudes toward pair programming remained stable. Nascent evidence indicates that pair programming processes work equally as well for students with and without LD.  Key outcomes or other achievements:  Preliminary findings indicate that pair programming is an equally effective intervention for students with LD as it is for students who do not have LD.    During the COVID-10 pandemic season, we developed innovative procedures and pedagogy to teach pair programming via Zoom breakout rooms in a social-distancing learning environment.  The results of our innovative approach to facilitate pair programming online were reported in a peer-reviewed journal article.     What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?  We provided a workshop on May 18, 2021.

Impacts  What is the impact on the development of the principal discipline(s) of the project?  There is a great need to improve the college experience in computing courses for students with LD. Authorities in the field of education have indicated that supportive learning environments should be created to promote active learning, collaboration, and mastery of skills. Our project will have a direct impact on computing education involving disciplines of computer science and information technology.     What is the impact on other disciplines?  The results of the project will have an impact on STEM education and disability education and will help improve teaching for students with learning disabilities.     What is the impact on the development of human resources?  The project has improved the learning and programming performance of students with LD, and helped STEM teachers better understand the needs of students with LD and create a more inclusive classroom.
