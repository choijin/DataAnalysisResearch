<AbstractNarration>The 14 November 2016 M 7.8 Kaikoura Earthquake in New Zealand triggered thousands of landslides, blocked major highways and destroyed rail system infrastructure, leaving 1000 residents and tourists trapped in the seaside town of Kaikoura. This event and the investigator's previous research and sampling in the region presents a rare opportunity to study erosion associated with widespread landslides that occur at the same time as major earthquakes. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will examine the erosion associated with these landslides using modern geological techniques. It will enhance international collaboration between the US and New Zealand and involve three graduate students in the scientific research process. The project is led by an early career female investigator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address the following questions of relevance to the geomorphology and geochronology communities: 1) What effect does coseismic landsliding have on detrital cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) derived basin wide erosion rates? and 2) What is the contribution of periodic but widespread coseismic landslides to erosional mass flux in tectonically active mountain belts such as the Kaikoura Ranges? The principal investigator and her team will address these questions by doing repeat detrital 10Be CRN measurements in six drainages shaken by the earthquake. These samples will be used to examine basin-wide erosion rates following extensive coseismic landsliding. Landsliding is predicted to complicate detrital CRN measurements of basin wide erosion rates. This study will circumvent this complication by constraining erosion rates before (with previously collected samples) and directly following a large earthquake (to be sampled this January 2017).</AbstractNarration>

We addressed these questions by doing repeat detrital 10Be cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) measurements in five river basins shaken by the earthquake to variable degrees. Samples were collected over four different field campaigns: pre-earthquake (2013/2015), immediately post-earthquake (2017), and the two years following (2018, 2019) to get a sense of the full pre and post-event landscape evolution.  Our preliminary findings indicate that at least two of the five river basins appear to have a strong signal in the CRN values post-earthquake and one river basin appears to be unaffected by the earthquake perturbation. The two basins that appear most affected have the highest mountain relief, closest proximity to faults that slipped during the earthquake (i.e. experienced the strongest shaking), and the most landslides. These same basins also show anomalously high erosion rates pre-earthquake. The calculated pre-earthquake erosion rates are much higher than the long-term average for the same sites and are unrealistic for any place on Earth. This result indicates that these basins were significantly influenced by landslides, which alter apparent erosion rates, that must have been prevalent even before the great seismic event of 2016.   Results from this study show that landslides are a dominant erosional force over the entire earthquake cycle, including in between strong shaking events, in parts of the mountain range where a threshold in slope or relief has been exceeded.
