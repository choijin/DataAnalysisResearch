<AbstractNarration>In this project, investigators participating in the 2015 U.S. GEOTRACES Arctic expedition will measure the concentrations of iron, manganese, zinc, copper, cadmium, and nickel from a variety of seawater and ice samples in the Western Arctic Ocean.  These are commonly referred to as 'micronutrients' because they are present in the ocean in extremely low concentrations and because they are essential for marine organisms.  In common with other national initiatives in the International GEOTRACES Program, the goals of the U.S. Arctic expedition are to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. Some trace elements are essential to life, others are known biological toxins, and still others are important because they can be used as tracers of a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the sea. The six trace elements to be measured in this study are arguably the most important bioactive trace elements in the oceans, and their measurement will provide key information on biological and physical processes in the Arctic. This project will be carried out under the direction of a postdoctoral researcher, providing a unique professional development opportunity for an early career scientist. In addition, the research will involve the training of an undergraduate researcher, and provide public outreach opportunities to K-12 teachers and students, and indigenous populations in Alaska.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six micronutrients to be measured under this project have all been identified as key trace elements for the GEOTRACES Program. This research will allow rigorous testing of the Arctic physical and biological processes, many of which are already undergoing fundamental changes as a result of climate change, that control the inputs and fate of key micronutrient metals in the Arctic Ocean. Colloidal distributions are specifically targeted in order to derive additional information on the unique physicochemical form and reactivity of distinct dissolved metal pools. The project will also explore the role of melting sea ice in driving near-surface concentrations of these elements by measuring concentrations and size partitioning of these six metals in sea ice, snow, melt ponds, and in the seawater immediately under sea ice. Given that the Arctic is a relatively small basin surrounded by broad continental shelves, sedimentary sources and sinks will also play a major role in controlling the distributions of these elements. Thus, metal concentrations in porewater samples from bottom sediments will also be determined from cores in the Bering and Chukchi Seas, in order to investigate benthic exchanges.</AbstractNarration>
