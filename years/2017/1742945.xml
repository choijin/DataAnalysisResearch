<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The Fourteenth International Meeting on Ferroelectricity (IMF2017) is being held Sept. 4-8, 2017, at San Antonio, Texas, USA.  It is the first time this series of international meeting is being hosted at San Antonio and sponsored/organized by a Hispanic Serving Institute. Special attempts are made in order to enhance the students' participation from underrepresented institutes and from countries of growing economies. The meeting is to be attended by researchers coming from more than 50 different countries and regions, including substantial participation of researchers from South American countries. A significant number of attendees will be students and a substantial number of the attendees are women.  The meeting will publicize materials research worldwide and bring positive impact to student/postdoctoral participants by broadening their networks, career pathways and expanding their collaboration opportunities.  A successful IMF2017 meeting will publicize and accelerate research in the field of ferroelectrics which heightens competitiveness and brings broad impact in advanced electronic devices and technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: The IMF meeting series provides a platform to bring together researchers from academia, industry and government laboratories to share their latest knowledge in the field and to present the development of novel applications of ferroelectricity in various interdisciplinary and cross-coupled research areas. The conference provides an inclusive and cumulative understanding of the many novel emerging ferroic and multiferroic materials. The major themes and drivers of this premier meeting have been to present/explore the recent developments enabling a new understanding of ferroelectricity, various new materials design and novel materials synthesis approaches, and advances in the field that bring out novel, emerging, and cross-coupled effects among various materials including semiconductor, magnetic and biological materials.</AbstractNarration>

(A)&nbsp; To attract broad participation of researchers in this field, with wide representation of countries, expertise, and from different research and educational background, as well as different economic development stages. Participation of women researchers was especially encouraged.&nbsp; (B) &nbsp;To provide an international platform to share extensive and cumulative understanding of a large family of novel ferroic materials, to disseminate recent discoveries, to explore/expand frontier of the ferroic research, and to stimulate collaboration in the ferroic materials research community. &nbsp;(C) Publish peer reviewed papers selected from submitted manuscripts presented at the IMF2017, in archival/flagship journal of the ferroelectric research (International Journal of Ferroelectrics) to document the research achievement and to add to the knowledge base serving the broader materials research community.</p> <p>More than 300 registered attendees participated in the IMF2017, out of &gt;500 authors for 417 oral/poster papers in the meeting program. The registered attendees are from some 50 countries and regions, representing various universities, research organizations and institutes. Among the registered participants, more than 20% of the attendees are women scientists/researchers in the related materials research field. Also among the registered participants, more than 25% are student participants, one of the highest in the IMF meeting history. Among the student participants, some 28% are female students.&nbsp; 417 presentations including plenary, invited, contributed and poster papers were delivered in 35 full sessions, covering a broad interests and application areas of ferroelectricity, from dielectric, piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties and the theory on phase transitions and critical phenomenon, to novel applications and device concepts using various ferroics, multiferroics, bio-multiferroics, and cross-coupled phenomena. The selected and accepted papers after critical review process are being published in Special Volumes of International Journal of Ferroelectrics in 2018.</p> <p>Broader Impact: A special session &lsquo;Women at the Frontiers of Ferroelectrics&rsquo; were also organized to recognize the growing participation of women researchers in the research field. The meeting also organized a special plenary memorial session in honor of late Prof L. Eric Cross, Dr. Jan Fousek and Prof. Hans Schmid, in recognition of their lifelong dedication and contribution to ferroic research. &nbsp;During the IMF2017 a special discussion among representatives of North, Central, and South Americas was held and an agreement reached to launch &lsquo;Ferroelectric Meeting of Americas (FMAs)&rsquo;. It will help enhancing the exposure and collaboration in the field of ferroelectricity for the countries of Americas.&nbsp; The IMF2017 provided more than 70 student attendees both the future research directions to work on and network opportunities with senior researchers and leaders in the field.&nbsp; The organizational effort expanded the UTSA faculty collaboration in interdisciplinary research field. &nbsp;The meeting also enhances the visibility of UTSA, a Hispanic Serving Institute, on its scientific research and graduate education to the domestic and international materials research community in the field. &nbsp;The conference also introduced the meeting attendees to southern Texas culture, through a sponsored cultural showcase on the Riverwalk and by an organized visit to the Institute of Texan Culture; both brought positive perspectives of the host city San Antonio to the world.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/09/2018<br>      Modified by:
