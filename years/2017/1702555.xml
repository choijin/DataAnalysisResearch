<AbstractNarration>The next generation of communication networks is predicted to provide an Internet of Things (IoT) interconnecting up to 1 trillion sensors, products, machines, and devices by 2022.  This research addresses the critical problem of security in these important emerging networks. Due to the limited capability of typical IoT terminals, the strict delay requirements of anticipated real-time IoT applications, and the broadcast nature of wireless channels, this project investigates physical layer and low complexity cryptographic methods to prevent eavesdroppers from gaining access to IoT data. IoT terminals will often communicate via short messages, requiring new theory beyond the existing theory based on infinitely long messages. Since inference takes a central role in IoT systems, this research focuses on inference-based metrics. This project enables student training at the three participating universities, organization of workshops at major conferences, and development of course materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on very recent work by the members of the project team, the team is developing bounds and approximations to fundamental performance indices in order to understand and design inferential networks based on short packet communications. To gain insight into large-scale inference networks, the team is investigating scaling laws for inferential performance which achieve optimum scaling behavior as one varies the ratio of the number of legitimate users to the number of eavesdroppers. New practical low-complexity cryptographic methods employing non-binary quantization, symbol flipping, channel state information and related approaches are under development and are expected provide significant advantages over existing methods of protecting IoT data. Distributed inference and learning methods that complement the developed approaches are also under development. Fast bootstrapping methods and low-complexity estimation, decision making and classification methods for distributed sensors in IoT are being derived as well.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project has made significant progress on developing fundamental theory showing how much information can be securely transferred while also achieving compression.  The project produced very important new results that build the theory in this area. The results show how to extend the theory of compression to cases where security is desired. The results show that if we secure only certain parts of the data, which is a very practical assumption, significant compression can still be achieved. The results could make their way into future textbooks on this topic so the research team is very proud of these results.  Secrecy by design is examined as an approach to information-theoretic secrecy. The main idea behind this approach is to design an information processing system from the ground up to be perfectly secure with respect to an explicit secrecy constraint describing exactly what information must be protected. The principle technical contributions are decomposition bounds that explicitly describe how much compression can be achieved given an explicit required level of security.  Using the problems of privacy and lossless compression as examples, the utility cost of applying secrecy by design is investigated. Privacy is studied in the setting of the privacy funnel function previously introduced in the literature and new bounds for the regime of zero information leakage are derived. For the problem of lossless compression, it is shown that strong information-theoretic guarantees can be achieved using a reduced secret key size and a quantifiable penalty on the compression rate.  The project has also made significant progress on the theory of security for Internet of Things (IoT) inference applications.   Our work provides significant understanding about the possible attacks on IoT inference systems, their impact and how to protect against them. The project has obtained fundamental theory, limits, and protection approaches in the distributed processing environments typical in IoT.  The project has classified all possible attacks, those of greatest impact and shown how to protect against these attacks.
