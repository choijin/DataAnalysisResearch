<AbstractNarration>In the last few decades, a deep and surprising interplay between the mathematical field of algebraic geometry and the physics of string theory has been discovered. Physical predictions have led to the construction of new numerical invariants which provide novel insights into the geometry of different spaces. These invariants, which were initially difficult to rigorously define and calculate, can now be accessed using methods from algebraic geometry and also symplectic geometry (the study of spaces similar to phase spaces that arise in classical mechanics).  Motivated by conjectures and intuition from mathematical physics, the principal investigator (PI) plans to study new classes of enumerative invariants, their general structure, and relations between different enumerative theories.  This project, while developing new tools and methods in algebraic geometry, has at its roots conjectures originating in theoretical physics.  As such the project will help elucidate and verify physical conjectures, thus furthering understanding in this field. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goal of enumerative geometry broadly is to study a space by counting subspaces of a certain type. Gromov-Witten theory, for instance, defines invariants of a smooth complex algebraic variety X which give approximate counts of the number of complex curves in X. Another theory, Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten (FJRW) theory, is defined similarly, but gives invariants of a singularity rather than a smooth variety. Predictions by Witten and other physicists studying mirror symmetry indicate that these invariants have a rich structure and are often related to each other in surprising ways.  The recent introduction of the concept of so-called Gauged Linear Sigma Models (GLSMs), which simultaneously generalize Gromov-Witten theory, FJRW theory and many others, has the potential to transform the current understanding of enumerative geometry. While giving a unified framework for many different theories, defining enumerative invariants for GLSMs may provide new methods for computing Gromov-Witten invariants--a longstanding goal in both physics and mathematics--and will clarify certain mysterious correspondences between different theories such as the crepant transformation conjecture and the Landau-Ginzberg/Calabi-Yau correspondence.  The PI will give a general algebro-geometric construction of enumerative invariants associated to GLSMs, and use this new construction to realize those applications described above. The PI will also develop new computational techniques in Gromov-Witten theory, explore the recursive structure of these invariants (as predicted by the Witten-Kontsevich Theorem and the Virasoro Conjecture), and prove new correspondences related to mirror symmetry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Enumerative geometry is a field of mathematics concerned with counting problems.  The goal is to probe the geometry of a space by counting how many subspaces lie within it that satisfy certain conditions.  Euclid's postulate that through any two points in the plane there is exactly one line may be viewed as the first result in this field.  A more difficult enumerative geometry question is, for instance, given four random lines in space, how many other lines intersect these four?  Although mathematicians have studied these types of questions for centuries, they are still notoriously difficult.  Current methods in this field require sophisticated modern mathematical machinery.  In the 1990's, a remarkable connection was discovered between enumerative geometry and the physics of string theory.  It turned out that mathematical counts of algebraic curves in a space gave information about the physics of that space.  Collaborations by mathematicians and physicists to fully understand this groundbreaking connection between centuries-old mathematical questions and cutting edge physics quickly led to advances in both fields.  In working to rigorously define the "curve counting invariants" being described by physicists, new mathematical theories such as Gromov--Witten theory were developed which revolutionized enumerative geometry.  String-theoretic considerations predicted a remarkable structure to these new invariants, one that was wholly unexpected from a mathematical viewpoint.  The effort to verify and formalize this structure is still underway.  While significant progress has been made in defining and understanding the curve counting invariants of a smooth space, in order to fully realize the scope of the connection between string theory and enumerative geometry, one must generalize these theories to more exotic geometric objects.  This has been accomplished for instance for spaces endowed with special symmetries (leading to orbifold Gromov--Witten theory), and for singularities (FJRW theory).  Yet another generalization of a smooth space is what is known as a Landau--Ginzburg model, which is simply of a space together with a function on that space known as a superpotential.  Due to pioneering work of Witten, we have come to realize that Landau--Ginzburg models can be used to represent many of the most important geometries appearing in mathematics and physics, and seem to be key to understanding crucial conjectures and open questions in the field.  Only recently, however, have mathematicians begun to understand the enumerative geometry of Landau--Ginzburg models.  The present project was centered around two complementary goals.  First, to develop new methods for defining and computing curve counting invariants for Landau--Ginzburg models.  Second, to apply Landau--Ginzburg models and their curve counting invariants to better understand open questions in enumerative geometry and mathematical physics.  Much of these open questions are centered around understanding how changing the shape of a space affects the counts of curves in that space.    Over the course of this project, we succeeded in providing the first full construction of curve counting invariants for a class of Landau--Ginzburg models known as hybrid models.  Hybrid models are of particular importance to this story because they simultaneously generalizes singularities as well as many smooth spaces of interest to physicists.  Based on the physical intuition afforded by Landau--Ginzburg models, we also addressed several longstanding conjectures in enumerative geometry.  We proved new correspondence results relating the curve counting invariants of different spaces, showing precisely how, for specified types of geometric modifications, the corresponding invariants are affected.  These questions are of significant interest in physics, where they translate into questions of how the shape of our universe impacts physical calculations.  Finally, the project culminated in a new method for computing certain curve counting invariants for a large class of Landau--Ginzburg models known as gauged linear sigma models.  These computations show that the enumerative invariants of gauged linear sigma models have a rich recursive structure, similar to that first discovered almost 30 years ago in the counts of curves in smooth spaces.
