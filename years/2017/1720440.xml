<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the development of efficient, stable and accurate numerical algorithms for gradient flow systems which are ubiquitous in modeling of real-world phenomena. It is expected that the research will not only lead to efficient numerical algorithms for a class of problems of current interests, but also contribute to better understandings of some fundamental issues in materials science, biotechnology, and other related fields through numerical simulations. This project will also provide opportunities for the involved graduate and undergraduate students to learn critical skills of computational and applied mathematics and to develop state-of-the-art numerical algorithms for science and engineering applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The free energies of gradient flow systems usually consist of various nonlinear potentials formulated in diverse complex formats which present a major challenge in the construction of efficient and accurate time discretization schemes. The project aims at overcoming this challenge by using a flexible and robust IEQ approach that enables one to develop time discretization schemes for a large class of gradient flow systems. The goals of this proposal are three folds: (i) to develop a unified numerical framework of time-marching schemes for solving general gradient flow models with high nonlinearity; (ii) to develop efficient numerical schemes for a number of challenging gradient flow models of current interests (e.g., nonlinear coupled multivariable models, nonlocal models, anisotropic models, nonlinear coupled systems that follow various physical principles, tensor based liquid crystal models); (iii) to investigate some fundamental issues of viscoelastic drops on substrates and active liquid crystal droplets using the developed predictive numerical tools. The proposed schemes will lead to numerical predictive tools that extend the capability of mathematical and experimental analysis, and contribute to better understanding of some pressing science and engineering issues related to multi-phase complex fluids.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goals of this award were to  develop efficient, stable and accurate numerical algorithms for a class of gradient  systems, and to apply them for solving some challenging problems arising in materials science and fluid mechanics.    The main contribution of this project was the   development of a new  unified framework,  the so called Scalar Auxiliary Variable (SAV) approach,  for developing efficient and robust schemes for a large class of gradient flows. This unified framework leads to numerical schemes that are very efficient, easy to implement,  enjoy many other advantages, and are applicaple to  a large class of complex nonlinear systems. This approach has already  received much attention and  inspired a significant number of followup investigations.  The PI applied this framework to develop efficient and robust numerical schemes for various challenging systems arising from materials science and fluid mechanics.   The algorithms developed in this project  provided capabilities to numerically solving challenging problems arising from emerging engineering and scientific applications, and the numerical simulations carried out in this project contributed towards better understandings of some complex physical and mathematical problems.  This project also provided valuable opportunities for the involved graduate students to learn critical skills of applied and computational mathematics, and laid a solid foundation for them to pursue a career in STEM fields.
