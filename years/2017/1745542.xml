<AbstractNarration>This project is to support the Space Environment Effects and Science Workshop September 5-8, 2017 at the Department of Commerce facility in Boulder, CO. This workshop brings together two groups for whom increased collaboration is important - the engineers from IEEE radiation and plasma effects community and space environment research scientists. This workshop will focus on the effects of space weather on space and launch systems. The goal is to establish effective communication between the research community and the end-users with a goal of developing further requirements for space environment climate and forecasting models. This workshop addresses the goals of the National Space Weather Action plan to further develop the research to operations and operations to research linkages.</AbstractNarration>

The meeting was advertised to the engineering community in person at conferences and team meetings.   SEESAW is a unique opportunity to bring together two diverse groups that have no regular venue for interaction.  These two groups are (a) the IEEE radiation and plasma effects community, who are concerned with design and operation of launch and space vehicle systems, and (b) the community of space environment researchers who study and model the radiation and plasma environment near Earth. Workshop topics included:  Identification of space radiation and plasma      environment models, tools, and data that may be used for design, anomaly      analysis, etc. with little modification. Interaction between environment researchers and      potential users in the broader space community Improved alignment of environmental research priorities      with societal needs through greater awareness Development and communication of requirements for space      environment climate and forecasting models.   About 70 scientists and engineers met to discuss needs and capabilities, and to establish working relationships for future collaboration. Approximately 50 presentations were given, and most of them can be found on-line at https://cpaess.ucar.edu/meetings/2017/seesaw-presentations.
