<AbstractNarration>Recent research by the investigator on clays that kill human pathogens, including antibiotic resistant strains like methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), has documented their common characteristics. Worldwide, only 5-10 % of clays studied to date are antibacterial when hydrated and tested in vitro. Most antibacterial clays are from hydrothermally altered volcanics, where volcanogenic fluids produce minerals containing reduced metals. Ferruginous illite-smectite (I-S) is the most common clay mineral, although kaolins dominate some samples. Antibacterial clay mineral assemblages may also contain non-clay reduced Fe-minerals (e.g., pyrite) that oxidize, causing damage to cell membranes and intracellular proteins. The key is that the clay mineral assemblage buffers the hydration water to pH and Eh conditions that release metals critical to the antibacterial process, allowing interaction with the bacteria. Antibacterial clays also exchange structural ions with the bacterial membrane that weaken bacterial defenses. This research will take this new understanding of the antibacterial process, to the next level by testing their effect on biofilms. Infectious diseases in humans commonly form biofilms, which are communities of bacteria more resistant to antibiotics than the "free floating" bacterial suspensions tested. The effectiveness of antibacterial clay on biofilms is an important step in supporting the costly testing of the bactericidal effect in animal trials. If antibacterial clay is effective against biofilms, in vivo testing may lead to design of new treatments for antibiotic resistant bacteria, with potential applications in wound dressings, medical implants (joint replacements, catheters), animal feed stocks, agricultural pathogens, and production of antibacterial building materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific goal of this research is to document the effect of an antibacterial clay previously tested against a broad spectrum of planktonic human pathogens, on biofilms most common to infectious diseases. In collaboration with infectious disease researchers at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN), the investigator will develop protocols for the application of clays to biofilms and evaluate conditions that lead to, or limit, their antibacterial activity. Clinical isolates of common and antibiotic resistant bacterial strains will be tested. The investigator has demonstrated that antibacterial clays release metals (Aluminum, Iron) that act together to damage cell membranes and intracellular proteins so they will monitor the interaction of these metals with the biofilms. Standard methods for testing antibiotics must be modified for testing natural clay because the minerals, while releasing metals, are not completely dissolved and therefore will affect spectroscopic evaluations of bacterial viability. Furthermore, the investigator found that metal speciation in various growth media affect results by limiting metal reactivity with bacteria. Therefore, healthy biofilms grown on Teflon disks will be incubated with clay suspensions and cultures will be evaluated for viability by serial dilution and plate counting. If successful, this project will bridge the gap between mineralogy and medicine promoting applications of clay or its derivatives to antibiotic resistant infections. This will enhance development of medical protocols for evaluating minerals that improve human health. The ultimate benefit to society will be to establish an economical and safe natural mineral cure for antibiotic-resistant infections. Proof of the antibacterial activity and safety for applications in wound care may lead to an economic use of clays to treat wounds, or to development of new medicines that incorporate similar antibacterial properties.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Antimicrobial resistance poses a growing threat to public health. Approximately 2 million people in the United States are infected with multi-drug resistant microorganisms each year, and at least 23,000 people die from their infections. Development of new antimicrobial strategies is an essential goal in the battle against resistance. Antibiotic-resistant infections are increasingly common in the public. Infections with resistant bacteria are associated with increased lengths of hospital stay, cost and mortality. The cost of antimicrobial resistance has been estimated to be over $105 billion worldwide. The proliferation of acquired resistance mechanisms in bacteria challenges treatment; currently available antibiotics have limited or in some cases, no, activity against resistant bacteria. Moreover, the use of antibiotics selects for further resistance in target bacteria thus accelerating the challenge. On a biological level, genes can carry antibiotic resistance mechanisms encoded either on bacterial chromosomes or mobile genetic elements, or chromosomal mutations may confer resistance. A parallel challenge is resistance associated with microbial biofilms, communities of microorganisms that form on surfaces, whether artificial (prosthetic joints) or natural (wounds). Bacteria in biofilms are resistant to antibiotics through different mechanisms than acquired antibiotic resistance.</p> <p>Wound infections are commonly encountered in clinical practice and are affected by both acquired and biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance. Given that the management of wound infections is difficult and that often, antibiotic resistant bacteria are involved, novel and innovative therapeutic and preventive non-antibiotic approaches are needed.</p> <p>Based on photo-documented observations of the ability of certain natural clays to heal bacterial infections (Williams, 2017), our research on antibacterial clays (minerals &lt;2 microns) has identified clays with unique geochemical properties capable of killing bacteria, including antibiotic resistant strains. This NSF EAGER research has documented that the clay also kills bacteria in the biofilm state, <em>in vitro</em> (Caflisch et al., 2018). We studied an antibacterial reduced-iron clay from a hydrothermal deposit in the Oregon Cascades, mined by Oregon Mineral Technologies (OMT). We refer to this antibacterial clay as the OMT Blue clay (Morrison et al., 2016). We note that antibacterial activity is not characteristic of all clays; that is, clays need to have specific geochemical properties, to be antibacterial (Williams, 2017). While the use of clays for medicinal applications has existed since humans evolved on earth, only recently have the technological capabilities existed to examine physical and chemical interactions of clays with microbes and understand what makes clay minerals antibacterial.</p> <p>Under this project, our team evaluated the effects of OMT Blue clay against 13 strains of staphylococci, streptococci, <em>Enterobacteriaceae</em> and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (Caflisch et al., 2018). The clay was evaluated against the bacteria in both the biofilm and planktonic states. Time-kill studies were used to assess planktonic activity. OMT Blue clay was shown to be bactericidal against all <a title="Learn more about Gram-Positive Bacteria from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/gram-positive-bacteria">Gram-positive and -negative bacteria</a> tested over 24 hours in the planktonic state, reducing their populations to the limit of detection. To assess anti-biofilm activity, biofilms on medical-grade Teflon discs were treated with a clay suspension. Compared with controls, the sizes of the disc-associated bacterial populations of all organisms were substantially reduced when exposed to OMT Blue clay. With one exception, all Gram-positive bacterial biofilm populations exposed to OMT Blue clay were reduced to the limit of detection. Gram-negative bacterial biofilms similarly exhibited attenuation following OMT Blue clay treatment. All species demonstrated statistically significant (&gt;3 log<sub>10</sub> cfu/cm<sup>2</sup>) population reductions compared with controls, with one exception. Aqueous leachates of OMT Blue clay were also effective at reducing the biofilms, but to a lesser degree than OMT Blue clay suspensions, presumably because they were prone to rapid oxidation rendering them less active than the OMT Blue clay suspensions.
