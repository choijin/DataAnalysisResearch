<AbstractNarration>This award will support the renewal of the REU Site at the SETI Institute (SI), which focuses on astronomy and planetary science with a connecting theme of astrobiology. Ten student participants per year will be paired with SI scientists to conduct research at both SI and at the NASA Ames Research Center. The undergraduate students will perform detailed research into a variety of topics, including the interstellar medium, asteroids, geological activity on Mars, and spectroscopy of the outer solar system. In addition, all participants will attend tutorials by SI scientists on introductory concepts in astronomy, biology, and geology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By offering high-quality research experiences to students at a critical stage of undergraduate education, the REU Site will contribute to increasing the nationwide pool of scientists and engineers. Participants will develop the research methods and analytical skills (mathematical, computational, and logical) necessary to process data, understand primary research, and to remain current with new developments in the field. The REU Site also has an active and highly developed plan to recruit underrepresented minorities into its program, which will expand STEM training opportunities to these groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

During the final week, students present their research results to both SI scientists and to the public via SI's weekly public colloquium series, and some students present subsequently at professional scientific conferences or co-author journal articles.  10 students participated in the 2018 summer REU program, 11 in the 2019 program, and 9 in the 2020 program.  In each year, the students took part in a 10-week summer internship in which they participated in a research project, field trips, professional development workshops, and presented the results of their work at the end of the summer.  All students successfully completed the program and some presented their results at professional conferences (photos have been uploaded with this report).  Other students took part in highly specialized professional workshops or were co-authors on refereed journal articles.  The CAMPARE students also presented their projects at a research symposium at Cal Poly Pomona.  In light of the global pandemic, our 2020 program was entirely virtual.  Students remained in their place of residence and participated in regular meetings via Zoom.  They also interacted via remote technology with their research mentors.  Substantial changes were made to the professional development content and the field trip content during the 2020 summer program in order to accommodate the virtual format.  In some cases, necessary technology was provided to student interns at their residences.       Last Modified: 06/18/2021       Submitted by: Matthew S Tiscareno]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
