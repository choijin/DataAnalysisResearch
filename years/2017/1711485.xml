<AbstractNarration>Wide bandgap semiconductors such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride are poised to revolutionize the next generation of power electronics and electricity infrastructures. Their penetration into the market, however, is hindered by two major barriers: cost and reliability.  The objective of this project is to explore new multilevel power conversion architectures leveraging cost-competitive gallium nitride power integrated circuits, and establish a viable technological pathway for breaking through these cost and reliability barriers. The demand for electricity is expected to increase significantly with further electrification of the world driven by renewable energy usage, electrification of transportation, expansion of efficient electrical heating and cooling, expansion of information traffic, increased industrial motor usage, and new smart grid development. By 2030, an estimated 80% of all U.S. electricity is expected to flow through power electronics. Advanced wide bandgap power electronics will play a critical role in all phases of the electricity life cycle including generation, distribution and consumption, and have the potential to improve electricity efficiency by 10-25%. With the proposed advanced converter topologies, it is possible to realize efficiency gains by facilitating higher levels of adoption for cost-effective gallium nitride semiconductors in applications of power supplies, electric vehicles, data centers, solar inverters, power conditioners, electric motor drives, and wind power systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to explore scalable multilevel multicell power conversion architectures to extend the power rating of gallium nitride power converters to the range of 100 kW, fully utilizing low-voltage (40-300V), cost-competitive, reliability-proven, commercially available gallium nitride transistors. This is distinctly different from the mainstream approach on developing wide bandgap power converters using high-voltage (&gt;1200V) semiconductor devices, which continue to face cost and reliability challenges. The new approach, originally developed for megawatt industrial applications, if adapted properly for the proposed lower power levels, will offer the same benefits of increased power rating and efficiency, reduced harmonic distortion, electro-magnetic interference, and improved redundancy and reliability, in addition to cost and size reduction.  These objectives will be met through the combination of (1) advanced architectures and topologies, (2) new control strategies and modulation techniques, (3) gallium nitride power IC building blocks and integrated gate driver, and 4) integration and scalability allowing for a broader range of power applications. The research plan includes major research components in the areas of power converter topologies, design, modeling, prototyping, and testing of the power converters; control and modulation techniques; development of gallium nitride device integration and converter scalability strategies; and evaluation and benchmarking against existing solutions.</AbstractNarration>
