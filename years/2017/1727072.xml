<AbstractNarration>This award will be used to acquire a high-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV) system for conducting state-of-the-art fluid imaging at San Jose State University. High-speed PIV is an advanced technique that uses a combination of laser light and cameras with high frame rate to map the flow field. The system includes stereoscopic PIV for measuring three-dimensional velocity components and two-color microscale PIV for imaging two-phase microfluidic systems. This advanced instrumentation will facilitate innovative research on wide-ranging critical applications, including biomedical devices, biochemical analysis, and sustainable heating, ventilation and air conditioning technologies. In addition, the PIV system will be integrated into educational activities and student projects at both undergraduate and graduate levels to enhance hands-on student learning in microfluidics and computational fluid dynamics courses. Sharing the PIV system with interested researchers on campus and other regional organizations will foster scienti&amp;#64257;c collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high-speed PIV system will enable high-impact experimental research in biofluid mechanics, turbulence and microfluidics. Examples of research projects enabled by the proposed instrument are as follows. (1) Investigation of the hemodynamic performance of novel trileaflet mechanical aortic valves for improving the design of next-generation prosthetic aortic valves. (2) Study on turbulence in natural ventilation and effects of naturally-occurring wind turbulence on the exchange rate of air in buildings. (3) Study on stent thrombosis to understand the relationship between wall shear stress near stent struts and thrombus formation. (4) Investigation of micro-droplet stability in constricted channels using two-color microscale PIV. (5) Study of particle mobility through porous media for the development of electrophoretic ink technology. The success of these research projects will rely on the acquisition of the proposed high-speed PIV system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The acquisition of a versatile particle image velocimetry system (PIV) has provided SJSU with the ability to investigate flow systems characterized by high-speed phenomena or microscopic scale. Essentially, the PIV instrument combines a laser source with a camera (and a microscope) to visualize flow features and measure fluid velocities in a 2D frame.  At SJSU, the PIV instrument has enabled a broad range of research projects, including (1) a detailed characterization of the hemodynamic performance of commercial and prototype mechanical heart valves, (2) the development and characterization of a novel microfluidic device capable of producing clot analogs at the boundary between active co-flow fluid streams, and (3) an investigation of the flow field inside a single drop during formation. These project have been conducted by four graduate students (75% women).   Research and educational activities involving the PIV instrument will engage faculty, students, external collaborators for years to come, and will allow to reach out to the diverse K-12 community in the Bay Area to encourage young students to pursue STEM careers.  Key outcomes made possible by this grant include one American Heart Association (AHA) grant awarded, two conference papers and one MS thesis completed, and two additional MS theses underway.
