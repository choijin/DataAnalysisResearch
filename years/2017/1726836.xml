<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Programs. Professor Ryan Walvoord from Ursinus College and colleagues Mark Ellison and Amanda Reig are acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the structural studies of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the changing interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state.  The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, forensics and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students via independent student research and traditional academic coursework. Students work on these projects during independent studies and summer research. The spectrometer complements recent infrastructure improvements in the sciences with the construction of an Innovation and Discovery Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NMR spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. It aids researchers in synthesizing small molecule fluorescence-based chemical tools for the detection of water contaminants.  It is used to structurally characterize and analyze oxygen-dependent reactivity of modified metal-binding proteins. The spectrometer is also used in the analysis of functionalized single-wall carbon nanotubes to be used as delivery materials for antibiotics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant has supported the acquisition of a Bruker 300 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer, which has significantly enhanced and enabled undergraduate education and research programs at Ursinus College.  The instrument has been installed in a dedicated laboratory space, and successful maintenance and training has allowed consistent and broad use of the instrument across teaching and research activities.  The instrument is a critical element of our analytical capabilities, particularly for the characterization  and determination of molecular structure.  The NMR has been incorporated into laboratory courses to provide training and experience on this state-of-the-art instrument to students interested in STEM fields.  Experiments have been added to our Physical Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis and Biophysical Chemistry laboratory classes, all in which the students directly collect and analyze data with the instrument, and the NMR is also included in Organic Chemistry curriculum.  Through laboratory experiments and research projects, more than 50 students collect and analyze data using the instrument each year.  Enhanced education and experience enabled by this grant has better positioned our students for strong postgraduate research positions, graduate programs, and careers in science.  Several research programs have been supported and enabled by acquisition of this instrument.  Projects involving new reactions for creating fluorescent materials, the use of nanomaterials for combating antibiotic resistance, and designing phospholipids to better understand membrane interactions were advanced with undergraduate coworkers conducting key experiments with the NMR.  The results of these findings have been reported to the broader community via external conferences, national scientific meetings, and peer-reviewed publication.
