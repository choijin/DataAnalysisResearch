<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase II project will provide an engaging independent-learning platform which weaves science into an exciting story for ages eight to thirteen. The platform combines a time-travel adventure game, a complementary book, and in-game avatars for important scientists (like Albert Einstein) that can answer students' questions.  It is aimed at the need for educating more science and engineering professionals by tapping into children's strong interest in games to augment current science curricula that students often find boring and uninteresting. The story is about STARDUST (atoms) and its formation and history in the universe.  It engages students by taking them back in time to identify trillions of atoms they personally inherited from Einstein and the last T-Rex.  Besides school use, the game's independent learning and engagement allows distribution directly to children for recreational use, adding another avenue for science learning, and a sustainable business model for the Company through school and commercial sales.  The technology can also support independent learning in underperforming schools. The development of the scientist avatar artificial intelligence technology will have wide application for many other educational and training requirements.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The innovation is a unique platform for independent learning about the sweeping science saga of atoms during the history of the Universe and Earth, and the connection of each student to that history through the trillions of atoms they inherited from prior beings like Albert Einstein and the last T-Rex.  The platform combines video games, a complementary fictional story book (based on the science) that acts as game introduction and player guide, and in-game avatars (like Albert Einstein and Henrietta Leavitt) that can provide verbal answers to students' spoken questions.  The artificial intelligence backing the scientist avatars includes learning manager software that guides student learning and provides assessments of progress in achieving pre-established learning goals. Four players cooperate in time travel adventures, exploring the human body, the Earth, and the Universe to find out what STARDUST is (atoms), how and when it was created (in the Big Bang and supernovae), how it got into Einstein, and from him to others (e.g., the carbon cycle). Excellent test results for the Phase I prototype game suggests a successful start at creating good player engagement. The project will continue to combine learning and engagement in 10 additional episodes with new scientist avatars including female and minority scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project created The Stardust Mystery transmedia resources for science learning in classrooms and homes. The resources for children ages 8-13 include: computer video games, science and How-To videos, an illustrated book, and Expert Avatars that verbally answer spoken or typed questions. The goal was to create a learning experience that is so much fun to use, it can successfully compete with children's usual digital distractions.</p> <p>The resources weave science into time travel adventures featuring four cousins (Lizzy, Neddy, VC, and Milo) 11 to 13 years old, their Grandpa and their friends Jackson, Johari, and Svetlana who explore the human body, the Earth, and the Universe. The Stardust Mystery theme is "<em>we are made of STARDUST that was once in the body of Albert Einstein and the last T-Rex</em>." The goal is to find out what STARDUST is (atoms), how and when the atoms were created (in the Big Bang, star supernovas, and neutron star collisions), the kinds, size and number of atoms, and how they got from Einstein and the Last T-Rex, to others (the carbon cycle). &nbsp;A startling fact is that each human being has inherited trillions of carbon atoms that were once in the body of each dinosaur, Einstein, and millions of other living things.&nbsp;</p> <p>The project established a versatile video game format in which teams of up to four players use a variety of <em>Tools </em>(virtual instruments and capabilities) to investigate and interact with <em>Objects</em> in the game <em>Scenes (</em>rich 3-D worlds of outer space, land and undersea). The <em>Tools</em> included virtual instruments for measuring chemical composition, weight, mass, velocity, temperature, and density, and for taking photographs. Other <em>Tools </em>provide <em>Object</em> information, teleporting of players, cloning of animals, moving <em>Objects</em>, navigating and communicating. This format provides a versatile virtual maker space.&nbsp;</p> <p>Two games are being offered for free during school closings. <em></em></p> <p><em>MissionKT</em> for Windows and Mac computers takes place in the era of the last land dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Students cooperate in teams of up to 4 players and have fun, while learning many NGSS core ideas: atoms as the basic building blocks of our world; atoms' small size and enormous number; atom recycling; the history of Planet Earth written in its rocks, and the history of the Universe written in its stars. Testing of <em>MissionKT </em>by students demonstrated good engagement in the game play.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Building the Universe: The Beginning of Time</em> is currently a single player game for Windows computers. It starts at the Big Bang where players collect quarks and assemble them to create protons and neutrons. Then, they add electrons and the electromagnetic force to create the first small atoms. Additional parts of the game will assemble stars, planets and galaxies, and finish with the Solar System.</p> <p>To illustrate the science in the Stardust Mystery story, short animated videos were produced using the game's characters and scenes. They are available on the STARDUST MYSTERY YouTube Channel. The videos are also available for players to view in the <em>MissionKT</em> game. There are 11 videos including:</p> <ul> <li><em>How Big Are My Atoms</em>? in which Johari suggests changing the size of Milo's atoms to the size of sand grains to see how big he would be.</li> <li><em>Our Cosmic Connection to the Universe</em> in which VC, Neddy and Grandpa explore the Universe back to the Big Bang to discover how and when their atoms were created and how they have been shared by plants and animals. &nbsp;</li> <li><em>What Killed the Land Dinosaurs</em>? about the asteroid collision with Earth 66 million years ago.</li> <li><em>How Do We Know What Killed the Dinosaurs</em>? In which Lizzy and Milo do the research on the Gubbio rock layer that was evidence for the asteroid impact.</li> <li><em>A Quadrillion Tons of Gold </em>in which Milo and Johari travel back in time to view a neutron star collision observed on earth in 2017 that produced the heaviest atoms in the periodic table.</li> <li><em>How did Einstein Get Dinosaur Atoms?&nbsp; </em>in which Neddy explains how Albert Einstein acquired carbon atoms from dinosaurs.</li> </ul> <p>How-To tutorials to support game play are also available on YouTube.</p> <p>The Albert Einstein Expert Avatar<sup>TM</sup> is available online.

A Quadrillion Tons of Gold in which Milo and Johari travel back in time to view a neutron star collision observed on earth in 2017 that produced the heaviest atoms in the periodic table. How did Einstein Get Dinosaur Atoms?  in which Neddy explains how Albert Einstein acquired carbon atoms from dinosaurs.   How-To tutorials to support game play are also available on YouTube.  The Albert Einstein Expert AvatarTM is available online. The Einstein avatar answers questions about Einstein's life, science and opinions.  The patented technology includes an authoring system to allow others to easily create their own Expert Avatars.  A description and a link to the Albert Einstein application appear on TheStardustMystery.com web site.  The Stardust Mystery illustrated book manuscript  has been completed and submitted for final editing and publication  expected in Sept. 2020.  The story follows the four cousins and their friends as they solve the Stardust Mystery using the virtual reality Cosmic Egg time, space and size-change travel ship.
