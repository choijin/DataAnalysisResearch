<AbstractNarration>Advanced functional materials possess unique surfaces and interfaces that find widespread use, such as solar energy storage, biofuel production, water treatment, and medicine. Successful applications require detailed information about the surfaces and interfaces of these materials in different environmental conditions. The proposed Environmental X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (E-XPS) for surface analysis overcomes the deficiency of traditional instrument that must operate under ultra-high vacuum pressures by providing uncompromised operation at near ambient pressures in reactive environments over a wide temperature range (-100 to 1100 degrees Farenheit). The proposed research activities have the potential to advance the fundamental science and use of advanced functional materials for these numerous applications. The E-XPS will enhance interdisciplinary research, training and education of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers at Lehigh University. As a user facility, the unique instrument will enhance regional academic, governmental and industrial research collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four broad areas are the focus of the proposed research: heterogeneous catalysts and sorbents; photonics and photoelectron-chemistry; surface tribology and multifunctional materials; and biomolecules in their natural environments at surfaces/interfaces. For catalysis, the projects include rational design of catalysts for hydrogen manufacture with non-toxic earth-abundant elements and design of model catalysts for conversion of inexpensive and abundant methane (natural gas) to value-added ethane and ethylene.  For sorbents, the focus is on template-mediated multiscale structuring of hierarchically porous carbon membranes. Tribochemical properties of high performance coatings for aerospace applications. Ultralow wear polymer nanocomposites and nonporous materials synthesized at high pressures will also be probed. Surface chemical and electronic properties of various semiconducting materials, such as dilute-As GaNAs alloys as well as chalcogenide glasses, under atmospheric conditions, will be analyzed to understand the underlying oxidation mechanism and kinetics.  Finally, cell/substrate interfacial layers in the presence of water to analyze scaffolds and cells under near-native live environments will be analyzed.</AbstractNarration>
