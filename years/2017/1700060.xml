<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for the annual Clinic on Dynamic Approaches to Infectious Disease Data to be held in December, 2016, that will provide training for U.S. scientists in the mathematics of infectious disease epidemiology. Mathematics and simulation are essential tools in infectious disease control, enabling decision-makers to explore control policies before implementing them, interpret trends, and predict emerging threats. Over the past decade, integration of the fields of mathematical epidemiology and biomedical epidemiology has increased in research practice; however, training options provide few opportunities for integration in the classroom. This clinic addresses this gap by offering participants exposure to a broad range of concepts and techniques from both epidemiological traditions. The clinic will provide a conceptual foundation for integrating dynamic modeling approaches with empirical infectious diseases research. It is aimed at participants without substantial experience in scientific computing or in mathematical modeling. The training will focus on how the complex dynamics of pathogen transmission influence study design and data collection for addressing applied problems in infectious disease research. This training will prepare participants to pursue their research goals after the clinic. Participants will develop the skills necessary to identify which research questions can and cannot benefit from development of a dynamic modeling program. In addition, because the clinic will also include scientists from Africa it will provide opportunities for U.S. scientists to build a network of international collaborators. In addition, lectures will be made publicly available online so that they can be used for self-instruction by those unable to attend the clinic or incorporated into teaching materials for other courses.</AbstractNarration>

DAIDD 2016 was hosted by the University of Georgia&rsquo;s Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. There were 22 student participants, 14 from the US (supported directly from this grant) and 8 of whom were from Africa (supported by the South African Centre for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis). The workshop faculty included 4 core faculty of the ICI3D Program and 4 Workshop Faculty, with two of each coming from US and African institutions, respectively. The Clinic included a diverse set of pedagogical approaches including lectures, computer tutorials, discussions, group work, and individual work. Through several of the Clinic exercises and group and one-&shy;on-&shy;one mentorship with DAIDD faculty, each DAIDD participant developed (1) an iteratively refined research question for an infectious disease modeling project, based on their own research projects and interests, (2) a written proposal (approximately one page) for a dynamical modeling approach that would address this research question, and (3) a schematic diagram of the dynamic model they would use to execute the proposal. An open access, citable repository of pedagogical materials developed through the ICI3D program, including materials developed or refined at DAIDD 2016, is available through the ICI3D Figshare Repository (DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3788224).</span></p> </span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/03/2017<br>      Modified by: Steven&nbsp;E&nbsp;Bellan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
