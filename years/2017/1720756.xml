<AbstractNarration>The investigators will address important questions concerning the explosion of Supernovae (SNe), which can occur at the end of the life of a star. How do these stars die?  Astronomers use SNe as 'standard candles', because they are all shown to explode with nearly identical energies.  If the energy of an explosion is constant, then the fainter the SNe is seen, the more distant it must be.  Astronomers use these SNe to measure the distance to galaxies. Because of their great brightness, SNe are astronomers best tool for studying dark matter at great distances. However there are some serious concerns; do stars with different element composition or spin explode with different brightness? How do the details of star systems and explosion physics influence our understanding of dark energy? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SNe have been one of the driving forces behind some of the most interesting physics of the past century: black holes, neutron stars, dark energy, neutrinos, and cosmic rays. Newly discovered classes of transients have already brought about discussions of gravitational waves, pair-instability explosions, and r-process element creation. Discoveries resulting from research funded by this proposal should address some similarly interesting physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will train two University of Illinois graduate students in observational stellar astrophysics and perform an integrated education program with undergraduate astronomy classes across the country. The graduate students will work with data from multiple telescopes and surveys. The main scientific goals are to (1) discover and characterize new and recently discovered classes of astrophysical transients, (2) detail the progenitors and explosions of those "exotic" transients, and (3) determine how Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) observables depend on the progenitor system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our UC Santa Cruz team used more than a dozen telescope to observe exploding stars and other astronomical phenomena that change over human timescales (days to weeks).  Through this program, we have published over 80 scientific articles.  The highlight of this this research was the first discovery of light from a gravitational wave source.  After the LIGO discovery of a neutron-star merger in August 2017, our team searched for the corresponding light, being the first to obtain an optical image of the event.  While the LIGO data provided rough positional information, locating the event to an area of the sky roughly 120 times the size of the full moon, our team pinpointed its position in a particular galaxy.  Our discovery provides an independent distance, environmental data, and a precise location for follow-up observations.  Our image jump started the new scientific field of multi-messenger astronomy.  In the following days, our team determined that the object we discovered was definitively the counterpart to the gravitational wave source.  Its observational properties was unlike anything seen before, fading quickly and turning from blue to red in only a few days.  We inferred that this even produced a significant amount of the heaviest elements in the periodic table, solving an old problem of where such elements are created.  This discovery was called the 2017 Breakthrough of the Year by Science magazine.  We also examined the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae and tested their utility to measure the properties of dark energy.  We studied several "superluminous" supernovae (those up to 100 times brighter than more common varieties of exploding stars), finding additional evidence that they come from an extreme population of massive stars.  We discovered the first strongly lensed supernova, SN Refsdal, which created a beautiful Einstein cross.  We studied peculiar Type Iax supernovae, finding that their progenitor systems are much better understood than more common Type Ia supernovae.  Finally, we presented the first results of the Foundation Supernova Survey.  This survey is replacing the current nearby sample of Type Ia supernovae used for cosmology.  In the next few years, this survey will reduce the uncertainty on dark energy properties by a factor of 2.       Last Modified: 01/27/2019       Submitted by: Ryan J Foley]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
