<AbstractNarration>This grant partially supports the participation of students from US institutions in the Doctoral Consortium at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2017 in Honolulu, Hawaii. CVPR is the premier annual conference in computer vision with over 2000 senior, junior and student participants. It is held in North America and attended by members of the international research community. The broader impacts of this project include supporting the career development of some of the brightest junior researchers in computer vision, contributing to the research community in general by drawing attention to an important aspect of graduate student development, potentially increasing the number of active researchers and educators in STEM, and ensuring that the computer vision community, through its recent graduates, makes fast advances in solving problems that will benefit society as a whole. The Doctoral Consortium aims to have representation from a diverse group of participants in terms of gender, ethnic background, academic institution, and geographic location. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF support covers some of the costs for 15 selected US-based graduate students to attend the conference. Participants and recipients of travel support are selected by the 2017 CVPR Doctoral Consortium co-chairs. The Doctoral Consortium provides opportunities for senior PhD students to highlight their work, and to discuss their research and career options with faculty and researchers who have relevant expertise and experience. The opportunity to receive advice on their research work and career plans from experts from different institutions, and with potentially different perspectives, is often not available internally at one's own institution. This year's Doctoral Consortium features a poster session, one-on-one mentoring, and panel discussion. The last of these components was introduced in last year's event and was well-received.</AbstractNarration>
