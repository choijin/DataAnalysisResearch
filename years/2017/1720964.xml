<AbstractNarration>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. The Multimedia Immersion (MI) project  will develop, pilot, and evaluate a nine-week STEM-rich multimedia production course for high school students. MI will make important contributions to the field through its efforts to design and evaluate the promises and challenges of a nine-week multimedia curriculum in multiple urban high schools. The MI course will engage teams of students to develop a personally and socially relevant storyline that guides their use of accessible audio and video technologies to create a five-minute animated video. To develop student STEM experience and provide technical support, the project will provide guidance and learning experiences in engineering (e.g., criteria, constraints, optimization, tradeoffs), science (e.g. sound, light, energy, mechanics) and multimedia technologies (e.g., computer based audio production, video editing and visualizations through animatics (i.e., shooting a succession of storyboards with a soundtrack). &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Because the curriculum situates engineering and science learning in the context of multimedia production, there are natural synergies with several existing high school courses including engineering design, audio/video media production, and multimedia technology. Although these courses are typically electives in high school, developing a 5-minute animated short on a topic of interest may encourage girls and students from underrepresented groups to select this course over other electives. MI will impact 10 teachers and approximately 250 high school students per year. The project will result in the following resources: nine-week curricular unit (multimedia, science, engineering); assessments to monitor student learning of science, engineering and technology (design logs); and research on changes in student knowledge, interest). Project resources will be disseminated to teachers, researchers, and curriculum and professional development providers via conference presentations, publications, and online webinars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MI project builds on student familiarity and interest in music, video and technology to promote an: (1) understanding of engineering design and physics and (2) an appreciation of the fundamental role of STEM in popular culture. Project evaluation will be conducted using student surveys and an examination of work products in conjunction with implementation challenges and successes to generate evidence for the feasibility and utility of a high school multimedia course that explicitly addresses science and engineering learning. Project evaluation will use student design logs as a window into student design processes and conceptual understanding. Student design logs are an essential feature of MI curriculum design. With an appropriate structure, these design logs can inform teaching, afford an opportunity for students to reflect on their own work, and provide evidence of student thinking and learning for assessment purposes. Using student design logs as a window into students' design process and conceptual understanding is an important contribution to the engineering education community which has few options for measuring student knowledge in ways that are consistent with the hands-on, iterative nature of the design process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This DRK-12 research study had the following major goals: Develop a nine-week multimedia curriculum for  urban high schools and determine if the curriculum could inspire STEM interest; iteratively pilot the curriculum with ten teachers and 250 students per year;  explore student increase in interest and self-confidence, as well as knowledge of science and engineering due to the curriculum; and to measure successes and challenges in various learning environments.   Two iterations of the curriculum were developed and implemented in ten schools in New York and New Jersey.  The student demographic groups in the study included  under-represented populations in STEM careers.  Teachers from participant schools attended Professional Development (PD) sessions on the campus of Stevens Institute of Technology prior to implementing the curriculum.  During the second iteration, Development Teachers from year one assisted in running the PD session for the teachers in year two.  Equipment packages valued at $1500 each were delivered and installed in each participating classroom by the project's PI.   Intellectual Merit: The significant findings in the next section include those based upon both quantitative and qualitative data including recorded interviews with project teachers by the Lead Researcher; student pre/post attitudinal survey; student Design Logs; recorded weekly teacher/project leadership Zoom meetings; and students' "Making Of" videos documenting their curricular progress. One hundred (100) percent of the nine (9) teachers interviewed by the Lead Researcher stated:  They would use the curriculum again. Students were very engaged in the animation project. Students acquired technical and computer skills they would not have done otherwise.. Students were stimulated by the cross-curricular nature of the curriculum. The curriculum was well-designed and easy to follow. The  summer PD session was essential for them to develop the technical skills necessary to teach the curriculum. The weekly Zoom meetings  were  necessary for sharing information with one another, discussing challenges, proposing solutions, and reporting on  progress. That they had suggestions  for the next iteration of the curriculum..  Eighty-nine (89) percent of the teachers interviewed collaborated with other subject area teachers to aid in their implementation of the curriculum.  241 students over the course of two years completed a pre/post attitudinal survey designed to measure students': positive beliefs about engineering and themselves; increased interest and awareness of STEM; and knowledge of the science and engineering design process. In both years of the study, students had significant differences in 17 items in the survey, mostly those dealing with the importance of science in their everyday lives, and increased confidence in engineering and technology. Sixty-seven (67) percent of students responding to an item ranking the curriculum gave it a combined four and five stars (five being highest). It is clear from these results that completing the curriculum results in a greater measurable positive change in students' attitudes toward, and comfort with, STEM. Students recorded their progress and responded to prompts in their Design Logs throughout the curriculum. 135 Design Logs were analyzed for students' understanding of sound and microphones. Responses were rated High (correct response with appropriate examples); Medium (correct response, but few or no examples ); and Low (incomplete or incorrect response; no examples). Two researchers ranked the same subset of the Logs independently, and then compared rankings for interrater reliability. For Module 2, Unit 1, 86 responses were rated. Fifty-five (55) percent of that group rated either Medium or High, displaying an understanding of sound. For Module 2, Unit 2, 49 responses were rated. Seventy-one (71) percent of that group rated either High or Medium in their understanding of the relationship between sound and microphones.   Review of video recordings and 38 transcripts from weekly Zoom meetings with teachers revealed that there were four distinct phases of curriculum implementation that both the teachers and their students passed through. The phases were defined by increasing levels of confidence, creativity and technological facility in both teachers and students. Teachers took different amounts of time to move from one phase to the next. Students created "Making Of" videos documenting their progress through creating the animation. Analysis of the students' comments recorded in 50 of these videos supports these statements: Students worked effectively in groups to create the assets they needed to produce the animation; students took on specialist roles, which drew upon their differing abilities and talents; students consulted with other groups  to help solve problems; there was high student engagement throughout the project; and students were able to articulate clearly what they were doing and how it fit into the overall project. Broader Impacts: Despite COVID-19 restrictions in the second year of implementation, the success of this curriculum exhibits an underlying symmetry between the Creative Design Process and the Engineering Design Process.  By using media arts as the vehicle to engage students, their creative passion in music, video and animation transported them into realms of science and technology in meaningful and enduring ways.
