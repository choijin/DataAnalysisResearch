<AbstractNarration>This project, acquiring, deploying, and maintaining a high performance computing (HPC) cluster, aims to support a broad range of data-enabled science and research training activities. Motivated by both fundamental and applied science agendas, the instrument will be utilized by at least the fourteen collaborative projects cited below:&lt;br/&gt;- Quality and Scalability of Topic Models;&lt;br/&gt;- Multigrid and Multiscale Optimization for Machine Learning and Networks;&lt;br/&gt;- Computational Studies of Multifunctional Polymers;&lt;br/&gt;- Gene Network Alignment at High-scale;&lt;br/&gt;- Modeling of Peptide-functionalized Polyethylene-glycol (PEG)-based Hydrogels;&lt;br/&gt;- Computer Simulations of Highly Thermostable Copolymer-enzyme Conjugates;&lt;br/&gt;- Enabling Modeling of Large Macromolecular Assemblages;&lt;br/&gt;- Computational Studies of Biomolecular Evolution;&lt;br/&gt;- Lattice Boltzmann Simulation of Vascular Blood Flow with Stents and Flow Diverters;&lt;br/&gt;- Automated Parallel Parameterization Methods;&lt;br/&gt;- Large-scale Simulations of Rare Events in Biological Systems;&lt;br/&gt;- Performance Optimization and Load Balancing for Large-scale Metal Cation Catalysts; &lt;br/&gt;- Fundamental Insights into Alkane Selective Oxidation in Atomic-scale Metal Cation Catalysts, and&lt;br/&gt;- Computation Determination of Chemical Stability of Nuclear Materials.&lt;br/&gt;The instrument is the primary resource for the projects in computer science, including scalable machine learning and methods for utilization of emerging memory and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) technologies. Moreover, the cluster constitutes a much needed platform for collaborative development and execution of GPU-accelerated scientific applications. The solid-state disks (SSDs) and memory paths available through Omni-path enable high scalability of research applications that manage complex operations, Transforming the way scientific knowledge is attained and implemented to drive new technologies, new developments in computing, coupled with traditional computational methods, advance efforts in chemistry, physics, biology, and materials science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The instrument serves as an essential tool for advancing inquiry for at least 20 faculty in the collaborative team from Clemson and Claflin University, an Historically Black University partner. Three hundred fifty or more graduate and undergraduate students participate in the research proposed and also in the educational projects that will use the instrument. Furthermore, configured as part of the Clemson "Palmetto" supercomputer cluster, the system is accessible to other faculty, staff, postdocs, and students and provides benefit to world-class operational user support and offers a path for sustainability for the instrument. The team includes nine women researchers and faculty participants who serve as role models. The participation of women, as well as in graduate programs at this institution, exceeds the national average. Outreach, education, and training activities will reach dozens of undergraduate participants at Claflin University. Current and proposed courses and seminars are planned at all levels.</AbstractNarration>

The instrument has been utilized by more than fourteen fundamental and applied science projects across fields of science and engineering that include computer science, computer engineering, economics, physics, chemistry, chemical engineering, biology, human genetics, materials science, and several interdisciplinary research fields.  This MRI award provided significant broader impacts.  It expanded the Palmetto Cluster, the supercomputing cluster of Clemson University.  The Palmetto Cluster is a significant research resource for Clemson and its collaborators.  The instrument has been utilized by hundreds of undergraduate and graduate students and faculty researchers at Clemson University and its collaborators for training and educational activities and research. Examples of the intellectual impact from different areas of science and engineering that utilized this MRI instrument include:  Graduate student Robert Underwood in the research group of Apon in the School of Computing and Calhoun in Electrical and Computing Engineering at Clemson University, and in collaboration with colleagues Dr. Franck Cappello and Dr. Sheng Di from Argonne National Lab, has used the MRI instrument to study error-bounded lossy compression.  Compression of data will be required to process the ever growing amounts of data, and lossy compression provides fast and efficient compression.  Error-bounded lossy compression limits the amount of error introduced by the compression and enables the method to be used effectively for scientific calculations in high performance computing applications where integrity is important but lossless compression performs poorly.  The visualization in Figure 1 illustrates the distortion of a dataset when compressed with ZFP, a popular lossy compression method, using two different modes.  The distortion using the developed FRaZ mode is much less than when the existing fixed-rate mode is used for the same compressed size.    The interdisciplinary Feltus and Smith groups at Clemson used this MRI instrument to develop an open source AI algorithm (TSPG) that models shifting biological states at the RNA level.  The algorithm was applied to human data but is designed to work in any biological system including crop genomics.  It is notable that the report's co-authors included master's and PhD students and faculty from multiple departments, including Genetics and Biochemistry, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Biomedical Data Science and Informatics.  The project also included a citizen scientist and patient.  Figure 2 lllustrates how data is collected and processed to produce a final product that are patient specific biomarkers.  The high performance computing capabilities provided by this MRI award helped to process more patient data much faster than would otherwise be possible.    This MRI instrument enabled the Schiller group to develop a computational workflow for simulation-driven characterization of nonwoven fiber materials. This approach integrates the generation of virtual material samples.  Three of the types of results obtained include:  (a) image-based segmentation and pore-network reconstruction, (b) high-performance simulation of hydraulic flow in porous media, and (c) the prediction of hydraulic properties and performance. The computational framework enables rapid image-based characterization of nonwoven samples which can accelerate the design of enhanced fiber materials for filtration and separation applications.    The Chowdhury group at Clemson used the MRI instrument to create a Connected Vehicle application development platform that developers use to emulate a Connected Vehicle environment.  The Connected Vehicle connects to a dedicated server via several types of networks.  Using DSRC, the mobile edge and fixed edges communicate with each other, while with optical fiber and Wi-Fi, fixed edges and system edges communicate.
