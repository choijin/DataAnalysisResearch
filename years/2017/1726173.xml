<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) pPograms. Professor Aaron Sadow from Iowa State University and colleagues Yan Zhao, Levi Stanley, Martin Thuo and Sarah Cady have acquired an upgrade for a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer by equipping it with a new console and a liquid-nitrogen, cooled cryoprobe as well as a flow NMR system to monitor kinetics. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as the study of biologically relevant species. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists to study the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to understand the specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the changes of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is important to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, forensics and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students via independent student research and traditional academic coursework as well as researchers and graduate students and high school students who participate in outreach activities. The NMR center also offers data collection and analysis for nearby industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NMR spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. It especially benefits the development of synthetic materials to produce bacterial biofilms and studies of catalytic reaction pathways. The spectrometer is also used in developing catalysts for new reactions that couple carbon-hydrogen and carbon-halogen bond activation with carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond formation and for engineering soft materials, one bond at a time.</AbstractNarration>
