<AbstractNarration>Plants are essential because they are the main source of carbon for terrestrial ecosystems.  Similar to humans, and animals in general, plants harbor diverse microbial communities, including fungi. Mosses are a major component of boreal, arctic and alpine vegetation, which are most drastically impacted by environmental variation. They are known to host diverse fungal communities, living inside plant tissues (endophytic), such as leaves, without causing any visible symptoms. Endophytic fungi can actually help living plants in various ways, including the improvement of nutrient uptake and protection from pathogens. However, fungi are also known to be proficient decomposers of dead plant material. Switches between these functional states by fungi might be dynamic and potentially regulated by abiotic and biotic factors. Understanding the circumstances and mechanisms by which these functional transitions occur will greatly improve knowledge of plant-fungus interactions and their roles as symbiotic entities to maintain nutrient cycling and ecosystem functions. The researchers will participate in various outreach activities, including the annual Darwin Day exhibition event at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. This grant will greatly improve the co-PI's Ph.D. dissertation, and contribute to the development of an independent research program for a successful academic career. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previously, the researchers have examined endophytic fungal species and their function across a senescence gradient within moss plants using an innovative metatranscriptomic approach. Although active fungal species were found to be structured according to the senescence gradient of the moss, several fungi inhabit both the living (top) and decomposing (bottom) portions of the plant, providing multiple candidate fungal species to study trophic transitions between symbiotrophism and saprotrophism. The researchers will isolate some of these fungi in pure cultures and use them in an experiment designed to quantify the effects of focal fungal strains on living and dead moss tissues. Using co-culture experiments of these fungi with moss plants, this project will characterize the phenotypic, and transcriptomic, responses of mosses to their associated fungi. This research will use also the same moss-fungus system to monitor differential gene expression associated with a switch between symbiotrophism and saprotrophism by three very different fungal species.</AbstractNarration>

While it has become widely accepted that all plant species host microbiomes, interactions between mosses and fungi remain scarcely explored. Yet, they offer many advantages compare to other land plants. One overarching goal of this research was to develop a new model system to better understand moss-fungal endophytes interactions and to investigate if fungal endophytes can change trophic states. The moss <em>Dicranum scoparium</em>, with its natural senescent gradient, turned out to be an ideal and powerful host plant system to study the biology of endophytic fungi. The Co-PI approached her doctoral project from multiple angles during the course of this award and two peer-reviewed publications resulted from this project, with one additional manuscript in preparation. The first paper focused on the transitions of active fungal community assemblies across the senescence gradient of the moss <em>Dicranum scoparium </em>gametophytes. The results revealed that while fungal communities are distinct across the senescing layers, several fungi are able to colonize multiple layers, which is indicative of their potential to switch between trophic states, i.e., between endophytism and saprotrophism. The second paper implemented a metatranscriptomic workflow to investigate the functions of fungal communities across the same senescence gradient as described in the first publication. We found functional switches of fungal communities at the genetic level and detected differences at the transcriptional level indicative of differential nitrogen source usage across the senescence gradient, which contributes to a better understanding of the nitrogen cycle. The Co-PI is working on the third manuscript in which she investigated functional aspects of plant-fungal interactions using the same moss, <em>D. scoparium</em>, but in pure <em>in vitro</em> culture and in co-culture with endophytic fungal strains she isolated from <em>D. scoparium</em> in nature. With the same experimental set up, she also examined the functional transitions of the same fungal strains when they are growing with dead moss materials. Our results suggest that most fungal endophytes of <em>D. scoparium</em> that we tested did not have detrimental effect on moss growth and some even promoted the growth of this moss. We also demonstrated for the first time, at the transcriptional level, that the same endophytic strain can switch its trophic state between endophytism and saprotrophism when associated with living versus dead moss tissues. These findings largely expanded our understanding of moss-fungal interactions at the community and individual isolate levels. Furthermore, the fungal and moss cultures, the experimental design, and bioinformatic workflow generated through this project, will allow other questions to be asked and tested for plant-fungal interactions in general.</p> <p>This award enabled the graduate student co-PI to develop her own research program, which is an invaluable training process to develop a new research program as a scientist. During the funding period, the co-PI has worked with several undergraduate students and led multiple scientific outreach activities to introduce the fascinating world of plant-fungal symbiosis to the general public. Ko-Hsuan Chen has contributed or has been invited to several national or international conferences to present the outcomes of this NSF funded project.
