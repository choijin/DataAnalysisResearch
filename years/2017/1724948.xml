<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Programs. With it, Professor Katherine Plass from Franklin &amp; Marshall College and colleagues Claude Yoder and Jennifer Morford acquire a transmission electron microscope (TEM).  A TEM sends a beam of electrons through a thin layer of material.  The electron beam interacts with the substance to produce a visual image, similar to a microscope. These images are important for research on the chemical properties of materials. They reveal details of the structure, such as size and shape of a nanoparticle or a protein.  This information helps researchers understand the material's properties and improve them. The acquisition enhances the training of undergraduates in research.  The instrument is used at four primarily undergraduate institutions, Franklin and Marshall College, Albright College, Ursinus College and Millersville University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of this electron microscope is aimed at enhancing research, especially in areas such as: (a) the synthesis of nanomaterials for the study of the properties of nanoparticles interfacing with molecules or cells, (b) plasmonic semiconducting nanoparticles used to modulate cation exchange, (c) studies of molybdenum accumulation in marine sediments by synthesizing iron-molybdenum-sulfide nanoparticles, (d) ion substitution in apatite materials, (e) metal nanoparticles as catalysts for carbon nanofiber growth, (f) carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide as vectors for transporting tetracycline antibiotics, (g) plasmonic metal nanoparticles and (h) modular proteins and how they move within cells.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      Project outcomes Franklin &amp; Marshall purchased a low-voltage benchtop TEM (Delong Instruments LVEM25), enabling undergraduate training in nanomaterials characterization in the Lancaster area and across a wide area of Central Pennsylvania. Undergraduate students have regular, hands-on access to this essential tool for studying nanomaterials, a rare experience for students at PUIs when TEMs are generally housed at large user facilities requiring extensive training and expensive user fees. Intellectual merit results: The TEM is advancing research work involving nanomaterials at primarily undergraduate institutions at F&amp;M and across Central Pennsylvania, resulting in several publications described below. The TEM continues to support and accelerate new, related projects. Katherine Plass (Franklin &amp; Marshall College) worked with six undergraduates to report on how the process of cation exchange, a method that changes the chemistry of a particle while not changing its shape or size, can be altered by use of oxidizing pre-treatments. This led to deeper understanding of the mechanisms of this powerful synthetic process and revealed important changes to the way that the particles absorbed light. The TEM was essential to demonstrating that the cation exchange process occurred, rather than some other chemistry process.  Mark Ellison (Ursinus College), with the help of thirty-two undergraduates and his collaborator, reported that carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide can be used to transport tetracycline antibiotics past the resistance mechanism of antibiotic-resistant E. coli bacteria. This revealed means of using current antibiotics in new ways against bacteria that have developed certain defences. The TEM was used to see how the process of attaching the antibiotics did not change the carbon nanotubes size or shape.  Jennifer Morford (Franklin &amp; Marshall College), with the help of eleven undergraduates and several collaborators, reported on how different atomic arrangements of iron sulfide can be formed and how these arrangements affect the way molybdenum sticks to the iron sulfide. This is an important question because the molybdenum associated with iron sulfides in ocean sediments is used to learn about the conditions in which the sediment was formed. The TEM was used to see the collections of particles formed and determine whether the sizes and shapes changed with different atomic arrangements and in the presence of molybdenum. Broader impact results:  The availability of this TEM has nucleated a collective of research groups from across Central Pennsylvania with interests in materials chemistry, nanochemistry, and nanotechnology. Central Pennsylvania contains numerous small colleges, many of which have a single faculty member doing materials chemistry research with undergraduates in relative isolation. To overcome this limitation, we implemented the "Super nano research group". This end-of-summer research meeting was attended by 5 primary investigators, 14 undergraduate, and 4 graduate students. This included 10 female students and 2 underrepresented minority students. The Super nano Group Meeting was an outstanding experience. It advanced the work of several research groups across the region and leveraged new perspectives to develop new experiments. It was an excellent professional development opportunity for undergraduate students, who experienced a "graduate level" group meeting. Undergraduate student researchers were pushed to answer detailed questions from a group of graduate students, who revealed the level of expertise gained through graduate work. The graduate students and PIs modelled supportive criticality in their questions, demonstrating the intense curiosity and skepticism needed to do good science balanced by an atmosphere of acceptance and cooperation. This was also an excellent professional development opportunity for the graduate students, who were interested in learning more about being faculty members at PUIs. They saw first-hand the opportunities afforded and constraints placed on research at a small school and got practice with mentoring undergraduate students. We demonstrated the feasibility of use of the low-voltage TEM in a classroom laboratory at Franklin &amp; Marshall and Elizabethtown Colleges. The TEM was used in the Inorganic Chemistry laboratory for a materials chemistry CURE (class-room based undergraduate research experience). Students refined novel syntheses of the unstable molecule fac-Alq3, a highly fluorescent and conductive molecule used for LEDs and solar cell devices. Students designed syntheses of boehmite nanoparticles as the precursors, which were visualized and measured using the TEM. Students also travelled from Elizabethtown College to examine the gold or silver nanoparticles synthesized in an upper-level Analytical Chemistry laboratory.
