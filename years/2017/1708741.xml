<AbstractNarration>The benefits of nanomaterials and their enabling properties have resulted in widespread use in industry and consumer products. As we approach 20 years of research on the potential impacts of nanomaterials on human health and the environment, differences remain in the scientific and regulatory communities regarding whether nanomaterials need to be assessed differently and more stringently than conventional materials. There is however a growing consensus that nanomaterials exhibit complex and interesting interactions with organisms and ecosystems. There is also visible convergence regarding methods of evaluation and assessments where nanotechnology is likely to yield greater environmental benefits or risks. This conference will take stock of what has been learned, point the scientific community towards specific conclusions, discuss needs for data integration, and finally identify remaining research gaps. The overall goal of the conference will be to integrate the scientific knowledge available about nanomaterial exposure, fate, effects and risks in the environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will bring together experts from around the world to discuss the state of the science on nanomaterials, their impacts, and their applications, with a dedicated discussion of applications and implications at the nano-bio interface. Specific scientific objectives of the conference will be: &lt;br/&gt;- Discuss environmental exposure of nanomaterials including their release from products and their detection &lt;br/&gt;- Summarize known transport and transformation pathways of nanomaterials &lt;br/&gt;- Discuss recent findings on uptake and effects in organisms and food-chains &lt;br/&gt;- Present the progress towards environmental risk assessment of nanomaterials &lt;br/&gt;- Identify nano-specific issues in exposure, fate, effects and risks &lt;br/&gt;- Discuss the relevance of nanomaterials compared to natural particles &lt;br/&gt;The main results obtained from addressing the above objectives will be summarized in a synthesis paper, which concludes on the topic of whether nanomaterials pose a novel threat under environmentally relevant conditions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ International summit to integrate the scientific knowledge available about nanomaterial exposure, fate, effects and risks in the environment  The manipulation of matter at the nanoscale has opened endless possibilities for scientists and companies to design materials with unprecedented functionalities and novel properties. The prospects for nano-inspired technologies were articulated nearly 20 years ago with the creation of the US National Nanotechnology Initiative and funding to examine environmental applications of nanotechnology and potential impacts was first put in place in the US in 2001 and grew steadily for over a decade. European support for funding in environmental nanotechnology has also been considerable. Current European funding of nanosafety- related work is about 100 Million Euro annually (Katalagarianakis, 2014). These investments have resulted in an increased understanding of the uses, effects and risks of nanomaterials.  The funding from NSF enabled participation from US researchers that include faculty, students and post-doctoral scholars.   Research and Education Activities:  This symposium brought together 101 participants from 17 countries and four continents to evaluate the knowledge acquired over the last decade on nanomaterial exposure, fate effects and risks.

Under realistic environmental exposure conditions, however, currently used nanomaterials will not have significant short term effects on organisms or ecosystems.  In the absence of acute effects on environmental systems, the research focus has shifted towards long-term effects, synergistic effects between particles and other components of the system and more subtle effects on community structure or ecosystem level.
