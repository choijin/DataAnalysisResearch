<AbstractNarration>The sequence of bases on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strand determines an individual's hereditary traits and his or her susceptibility to diseases. This sequence can be used to tailor conventional therapeutic approaches and deliver more personalized medicine based on an individual's genetic makeup. Solid-state nanopores and nanochannels present a new paradigm for DNA sequencing and can make sequence determination faster and cheaper than the currently used methods. However, these nanoscale tools have not been able to achieve the necessary control and reproducibility required for large-scale commercial applications. This award supports fundamental research for the development of an integrated nanoscale architecture that can harness the merits of both the solid-state nanopores and the nanochannels for controlled DNA analysis. The new platform will accelerate DNA sequencing research and has the potential to make personalized medicine a clinical reality. This research will also provide a rich foundation for teaching, training, and learning and open a new window to manufacturing and metrology at nanoscale. The program will also have extensive outreach component, including active recruitment and training of women and underrepresented minorities in engineering,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanopore sensors are poised to revolutionize DNA sequencing technology by obviating the need for chemical conversion and synthesis and by use of long read lengths. However, fast DNA translocation speed and low signal-to-noise ratio present scientific barriers that need to be overcome to realize the full application potential of these sensors. The objective of this research is to demonstrate enabling technologies necessary to design, fabricate, and assemble integrated nanoscale architecture for studying DNA translocation through nanopores, as well as to understand fundamental scientific principles that govern the translocation of long DNA molecules (&gt;100 kb) using simultaneous electrical and optical signal readout. Results of this research will bring about a novel bioanalytical platform that can be used to capture comprehensive genetic data with high temporal resolution. In this research, an integrated nanochannel-nanopore device will be designed and fabricated, wherein nanochannels will be used to unravel the long coiled DNA and feed the stretched molecules into the nanopore, which in turn will be used to discern the structural features of the DNA. The understanding of underlying physics of nanopore translocation of long DNA strands and the ability to control this translocation dynamics will help to realize nanopore based DNA sequencers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>To summarize, the key outcomes of this NSF Nanomanufacturing program grant have been: (1) fabrication of nanoscale architectures with integrated nanochannels and nanopore, capable of stretching long DNA molecules, (2) Utilization of two transverse electric potentials to control DNA translocation across the pore, (3) Achievement of the optical-electrical bimodal detection to obtain higher sensitivity in single-molecule bioanalysis, (4) the development of experimental approaches to slow down the translocation speed of DNA through nanopore devices with a major focus on the use of viscosity gradients and (5) the development of custom-codes (LabView, Mathematica, and MATLAB) to acquire and analyze the translocation data with the focus on intra-event characteristics to discriminate individual nucleotides. The first outcome, the fabrication of integrated nanochannel and nanopore for concurrent optical and electrical detection of DNA, involved many of the necessary basic steps that lead to the other key outcomes. Specifically, we successfully fabricate nanopores in an atomically thin 2D materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride to obtain thin nanopore devices and modify membrane characteristics (thickness, stability, and hydrophilicity) for optimum resolution. Further, we have demonstrated the ability to fabricate nanochannels 60 nm high and 80 nm wide, downstream to an array of micro/nano features to unravel the long-coiled DNA molecules. E-beam sculpting of graphene is not just dependent on the ability to displace atoms but also the ability to hinder the self-healing properties of graphene. Using relatively lower e-beam fluxes from a thermionic electron source, the C-atom knockout rate is comparable to the rate of C-atom ad-atom attraction and accumulation at the e-beam/graphene interface. Working at this unique regime has allowed the study of C-atom ad-atom migration as well as the influence of various substrate materials on graphene pore formation. The bimodal optical-electrical detection was able to identify free-antibodies, free-ligands and the complexes of the antibody-antigen sample. Furthermore, the bimodal sensor was able to discriminate between specific and non-specific binding to the protein. Since the use of solid-state nanopores for DNA detection and analysis more than a decade ago, no useful information about DNA sequence or structural motifs has been obtained. And one of the biggest obstacles in using solid-state nanopores for DNA sequence analysis has been the lack of motion control of DNA in terms of translocation speed and thermal fluctuations. By integrating nanochannels with nanopore this research targeted to overcome that obstacle. This project has successfully provided a new insight into translocation dynamics of long DNA strands (&gt;100 kb) and the potential to control their translocation speed. This knowledge will be paramount to help the nanopore discipline overcome current challenges and make big strides towards the development of a nanopore based sequencing platform.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/03/2020<br>      Modified by: Minjun&nbsp;Kim</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1707818/1707818_10319982_1578095401953_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1707818/1707818_10319982_1578095401953_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Integrated Nanochannels and Nanopores for DNA Analysis"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1707818/1707818_10319982_1578095401953_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Integrated Nanochannels and Nanopores for DNA Analysis"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Optical imaging of nanochannel structure fabricated by electron beam lithography</div> <div class="imageCredit">MinJun Kim</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Minjun&nbsp;Kim</div> <div class="imageTitle">Integrated Nanochannels and Nanopores for DNA Analysis</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1707818/1707818_10319982_1578095326736_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1707818/1707818_10319982_1578095326736_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="DNA diffusion out of the channels @ 0V"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1707818/1707818_10319982_1578095326736_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="DNA diffusion out of the channels @ 0V"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Once the 11V potential is turned off, DNA in the micro-features tends to  diffuse back into the big well because of high entropy associated with it compared to the micro/nanochannels.</div> <div class="imageCredit">MinJun Kim</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Minjun&nbsp;Kim</div> <div class="imageTitle">DNA diffusion out of the channels @ 0V</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1707818/1707818_10319982_1578095269551_3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1707818/1707818_10319982_1578095269551_3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="DNA entry into the channels @ 11V"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1707818/1707818_10319982_1578095269551_3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="DNA entry into the channels @ 11V"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Many DNA molecules appear stuck inside the channels.
