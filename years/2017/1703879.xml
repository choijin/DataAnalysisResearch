<AbstractNarration>This proposal partially supports 40 students for their travel to attend the 2017 Real World Cryptography Conference (RWC) to be held on Jan 4-6, 2017 at Columbia University, New York City, NY, USA. RWC has emerged as a premier venue for the presentation of ideas, advances and challenges from both academic and industrial cryptographers and security researchers. The conference aims to bring   better understanding of real-world cryptographic issues to the theoretical community, helping to inform their research and set new research challenges for the theoretical community, and enables practitioners to develop a clearer view of the current state-of-the-art in cryptographic research and what it offers to practice. As such, it fits closely with the goals of NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which include applied cryptography and implementation of cryptographic schemes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Real World Cryptography series of conferences was born in 2012 from a workshop entitled "Is Theoretical Cryptography Practically Relevant?", held at Cambridge University as part of the 2012 Alan Turing year. The goals of that workshop were:  1) To bring a better understanding of real-world cryptographic issues to the theoretical community, helping to inform their research and set new research challenges  2) To enable practitioners to develop a clearer view of the current state-of-the-art in cryptographic research and what it offers to practice  3) To provide a forum for exchanging ideas and building relationships between researchers from the different communities    and these remain the basic goals of the RWC series. The 2012 event was attended by approximately 100 people, and in each year since the audience as grown roughly linearly. RWC 2019 had an audience well in excess of 600 people.  Intellectual Merit: Now in its seventh year, RWC has emerged as a premier venue for the presentation of ideas, advances and challenges from both academic and industrial cryptographers and security researchers. The yearly attendance significantly surpass that of other top-tier events in cryptography, e.g., CRYPTO and EUROCRYPT.  Broader Impacts: The awarded funds were used to support student travel, lodging and attendance of RWC'18 and RWC'19.  Members of underrepresented groups were strongly encouraged to apply. Twenty-five students were supported in 2018, including eleven women; Twenty-two in 2019, including twelve women.   The students were exposed to talks about the state of the art in both academic and industrial research; they had ample opportunites to network with student colleagues, potential employers (both for internships and post-graduation jobs) and post-doctoral advisors. In addition to the talks, RWC specifically has a mid-event "lightning talk" session, in which employers have a few minutes to introduce their company/institution and talk about openings that they need to fill.  (There were roughly 50 such announcements during the session.)  This makes students aware of who they should chat up in the "hallway track" or contact after the event, as well as more generally informing them of the vast number of excellent positions available.
