<AbstractNarration>The largest increase in atmospheric CO2 in the recent geologic past occurred during the last deglaciation (from 20,000 to 10,000 years ago).  As ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere melted, atmospheric CO2 levels rose by ~30%.  Despite extensive research, the underlying cause of the CO2 change has yet to be fully explained.  Recent ice core results show that the CO2 rise can be traced to an isotopically light carbon source (i.e. carbon with a low 13C/12C ratio).  One possible cause is reduced marine photosynthesis, which would result in the accumulation of light carbon in the surface ocean and atmosphere.  Less photosynthesis would also reduce the amount of low 13C/12C carbon that falls from the surface ocean to intermediate depths in the form of organic matter.  Thus, reduced marine biological productivity should yield opposing carbon isotopic signals at surface and intermediate depths, with the surface ocean becoming isotopically lighter (lower 13C/12C) and intermediate depths becoming heavier (higher 13C/12C).  The results of this work could transform our understanding of the climate system by constraining the source of carbon isotopic signals and therefore the driver of atmospheric CO2 variability during the last deglaciation.  The broader educational impact of the proposed work includes the participation of a graduate student and an undergraduate at the University of Connecticut.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this project is to use data from multiple locations to assess changes in marine photosynthesis during the last deglaciation.  The research team will use high resolution sediment cores from five different locations, including the Southwest Atlantic, the Southeast Atlantic, the Southern Ocean, and Southwest Pacific, and the eastern tropical Pacific.  Each core was retrieved from intermediate (~1000 m) depths that should be sensitive to the amount of organic matter falling through the water column.  The team will assess variations in photosynthesis by analyzing the carbon isotopic ratio in the fossils of benthic (sea floor dwelling) and planktonic (surface ocean dwelling) organisms.  The team will also analyze the ratio of boron to calcium in the benthic fossils to infer overall changes in carbon concentration at intermediate water depths.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Earth's last ice age ended about 18,000 years ago, resulting in ice sheet retreat from large parts of North America and Eurasia.  While it is known that melting was driven by rising atmospheric CO2 levels, the reason for the rise in CO2 remains unclear.   One possibility is a change in the ocean's so-called conveyor circulation in the Atlantic Ocean, which carries heat northward into the Atlantic Basin.  Results from computer models suggest the conveyor can slow considerably as the result of freshwater input, which in turn drives dramatic changes in Earth's climate and carbon cycle.    The primary focus of our research was to infer changes in the Earth's carbon cycle using sediment cores from the South Atlantic, a location that is sensitive to changes in the conveyor.  We used chemical analyses of microscopic shells to infer changes in circulation and carbon storage in the deep Atlantic.  Computer modeling by our collaborators suggest that a weaker conveyor can cause reduced biological productivity in the surface ocean, which can in turn lead to higher atmospheric CO2 levels. This is because marine plants absorb carbon from the atmosphere and when they die their carbon-rich remains sink into the deep ocean. Less productivity therefore cause carbon to accumulate in the surface ocean and atmosphere.    Our results from the last deglaciation show that slowing of the conveyor circulation occurred first, followed by a reduction in biological productivity.  Our results are therefore consistent with model simulations that show the conveyor can trigger changes in biological productivity.  This novel result tell us that a weaker conveyor not only affect climate in the North Atlantic region but also the carbon cycle more broadly.  Projections of future climate and the stability of the conveyor circulation therefore need to take into account indirect effects on the marine carbon cycle.   The  educational impacts of this work include the professional development of a postdoctoral scholar, a graduate student, and two undergraduates.  Each have continued to pursue oceanographic research as a result of support from NSF.          Last Modified: 01/22/2020       Submitted by: David C Lund]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
