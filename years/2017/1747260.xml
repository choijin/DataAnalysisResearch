<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I Projects intends to promote academic achievement, high school graduation and college and life preparedness for adolescents (middle through college students) with Executive Function (EF) deficits.  EF deficits are found in a variety of neurodevelopmental and medical disorders including Traumatic Brain Injury, Epilepsy, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the most common childhood behavioral disorder affecting up to 10% of youth as well as Autism Spectrum Disorder.  Youth with EF deficits struggle to get things done and have high school graduation, college matriculation and college graduation rates well below national norms.  In addition, these adolescents suffer from anxiety, depression, job loss, substance use and suicide at higher rates than their peers without EF deficits.  Research supports incentive-based behavioral EF remediation for deficient populations.  But availability of research-based EF remediation support is limited.  The proposed technology aims at enabling students to develop the EF skills needed to reach their academic potential and improve their life outcomes. The broader impact of this research is to gather rich data that will advance the scientific and public understanding of technology as a means of facilitating EF skills development in adolescent populations with Executive Function deficits.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Phase I project aims to iteratively develop an app-based EF technological intervention using user-centered design principals.  This technology innovation is in the form of a smart phone based app that uses gamification and automation to motivate students to make structured behavior change to learn the time and materials management, planning, organizational and motivation skills to get their work done with help of their support team. This Phase I project will focus on 3 Aims.  First, we will assess users' current context (EF remediation approaches and challenges) to validate user relevance of our approach and refine where necessary for optimal usability (Aim 1).  We will then systematically evaluate the features, usability and feasibility of the technology intervention?and make additional software design revisions as needed to promote successful uptake (Aim 2).  And we will develop a functional prototype of the app innovation (Aim 3) tailored to the $2.3 B Special Education software market.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       Project Outcomes Report  For this SBIR project, Studentivity, Inc. proposed to iteratively   prototype and test key innovations for a technology intervention for   adolescent executive functioning.  We iteratively developed a Phase I prototype of Studentivity?, a   gamified digital student planner and executive   function development App for students with user input and testing.  The   Studentivity? App is designed to help adolescent students   make a game of developing academic executive function skills and coping   mechanisms including time and task management, organization, planning and   study skills development, with automated support from the App.  The App is designed to be suggestive and assistive,   using evidence based proprietary innovations in planning, routines and gamification   to support students in developing EF skills and independence in collaboration   with their support team of parents and education professionals.       During   Phase I, we completed all five proposed   technical objectives, specifically:  (1)   Conducted User Interviews.  We gathered feedback from 50 students,   parents, educators and specialists via Studentivity ICorps market interviews   and Seattle Children's Research Institute (SCRI) structured interviews.  We used this input to refine features for   the App prototoype.    (2)   Created App Prototype. Incorporating User   feedback, we developed a Phase I App prototype consisting of LMS Integration to enable students to   import their school assignments from the Canvas and Schoology learning   management systems into the Studentivity App for planning; Proprietary Planning and Task Management technology   to help students develop a step by step plan for their work for the week; Proprietary Routine Configuration to help   students to create a routine and reminders to support them in developing the   Executive Function Skills for success; Gamification in the form of streaks, badges and incentives to help motivate students to use   the App and reinforce new skill development; and Collaboration in the form of reports to share results with their   support team.    (3)   Developed Advanced Game Play Designs.  We designed three potential concepts   for potential advanced game play for the App and presented them to users to   solicit feedback.    (4)   Usability Tested Game Prototype with Students, Parents and Educators.  We conducted usability testing of the   Prototype with 16 students, parents, teachers and specialists to collect   observations and ratings of app usability and collect user feedback.  We also collected user feedback on 3 design   concepts for potential future Game Play for the App.   (5)   Developed Phase II Conceptual User Interface Designs.  As a part of the iterative design process we   created updated User Interface designs to address usability issues identified   in testing and we designed new User Interface designs to conceptualize future   features desired by users.  These   future concepts include a web based version of the App to allow use on any   computer, laptop or tablet via a web browser.      Key Phase I Results:  1.       Market Interviews confirmed demand for an   Executive Function support intervention amongst parents students and   educational specialists, and interest in a technology based intervention in   this area.  User?s key issues were identified   as student Time Management, Task Management, Motivation and Self Esteem   support which were mapped by experts to evidence based approaches in the Studentivity   App.     2.     Studentivity developed a Phase   I Prototype of the Studentivity App that meets each of our Phase I Innovation   objectives, demonstrating feasibility of our key technology Innovations in Executive   Function support and our team?s ability to   deliver a market ready solution with Phase II funding and development.     3.     Interviews and Usability Testing with students, parents and educators produced evidence that the Studentivity approach is an appealing solution for   Executive Function Support.  Usability testers were   found to respond well to the UI and were interested that an App like this could   be available to them.    When we   asked 16 ADHD students, parents and educator usability testers for their   feedback on the app, they almost unanimously agreed that the App interface   was helpful and of use to students of their demographic and added features   beyond their existing tools.   Several key innovations including features of importing assignments from school Learning Management Systems, assisted planning and   gamification were most cited as of interest by users.
