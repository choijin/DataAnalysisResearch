<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of producing ophthalmic lenses utilizing a low cost optical printer that will enable the fabrication of superior quality lenses with a low cost optical printer.  The result is development of a business model where an eye exam is administered, prescription lenses are printed and glasses assembled and dispensed in a single visit.  Upon completing the refraction portion of the eye exam, the lens prescriptions will be electronically transferred to the optical lens printer.  The lens blanks, pre-treated for UV and anti-scratch protection, will contain a laser writable photopolymer layer that accepts and freezes the personalized prescriptions.  Eyeglasses produced with this method will be of equal or higher in optical quality compared to traditional lenses and can be produced at a fraction of the cost of conventional lenses.  This method of producing ophthalmic lenses both reduces the turnaround time for securing eyeglasses but equally important, will significantly reduce the cost for producing eyeglasses translating to lower the retail prices.   Considering that over 60% of the US population wears glasses and a much high percentage of families have members that depend on glasses, this project will benefit the vast majority of US taxpayers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this STTR Phase 1 proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of three coupled innovations: 1) a high-speed optical printer for 2) photosensitive ophthalmic lens blanks that record 3) novel gradient-index diffractive optics which provide dramatically improved fabrication cost, visual performance and lighter weight over existing lens making technologies.  The target application will be low cost, low and higher order aberration correcting eyeglass lenses fabricated with a compact, inexpensive optical printer.  Lenses produced with this light based process will match or exceed the optical quality of current free form lenses made with computer numerical controlled milling machines costing in the range of $250k to $500k.  This proposed lens making innovation enables the development of an eyeglass dispensing business model that could eliminate the need for conventional centralized eyeglass labs, the associated distribution networks, a comprehensive inventory of lens blanks and the long wait times for procuring prescription eyeglasses.  The developments of this STTR will allow ophthalmic practices to better serve their patients, enabling on-site fabrication of superior corrective lenses that more closely match eye deficiencies.  By the end of phase I, the goal is to optimize the photopolymer materials, refine the light sources and complete an engineering model of the optical printer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF STTR 1721055-  On-demand optical printing of high-performance personalized eyeglass lenses     This goal of this Phase I STTR project was to demonstrate the feasibility of the fabrication of superior quality ophthalmic lenses with a low cost optical printer based on changing the index-of-refraction of the materials as opposed to modifying the thickness of the lens. The tasks completed focused on three coupled innovations: 1) a high-speed optical printer for 2) photosensitive ophthalmic lens blanks that record 3) novel gradient-index diffractive optics.  The objectives of these innovations are to dramatically improve visual performance, be lighter weight and reduced fabrication cost over existing lens making technologies. The expected result enables a disruptive eyewear business model where an eye exam is administered, prescription lens blanks printed and finished, glasses assembled, fitted and dispensed in a single visit.  Lenses produced with this process are expected to match or exceed the optical quality of current simple, progressive and premium free-form lenses made with computer numerical controlled milling machines costing in excess of $500k. This proposed point of eye-exam/sale lens making technology enables the development of an eyeglass dispensing business model that eliminates the need for conventional centralized eyeglass labs, the associated distribution networks, a comprehensive inventory of lens blanks and the long wait times for procuring prescription eyeglasses.  The resulting point of eye exam/sale business model also reduces the environmental pollution associated with the current central lab based eyewear industry.  By the end of phase I, the goal was to optimize the photopolymer materials, refine the light sources, complete a lab model of the optical printer and print sample lenses.   The conceptual design of an ultra-high production printer with 60 second or less lens printing capability was completed and a provisional patent was filed.  To obtain a sub-minute printing capability with a single exposure of the lens blank requiring a stationary staging platform, a 106 M-Pixel design was chosen  During the Phase I program, the lithography tool was simplified to a mask projection system using gray-scale masks.  All of the scientific questions of the program were answered using this light table lab lens writing system. Several photopolymer materials were formulated and demonstrated.  The material detailed in this report meets the stated goals.  In addition, a second higher performance material was formulated that exceeds design objectives of Phase I the and is detailed in the publication M. D. Alim, D. J. Glugla, S. Mavila, C. Wang, P. D. Nystrom, A. C. Sullivan, R. R. McLeod, C. N. Bowman, "High dynamic range (&Delta;n) two-stage photopolymers via enhanced solubility of a high refractive index acrylate writing monomer," ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces 10, pp. 1217-1224, 2018.  This material could have applications for lenses that exceed the required capabilities of eyeglasses, such as custom complex lenses for medical and scientific imaging. Demonstration lenses were successfully fabricated and characterized and are now available for proof-of-concept demonstrations for subsequent venture fund raising discussions.  During phase II the lenses will be further optimized to mitigate the effects of chromatic aberrations and haze to levels that will exceed the optical qualities of conventional eyeglass lenses.
