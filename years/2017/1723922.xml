<AbstractNarration>This award is in support of the 2017 Tropical Cyclone Operations and Research Forum (TCORF) at the 71st Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference (IHC) to be held on March 14 -16, 2017 at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, in Miami, FL.  The TCORF/IHC brings together representatives from Federal agencies and the academic research community to discuss the latest research into tropical cyclone observing, forecasting, and warning such as:  2016 hurricane/typhoon season challenges and the opportunities for research that they offer, research priorities of the operational centers, observations and observing strategies, tropical cyclone model development, transitioning research to operations, and advances in tropical cyclone forecast and warning products and services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is important to the Nation because it brings the academic research community, together with Federal agencies, to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season and make improvements to the Nation's hurricane forecasting and warning program.</AbstractNarration>

The forum brings the  academic research community together with Federal agencies to prepare  for the upcoming hurricane season and make improvements to the Nation?s  hurricane forecasting and warning program.  The Organizing Committee selects panel topics and invites speakers from the operations and research communities to present papers and participate in discussions.  137 registered participants convened at the  Rosenstiel School for Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS) on March  14-16, 2017 to review the Nation's hurricane forecasting and warning  program and to make recommendations on how to improve the program in the  future. Tropical cyclone research continues to be a part of the forum  in the context of operational imperatives. The agenda comprised a  combination of themed sessions, a poster session, and the Working Group  for Hurricane and Winter Storms Operation and Research (WG/HWSOR)  meeting.  TCORF summary report and presentation are posted on the TCORF website, as well as an email is sent to the participants after the Forum.
