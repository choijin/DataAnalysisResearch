<AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative conference proposal from the four comprehensive universities in the state of Georgia: Georgia Southern University, Kennesaw State University, University of West Georgia, and Valdosta State University. The goal of the conference workshop proposal is to bring these four institutions together to discuss, plan, and implement changes to improve undergraduate STEM education across the state. This conference will focus on four strands: gateway courses, faculty teaching and learning, education research, and undergraduate research. These four topics are critical to the success of students and their faculties at these institutions. A theme of the meeting is to establish collaboration and partnerships among the faculties of these institutions, so that they can share best practices, initiate change, and study the impact of change on recruitment, retention, and graduation rates. By focusing the efforts of these four institutions with guidance from the University System of Georgia, the workshop outcomes may reach a broad spectrum of STEM faculty (and thereby students) across the state, to address the low persistence of students who begin as STEM majors in college. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the workshop conference will establish plans to improve undergraduate STEM education and to increase research opportunities at these institutions for undergraduate students. Participants will plan how to evaluate the effectiveness of these efforts, particularly in increasing the persistence of STEM majors to graduation. Focusing on all four of Georgia's comprehensive universities is unique in the sense that these institutions aspire to balance research, teaching, and service expectations to a greater degree than research and liberal arts institutions. There is widespread agreement that the comprehensive universities in Georgia should be working jointly to improve our undergraduate STEM retention, progression, and graduation and this conference workshop will serve to initiate this joint work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As institutions of higher education is beholden on us to provide students with the capabilities and avenues to succeed.  This is not to say that students do not have the responsibility to engage in and fully commit to their learning but rather to say that the college student of the past no longer exists and we, as faculty and staff, have to meet this new generation of student where they are and understand what their expectations for higher education are.  No longer should we place all the onus for learning on the student but take the responsibility for providing quality teaching as well.   Nowhere is this more needed than in STEM courses.  Students come to us having met the requirements of admissions to our institutions, declare a major in STEM education, and then proceed to become disenfranchised with the system leaving our enrollment rates high but our persistence and graduate rates stagnant over the past 10 years (meaning we are enrolling more students into STEM majors but they are not graduating in the same numbers).   The purpose of our recent Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Symposium (NSF Award 1723296) was to find out what similar Institutions were doing to retain, promote, and support students in their STEM coursework so that our graduation numbers would increase.  Four Institutions in Georgia meet to share their successes and programs that they have implemented that have been successful for the in their courses.  Types of programs include but are not limited to:  Supplemental Instruction  Learning Assistants  Faculty Learning Communities  Gateway to Completion  Undergraduate research  However, many of these programs are being done in isolation by individual faculty members and there is no continuity across institutions, courses, or within departments. In addition, while research indicates these programs do have impacts on students, no local evidence is being collected to allow faculty to make a case for keeping these programs.  Many of these faculty are using students as supplemental instructors or teaching assistants and pay these students to do this work.  This becomes a problem with budgets are cut, reallocated, or redirected.  These types of expenses are usually the first cut and without hard data to back up the success of these programs, they are often short-lived.  The overall merit of this symposium was allowing the four sister institutions to learn from one another, develop connections with each other, and to learn how successful programs are being implemented at other similar institutions.  Much discussion took place about rethinking undergraduate curriculum maps, developing faculty teaching potential, learning where the pitfalls lie.  For instance, it was discovered that while national data supports many of these types of efforts, many faculty are left to their own devices to implement and many department chairs are unware of the techniques that faculty are using.  Because multiple faculty are doing  a variety of things, it is hard to tell what is truly working when there is no consistency from one course to the next and students don?t have time to fully engage with new learning strategies. However, departments are unclear how to encourage new techniques because of academic freedom and tenure and lack of funding makes sustainability of programs difficult to cement. This information gave participants a chance to walk away with action steps that they would like to implement such as: collecting data on strategies implemented, utilizing Colleges of Education to assist with pedagogical techniques, consider incentives for faculty who are willing to try new and innovative teaching strategies, have faculty report out what is working at faculty meetings, increase opportunities for undergraduate research, target resources to what is working and institutionalize programs which have shown success.  Through awareness of opportunities, challenges, and best practices, symposia like this one can begin to increase the teaching of undergraduate STEM courses thereby increasing retention and graduation in STEM fields.  Improving student success especially in gateway courses and can lead to increased student motivation and engagement.  Educating faculty and department chairs on the strategies that are successful and by gathering data to back up these claims, Universities can begin to develop plans for institutionalized change which better supports the 21st century student and their expectations of post-secondary education.
