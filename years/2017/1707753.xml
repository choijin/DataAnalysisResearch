<AbstractNarration>Groundwater is an important drinking water source for many communities. Who depends on groundwater for drinking water ?  Three of four American cities, 95% of the rural American population, and over half of all Americans.  Wide scale contamination of groundwater threatens many of these sources.  The state-of-the-science for cleaning up contaminated groundwater is mired in 1950s technology because the pollutants and the flowing groundwaters in which they occur are out of sight and very difficult to monitor.  This makes it particularly difficult to design so-called 'in situ' clean-up methods, that rely on injecting mixtures into the subsurface to make chemical reactions underground that convert the contaminants to non-toxic products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem to be studied in this project is how groundwater clean-up happens underground.  The project will use a recently discovered method of tracking the moving front between the contaminated ('plume') and the non-contaminated groundwater as a basis for predicting the overall rate of chemical transformation in situ.  This new method is a recent invention from the theory of turbulence, a field that has challenged human minds since the time of DaVinci, and it promises to provide a much more accurate way of accounting the overall rate of clean-up, even when it is difficult to know exactly the location of the contaminant plume. This project includes both controlled experiments in the laboratory and field site testing to complete the development of this method of designing groundwater clean-up. This innovative and powerful approach does not require the site manager to know exactly where the plume is, like other methods, but it only requires the total surface area of the plume.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance of this research includes: development of new methods to help federal and state agencies, cities, groundwater contamination responsible parties, and anyone responsible for groundwater quality, to design and manage in situ groundwater remediation strategies all over the United States.  This project shares the work with learning people at all levels from Kindergarten to College, in order to achieve broad training goals.  The project involves both undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary education, includes classes with approximately 75 K-12 students as well as their teachers per year involved in different aspects of engineering and environmental processes in soils through one-day hands-on field trips to the UC Davis campus, and expansion of two UC Davis graduate courses to include material learned in this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported basic science research on the topic of reactive transport in porous media, with focus on the way that biochemical reactions are controlled by mixing between two separate solutions.  Examples of this include salt water colliding with freshwater in the ground, mixing between clean river water and contaminated groundwater in the "hyporheic" zone beneath rivers, displacement of one solution with another in a fixed bed reactor in chemical engineering applications, and injection of a reactant solution into a contaminated aquifer in order to remediation groundwater.  Computer models of these systems is based on mathematical models which in turn are built on theories of how the mixing occurs and how it impacts the extent of the particular biochemical reactions involved.  Our objective has been to advance these theories in order to 1. incorporate the impacts of mixing on the reactions, and 2. develop equations that are as simple as possible for practical use by the hydrogeology community.  Our scientific outcomes (intellectual merit) are substantive.  We have developed an entirely new theory for general math model construction of what happens when either or both of the reacting solutions undergo exchange between a mobile phase (e.g., the river) and an adjacent immobile phase (e.g., the sediment bed underlying the river).  This so-called mobile-immobile exchange occurs in all the examples listed above and in groundwater and soilwater in general, as well as in biological applications.  Our math is a simple extension ofaclassical (70 yrs old) model of first-order reversible mobile-immobile exchange to include the residence time while immobile as a new quantity.  The simplicity of this method, termed "Phase exposure-dependent exchange" (PhEDEx) gives rise to closed-form solutions (can solve on a calculator) in many cases, and generalizes most prior theories of mobile-immobile exchange.  Second we used the same approach to model incomplete mixing for purely mobile fluids, by explicitly treating mobile-unmixed and mobile-mixed phases.  This "mobile-mobile" approach was tested against published data with successful results.  Third, in another paper from this project we have extended prior theories on mixing ("scalar dissipation rate") and clarified their application.    We have published a number of technical papers on these main theoretical advances and the PI and students have given talks on these advances at numerous conferences worldwide.  This project supported the doctoral work of two students (Ahmed Ali, Deviyani Gurung), the masters work of two students (Clarisa Watkins, Henry Moen), and the employment of three undergraduate research assistants (Dylan Bright, Mark Rosimo, Jacob Greissl) at Washington State University.  The work also led to two subsequent proposals, one to NSF CBET on reactive transport in pipe networks inside buildings (successful) and one to DOE Subsurface Biogeochemical Research on reactive transport in river corridors (pending).  Ahmed, Henry, Dylan, and Mark have gone on to employment in consulting firms, Deviyani continues to complete her doctoral work on these topics, and Jacob has matriculated into graduate school here at WSU.
