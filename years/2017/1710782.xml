<AbstractNarration>This is an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology, under the program Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellow, Akana Noto, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow is being mentored by Randall Hughes and Tarik Gouhier at Northeastern University. This research aims to investigate the importance of biodiversity on ecological communities, focusing on New England salt marshes. Scientists frequently study species diversity (how many species are present), but research increasingly shows that genetic and trait diversity within a single species can be similarly important. Species containing more variation among individuals are less affected by environmental change, and recover from change more quickly. However, the effect of variation within a species on its interactions with other species remains unclear. The fellow's research explores how diversity within species affects competition among salt marsh plants and consumption by the herbivorous crabs that eat them. Salt marshes serve many important 'ecosystem functions' including filtering water and protecting shorelines from storms, and this research will generate predictions to inform the best ways to manage and restore this important threatened ecosystem. The fellow is developing educational activities and lesson plans for local elementary and middle school students, particularly those from low-income and underrepresented minority communities, focusing on the importance of variation within species. These activities are based in local ecosystems and help students from largely urban areas learn about their local environment as well as important biological concepts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fellow will use a combination of field experiments (1,2) and models (3) to ask the following specific questions about how intraspecific variation affects plant communities via species interactions: (1) How does intraspecific genetic diversity within a plant species affect interspecific competition? (2) How does intraspecific trait diversity among consumers affect plants, and is this effect mediated by plant genetic diversity? (3) How will plant biomass vary with plant and consumer intraspecific diversity across space? Salt marshes are a good model system because intraspecific diversity is known to be important and easy to manipulate. These questions provide a good basis for teaching students key concepts such as genetic diversity and evolution, and this research will allow the fellow to receive training in molecular techniques and development of mathematical and computational models.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Species diversity is an important aspect of ecological communities, and conservation efforts are frequently directed at preserving it. When species are lost, communities often become less stable or less functional in other ways, so preserving species diversity is important if the community is to be maintained. Yet there is also diversity within species?some individuals of a species may be large while others are small, for instance?and this diversity is also likely to have ecologically important effects. In fact, recent research has shown that, like species diversity, diversity within a species (intraspecific diversity) often increases the stability of the community, makes communities more resistant to invasive species, and leads to more species coexisting. These benefits to communities are likely due, at least in part, to the effect of intraspecific diversity on interactions among species, but its specific effects are not yet known.</p> <p>This research sought to determine how intraspecific diversity affects species interactions in salt marsh communities and how or if that impacts the community as a whole. Salt marshes are an ideal place for this research as they provide many services that benefit humans?protection from flooding, carbon storage, nursery habitat for commercially important fish species?so understanding these ecological dynamics also provides information that is useful for conserving an important ecosystem. We conducted field experiments in two Massachusetts salt marshes and built a mathematical model to address these questions. We found that intraspecific diversity in a plant species caused less competition with other members of its species, but it did not affect competition with another species. We also found that herbivorous crabs of different sizes affected the plants they eat differently; large crabs had much stronger effects on plants than small crabs while a mix of large and small were often similar to either the large crabs or small crabs alone. Interestingly, while large crabs reduced the amount of intraspecific (genetic) diversity in plants during our experiments, having a mix of large and small crabs led to less of a reduction. Finally, our model showed that, when examining interactions among more species, intraspecific variation in the strength of species interactions also affects stability of the community, but its effects on stability may depend on how it affects competition within species.</p> <p>Together, these results suggest that intraspecific diversity affects both competitive and consumer interactions, and this may be a way by which intraspecific diversity affects whole communities. In particular, we found that, because of its effects on competition with species, communities with greater intraspecific diversity may be both more stable and better maintain their intraspecific diversity than those with less intraspecific diversity. This suggests that conserving intraspecific diversity may be very important to maintaining functional ecological communities. In a project that emerged from this grant, we found that sea-level rise is associated with reduced intraspecific diversity in a common salt marsh plant species, so conserving intraspecific diversity will require active effort if we are to counteract the effects of global change.</p> <p>The results of this work were presented at conferences, an invited seminar and at events for the public. One manuscript has been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, one is under review and two more are being prepared for submission. In addition to the benefits of having these results, this work has opened up avenues for new research into questions about the ecological importance of intraspecific diversity.</p> <p>This grant also included activities to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields. To contribute to that goal, I worked with teachers and elementary and middle school students, many of them from groups underrepresented in science. I led workshops for teachers to help them find ways to incorporate both local ecosystems and scientific inquiry into their classrooms, while addressing their state-level learning outcomes. I also worked more directly with student: I developed and led activities for afterschool programs; talked to students about what a scientist does, how I became a scientist, and what goes on in their local ecosystems; and planned outdoor excursions for students to experience local ecosystems. I even talked to K-5 students from local schools about my research, teaching them how diversity within species affects communities and having them come up with their own hypotheses about my experiment. Finally, I mentored several undergraduate students who worked with me as research students on this project. These activities helped expand the horizons of students of a variety of ages, whether directly or indirectly through their teachers, and exposed students to ideas, careers and places with which they had had little prior experience.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/17/2020<br>      Modified by: Akana&nbsp;E&nbsp;Noto</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1710782/1710782_10494593_1587163295985_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1710782/1710782_10494593_1587163295985_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Crab enclosure"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1710782/1710782_10494593_1587163295985_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Crab enclosure"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Enclosure for herbivory experiment.
