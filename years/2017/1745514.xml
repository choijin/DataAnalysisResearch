<AbstractNarration>CHANGES is a Coalition of Hispanic, African and Native Americans for the Next Generation of Engineers and Scientists. This unique coalition has the potential to dramatically change the way its constituent organizations function with respect to national level activities that support broadening participation. With fifteen current member organizations, CHANGES has brought together many of the professional societies that target diverse populations to convene a workshop, hosted by the University of Texas at Arlington, during spring 2015. The workshop will facilitate the creation of a strategic plan for broadening participation at the national level, involving the membership of each of the organizations.  A core set of strategic initiatives aimed at leveraging the collective membership to positively impact the STEM workforce, research, and educational communities on a national scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity will advance our knowledge with respect to how this coalition can advance broadening participation efforts. While this type of coalition has been attempted in the past, it failed to gain traction and subsequently disbanded before even really getting started. The workshop and related efforts will: 1) solidify the partnership of CHANGES member organizations to maximize the collective influence for broadening participation in STEM; 2) improve the understanding of partner organizations' programs in order to better coordinate and complement these programs (by taking advantage of other strengths and goals of the individual organizations and enhancing the collective agenda of CHANGES), and 3) identify a core set of strategic activities aimed at leveraging the collective membership of CHANGES to broaden participation and inclusivity in the STEM workforce, research, policy, and educational communities - on a national level. Ultimately, the project will produce a broader understanding of how professional organizations that focus on under-represented populations can effectively collaborate to make a significant impact on the diversity of the STEM national workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Coalition of Hispanic, African and Native Americans for the Next Generation of Engineers and Scientists (CHANGES) formed in 2012 to broaden  the participation of underrepresented minorities in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Architecture by encouraging scientific and technical excellence, fostering workforce development and inclusion, and developing policies and programs that promote STEM workforce diversity.   With a membership comprised of fifteen (15) minority  professional and non-profit organizations, CHANGES represents a combined membership of more than 100,000 individuals. CHANGES membership represents a powerful pool of scientific and technical talent that has, to date, been historically underdeveloped, underutilized, and overlooked as critical stakeholders in addressing America's scientific challenges.  CHANGES received NSF support to organize and conduct a three-day workshop that brought together representatives from each CHANGES partner organization to:                                              1) Solidify  the partnership of CHANGES member organizations and maximize the collective influence for broadening participation in STEM;  2) Improve the understanding of, and insight into  partner organizations'  programs in order to better coordinate and complement these programs to take advantage of strengths and goals of individual organizations and enhance the collective agenda of CHANGES, and  3) Identify  a core set of strategic activities to leverage  the collective membership of CHANGES with a specific purpose to  facilitate broader participation and inclusivity in the STEM workforce, research, policy, and educational communities on a national and global level.

Intellectual Merit : The workshop incorporated best-practices, as identified from previous organizational management, leadership, and diversity-related research endeavors, into the policies, procedures, and activities of CHANGES, and into those of the individual partner constituencies. These practices were used to better inform and implement strategic planning, so that as a collective unit, the Coalition is better prepared to serve  as a substantial force for increasing URM awareness of STEM workforce, research, policy, and educational opportunities. Individual CHANGES partner organizations sponsor grassroots efforts that motivate URMs in STEM and are sought out by industry, university, and government entities to identify and develop potential STEM talent.   CHANGES provides a key support mechanism for the development of next generation of STEM practitioners. Implementation of Workshop goals and activities  solidified organizational structure, established realistic timelines for completing agreed upon tasks, inventoried individual and collective organizational strengths and advanced the development of CHANGES as a collective body, well-equipped to address the need for increased STEM diversity.  Broader Impacts : The workshop?s broader impact addresses the need to strengthen URM participation and leadership in STEM throughout the U.S. The Coalition shares the responsibility with other STEM leaders to inspire, motivate, and prepare the next generations of engineers and scientists to achieve America's innovation and competiveness goals.  Workshop outcomes included: 1) adoption of best practices, strategies, tools, resources, and operations to strengthen the US URM STEM leadership and workforce; 2) identification of strategies to increase national visibility and influence for partner organizations in the development of STEM research, policy and educational programs; 3) a better understanding of the role of complementary non-profit and professional organizations embarking upon collective efforts to broaden and invigorate URM participation in STEM; and 4) plans for a continued national discussion of strategies that can lead to increased participation of URMs throughout STEM workforce, research, policy, and educational pathways.
