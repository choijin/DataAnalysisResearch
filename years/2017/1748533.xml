<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation (NSF) Dear Colleague Letter NSF 17-092: Improving Undergraduate STEM Education in Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) calls for projects to support conferences that will identify the most critical challenges and opportunities regarding undergraduate science, technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) education at HSIs, and potential actionable solutions that fall within NSF's mission, policies, and practices. The University of Houston will host a two-day conference where the most salient challenges and opportunities will be addressed with a special focus on three important transition points for Hispanic STEM students: the transition from high school to post-secondary education; the transition from community college to university; and the transition from college to the workforce or to graduate/professional school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An organizing committee is charged with bringing energy and attention to the three critical aspects of student development that form the conference themes.  The conference will not only make clear what research is currently available, but will also highlight areas critical for further investigation. The conference will include sixty participants for the main agenda, as well as twenty-five presidents and chief academic officers for the "HSI Presidents' Convening". The meeting will be organized and conducted with the goals to: 1) synthesize a well-informed and detailed understanding of the most important challenges facing HSIs now and in the decade, with special attention to college readiness, university readiness, and workforce or graduate/professional school readiness; 2) identify key strategies, initiatives, and programs that are likely to address these challenges and opportunities effectively; and  3) return conferees to their campuses with a strong sense of what is working well on HSI campuses now. The conference will frame an important set of student-transition issues for further discussion and will explore and disseminate practices, programs, and strategies that have been demonstrated empirically to be efficacious.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A 2019 Consensus Report on Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) from the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine pointed out that demographic changes among young people in the US mean that "the educational outcomes and STEM readiness of students of color will have direct implications on America?s economic growth, national security, and global prosperity." Because MSIs disproportionately enroll students of color and are underfunded compared to the non-MSI institutions in their states?even compared to those in the same Carnegie classification?it is urgently important for the intellectual and economic health of the nation that investments in student success at MSIs yield positive results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This project brought representatives from K-12, community colleges, and four-year universities to work toward better understanding the transitions students make from high school to college, from community college to university, and from university to the workforce or graduate/professional school. The objective was to identify not only challenges but also what works at representative institutions, so conferees could make recommendations to the National Science Foundation about future investments in STEM teaching and learning at Hispanic Serving Institutions. This conference was one of several funded by NSF for this purpose, and the Investigators for this grant participated in a wider discussion with the teams from the other conferences.&nbsp;</p> <p>The conference and follow-up conversations brought focus to three important issues facing HSIs?issues NSF can assist in addressing right away. The first is the gap in math skills and knowledge for high school graduates entering college, especially for students who went to under-performing schools. As the conferees noted in their discussions, these students have not been set up to succeed, and far too many never really get their feet under them in STEM majors at university. Indeed, it is highly likely that under-preparation in math is a leading cause of attrition from STEM fields among university students from low-income, first generation in college, and under-represented minority backgrounds.</p> <p>This is too often true even of students who did well in high school math. This is particularly troubling, because these students have every indication from their high school courses and grades that they are fully ready for university-level work, only to struggle in lower-division, introductory math courses.&nbsp;They have been set up to fail.</p> <p>NSF can help with this by funding more work on effective math teaching and learning at HSIs, with a focus on the transition from high school to university. The universities will not be able to bring about better outcomes for a wider range of students until this basic issue is studied and remedies are identified. The math education community has a good sense of what works poorly or not at all, but there is much less consensus on what works.&nbsp;</p> <p>The second issue the conference brought to light is the near-complete lack of conversation between community colleges and universities on how to support their shared students. In most cases, state-imposed articulation requirements take the place of real collaboration. Universities accept community college credits as equivalent because they are required to do so by law or policy, but only infrequently is there any attempt to ensure that lower-division community colleges are, in fact, preparatory for success in upper-division university courses. Most 'partner' institutions do not even share data on how students do once they make the transition.&nbsp;</p> <p>NSF can help with this by suggesting or requiring that the teaching and learning research and student-support projects it funds though the HSI grant competition give specific attention to this issue?that PIs are aware of it and, where appropriate, addressing it in their research or programming plans.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>A final issue of focus for this project is the relative lack of diversity among college and university faculties compared to their student bodies. Some of this is due to swift changes in demography and is therefore a function of age, but even accounting for this, there is reason to be concerned about the pipeline from university to graduate school and into the professorate. Research shows that lack of mentors who look like our students has important effects on students' feelings of disciplinary belonging.&nbsp;</p> <p>NSF for decades funded projects and programs at particular institutions that support broader participation in STEM. NSF has already moved to a hub system for supporting institutions that have not been frequent applicants for NSF funding. The Foundation might also consider prioritizing further cross-institution work, including the strategic development of post-doctoral programs at HSIs that have a focus on training students from other HSIs.&nbsp;</p> <p>While the challenges ahead in maintaining global leadership in STEM in the face of shifting demography and the further growth of wealth inequality are daunting, those who engaged this project saw hope in attention to math transitions, collaboration between two- and four-year schools, and strategic pipelines toward doctoral degrees and post-doctoral positions for students at HSIs.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/25/2019<br>      Modified by: Andrew&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hamilton</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1748533/1748533_10509279_1577313711143_FileFeb17,32505PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1748533/1748533_10509279_1577313711143_FileFeb17,32505PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="UH HSI Conference 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1748533/1748533_10509279_1577313711143_FileFeb17,32505PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="UH HSI Conference 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">An NSF staffer addressing participants at the UH HSI Conference</div> <div class="imageCredit">Andrew Hamilton</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Andrew&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hamilton</div> <div class="imageTitle">UH HSI Conference 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1748533/1748533_10509279_1577313843800_27983278_2022416674695316_1359973274280622100_o--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1748533/1748533_10509279_1577313843800_27983278_2022416674695316_1359973274280622100_o--rgov-800width.jpg" title="UH HSI Conference 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1748533/1748533_10509279_1577313843800_27983278_2022416674695316_1359973274280622100_o--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="UH HSI Conference 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">PI Andrew Hamilton addressing the conferees</div> <div class="imageCredit">Andrew Hamilton</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Andrew&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hamilton</div> <div class="imageTitle">UH HSI Conference 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1748533/1748533_10509279_1577313953636_27971572_10155498669814891_1603164798715639025_n--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1748533/1748533_10509279_1577313953636_27971572_10155498669814891_1603164798715639025_n--rgov-800width.jpg" title="UH HSI Conference 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1748533/1748533_10509279_1577313953636_27971572_10155498669814891_1603164798715639025_n--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="UH HSI Conference 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Conferees discuss challenges in a break-out session</div> <div class="imageCredit">Andrew Hamilton</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Andrew&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hamilton</div> <div class="imageTitle">UH HSI Conference 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1748533/1748533_10509279_1577314097091_FileFeb17,34831PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1748533/1748533_10509279_1577314097091_FileFeb17,34831PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="UH HSI Conference 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1748533/1748533_10509279_1577314097091_FileFeb17,34831PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="UH HSI Conference 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">UH Chancellor and President Renu Khator being introduced to conferees about undergraduate student Laura Duarte</div> <div class="imageCredit">Andrew Hamilton</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Andrew&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hamilton</div> <div class="imageTitle">UH HSI Conference 4</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
