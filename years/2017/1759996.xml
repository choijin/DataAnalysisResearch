<AbstractNarration>Windstorms and associated hazards, such as storm surge, routinely cause the most building damage of any natural hazard in the United States. To mitigate this damage, it is important to understand the relationship between wind speed and its characteristics and the resulting building damage.  On 25 August 2017, Hurricane Harvey struck the coast of Texas as a Category 4 hurricane with a rare combination of high wind speeds and significant storm surge.  Preliminary reconnaissance showed that residential building performance in coastal communities in Texas exposed to the brunt of Hurricane Harvey's impacts was highly variable, even for similar building types that should have experienced similar wind speeds and storm surge levels. This variability demonstrates gaps in the fundamental knowledge of the relationship between hurricane hazards and building damage. This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) will support field data collection on residential building performance during Hurricane Harvey in order to fill these gaps by formally evaluating the hurricane hazard-to-building damage relationship through direct observation. A better understanding of the hazard-to-damage relationship and the factors that influence it can be used to advance hurricane-resistant building design methodologies and society's resilience to windstorms. All data acquired during the field work will be shared with the engineering research community through the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot available at https://www.designsafe-ci.org. The collected building performance data, matched with wind speed observations or estimates, will provide a library of engineering case studies for use in the classroom to educate the next generation of engineers and architects on the impacts of hurricanes on buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current building design and damage prediction methods assume that windstorm damage is primarily a function of standardized wind speed magnitude, local terrain, and building characteristics, implicitly ignoring any potential differences between extreme wind event types for the same given wind speed, and any effects from potentially coexisting hazards such as storm surge.  The goals of this RAPID project are to 1) collect a representative, spatially-referenced database of residential building performance during Hurricane Harvey, 2) develop hurricane fragility functions for wind based on the field data collected, and 3) establish a framework for evaluating the effects of enhanced hazard conditions, such as storm surge or mesovortices within the hurricane eyewall, in addition to high winds, and other extreme wind events such as tornadoes, on the wind-to-damage relationship.  Residential building damage data will be collected, from major areas with significant building stock along the impacted Texas coastline, by a team of researchers and graduate students from Auburn University, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and University of Maryland. A guided cluster sampling approach over a large spatial area will be used to conduct detailed, ground-based surveys of single-family residential structures with geo-tagged photographs and field notes. The collected data will include the damage ratios for all major building components, characteristics of the building such as construction material and number of stories, and any evidence that could be used to estimate wind speed or storm surge height. The fragility functions developed from the empirical data will be used to facilitate the comparisons between wind-to-damage relationships, demonstrating differences in expected building performance during wind-only, wind and storm surge, and tornado events.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ BACKGROUND  Hurricanes continue to cause catastrophic impacts to communities in the United States due to the extreme winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall they bring. The collection of perishable data on building and infrastructure performance post-huricane is critical to advancing our understanding of the individual hazards and their impacts, and to enhancing life safety and minimizing damage from future events.   Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Port Aransas on August 25, 2017 as a Category IV hurricane. Wind gusts over 130 mph were measured in Rockport, TX before Harvey moved further inland, causing historical flooding in and around Houston, TX. This project focused on engineering assessments of wind and surge damage to buildings in coastal cities and communities of Texas including Rockport, Fulton, Port Aransas, Portland, Sinton, Seadrift, and more.   The objective of this project was to document perishable building performance data following Hurricane Harvey (2017) with the intent to better understand, by observation, the fundamental, probabilistic relationship between hurricane intensity and damage.  INTELLECTUAL MERIT   The project focused primarily on structural engineering assessments of residential buildings impacted by high winds and storm surge. Teams supported by this project conducted a total of 1,177 individual building assessments in coastal Texas, while also documenting street sign failures, high water marks, and other hazard indicators that can be used to infer characteristics of the hurricane hazards such as wind direction and storm surge inundation height.   The primary outcome of this project is the complete, quality controlled dataset of building assessments and hazard indicators published through the NSF DesignSafe CyberInfrastructure (doi:10.17603/DS2DX22). The database includes descriptions of the observed damage to each building, geotagged photographs of the post-hurricane condition of the building, and a number of key building attributes such as year built, roof shape, number of stories, construction materials, and first floor elevation.   The detail contained within the database is allowing researchers to examine more precisely the various factors that cause the observed building performance, and attribute damage or lack of damage to the proper factors. Ultimately, this database is allowing researchers to more precisely identify what is causing the damage being observed after extreme windstorms, so that solutions can be developed and integrated for the mitigation of future hurricane impacts.  BROADER IMPACTS  The published dataset is ideally suited for integration with other non-engineering studies, such as radar observations of the Hurricane Harvey wind field, longitudinal studies of community recovery, and explorations of homeowner pre- and post-hurricane behavior.  Research findings from the project have been shared at nine domestic and international conferences and research meetings, including a multidisciplinary research symposium held at Port Aransas, TX (close to the landfall location of Hurricane Harvey) that was attended by local residents and community officials. Findings have also been published in two conference proceedings and the American Association for Wind Engineering quarterly newsletter.
