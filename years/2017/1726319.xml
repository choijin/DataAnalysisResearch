<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;To truly understand the connections between the structure of materials and their properties, it is necessary to study them across a wide range of length scales using multiple analytical techniques. However, it is often difficult to precisely link the various lines of research data generated from experiments performed using an assortment of different specialized instruments into a single, cohesive picture. The environmental scanning electron microscope purchased through this grant directly addresses this challenge by integrating a large array of powerful imaging and analysis modalities into one unified platform. The transformational capabilities and experiments enabled by this instrument will have a major impact on materials-oriented research and education at The Ohio State University and across the region. This instrument enables educators to develop new courses on cutting-edge microscopy methods for both local and remote students, as well as innovative interactive teleconference based outreach activities that touch the lives of young learners. The new modes of outreach enabled by this microscope make it possible to reach a large number of K-12 students, including populations that are typically underserved in such activities such as hearing-impaired students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;Researchers at The Ohio State University, as well as across the State of Ohio, use the microscope's novel combination of high-resolution imaging, data-rich analytical methods, and in-situ testing and manipulation to probe a wide range of length scales and create advanced experimental methods for multidisciplinary materials science research. The simultaneous and/or precisely correlated application of multiple analysis modalities (imaging, diffraction, plus chemical and electronic property measurements) and in-situ sample manipulation capabilities (heating, cooling, mechanical stress, and environment) empower the discovery of new scientific knowledge and make possible transformational advances in critical materials fields, including advanced functional materials, high-performance structural materials, and forward-looking engineered biomaterials. Of particular focus are meso-scale heterogeneities within a material's structure and composition, the study of which clarifies the important linkages from individual dislocations, grain substructure, and damage initiation to full-scale devices, polycrystal aggregates, and bioengineered fibers and tissue scaffolds. These studies allow researchers to fill critical gaps in the fundamental understanding of meso-scale phenomena and structure-property relationships within the atoms-to-applications continuum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The active period for this award was 09/01/2017 - 08/31/2019. In that time, the instrument was fully designed, acquired, and installed, with final commissioning and vendor check-off occurring in May 2019. Multiple users from a range of research groups from a number of different departments (MSE, ECE, MechE, Geology), persuing a range of topics--semiconductors, geology/earth sciences, metallurgy, welding, and biomaterials--at The Ohio State University have been trained on the unique aspects of this new microscope and a number of different investigations have occurred thus far.

These early experiments, and multiple others that have thus far been performed, have clearly shown the power of a well-designed instrument for multi-modal and/or highly-correlated SEM-based characterization for a range of important materials research areas.  In terms of broader impact, introduction of this instrument into education and outreach activities is at an early stage, but already there is a benefit and positive impact on the research quality of all of the students that have thus far been trained and making use of it.  Discussions of the capabilities of this new and unique microscope are now being included in SEM training workshops (for both internal and external users) run by the microscopy center, and lab course instructors are beginning to work on exploring how to make use of this instrument’s unique capabilities in their activities.
