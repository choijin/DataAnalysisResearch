<AbstractNarration>This project will analyze how the type and timing of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) affect the well-being and resilience of children with autism.  This project will advance understanding of how the type and timing of adverse childhood events affects children with autism and similar vulnerable populations within the fields of sociology, disability studies, and public health, expand current theory to include disability, and inform potential interventions to reduce adverse events in families of children with autism and other vulnerable populations. The broader impacts of this study include contributions to individuals with autism and their families by promoting an increased presence of the experiences of people with autism into current theory and creating knowledge about how children with autism cope with adverse events.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Autism is a lifelong developmental disability estimated to affect 1 in 68 U.S. children. Compared to their peers, this population experiences a variety of health disparities, including decreased well-being, increased family stress, and significantly more adverse childhood experiences (e.g., psychological, physical, or sexual abuse, and/or household dysfunction). Remaining unknowns include: (1) how these disparities may be connected (e.g., does family stress lead to more adverse childhood experiences, which in turn leads to decreased well-being?); (2) how autism itself, as well as the timing of the diagnostic process for autism, may enhance these disparities; (3) how the combination of these disparities may affect life course trajectories of individuals with autism; and (4) how children with autism cope with family stress or adverse experiences. This project will fill in these gaps in the literature by answering three primary questions. Firstly, How is age of diagnosis associated with ACEs (e.g., do these events primarily occur prior to, during, or post diagnosis)? Secondly, For children with autism, how are ACEs related to health, internalizing behavior, externalizing behavior, and academic performance? Thirdly, Does an expanded construction of resilience (including both internal and external characteristics) mediate the relationship between ACEs and well-being for children with autism? This study requires the collection of original data through a survey instrument, which will be disseminated online to parents of children with autism in five states (Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Montana, and Utah). Disability organizations in each of these states have agreed to distribute the online survey link to potential participants through their electronic listservs. A minimum of 300 parent responses will be collected to provide a large enough sample size for the necessary quantitative analyses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to understand how the timing and variability of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) affects the well-being of children with autism, and which aspects of resiliency are beneficial for coping with adverse events among this population.  In relation to intellectual merit, findings from this study advance knowledge regarding the experience of ACEs among children with autism and expanded current conceptualizations of ACEs, family instability, and resiliency to include the experience of this vulnerable population.  Results indicate that specific sub-groups of children with autism (namely those who are poor, of Hispanic ethnicity, and/or who are diagnosed late) are at the highest risk of experiencing adverse events over time.  Further, the children who experience the most ACEs over time have the poorest well-being. Finally, when measured more thoroughly (to include both internal and external characteristics), resiliency is a helpful coping mechanism for children with autism.  Internal resiliency characteristics (such as calmness and flexibility) were found to be especially important in this population.  This information may be used to inform interventions targeted at increasing resiliency skills among children with autism, and especially among the sub-groups experiencing the most adverse events.  In addition to producing scientific knowledge regarding the experience and timing of ACEs and their effect on well-being as well as the role resiliency plays in coping with ACEs among children with autism, this study has several broader impacts.  First, this study promotes an increased presence of the experience of individuals with autism into several major theories (such as the life course perspective and the stress paradigms).  Expanding sociological theory to make it more inclusive of various populations is important for truly understanding how families, communities, and societies function.  Second, the original data collected for this study will be available to the public.  This data sharing will benefit society and further increase scientific knowledge regarding this population.  Third, findings from this study promote enhanced well-being for individuals with autism and other similar vulnerable populations.  Results can be used to inform the development of interventions aimed at decreasing stress and ACEs, increasing resiliency, and improving well-being and quality of life for families of children with autism and related disabilities.
