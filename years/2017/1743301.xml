<AbstractNarration>The archaeological record is uniquely positioned to inform modern strategies for social adaptation to current and future climate because of its deep time perspective of how a wide range of societies successfully or unsuccessfully adapted to changing environmental conditions. However, archaeological research is rarely incorporated into current debates because the archaeological evidence for human response to environmental change is typically at a scale too large (e.g., subsistence shifts, changing settlement patterns, and migration) for the average person to find meaningful to everyday life. This project takes advantage of a unique opportunity to study localized variation within the archaeological context of the largest pre-Columbian settlement in North America to determine human decision making to changes related to fluctuating water tables at yearly, decadal, semicentennial, and centennial scales. By establishing a chronology of localized variation associated with urban construction history, researchers will address questions about how urban societal response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the direction of Dr. Tristram Kidder, Ms. Caitlin Rankin will study construction chronology and localized environmental sequence at a wetland mound and plaza group within the urban central precinct of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Cahokia Mounds in southern Illinois. The investigators will collect and analyze a continuous series of soil samples taken from mound, sub-mound, plaza, and sub-plaza contexts with a variety of scientific methods including stable carbon isotope analysis, grain size distribution analysis, loss-on-ignition, magnetic susceptibility, and soil micromorphology to determine environmental conditions through time. Archaeological excavations will be conducted at the edge of mounds and within plaza limits to determine the use and construction history of the wetland mound and plaza group. Bayesian statistics will be used to refine a chronology for both environmental and construction history. Investigators will utilize a risk management perspective to address social response by determining if the people of Cahokia invested labor to maintain the space to its original design and function or if they choose to adapt the function and the design of the space to new environmental conditions. This project will provide the data for Ms. Rankin's doctoral dissertation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Many archaeologists argue that studying past human response to climate change can be helpful in informing future strategies to adapt to modern effects of climate change; however, archaeological research is rarely utilized in climate change policy. Much of archaeological research involves forming hypotheses to explain observations of past phenomena. However, the advancement of knowledge requires a back and forth between hypothesis forming and hypothesis testing. I argue that a lack engagement in hypothesis testing has stalled the advancement in archaeological knowledge on the relationship between humans and their environment. Ultimately, it is this stall in the advancement of knowledge that makes archaeological research irrelevant to the fast paced and evolving demands of climate change policy. In this doctoral dissertation project, I use Cahokia Mounds as a case study of an archaeological site where untested hypotheses related to the relationship between humans and their environment have persisted in academic literature and public discourse for decades. First, I address a hypothesis that deforestation caused increased flooding at the end of Cahokia's occupation. I use stratigraphic analysis of archaeological excavations conducted in the floodplain of Cahokia Creek to demonstrate that geomorphic conditions were stable from Mississippian occupation (AD 1050 -1400) until the Industrial Era (mid-1800s). The presence of a stable ground surface from Mississippian occupation to the Industrial Era does not support the expectations of the deforestation hypothesis. Ultimately, this research demonstrates that pre-Colombian ecological change does not inherently cause geomorphic change, and narratives of ecocide related to geomorphic change need to be validated with the stratigraphic record. Second, I address a hypothesis that regional trends of drought caused food insecurity at the end of Cahokia's occupation. I rely on stable carbon isotope data of buried soil horizons as a proxy of dominant vegetation ground cover changes through time. These data show local ecological resilience to regional trends of drought, demonstrating that the assumed ecological effects of climate change are not universally inherent. Third, I address the hypothesis that the North Plaza complex was drier than modern times during the construction and utilization of this space. The hypothesis that the North Plaza was dry during Mississippian occupation is generally accepted because it fits into preconceived notions about the use of plaza space. I rely on stratigraphic and stable carbon isotope datasets to demonstrate that the North Plaza was a wetland during the construction and utilization this space. Ultimately, the North Plaza hypothesis is great example of how preconceived notions in archaeology can give leeway to accept untested hypotheses. Moving forward, I suggest archaeologists need to be more conscious of the assumptions that are built into explanations of past phenomena and that we should continue to develop research agendas capable of testing these assumptions.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/27/2020<br>      Modified by: Caitlin&nbsp;G&nbsp;Rankin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743301/1743301_10523617_1582838848631_DJI_0517--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743301/1743301_10523617_1582838848631_DJI_0517--rgov-800width.jpg" title="A North Plaza Perceptive"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743301/1743301_10523617_1582838848631_DJI_0517--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="A North Plaza Perceptive"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">View of Monks Mound from the perspective of the North Plaza, Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site, Illinois</div> <div class="imageCredit">Matthew Gush</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Caitlin&nbsp;G&nbsp;Rankin</div> <div class="imageTitle">A North Plaza Perceptive</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743301/1743301_10523617_1582838775227_Caitlin_Trowel--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743301/1743301_10523617_1582838775227_Caitlin_Trowel--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Archaeologist at Work"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743301/1743301_10523617_1582838775227_Caitlin_Trowel--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Archaeologist at Work"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Graduate student Caitlin Rankin prepares excavation walls for photography and mapping</div> <div class="imageCredit">Matthew Gush</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Caitlin&nbsp;G&nbsp;Rankin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Archaeologist at Work</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743301/1743301_10523617_1582838663167_Mound5_Excavations--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743301/1743301_10523617_1582838663167_Mound5_Excavations--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Mound 5 Excavations"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743301/1743301_10523617_1582838663167_Mound5_Excavations--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Mound 5 Excavations"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Ariel view of archaeological investigations of Mound 5 at Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site, Illinois</div> <div class="imageCredit">Matthew Gush</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Caitlin&nbsp;G&nbsp;Rankin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Mound 5 Excavations</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
