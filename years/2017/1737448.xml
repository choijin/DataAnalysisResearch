<AbstractNarration>When an asteroid is hit by another large solar system object, it can break apart and become many asteroids all of which have similar orbits.  These smaller asteroids that were formed during the break-ups are the rocks that fall to Earth: smaller pieces of the asteroids are meteorites, and larger pieces become those asteroids that could threaten Earth with a big impact.  Those asteroids that all come from one original asteroid are called a "family."  Astronomers use telescopes and instruments to look at the types of rocks on the asteroids in the families we find today to see if they have similar compositions.  Comparing the orbits and the compositions in an asteroid family gives us information on how long ago the break-up of the asteroid parent happened.  The Principal Investigator will observe about 35 asteroids near the large asteroid (6) Hebe to learn their compositions and, from that, their possible family beginning.  This research serves the national interest by promoting the progress of planetary astronomy, as well as providing information to secure national defense and welfare when Earth is threatened by the possible impact of a large asteroid.  The project will include students, aiming especially to identify female and disabled students as possible, to teach them how a scientific study is conducted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asteroid families are a collection of objects formed during the collisional breakup of a parent asteroid or as the ejecta from a large impact onto a parent body.  These events are major sources of the meteoroids that fall to Earth as meteorites, and of the Earth-approaching objects which constitute a potential impact hazard.  Asteroid families eventually diffuse orbitally to become the background asteroid population; as such, the time scale of diffusion constrains the ages of families and the collisional rate in the asteroid belt.  The H-chondrite meteorites exhibit a range of metamorphism suggesting deep excavation from their parent body, and spectral properties similar to asteroid (6) Hebe.  This research seeks a spectroscopic investigation of 35 asteroids in the dynamical region near Hebe to test for the presence of a small dynamical family of H-chondrite composition.  Detection or non-detection of such a family would place constraints on the formation of impact-generated families by providing data to the modeling community to test orbital diffusion models in regions proximate to resonances, as well as provide an explanation for the diverse thermal histories of the H-chondrites.  The proposed research effort would also provide a strong test of spectroscopic and dynamical predictions regarding asteroid family identification.  The PI will also focus on recruiting and teaching students, emphasizing female and disabled individuals as possible, the specific scientific investigation and writing techniques that would prepare them to become strong, diverse scientists and educators in the globally competitive STEM workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Intrinsic Merit:  The fundamental science question addressed in this research concerns the evolution of asteroid families, and more specifically, Does Asteroid (6) Hebe have a genetic family and is it the reason for the range of H-chondrite metamorphic grades?  Hebe has been identified dynamically and spectroscopically as the H-chondrite parent body. The H-chondrites exhibit a range of metamorphism suggesting deep excavation from the parent body, an event expected to form a family.

This research initiated a limited spectroscopic investigation of 36 asteroids near Hebe between 2009 and 2018 using the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility?s SpeX instrument to test for the presence of a small dynamical family of H-chondrite composition.    Of the acquired 36 asteroid spectra: 16 were featureless, 1 contained a single absorption feature, 16 exhibited two absorption features, and 3 were deemed unusable due to poor quality.  The interpretation of asteroid spectra with two absorption features began with the extraction and interpretation of Band Centers and the Band Area Ratio, which we used to determine the surface mineralogy.  The results of the parametric analysis revealed nine asteroids that have an H-chondrite mineralogy. We conclude that asteroids with H-chondrite mineralogies reside on both sides of the 3:1 Kirkwood Gap, and this implies that (6) Hebe does have an old-dispersed family, as well as provides spectral evidence for Bottke?s (2000) hypothesis of resonance jumping.    The Broader Impacts of the research resulted in:  An increase in the participation of disabled individuals in the US workforce, as well as a gain in diversity and equal opportunity in society. The NSF grant provided a pathway for the PI (I am disabled) to obtain a tenure track position at a research university resulting in a gain in diversity and equal opportunity in society.
