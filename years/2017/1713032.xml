<AbstractNarration>Applications in diverse fields, including data analysis, convex geometry, biology, physics, economics, engineering, operations research, and computer science, give rise to questions about random phenomena in high dimensions. For example, given data that lives in a high-dimensional space, what information can be obtained by studying lower-dimensional projections of the data? Given a large number of interacting agents, who strategically make choices based only on their own state and the distribution of states of the other agents, what do their equilibria (or optimal strategies) look like? This award supports the development of diverse mathematical techniques for the analysis of such questions.  The focus will be on characterizing large deviations from typical behavior, which though rare, are often of crucial importance in applications. The investigator will help train new mathematics researchers, mentor early career researchers, and be involved in outreach efforts.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research will address three topics concerning high-dimensional random phenomena. The first involves the study of random projections of probability measures in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces.  This is relevant both for the statistical analysis of high-dimensional data, as well as for asymptotic convex geometry and asymptotic functional analysis. The focus is on characterizing the large deviation behavior of such random projections, as the dimension goes to infinity. This is of interest because, unlike fluctuations, the large deviation behavior is non-universal and thus distinguishes between different high-dimensional distributions. The second topic considers properties of high-dimensional Gibbs distributions on a class of hard-core configurations associated with a graph. Whereas classical models assume discrete spins, the focus of this research is on versions with continuous spins, which exhibit quite different behavior and require new techniques for their analysis. The last topic concerns the analysis of fluctuations, large deviations and concentration inequalities for Nash equilibria in both static and dynamic games of mean-field type with a large number of rational agents. This has implications for a broad range of applications and entails the development of new mathematical techniques, including large deviations principles for set-valued random elements, and analysis of solutions to a master equation for mean-field games.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:   The project focused on three research themes related to the analysis of stochastic systems, using a combination of techniques from game theory, stochastic analysis, convex geometry, Fourier analysis and the theory of Gibbs measures and phase transitions.  Many-player games arise in a variety of applications ranging from economics to engineering and Nash equilibria of games are notoriously hard to compute exactly, even for games with a small number of players.  The goal of the first theme was to obtain asymptotic approximations of Nash equilibria for classes of symmetric games with many players, in both static and dynamic settings. Whereas the convergence of Nash equilibria to equilibria of the so-called limiting mean-field game (MFG) had been previously established in many settings, we obtained the first refined convergence results for stochastic differential games that (under suitable conditions) quantify this rate of convergence. In particular, we characterized (via a central limit theorem) fluctuations of the Nash equilibria from the MFG equilibrium for a fixed number of players (via concentration estimates) and probabilities of large deviations of Nash equilibria from the MFG equilibrium (in the form of large deviation principles).  Along the way, we also obtained new deviation and concentration results for interacting processes (i.e., in the absence of strategic behavior), which arises in a broad range of models in physics and biology, and initiated the study of asymptotic limits of asymmetric interacting particle systems.   We also obtained new deviation results for symmetric static games, in situations where the associated Cournot-Nash equilibria of the corresponding limit static mean-field game may be non-unique.  The second theme involves the study of high-dimensional measures, which model high-dimensional data or volume measures of convex bodies that play an important role in the local theory of Banach spaces.  Specifically, since it is typically challenging to directly study the high-dimensional measures themselves, a natural alternative is to examine lower-dimensional projections, and determine what information can be gleaned from them. Existing results (such as the central limit theorem for convex sets) had largely focused on universality results, which show that under suitable conditions the fluctuations of lower-dimensional random projections are Gaussian. While interesting and elegant, such results do not provide the means to distinguish between many classes of quite different high-dimensional objects.

We showed that these are non-universal, in the sense that this exponential decay rate is different for different classes of high-dimensional measures, and thus can be used to distinguish them.  In addition, for the particular class of lp balls, which are of particular interest in Banach space theory, we established refined estimates that provide more accurate quantitative estimates of tail probabilities for a fixed high-dimensional measure and also developed computational algorithms for computing the probabilities of rare events, or equivalently, measure outliers in the data.  Finally, the third theme entailed the study of a continuous version of a well-studied model called the hard-core model, which models phenomena in physics and communication networks. phase transitions in certain continuum models, motivated by the question of the complexity of computation of volumes of high-dimensional convex bodies. We showed that, in contrast to the original discrete model, the continuous model on a regular tree does not exhibit any phase transitions.     Broader impacts:  The project is interdisciplinary, with the techniques and results developed being of relevance in many applications, including game theory, engineering, asymptotic convex geometry, high-dimensional statistics and statistical physics.   The techniques developed are of broader applicability and are being used by other members of the mathematical community.  For example, the approach developed for refined convergence of Nash equilibria of stochastic differential games has been used by other authors to study games on finite state spaces. In addition, our work has spawned various other related studies of large deviation behavior in asymptotic convex geometry. The PI has also developed several new topics courses in these areas.   The project involved the training of two post-doctoral fellows, one female graduate student, who was enabled to travel and present her works at conferences, and four undergraduate student projects (three female).  The PI also disseminated her work widely, and gave four short courses to students and researchers in three continents (America, Asia and Europe) in the last few years.  The PI was also active in outreach, by leading the Math CoOp, a group dedicated to developing and giving presentations to local elementary, middle and high schools.  During this period, the PI served as Deputy Director of ICERM (the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics), was a member of several scientific advisory boards and served on multiple editorial boards and committees that serve the broader mathematical community.
