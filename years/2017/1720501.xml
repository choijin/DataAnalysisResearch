<AbstractNarration>This project will study the transformation of quantum information from microwave electronic devices to optical elements via opto-electromechanical interfaces. Passing information with high fidelity (sometimes called state-conversion) between these devices would facilitate the construction of a hybrid quantum network, a form of quantum computer. Such hybrid networks could be scaled up in size more easily than some other proposed quantum computer architectures, and they are designed to exploit the various strengths of their component subsystems.  Because mechanical motion can be coupled to electromagnetic fields at frequencies ranging from acoustic to optical wavelengths, opto-electromechanical interfaces made of mechanical resonators and cavity photons provide a promising candidate to advance this goal. This project will design interfaces with which quantum information can be transmitted uni-directionally while simultaneously preventing noise transmission. The time-dependence of the couplings will also be studied to better engineer the shape of photon pulses. Ideal pulse shape ensures high-fidelity photon absorption or information retrieval from a quantum bit. This project also includes educational and STEM activities that can broaden the participation of women and minority students. These activities include course development, women-STEM lectures, Student Physics Society activities, and Bobcat day events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description. This project supports the study of quantum state conversion between microwave and optical photons via hybrid optoelectromechanical interface. Hybrid quantum devices are composed of distinctively different subsystems. By exploiting the strength of each subsystem, hybrid devices can facilitate the construction of scalable quantum computers. An essential question in hybrid quantum networks bridging microwave and optical frequencies is how to achieve noiseless and lossless transmission of quantum information between the subsystems. The objectives of this project include (1) designing optoelectromechanical interfaces for nonreciprocal state conversion and routing between microwave and optical photons and (2) developing numerical methods to control the pulse shape of photons transmitted through optoelectromechanical interfaces. Nonreciprocal state conversion controls the direction of state flow and prevents noise from being spread to other parts of the quantum network. The group will design nonreciprocal interfaces operated under optimal conditions with significantly reduced mechanical noise. The effective gauge phase between the linearized light-matter couplings will be studied to achieve this goal. Meanwhile, the pulse shape of incoming photons is crucial for achieving high-fidelity storage or retrieval of photon state from a quantum bit. The team will use an optimal control technique to design time-dependent electro- and opto-mechanical couplings to achieve desirable pulse shape. This project can provide insights on the potential and limitation of hybrid quantum networks and deepen our understanding of the role of quantum interfaces in hybrid systems.</AbstractNarration>
