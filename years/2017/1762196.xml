<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for the annual Clinic on Dynamic Approaches to Infectious Disease Data (DAIDD) to be held in December, 2017. DAIDD will train U.S. scientists in the mathematical modeling of infectious disease dynamics. Mathematics and simulation are essential tools in infectious disease control, enabling decision-makers to explore control policies before implementing them, interpret trends, plan empirical studies, and predict emerging threats. Over the past decade, integration of the fields of mathematical epidemiology and biomedical epidemiology has increased in research practice; however, training options provide few opportunities for integration in the classroom. This clinic addresses this gap by offering participants exposure to a broad range of concepts and techniques from both epidemiological traditions. The clinic will provide a conceptual foundation for integrating dynamic modeling approaches with empirical infectious diseases research. It is aimed at participants without substantial experience in scientific computing or in mathematical modeling. Training will focus on how the complex dynamics of pathogen transmission influence study design and data collection for applied problems in infectious disease research. Training will also prepare participants to pursue their research goals after the clinic. Participants will develop the skills necessary to identify which research questions can and cannot benefit from a dynamic modeling approach. In addition, because the Clinic will also include scientists from Africa, it will provide opportunities for U.S. scientists to build a network of international collaborators. All pedagogic material will be made publicly available online so that they can be used for self-instruction by those unable to attend the Clinic or to be incorporated into teaching materials for other courses.</AbstractNarration>

Presented as part of the International Clinics on Infectious Disease Dynamics and Data (ICI3D) Program, this Clinic brought together graduate students and early career researchers from North America and Africa to learn about the conceptual foundations of dynamical modelling of infectious diseases and formulate their own research questions in line with these concepts. DAIDD 2017 was hosted by the University of Georgia&rsquo;s Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. There were 23 student participants, 13 from the US (supported directly from this grant), 9 from Africa (supported by the South African Centre for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis), and 1 from elsewhere (supported through other funds). The workshop faculty included 5 core faculty of the ICI3D Program and 2 Workshop Faculty, bringing together expertise from the US, Canada, and Africa. The Clinic included a diverse set of pedagogical approaches including lectures, computer tutorials, discussions, group work, and individual work. Through several of the Clinic exercises and group and one-&shy;on-&shy;one mentorship with DAIDD faculty, each DAIDD participant developed (1) an iteratively refined research question for an infectious disease modeling project, based on their own research projects and interests, (2) a short written proposal for a dynamical modeling approach that would address this research question, and (3) a schematic diagram of the dynamic model they would use to execute the proposed research. An open access, citable repository of pedagogical materials developed through the ICI3D program, including materials developed or refined at DAIDD 2017, is available through the ICI3D Figshare Repository (DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3788224).</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/18/2018<br>      Modified by: Juliet&nbsp;R&nbsp;Pulliam</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
