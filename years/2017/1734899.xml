<AbstractNarration>Increasing the number of underrepresented groups earning engineering degrees is critical to the United States' economic competitiveness and national security. Because of its importance, greater attention has been placed on the country's need for a strong engineering workforce and how to meet the growing demand for engineers, especially among underrepresented groups. On behalf of the Association for Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU), the investigators outlined a comprehensive research project with four specific objectives: (1) assessing the number of degrees awarded over time in engineering by all colleges and universities and by race and ethnicity, gender, and engineering discipline utilizing the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data Systems Completion Survey, conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics; (2) comparing projections in engineering degrees and projections in the engineering academic and nonacademic workforce from datasets, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Projections, to more accurately assess where engineering workforce shortages persist across specific engineering disciplines; (3) convening and engaging esteemed scholars, industry leaders, and university administrators and thought leaders to review collective data to better understand key shortage areas in engineering disciplines to establish a baseline that broadening participation leaders can use to better frame their projects; and (4) organizing current data sources and metrics into a publicly accessible resource available to engineering educators, social and behavioral scientists, and education researchers and policymakers to easily compare and analyze engineering degree awards' employment data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By highlighting recent trends at the national and institutional level and determining mismatches in supply and demand, this research  project will assist engineering education leaders, stakeholders, and policymakers in developing targeted efforts to broaden participation in specific engineering disciplines among projected shortages will exist. By convening university leaders from institutions seeking to broaden participation in engineering, it is likely that partnerships and collaborations will be established across various institutions, experts, and engineering societies to address the dearth of underrepresented groups throughout the engineering enterprise. As another major outcome from this research project, the investigators proposed to develop a robust online tool, combining several national datasets, to build institutional metrics as way to assist various stakeholders and researchers with making peer and aspirational institutional comparisons. Other project deliverables include the production of two major reports, such as The Status Report on Engineering Education Volume I: A 5-year Trend Analysis of Engineering degrees awarded at the national and institutional level to determine which colleges and universities are successful at graduating Traditionally Underrepresented Groups in Specific Engineering Disciplines and The Status Report on Engineering Education Volume II: A Detailed Analysis of Projections for Engineering Degrees and the Engineering Academic and Nonacademic Workforce. Both reports will provide useful information, not commonly produced by U.S. governmental agencies and non-governmental entities. Further, the two reports will be widely disseminated among APLU's member and non-member institutions of higher learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[To thrive economically and address major challenges, such as a changing climate and international security, the nation relies on the considerable contribution of engineers.   Engineering occupations are some of the highest-paying and most prestigious in the US labor market, but they are also some of the least diverse.  This relative lack of diversity is an issue of social equity, and also increasingly one of ensuring a sufficient supply of engineers to fill the jobs to keep the economy strong. Intellectual merit -- in two important reports, this project explored the key components to the present state of engineering -- the relative diversity in the granting of engineering degrees, and what diversity presently looks like in the engineering workforce.  APLU's 2018 Status Report on Engineering Education found that despite increases in the number of Black, Hispanic and other underrepresented students, they remain significantly underrepresented in the proportion of engineering degrees awarded.  The report shows at the institutional level, there is a high concentration of each underrepresented group in a small number of institutions which contrast with a large number of institutions with little to no racial or ethnic diversity in their engineering programs.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) continue to play an important role in educating Black and Hispanic students in engineering.  And alarmingly, states with majority-minority or emerging majority-minority college-age population are failing to educate a large enough share of their URG students in engineering.  Overall, the report examines trends in engineering degrees conferred at national and institutional levels to determine areas of growth among various groups, changes in racial, ethnic, and gender diversity in engineering, and which colleges and universities graduate a larger number of underrepresented groups in specific engineering disciplines.  The complementary second report, issued by Georgetown University's Center for Education and the Workforce (CEW) - Mission Not Accomplished: Unequal Opportunities and Outcomes for Black and Latinx Engineers finds that of the nearly 1.7 million prime-age engineering workers in the United States in 2019, 81% were either White or Asian, and 84% were men. A mere 3% of engineers working in the field in 2019 were either Black or Latinx women. The CEW report contains 4 critical conclusions on diversity and pay equity in engineering:  at      the present pace of change, achieving racial equity in engineering for      overall Black and Latinx workers could take 76 years, and for Black      Workers alone - up to 256 years! Black and Latinx workers with      bachelors degrees in engineering earn less than White and Asian workers Black and Latinx engineers with      an additional degree have earnings comparable to White workers with a      bachelors degree Women's representation in      engineering has barely improved and their earnings lag those of men   Broader impacts and societal consequences:  These findings indicate that in order to fully diversify the workforce, it will take significant change at both postsecondary and earlier levels of education.  At the university level, access and success by underrepresented students across institutions will need to improve, as suggested by the first report APLU published. As indicated in significant other literature, barriers to URG student success in engineering begin much earlier in their education - including offering students the vision of what careers in engineering are like and the skills/education/confidence that they can attain these careers.  Finally, the findings suggest the lack of diversity in engineering degrees may affect state and regional economies differentially in years to come. The APLU report provides an examination of diversity in conferred engineering bachelor's degrees by state. The range of inequity across nearly every state demonstrates the lack of underrepresented groups in engineering could be a problem throughout the country even as the implications may vary.  The project conveys a grim snapshot of diversity in engineering --both at the university and workforce levels.  However there is also a glimmer of hope, as there have been improvements, however relatively small.  Through such system changing efforts as the NSF INCLUDES program, the science and technology community has begun to recognize that transformation has be faster and much broader in order to better serve the future needs of the nation.
