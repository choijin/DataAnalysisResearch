<AbstractNarration>Students from groups underrepresented in the sciences are more likely to take post-baccalaureate classes or pursue a Master's degree before applying to Ph.D. programs. The goal of the Columbia Bridge-to-PhD Program is to increase the number of underrepresented scholars entering STEM PhD programs and to give them the skills necessary for success in those programs. One such necessity is a network of mentors and colleagues. The program holds a half-day symposium every year with returning alumni sharing their experiences. This grant will support a "Super Symposium" to evaluate the lessons learned from the the ten-year history of the program. Funds will support travel costs of program alumni to attend the symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has begun analyzing the impact of the program on students' graduate career trajectories. His data show that the program has a high success rate for students admitted to PhD programs, with 80% of the program's applicants being accepted. Preliminary data show that the Bridge Program's alumni are more likely to be admitted to higher-ranked, less diverse graduate programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
