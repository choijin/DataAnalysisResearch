<AbstractNarration>This project supports hosting the 25th edition of the GENI Engineering conference (GEC-25), including organizing and hosting the demo session, to be held on March 14-15, 2017, on the Florida International University's Miami campus. The Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) is a virtual instrument that is emerging as a foundational experimental research platform across the United States. GENI aims to transform experimental research in networking and distributed systems, as well as emerging research in very large socio-technical systems, by providing a suite of infrastructure for 'at scale' experiments in future internets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GENI is an instrument designed to address three issues: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Science Issues: We cannot currently fully understand or predict the behavior of complex, large-scale networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Societal Issues: We increasingly rely on the Internet but are unsure we can trust its security, privacy or resilience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Innovation Issues: Substantial barriers exist to at-scale experimentation with new architectures, services, and technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GENI addresses these issues via scale (from federation) and support for two kinds of experiments: 1) controlled and repeatable experiments, which will greatly help improve our scientific understanding of complex, large-scale networks; and 2) in-the-wild trials of experimental services that ride atop or connect to today's Internet and that engage large numbers of human participants. The GEC meeting and Demo sessions provide graduate students with both an opportunity to demonstrate and explain their work to the GENI community prior to formal publication. It is a key part of helping new graduate students understand what is being done with GENI and who among their peers at other institutions might be valuable resources. It also supports outreach to new community members, including the emerging US Ignite community. GENI is already being used as an instrument for research. This proposal supports the development and use of the research instrument.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) is a suite of research infrastructure, aimed at transforming experimental research in networking and distributed systems.  GENI provides a suite of national-level infrastructure for "at scale" experiments in future Internets, distributed computing, and cloud computing in response to a variety of challenges, including research cyberinfrastructure, global federated infrastructure, future Internet testbed development, and integration and testbed-supported research. GEC25 provided a 2-day program that provides content of general interest to experimenters, developers and practitioners. The program was of interest to not only U.S. participants, but participants from Latin America, Canada, Europe, and Asia.  GENI is enabling research in computer networks, systems, and advanced applications through Future Internet, Distributed Cloud, and Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Software Defined Infrastructure (SDI) testbeds.  GENI engages U.S. and international researchers through workshops and by facilitating research activities.  The GEC25 conference supported GENI?s objectives to attract U.S. GENI researchers and researchers from international peer projects to share knowledge and further their collaboration.  With GEC25 being in Miami, it facilitated the participation of researchers from Latin American countries to engage with their U.S. counterparts.  The lively discussions and forward looking technical interchanges at the GEC are a testament to the importance of the GENI Engineering conferences. GENI is relevant or useful for future program offices such as TIPOFF (Tomorrow's Internet Project Office) or PAWR (Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research). We recommend the future TIPOFF continue to organize such events for the community.  We also recommend TIPOFF coordinate with the newly formed PAWR office and other national and international cyber-infrastructures in the organization of these events in order to continue the exploration of opportunities for collaboration and inter-operation.
