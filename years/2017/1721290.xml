<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR Phase I project is to develop a new water flood technology to increase oil recovery.  The best current technology is limited to 30 - 50% recovery leaving significant resources in the ground.  The available methods to further increase recovery are expensive, have limited application and can cause environmental damage.  The proposed method is much lower cost and has minimal environmental impact.  Our technique does not use chemicals or additives thus avoiding the risk of contaminating ground and surface water resources.  Rather than drill thousands of new wells, our approach revitalizes old fields and requires little modification to the existing infrastructure and operational procedures.  It would allow older fields to continue to operate, providing revenues, jobs and taxes while increasing and further diversifying our domestic oil reserves.  Development of these currently unrecoverable oil resources could enable long-term stabilization of oil prices at reasonable levels and offer new business opportunities for small operators.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase I project proposes to measure the wettability in several petroleum reservoirs and to determine the equilibrium constants required to better describe the interaction between mineral surfaces and surface-active components of crude oil.  These constants will be added to a geochemical model to evaluate the capability of the models to predict wettability.  Wettability in petroleum reservoirs is poorly constrained, and current formulations that depend on interfacial energy cannot accurately portray the observations and offer little predictive capability.  The current wettability measurement methodologies rely on flow properties to infer interfacial energy because it is difficult to directly measure the interfacial energy between rock and oil.  Using a geochemical approach, we can explicitly represent the electrostatic and van der Waals force that make up the interfacial energy.  This approach will produce quantitative formulations of wettability that can be implemented in standard geochemical models.  Our goals are to demonstrate that we can measure the important reactions using standard chemical methodologies, that these measurements can be used in geochemical models to calculate wettability and that the models can be used to predict wettability as a function of water chemistry, for enabling techniques for more effective water flooding and enhanced oil recovery.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project was aimed at solving the problem of declining U.S. oil resources.  Oil is a critical fuel in the U.S. energy mix and represents 37% of current U.S. energy consumption.  In the past, our domestic resources were sufficient to meet demand, but today the U.S. is an oil importer.  This situation has left the U.S. dependent on foreign sources and price structures that are not favorable to our economic stability and national security.  While current domestic oil production has reached 10 million barrels per day, U.S. consumption remains at nearly 20 million barrels per day with projected demand remaining flat or slightly declining through 2040, thereby sustaining U.S. reliance on imported oil, mostly from Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela and Nigeria.      The days of easy-to-find and produce oil are ending.  This historic change was best summarized by Ahmed Hashmi, head of upstream technology at BP who in 2016 said, "We believe that the world has probably reached a point globally when the potential for enhanced recovery from known hydrocarbon resources exceeds the potential from new discoveries".  Current methods of additional extraction are expensive. Unconventional resources (shale) have not yet provided an alternative at reasonable costs.  The current paradigm is one of constant new development and exploitation.  The current approach of extraction of unconventional oil resources (tight sands and oil shale) requires vast numbers of expensive new wells that only produce for a few years.  This approach will extend the life of existing conventional oil fields by decades.      Our methodology involves changing the salinity of the injected water allowing more oil production without changing infrastructure or operations.  We use brackish water mixed with produced brine to change the salinity.  The technology will allow the U.S. to continue production from existing oil fields without environmental impacts.  There are no worries about induced seismicity, stray gas or chemicals contaminating groundwater reservoirs, all potential concerns with unconventional oil recovery practices that require high oil prices to remain viable.  This technology can increase the energy security of the U.S. and create more jobs in the faltering oil industry while stabilizing domestic oil production at much lower costs than other technologies.     This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project has furthered our understanding of the means to optimize wettability in existing oil reservoirs without the environmental impacts or high costs of current technologies.  This project demonstrated that some essential technical challenges could be met, and the results used to provide a standardized, robust and cost-effective means to measure wettability compared to current technologies.  This is a critical step that has been a bottle neck in prior studies.  This project showed that wettability measurements by flotation could be bought to a commercially-viable level, that the measurements could identify the salinity to optimize wettability for oil recovery and that the measurements can be used to derive equilibrium constants to make quantitative surface complexation models of wettability.  These models differ from prior efforts and allow the use of standard geochemical models to describe wettability in systems of complex surfaces and multiple liquid phases.
