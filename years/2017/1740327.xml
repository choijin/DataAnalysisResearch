<AbstractNarration>This award is cofunded by the Office of International Science and Engineering. This project aims to support the participation of U.S. researchers, postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students in one of the first Pan American Nanotechnology Conference to be held from November 27th to 30th at Guaruja, Brazil. Preference for allocation of travel support will be given to underrepresented groups in USA, i.e. minorities, females and researchers/students with disabilities as well as early career scientists. This conference will provide a venue for understanding nanotechnology and nanoparticles behavior in biological, chemical and environmental systems with the purpose to develop useful and sustainable applications throughout the Pan-American region. In this conference, educational, regulatory, social and economic aspects of sustainable nanotechnology applications will be also discussed. This conference will be the largest assemblage of participants from the Americas sharing knowledge and fostering collaboration to move forward the development and application of sustainable nanotechnologies and nanomanufacturing with the final aim to solve societal challenges as well as protect and improve the environment and human health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will have plenary and concurrent smaller breakout sessions to introduce different areas of the nanotechnology field, including: biological-nano interactions, chemical-nano interactions, ecological-nano interactions, sustainable nanomanufacturing, nanoinformatics and modeling, as well as educational, social, economic and legal aspects of nanomaterials and nanotechnologies. This conference will be one of the first assemblage of participants from the Americas sharing knowledge and fostering collaboration with the purpose of moving forward the development and application of sustainable nanotechnologies to improve quality of life worldwide while promoting protection of the environment and human health.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span><span style="font-size: small;">During the last <span>ten</span> years, researchers in Latin America have incorporated extensively in their research agendas nanotechnological applications in the areas of health, energy, and water. On the other hand, fundamental aspects of nanotechnologies related to nanomaterials interactions with different biological and chemical systems, as well as sustainability of nanomaterial fabrication have been focused mostly by the leading countries in nanotechnology research and development, <span>i.e.,</span> the <span>USA</span> and China. These different strengths in the Pan American region have highlighted the importance of a Pan American conference in South America to allow knowledge exchange and dissemination. In order to fill this knowledge gap and foster collaborations among researchers in USA and countries in Latin American, the PIs of this project partnered up with researchers from Latin America to hold the first Pan American Nanotechnology Conference from November 27</span><sup><span style="font-size: x-small;">th</span></sup><span style="font-size: small;"> to 30</span><sup><span style="font-size: x-small;">th</span></sup><span style="font-size: small;"> at Guaruja, Sao Paulo, Brazil. This first Pan American event had 257 participants. Among the participants, 132 were female, while 125 were male. In this conference, 70 participants were from the <span>USA,</span> <span>and</span> 173 were from different countries in Latin America, while the remaining participants were from other countries in Europe and Asia. The funds of this project allowed travel support to 53 participants from the <span>USA</span> to attend the Conference in Brazil. Among the 53 participants attending the conference, 24 belonged to female, minorities and <span>underrepresented</span> groups. In this conference, we also had a balanced number of US academicians at different levels in their careers. Participants included seven assistant professors, eight associate professors, 13 full professors, and 25 graduate and postdoctoral students. This first conference was <span>markedly </span>successful since collaborations between USA scientists and Latin American scientists <span>were initiated</span>. Furthermore, it provided educational and networking opportunities for US scientists at various career stages.</span></span></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/07/2018<br>      Modified by: Debora&nbsp;F&nbsp;Rodrigues</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1740327/1740327_10502010_1533674279211_conference_flyer_Brazil--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1740327/1740327_10502010_1533674279211_conference_flyer_Brazil--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Conference Flyer"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1740327/1740327_10502010_1533674279211_conference_flyer_Brazil--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Conference Flyer"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Advertisement of the Conference.
