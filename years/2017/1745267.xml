<AbstractNarration>Many vertebrate groups have protected their skulls, with the horns and antlers of mammals having attracted the most attention from evolutionary biologists. This project promotes the progress of science by expanding research on animal weaponry into an unexplored group of fishes called sculpins.  Sculpins have large and variable head spines.  It is assumed that they use them to fight and compete for mates or to defend themselves from being eaten by predators. The latter has been assumed, but never tested.  This project will be first study of its kind in an aquatic system, and it will help determine whether the evolution of spines follows the same rules and patterns discovered in terrestrial systems. The project will benefit society by offering numerous educational experiences, including research opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students, a new version of a previously successful training workshop, and a travelling class that uses 3D visualization of animal weapons to excite precollege students about biology. It will also open access to scientific data by making 3D reconstructions of the skeleton of nearly 1000 CT scanned fish specimens publicly and freely available. Because of its novel combination of disciplines and methods, the project has the potential to pioneer a scientific approach that may become a new community standard. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team of experts in ichthyology, comparative phylogenetic analysis, macroevolution, biomechanics and 3D morphometrics will unite these disciplines to discover why the heads of sculpins bear impressively variable preopercular spines. Have these fishes evolved their weapons to escalate and enhance male-male competition? Or, do the spines defend their bearers from engulfment by gape-limited predators? To answer that question the project will link microCT scans of more than 150 species, synthetic phylogenies, and databases of functional trait diversity to reconstruct the history of spine evolution in these fishes. Further, it will shed light on the generality of rules governing the evolution of cranial appendages in these fishes follows those discovered in terrestrial systems.</AbstractNarration>
