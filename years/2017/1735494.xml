<AbstractNarration>Paragraph 1&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a workshop to examine the potential for supporting research on submerged human habitation sites on the continental shelf of the U.S.  The workshop brings together approximately twenty-five individuals with relevant and specialized expertise on this topic of research and will be held at the Smithsonian Institution, in conjunction with the Society for American Archaeology meeting Spring 2018 in Washington, DC.  An investigation of submerged human habitation sites has the potential to provide important insights into human evolution in North America, including topics of migration, colonization, response to sea level rise, and the origins of maritime adaptations.  These topics are important not only for understanding the development of early social organization in North America but can also give us critical information about the societal impacts of sea level rise, which is a potential threat in coastal regions of the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paragraph 2&lt;br/&gt;The interdisciplinary workshop will include senior and early career scholars from the social and physical sciences, federal resource managers, and other stakeholders. The workshop will identify and explore innovative methods and relationships necessary to address the archaeology and paleoecology of submerged coastal landscapes on the US continental shelves. Participants will identify extant and needed technological, fiscal, human, educational, and logistic resources, and explore synergistic interagency and interdisciplinary relationships needed to promote and support this type research. The product will be a synoptic report and proposed action plan for distribution to stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report:  Submerged Landscape Archeology in North America: An Exploratory Workshop; Washington, DC, Fall 2018  This report documents the results of a workshop to advance submerged landscape archeology in North America held in the Rose Room, Department of Anthropology, Smithsonian Institution, Museum of Natural History, June 11-12, 2019.  The workshop brought together an interdisciplinary group of scientists, federal, state, Native American, and private stakeholders to define research and societal needs, and the theoretical, methodological, and technological requirements and protocols to advance this research.  It culminated in defining the central parameters of submerged landscape archeology and its challenges, and making recommendations and identifying resources to facilitate collaborative partnerships necessary to advance this research frontier.  The workshop was structured in two primary parts.  The US lags behind other industrialized nations in non-shipwreck archeological research, and it is important to understand how European insights and methods might be applied in the US.  Consequently, the first part consisted of a series of presentations designed to provide an overview of the state of the art of submerged landscape archeology in the European Union (EU) under a cooperative agreement called SPLASHCOS (Submerged Prehistoric Archeology and Landscapes of the Continental Shelf) which documented thousands of submerged sites on Europe’s continental shelves.  The EU presentations were followed by an overview of the regulatory, scientific, cultural, modeling and technological state of the art in the US.   Following an introduction outlining the workshop goals, objectives, and expectations, William E. Easterling, III, Assistant Director of Geosciences, National Science Foundation (NSF), delivered an inspirational welcoming address emphasizing the importance of convergent science and harnessing the data and technological revolution. E. James Dixon (UNM) spoke about the background, development, goals and objectives of the workshop. His address was followed by presentations on the global significance of submerged landscape archeology by Geoffrey N. Bailey, (University of York, UK). Vincent Gaffney, (University of Bradford, UK) presented the results of the 2017 Chichley Conference and Report.  Martin Segschneider, (Coastal and Maritime Archeology Lower Saxony Institute for Historical Coastal Research, Germany) provided an update on the European Union’s Submerged Prehistoric Archeology and Landscapes of the Continental Shelf (SPLASHCOS) on line database. Loren Davis (OSU) spoke about the larger rationale and needs for a national focus on offshore submerged landscape archeology.  William Brown of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) outlined the agencies responsibilities pertaining to submerged cultural resources on the US continental shelves followed Davis.  Douglas Harris, Narragansett Deputy Tribal Preservation Officer, USA spoke to the tribal heritage importance of submerged landscapes and archeology. Kelley Monteleone (U Calgary) spoke about GIS modeling of submerged paleolandscapes and its application to identify areas of high potential for the occurrence of submerged archeological sites. Jillian Maloney (CSUSD) provided an overview of contemporary and state of the art offshore geophysical survey and sampling technology and methods.     The participants were encouraged to contribute to discussions oriented toward five themes:  1)         Rationale and significance of submerged paleolandscape archeology  2)         Forging interagency, tribal, academic, and private partnerships   3)         Defining needs, identifying funding, and logistic resources  4)         Scientific, heritage, and resource management &ndash; a SPLASHCOS for America?  5)         Cultural, field, and laboratory research protocols and new methods  Workshop attendees self-selected to participate in working groups based on their expertize and interests.  Each group engaged in open discussions about each topic that were recorded by a note taker.  Identification of challenges and formulating recommendations to address them took place on the afternoon of day one and the morning of day two.  Participants were encouraged to move between groups to facilitate sharing perspectives and expertize.  Each group synthesized their results, which were presented to participants by a group member on day two.  The presentations were followed by a discussion in which all participants were encouraged to participate.  The results of the working groups and discussions were organized into a draft final report consisting of two parts.  Part One presents an overview of the scientific and cultural rationale, significance, and national need for submerged landscape archeology. Part Two provides a synthesis of working group themes and their challenges and the working groups’ recommendations to meet them.  The workshop achieved several outcomes that advance knowledge about the state and future direction for submerged landscape archeology in the US.  The broader impacts of this workshop resulted in establishing synergistic relationships between federal, state, tribal, academic, and private industry stakeholders. A key outcome of the workshop was the formulation of a national-level exploratory committee provisionally designated the "AquaTerra" working group.  The AquaTerra the committee is charged with exploring and advancing a collaborative interdisciplinary organizational, educational, and research organization to serve public, resource management, industry, private, tribal and educational stakeholders.  The committee is charged with reporting its results and recommendations for further action to the workshop participants, and encouraged by the working group to seek funding to support their efforts.
