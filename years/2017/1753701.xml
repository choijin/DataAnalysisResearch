<AbstractNarration>This project will advance our understanding of using technologies of the brain in interpreting the senses.  The project will engage in public participation in discussions regarding the development and use of brain machine interface devices. The study will identify how these technologies are brought to market, and experienced by individual users. It will be of interest to patients, doctors, policy makers, scientists and technology developers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will bring together social studies of science, the neurosciences and translational medicine to investigate the ways in which brain machine interface (BMI) devices are being developed. It will explore questions about what subjects see when using BMI devices? What does it mean for a BMI device to "work"? The  study will  trace how institutional relationships involved in the production of a BMI device (i.e. the academic military- industrial complex) manifest in individual, perceptual experience. The project will use phenomenological and experimental methods that include computational modeling, psychophysics and behavioral tasks, as well as interviews and ethnography.  By combining institutional ethnography and critical phenomenological methods in the context of the neuroscience the result will contribute to our understanding of the processes of embodiment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ I am interested in using cross-disciplinary methods in order to create multilevel analyses of perceptual phenomena.  This project serves as a case example of this kind of work, focusing on artificial vision produced by visual prosthesis devices. The project centers on the following questions: what do individuals with these devices see when these devices are turned on for the first time? How does that change over time? What does it mean for one of these devices to "work"?  Over the course of four years, I followed these devices &ndash; and one in particular - from bench to bedside, using mixed methods that allowed me to attend to both their perceptual and political origins and effects.  What I found was that the reason we currently know so little about the experience of artificial vision produced by these devices - despite hundreds of individuals having already ben implanted, scores of them closely followed in research trials - is because we don’t ask.  Why we don’t ask is the story of perception in the age of information and financialization, a story that I elaborate on using ethnographic data collected from neuroscience labs in Silicon Valley, a biotech start-up in Paris and the US FDA.   But ask we must, as it is our ethical imperative to understand what these technologies and others like them are doing and why. Within this work I develop a conceptual framework and perceptual toolkit with which to inquire about the effects of complicated information and communication technologies. I demonstrate their use with ethnographic data related to the perceptual experience of visual prosthesis recipients. I find that when we do ask, we learn that artificial vision produced by these devices seems to be a fundamentally different phenomenon than natural vision. It is a finding that must be understood within the political and economic context in which the devices are made, and that has important implications for both how these devices are produced and implemented, as well as for our more general understanding of sensory perception.
