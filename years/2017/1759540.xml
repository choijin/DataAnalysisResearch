<AbstractNarration>1759542 (LaMontagne) and 1759540 (Gentry). Floodwaters generated by hurricanes and other extreme weather events may contain dangerous levels of microbial pathogens, associated with sewage and human waste contamination, and toxins. To determine the source of fecal contamination of floodwater and the impact of this floodwater on receiving water quality, the investigators will collect water samples at stations surrounding an estuary between Houston and Galveston. Samples include those already drawn before and also immediately after Hurricane Harvey deluged Houston. Analysis of early samples shows that microbial contamination is present post storm. The investigators will apply quantitative modern molecular biology methods to determine the source of the microbes that contaminated these floodwaters and will continue sampling weekly until the microbial community, as assessed by the modern methods, returns to pre-storm conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little is known about the risk associated with exposure by contact to floodwaters or the impact of these floodwaters on receiving water quality. Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), used to assess contact risk for recreational waters, do not determine the source of microbial contamination and assessing the health of receiving waters remains challenging. Quantitative PCR and metagenomic analysis can help track the source of microbial contamination but few studies have conducted these analyses, particularly with pre-flood samples for comparison. Further, few studies have applied next-generation sequencing methods, which have the depth and coverage to identify microbes that reflect fecal contamination and the overall microbial community diversity and structure. This work will allow the determination of the source of fecal contamination of floodwaters generated in this event and could lead to an improved understanding of the health risks associated with exposure to floodwaters in future events and the impact of hurricanes on the health of coastal systems.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Hurricane Harvey caused widespread flooding along the Texas Gulf Coast in August 2017 with areas of Houston receiving record rainfall, &gt;150 cm in some areas within a few days.

Total coliform bacteria, <em>E. coli</em>, and enterococci were enumerated using the IDEXX Quanti-Tray/2000 system with Colilert and Enterolert tests. Water samples were also filtered, had DNA extracted, and were analyzed via qPCR for general and source-specific <em>Bacteroidales</em> markers. The surface water samples collected immediately after the hurricane had elevated levels of <em>E. coli</em> ranging from 488 to 1,733 MPN/100 mL with a geometric mean of 1,019 MPN/100 mL across all sites. However, after one week, the <em>E. coli</em> levels had decreased to &lt;100 MPN/100 mL at all sites. Levels of total coliforms, enterococci, and <em>Bacteriodes</em> were higher than <em>E. coli </em>but followed similar trends with elevated levels immediately following the hurricane and a rapid decrease in levels as the floodwaters dissipated. The results indicate that the hurricane had a dramatic, short-term impact on fecal contamination of surface waters but that these effects were relatively short-lived, with fecal indicators approaching normal, background levels within a week after the rainfall ended.
