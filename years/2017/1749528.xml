<AbstractNarration>This award funds a focused workshop with the goal of bringing together leading researchers and practitioners in networked systems to develop a new networking research agenda for "Cloud 3.0", focusing on rethinking from the ground-up networked systems infrastructure within the datacenter and beyond. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background: In recent years we have witnessed two dramatic transformations of the IT industry. First, virtualization, and private data centers, enabled organizations to use limited compute resources in a more flexible and cost-effective fashion. Second, cloud computing, and public clouds, enabled organizations to outsource their IT infrastructure, vastly reducing capital and operational expenses. We are now poised for the third dramatic shift: "serverless" platforms, or "Cloud 3.0", which has the potential to reinvent both hardware and software architectures. With Cloud 3.0, application developers just bring code and data without worrying at all about the infrastructure (e.g., configuring and spinning up cloud resources). Application developers define even the most complex applications as a set of simple stateless functions, or lambdas.  An infrastructure provider (e.g., a public cloud operator) handles all the complex "details" (e.g., acquiring resources, managing failures, ensure good user experience, etc.). This model offers many benefits including development of innovative applications at much greater speed, rapid adaptation to user demand, improved cost-effectiveness, etc. Several large online service providers have begun offering platforms for serverless computation, touting this as "the future of the Cloud".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current approach to supporting such Cloud 3.0 applications, infrastructure, and networking is to re-purpose existing hardware and software, protocols, and algorithms. But there are several places, especially in cloud networking, where existing technologies are a poor fit for Cloud 3.0. For example, at the hardware level, recent research in disaggregated network designs has the potential to further erode the hard boundaries defining servers as well. Similarly, new approaches to rethinking network protocols, abstractions, application programming interfaces (APIs), and algorithms may lead to more optimal support for serverless computing.  "Cloud 3.0" provides a rich set of opportunities for interesting core networking, as well as cross-cutting ("networking + X") research. Topics of interest that are likely to be explored at the workshop include: new datacenter architectures and networking interconnects; synergy between Lambdas and disaggregated network architectures; routing and link layer protocols to support Lambdas? performance, scale up, isolation; programmable fabrics and control planes that can support agility needed by Lambdas; revisiting transport and network layer protocol design; revisiting old abstractions such as the socket A ; Lambda isolation, security, and accounting, and the necessary support at network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator, along with workshop participants, will author a detailed workshop report which will outline a networking research agenda for Cloud 3.0. The report will be made available on the public workshop website. The website will also include a list of participants, their biographies, and their one-page pre-workshop write-ups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Cloud computing has revolutionized the computing landscape in the last decade, turning what was once a specialized resource -- high-performance networked computing platforms -- into a convenient and efficient commodity.  The ability to scale out computing workloads and network services has been an enormous driver of innovation in industry, academia, and beyond.   Despite this growth, cloud computing, and cloud-computing research, has largely been stuck in an archaic computational paradigm: the renting of whole servers (virtual or physical), each with an allocation of CPU, RAM, storage, and network connectivity.  With this model comes a host of issues that cloud providers and cloud users have attempted to paper over, with mixed success: inefficient allocation of computing and network resources, budget overruns, unresponsive elastic scaling in response to varied demands, difficulty securing whole-server/whole-OS platforms, and clumsy and low-level programming environments.   Recognizing the above challenges, cloud providers have recently begun to offer "serverless" cloud computing, in which cloud users only need specify the application code to be run in response to some event; the cloud provider handles the rest (scaling, provisioning, security, resource allocation, etc.). An early version was Platform-as-a-service (PaaS), exemplified by Google?s App Engine, which followed even earlier serverless models, such as shared web hosting and CGI scripting. A more recent popular recent variant of serverless computing is Function as a Service (FaaS), which forms the primary focus of this report. In the most common style of FaaS, compute tasks are specified as individual functions to be launched dynamically across available resources when triggered by external events. Some in the industry have started to refer to FaaS as Cloud version 3.0, or "Cloud 3.0".   In one view, FaaS may be the "packet switching" equivalent of cloud computing, with services composed of very granular, fine timescale tasks, compared with services that rent whole machines by the minute, which are more akin to "circuit switching." As with the advent of packet switching more than a half-century ago, the true promise and downsides of FaaS computing may not be clear for many years, and incumbents who are wedded to older models could staunchly oppose it--likely with some merit. This new cloud computing model requires new techniques and enables new applications, but which applications are most able to benefit remains to be seen. Research has only just begun to emerge in this space.   The NSF Cloud 3.0 Workshop was convened to study new directions in FaaS/serverless cloud computing. One goal of the workshop was to understand existing offerings in FaaS, their capabilities, and which applications benefit most from them (and how). Another goal was to explore how FaaS might look like in the limit; for example, to what extent can advances in systems and networking support even more stringent performance than today?s FaaS offerings? A related goal here was to explore hitherto unseen applications that might exploit such future FaaS platforms, and which applications or use-cases are fundamentally a poor fit for FaaS. The discussion was meant to be broad, to include various possible FaaS  instantiations, e.g., third-party based serverless offerings vs. FaaS infrastructure put in place by an enterprise to supports its internal applications (akin to a private cloud today).   The participants were asked to identify themes and directions for new research in serverless computing, both at the infrastructure level (i.e., research on cloud platforms themselves) and at the application level (i.e., research on innovative ways of leveraging FaaS). The participants represented a wide range of expertise on systems, networking, and security from both academia and industry.  Before the workshop, participants were asked to submit position papers describing their current research and their views on promising research avenues.  The workshop was organized around numerous breakout sessions each of which focused on specific sub-areas of research in serverless computing.  The breakout sessions then reported back to the larger group and the findings were used to guide subsequent breakout sessions.  Two industry participants, one from Google and another from Microsoft, were invited to present to the group about their efforts in cloud computing.   This workshop identified key research challenges in support for existing applications, as well as new hitherto unseen applications, and new grand research challenges both in core networking and systems, as well as cross-cutting challenges, aimed at future fundamental advances in FaaS. It also outlined barriers to conducting research in this exciting space and offer our thoughts on overcoming them.
