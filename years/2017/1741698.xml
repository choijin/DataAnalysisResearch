<AbstractNarration>Part 1:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the previous Integrated Ocean Drilling Program, NSF supported operation of the U.S. drillship JOIDES Resolution (JR) through a contract to the Consortium for Ocean Leadership (COL). COL, as prime contractor, oversaw subcontracts to Texas A&amp;M University (as "Prime Contractor" for operating the JR) and Columbia University (as "Logging Contractor"). The Borehole Research Group (BRG), under PI Goldberg, provided downhole logging services that included management of the logging subcontractor Schlumberger as well as logging data reduction and quality control, and management of the IODP logging database. These logging services are primarily geophysical measurements done remotely in the drilled borehole, such as borehole wall rock or sediment (formation) resistivity, geochemistry, seismic properties, or magnetic properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the current International Ocean Discovery Program, a new NSF Cooperative Agreement to Texas A&amp;M University as JOIDES Resolution Science Operator (JRSO) replaced the contract for FY2015. At the time of this award, it was recognized that a need existed to maintain the IODP logging database and the data reduction and quality control activities provided under the previous logging subcontract, activities that the JRSO at award could not easily or inexpensively provide. Thus, NSF made a 3 year award to the PI to provide these services in FY 2015-2017 (OCE-1440495), an arrangement that has worked very well, with no issues identified during review by two independent NSF panels examining JR facility operations performance in FY2015 and 2016. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award represents a new award to the PI to continue to provide these shipboard downhole logging data services, including data reduction and quality control and support of a database containing these logging data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will provide support for three years of the following services, also provided under a previous NSF Award to the PI: &lt;br/&gt;1) Rapid data reduction and quality control of logging data acquired aboard JOIDES Resolution drillship International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expeditions by the logging subcontractor Schlumberger, with subsequent return of the reduced data in near real-time to the Expedition Science Party aboard the drillship; &lt;br/&gt;2) Archiving of raw and reduced logging data within the existing IODP logging database LogDB housed at Columbia University; &lt;br/&gt;3) maintain and enhance web services for automated query and retrieval of data from LogDB, including development of new graphical tools; &lt;br/&gt;4) provide enhancements to LogDB, including publishing Digital Object Identifiers (DOI's) for each well log dataset and also providing interoperability between LogDB and other databases &lt;br/&gt;5) Submit full sets of raw and processed data for deep archiving to the National Centers for Environmental Information; and &lt;br/&gt;6) provide support for LogDB users, especially neophytes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project conducted at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) from 2017-2020 was to provide the scientific community with 1) data reduction and quality control of current International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) well log data acquired aboard the JOIDES Resolution (JR), and other scientific ocean drilling platforms, 2) online data access of both current and historical logging data, 3) web services that allow for automated query and retrieval of well log data from the online database (LogDB), and 4) enhanced interoperability with NSF supported data repositories.   To accomplish this, an automated system and protocol for the transfer of log data to and from the JR was employed by LDEO and the JR Science Operator at Texas A&amp;M University. Log data processing and QA/QC were promptly performed at LDEO and results were securely transferred back to the ship for scientific interpretation by the shipboard team, typically within 2-3 days.  Processed log data have been added to the shore-based LogDB database and are available to the scientific community at large for post-expedition research after a 1-year moratorium period. During the 2017-2020 period, LDEO processed log data from 30 new IODP holes drilled by the JOIDES Resolution, corresponding to over 16 km of drilled and logged intervals.  In addition, LDEO performed QA/QC processes and archived log data from 2 holes drilled by the IODP-European Science Operator and 4 holes drilled by the IODP-Japan Science Operator, corresponding to over 2.5 km of drilled and logged data, and assisted more than 22 international researchers with technical inquiries related to log data.  Data reduction of IODP well logs was performed using the TechLogTM Software, a commercial package that is maintained at LDEO and on the JOIDES Resolution. Additional software developed at LDEO was used for data handling and archival in LogDB.    During the 2017-2020 period, LDEO has maintained a web-enabled database (LogDB) to safely store, search, and retrieve log data collected in over 600 holes through more than 50 years of scientific ocean drilling. To date, 660 scientific drilling holes have been uploaded and maintained in LogDB, corresponding to 300 km of drilled and logged intervals. The current database size for DSDP/ODP/IODP log data is about 500 GB, with an additional 100 GB of log data from other scientific research programs. LogDB currently includes data from 84 IODP expeditions, 7 IODP-ESO expeditions, and 8 IODP-CDEX expeditions; more recent expeditions remain in moratorium. The complete LogDB online log data inventory and related documentation can be found at the following URL: http://mlp.ldeo.columbia.edu/logdb/scientific_ocean_drilling/.  Web services linked to LogDB provide scientists with an interface to the log data and meta-databases. User-defined data searches may be conducted using many combinations of identifiers, and the returned results provide a pathway to download the data as well as links to critical documentation and tools (https://mlp.ldeo.columbia.edu/research/technology) that describe data collection, processing (https://mlp.ldeo.columbia.edu/log-data-processing/), correlation with coring and field operations (https://mlp.ldeo.columbia.edu/data/timeline/) and visualization of the principal data contained in LogDB (https://mlp.ldeo.columbia.edu/data/logplot/).  A web landing page for LogDB was developed in collaboration with other widely used geodatabases, such as EarthCube, to create common meta-data links and to allow for more flexible user access through potential Linked Open Data developments in the future.    Through LogDB and these web services, researchers in the broader scientific community are able to discover, access, and use log data to address a wide range of societal, educational, and public interests. This is an important resource for educational initiatives and student research programs, with available web services now poised to publish the entire data collection with other NSF supported data repositories.  At the conclusion of IODP operations, per NSF directions the LogDB raw and processed data and associated metadata will be submitted to the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) in Boulder, CO.
