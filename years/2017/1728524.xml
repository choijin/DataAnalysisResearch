<AbstractNarration>The practice of medicine is rapidly more biomedicalized: highly scientific and technological, with enhanced access to increased amounts of new medications. The changes are not strictly medical. Biomedicalized treatment has also created and entrenched cultural messages focused on reducing risks and optimizing health. Social science research has shown that this new style of medicine can significantly influence behavior, both inside and outside the clinical setting. Findings from research on biomedicalized treatment have led to new questions, such as whether or not pharmaceutical use affects cultural practices. The research supported by this award will explore such questions through the lens of addiction treatment. This project, which trains a graduate in methods of rigorous, empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, examines whether addiction treatment and addiction pharmaceutical use influences mothering practices and identities. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, findings will be disseminated to organizations and individuals involved in optimal health care delivery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kelley Kampman, under the supervision of Dr. Lee Hoffer of Case Western University, will explore what influence biomedicalized addiction treatment has on mothering practices. Scientific advances in addiction medicine have led to the creation of new pharmaceuticals, such as Suboxone, and new methodologies such as medication-assisted treatment (MAT). These new medications are framed as a way to both treat their disease and improve their mothering practices. Despite discourses that link the use of addiction medications and the enhancement of mothering practices, there is little understanding of how mothers respond to these messages. The objectives of the project are (1) to understand how pregnant women seeking undergoing addiction treatment understand and respond to an addiction treatment program, and (2) to examine if and how current addiction treatment program practices influence mothering practices. Situated in Northeast Ohio, at the center of the current opioid epidemic, the researcher will conduct 16 months of fieldwork among a purposive sample of program patients (n=40) in a MAT program and program staff. Data will be collected using a mix of social science methods including interviews with both patients and their healthcare providers, surveys, case studies, and participant observation in the treatment program and outside the program in the women's daily lives. Findings from this research will improve our understanding of how people interact with pharmaceuticals, how pharmaceuticals influence cultural behaviors and concepts of self, and provide information on the lived experiences of pregnancy and addiction which has largely been absent in research and public policy discussions.</AbstractNarration>

Project fieldwork was conducted for 25 months. Study recruitment occurred at a hospital in Cleveland, Ohio with a high-risk obstetrics and gynecology clinic specifically for pregnant, drug using women. Demographic surveys and repeated semi-structured, open-ended interviews were conducted with 26 women in the community. A sub-sample of 5 women were selected for case studies, which included additional interviews and shadowing. Women were interviewed on topics including past drug use, beliefs about addiction, beliefs about motherhood, mothering practices, birth experiences, experiences with the Department of Children and Family Services, current relationships, and other topics.  This research highlights low-income drug using women's desires to be good parents and how they navigate a number of different social and economic challenges to be able to parent their children in the ways that they want to. The themes identified in this research include:  Participants and service providers share beliefs about what good motherhood is that closely reflect the ideology of intensive mothering. Intensive mothering is a style of parenting that is child-focused, time demanding, and requires a large amount of resources. To be able to intensively mother, low-income drug using women participate in a variety of informal economic strategies, including a reliance on family members and social networks for material support. Women in this study embraced and performed intensive mothering at a cost to their own physical and emotional well-being. Participation in and adherence to medication assisted treatment (MAT) helps drug using women to be seen as good and capable mothers. Drug treatment programs are not designed with the needs of parents, specifically mothers, in mind. While women need to participate in these programs to be seen as good mothers, long hours and a lack of childcare make it difficult for many women.    This work contributes to social theory by providing information on the lived experiences of pregnancy, mothering, and addiction treatment for addicted women, which has been absent in the broader field of drug studies and in public policy discussions. The results also highlight the social implications of MAT use, and provide details about the social and economic needs of pregnant, opioid addicted women which are needed to inform policy and practice.
