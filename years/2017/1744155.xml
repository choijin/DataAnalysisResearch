<AbstractNarration>The proposal requests funds to support students at the 3rd International Workshop on Software Analytics (SWAN 2017), to take place in September 2017 in Paderborn, Germany.  The funds are to encourage US-based students to attend, with priority given to underrepresented groups, US citizens/residents, and those otherwise unable to attend without financial support. The area of software analytics as the basis for empirical research in software engineering leads to a scientific understanding of phenomena surrounding software and its development.  The area is emerging and will be boosted by increasing participation in this start-up workshop series.  The workshop is a forum for presentation of work in this field, and as such, it will help expand research and strengthen US participation in the field.</AbstractNarration>
