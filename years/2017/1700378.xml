<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for US participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, to attend the twenty-ninth and thirtieth international conferences in Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC). The 2017 edition will be held in London, United Kingdom, on July 9-13, 2017 (more info on the website https://sites.google.com/site/fpsac2017/). The 2018 edition will be held in Vancouver, Canada, on July 16-20, 2018 (more info on the website http://fpsac.org). The most important annual conference series in algebraic combinatorics in the world, FPSAC offers young American researchers a unique opportunity to interact closely with top mathematicians from many countries. Each conference, which includes nine one-hour plenary lectures, thirty half-hour contributed talks, and forty posters, will attract over 200 participants from all over the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A distinguishing characteristic of FPSAC conferences is the concerted effort to recognize and encourage outstanding young scientists. At least one plenary speaker is an "emerging star," and talented young researchers are well represented among the speakers selected for contributed talks. Another special feature of the FPSAC conferences is a continued tradition of inclusiveness. The conference seeks to draw substantial participation from underrepresented groups. Furthermore, English and French have been designated as official languages for FPSAC 2017 and 2018 to promote a diverse pool of participants. Attendance at this conference will be exceptionally valuable for graduate students and junior researchers. Somewhat interdisciplinary, the conferences link research in combinatorics to other topics in pure mathematics such as algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, representation theory, K-theory and symplectic geometry, and to topics in other sciences such as computer science, physics, and biology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant provided travel funding for students and early career researchers to participate in the Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC) Conference in 2017 and 2018.  The FPSAC conference series is a one-week annual international meeting focusing on algebraic and enumerative combinatorics as well as connections between these topics and other areas of mathematics, computer science, bioinformatics, and physics.  The FPSAC meetings are one of the most important platforms in the world for the presentation of advances in algebraic and enumerative combinatorics.  They attract top mathematicians from all over the world and offer young mathematicians a unique opportunity to interact closely with them.  Plenary lectures are given by prominent researchers and contributed talks and posters are carefully selected by a program committee based on extended abstract submissions of twelve pages in length.  The National Science Foundation is acknowledged on the website as well as during remarks by conference organizers.      The broader impact of this project is evident in the conference?s commitment to vertical integration, diversity and inclusion, and interdisciplinarity.  The National Science Foundation award served this mission by providing the funds for young researchers to attend this prestigious conference.  This afforded them the opportunity to develop their professional preparation, exchange scientific ideas, and broaden their knowledge base.  The extended abstracts selected for talks and posters will appear in a proceedings volume of the journal "Seminaire Lotharingien de Combinatoire".     On July 9-13 of 2017, the twenty-ninth International Conference on Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC) was held in London (United Kingdom).  On July 16-20 of 2018, the thirtieth International Conference on Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics was held in Hanover, New Hampshire.  Each conference included eight one-hour plenary lectures, over twenty-five half-hour contributed talks, approximately sixty poster presentations, and a software demonstration.  The conferences attracted over 200 participants.  This award financially supported 32 young researchers and three plenary speakers in 2017 and 60 young researchers in 2018, allowing them to attend the conference and in many cases present their research.
