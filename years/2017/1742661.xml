<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel of graduate students to a multi-disciplinary workshop in 2017 with emphasis on topics related to cyber-security. The travel grant will enable career development and learning opportunities. Attending conferences is an important component of graduate school education for future computer security researchers. Students will have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class computer security researchers, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop the graduate students will attend is called the Secure Knowledge Management (SKM) workshop. This workshop deals with topics in machine learning, privacy, trust, risk, and social and economic aspects, and technology domains such as IoT, cloud computing and big data. The requested funds will be used to support student travel awards, and members of underrepresented groups will be especially encouraged to apply. Students will be exposed to the state of the art in cyber-security as presented by experts from both academia and industry. In addition, students will hear about internships and job openings, and have ample opportunity to discuss employment and collaboration with more senior members of the field. The results of the conference, and the awards made possible by sponsors will be made available to the research community.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Secure Knowledge Management Workshop (SKM) 2017 was held in Tampa, Florida, USA on October 6-7. The papers focused on various cutting edge topics as follows:&nbsp;</p> <p>Detecting Error Proneness and Error Resistance of Information (Singh et. al., 2017) - The paper identifies factors of error proneness and factors of error resistance; ambiguity, vagueness, imprecision and lack of presuppositions are identified. The paper attempts to quantify these factors into indicators which could serve as suggestive warnings.</p> <p>Secure Document Management through Information-Flow Control (Chiluka et.al., 2017)- This paper, experimentally demonstrates how information can be misused in the current commercial DMSs in spite of access control and encryption. The authors develop a ReadersWriters Flow Model (RWFM), a novel information security model, for the DMS and show that it overcomes information misuses.</p> <p>ARRA: Attribute-Based Role-Role Assignment (Niglekhu and Krishnan, 2017) - In this paper, the authors propose a model for an attribute-based role assignment (ARRA), a novel way to unify prior role-role assignments (RRA) approaches.</p> <p>Insider Threat Detection Based on Users&rsquo; Mouse Movements and Keystrokes Behavior (Hashem et.al, 2017) - This paper, proposes a new approach to insider threat detection and prediction based on the user&rsquo;s mouse movements and keystrokes behaviour. The authors conduct human subject experiments and capture their mouse movements and keystroke dynamics as they perform several computer-based activities in both benign and malicious scenarios</p> <p>Kidemonas &ndash; The Silent Guardian (Baksi and Upadhyaya, 2017); - The paper presents an architecture, called Kidemonas, to silently detect the threat and secretly report it to the user or the system administrator. Several attack scenarios are considered and a security analysis to demonstrate the features of Kidemonas is performed.</p> <p>Investigating the Effect of Security Breaches on User Behavior in Protecting their Computer Resources: Hospitality Sector Perspective (Talebi, et. al, 2017) - Drawing on the stage theory of protective action decision model (PADM) and risk communication literature, the paper develops a research model in the hospitality sector to understand users&rsquo; behavior at different stages of decision making in security breach incidents.</p> <p>Improving Smart Home Security through End-User Training (Plachkinova and Menard, 2017) - In this research, the authors aim to address security shortcomings through message-framed security appeals and targeted IoT security training. They propose an experimental design for testing the efficacy of our approach and discuss potential implications.</p> <p>Demystifying Android&rsquo;s URI Permission System (Talegaon and Krishnan, 2017) &ndash; The paper studies the evolution of URI permissions from API 10 (Gingerbread) to API 22 (Lollipop). This paper analyses and improves the design and enforcement of Android&rsquo;s URI permissions.</p> <p>Fake News Detection in Microblogs (Ebadi, et.al, 2017) - The paper considers a common case of fake news where the relative perspective of t text headlines and the article pointed to by its hyperlink source are unrelated or in disagreement. Utilizing stance detection, the paper creates a machine learning model with content- and context-based features to predict fake news in a corpus of about 50,000 labeled dataset obtained from Fake News Challenge (FNC) project.</p> <p>Health Information Exchange Impact on Physicians&rsquo; Referral Patterns (Eftekhari, et.al, 2017) - The research studies how Health Information Exchange (HIE) is implemented as part of the U.S. healthcare reform lead to improved physician referral processes. This study shows that the adoption of HIE increases a physician&rsquo;s tendency to refer patients to other physicians who have also adopted HIE.</p> <p>Cybersecurity Interventions for Young Adults (Amo et.al, 2017) &ndash; The paper compares two intervention models targeted at middle school students&rsquo; cybersecurity awareness and training. The first approach is a 60-minute workshop model where participants experience a hands-on lesson in networking. The second approach is a week-long experience wherein participants build websites and are required to defend themselves from an ongoing cyber attack on the fifth and final day. The results suggest that females tend to benefit from the longer interventions and that the second approach is preferred for increasing overall cybersecurity engagement and reducing gender gaps.</p> <p>DeceptionNet: AI Model for Encoding Deception using Facial Micro-Expression (Rad et. al, 2017) - This article, propose a deep multimodal deception detection system that analyzes emotion trajectories of bi-modal input&mdash;video and speech&mdash;to detect deception in real-time with notable accuracy.
