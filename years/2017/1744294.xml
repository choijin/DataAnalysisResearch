<AbstractNarration>The broader impact and commercial potential of this I-Corps project will improve the transition quality and efficiency of university students to companies. This platform will potentially provide several customer segments such as students, companies and universities with solutions that remove many barriers that currently make job hunting and hiring a time-consuming, costly, stressful, and often biased endeavor. The impact of the product goes beyond a specific academic major, and has the potential to cover all scientific subject matters for which there is a robust job market. Most importantly, the solution will remove the current potential biases against underrepresented minorities by automating the skill assessment process and minimizing the human involvement in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will develop effective, unbiased, and automated platforms and algorithms for skill assessment. The target customers will be the companies, and university graduates that would like to enter the job market with no prior experience. This research will propose novel techniques and working tools using artificial intelligence and machine learning methods to provide interaction during the interview process between the assessment engine and the interviewee. The project further develops novel formal methods and programming language analysis techniques to analyze the answers submitted by the candidate during the interview and adaptively select the next sequence of questions for each specific candidate. A realistic test-bed infrastructures on which the candidates will be asked to perform experiments is used to assess the expertise level of the candidates.  These novel techniques for automated interviews will reduce the cost and time for both companies and students.</AbstractNarration>
