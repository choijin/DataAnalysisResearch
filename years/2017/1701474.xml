<AbstractNarration>This project is rooted in two ancient parts of mathematics: representation theory (the study of symmetry) and number theory (numerical solutions of equations). Though these appear to be two quite different areas of mathematics, the Local Langlands Correspondence (LLC) predicts surprising relations between them. Roughly speaking, it says that infinite-dimensional symmetries should correspond to equations whose solutions have a related collection of finite-dimensional symmetries. The goals of this project are first, to discover and explicitly verify new and interesting examples of the LLC, and second, to use the predictions of the LLC to make new discoveries in number theory and representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is about interactions between representation theory and number theory, as predicted by the Local Langlands Correspondence for general reductive groups. The LLC is a body of predicted relations between the representation theory of local Galois groups to representation theory of reductive groups over a p-adic field. The goals in this project are to discover and understand new and interesting aspects of the LLC, via explicit methods. There are five proposed directions of inquiry: Lie-primitive representations of Galois groups into complex Lie groups; representations of p-adic groups whose parameters are Lie-primitive; extending known constructions of epipelagic representations to higher depth; inequalities for Swan conductors; and Jordan decomposition of depth zero representations and LLC.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project is about connections between Number Theory and Symmetry.  Number Theory is the study of solutions of equations, such as x^4+1=0.  The solutions of this equation may be viewed as the vertices of a square, and they have four symmetries coming from reflections of the square. We call these Galois symmetries. The Galois symmetries  of  more complicated equations are difficult to find or predict.  The Local Langland Correspondence  (LLC) conjectures that Galois symmetries of equations correspond to other symmetries which are easier to find. The price to pay is that the other symmetries take place in infinite dimensions. This proposal concerns  certain infinite dimensional symmetries called Discrete Series Representations. In this setting, the Explicit  LLC has two main parts 1. Constructing discrete series representations 2. Finding the corresponding Galois symmetries.  The outcomes of the project extend our knowledge in these two directions.  Both discrete series representaions and Galois symmetries have a Depth, measured by a non-negative rational number.  The PI constructed all discrete series representations having depth zero, along with their Galois symmetries. This construction interpolates between two extreme depth-zero cases which were previously known (unipotent and supercuspidal). The PI's graduate student Stella Gatineau has found new examples of discrete series representations of positive depth. The PI also found new Galois symmetries as in 2, whose corresponding discrete series representation was previously known.  This involved an analysis of Depth of Galois symmetries, which led to spin-off results directly related to the LLC and also to other areas of Representation Theory.  The Broader Impact of the project arises from its connection to Euclidean geometry via symmetry. The PI had earlier designed a course at Boston College  on Eulclid's Elements with a student-participation format. During the time of the project the PI mentored graduate students (including Gatineau) who are now teaching Euclid's Elements on their own.
