<AbstractNarration>The University of California Irvine (UCI) is partnering with the Orange County Department of Education (OCDE) and Santa Ana Unified School District (SAUSD) to form a collaborative network of university and K-12 researchers and practitioners with the aim of promoting computational thinking for students in grades three through five. The intention is to build connections to a broader curriculum as reflected in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the Common Core State Standards (CCSS), to the language and discourse needed to ensure academic success, and to the learners' peers, community, families and culture needed to make learning relational and meaningful. The work will be situated in Santa Ana schools, where the majority of students are low-income, Hispanic, English language learners. It will use the principles of Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR), designing interventions to implement, study and refine, alongside OCDE and SAUSD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first academic year, the team will visit partner elementary schools to gather information about current teaching of computational thinking, conduct a district-wide survey of elementary school teachers, and gather examples of instructional materials developed nationally to determine those that could be adapted locally. During the first summer, researchers will work with a team of teachers to develop pilot materials and instructional units for the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade levels. These materials--scaffolded for non-native English speakers--will integrate computational thinking with NGSS and CCSS. During the second year, teachers will implement the instructional materials in their classrooms with support from UCI and OCDE. Data will be gathered to study the implementation process, the challenges faced and how they are addressed, the extent to which the materials engage the learners on the emotional, behavioral, and cognitive levels,  and the suitability of the materials for promoting computational thinking among the targeted learners. During the second summer, the team will further refine materials for broader implementation in Orange County.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Introduction The University of California, Irvine Schools of Information &amp; Computer Science and Education are collaborating with Santa Ana Unified School District to develop a "Collaborative Network of Educators for Computational Thinking for All Research" (CONECTAR). The goal of CONECTAR is to iteratively develop, pilot, evaluate, improve, and scale up an upper elementary curriculum for computational thinking that meets the needs of diverse learners. This is being carried out through a Research-Practice Partnership with UCI and SAUSD personnel collaborating together. In the 2017-2018 school year, we piloted the curriculum with seven teachers, which was adapted collaboratively during a summer institute in 2018. The first full year of implementation then took place in the 2018-2019 school year, largely with returning teachers but with one new teacher, totalling eight teachers and 240 students in four schools. Teachers implemented the curriculum for an average of an hour a week over the course of the year.  We held another summer institute in 2019, further adapting the curriculum for student and teacher needs, based on teacher experiences and our research evaluation.  This curriculum was then implemented in a follow-on NSF project in the 2019-2020 school year. Research Data Throughout the year we collected the following data from the classrooms implementing the curriculum. Qualitative data Classroom observations. We conducted weekly classroom observations using two widely used protocols for identifying effective instructional strategies for diverse learners. During these observation days, teachers wore an audio recorded mic to capture the instruction of a lesson and one-on-one instruction between teacher and student(s).  Student interviews. Four diverse students in each class were selected with input from the teachers for pre- and post-implementation individual interviews of about 15-20 minutes. These students were interviewed on two separate occasions at both pre and post, with one interview focused on capturing computational thinking and another interview focused on student identity with computer science.  Quantitative data Computational thinking pre- and post-test. A pre- and post-test was constructed using the "Bebras" tasks, consisting of multiple-choice questions that require students to think about computational thinking concepts such as algorithmic procedures and programs, data structures, models, and control flow and data flow.  End-of-unit Scratch projects. We collected and assessed students' final Scratch projects using a rubric that assesses overall proficiency in programming, user experience, and the use of coding and computational thinking constructs.  Personalized Scratch Assessments. We gave students Personalized Assessment Worksheets for Scratch (PAWS), which use an algorithm to automatically generate questions for students about key computational thinking concepts (e.g., loops, conditionals, variables) based on their own Scratch projects.  Pre- and post-survey results. We conducted a pre- and post-survey on students' attitudes and beliefs towards computer science.  Teaching and Learning Processes Teaching Processes The curriculum was implemented in all 8 classrooms for the entire year. Teachers were able to teach the curriculum all year, with occasional breaks for standardized testing, etc. One difference noted in teaching had to do with approaches to inquiry. Some teachers used more open inquiry instruction and some used more structured inquiry, with greater scaffolding and guidance given to students. In general, students in the latter classes demonstrated greater gains in both computational thinking and computer science identity, which was taken into account in revising the curriculum. Learning Processes All students in all the classes were able to successfully participate. We noted a great deal of engagement among students and enthusiasm to participate in the computational thinking activities. Teachers reported that students looked forward to the coding throughout the week, and they also reported parents discussing their students' enthusiasm for CONECTAR. Our review of students' Scratch projects indicated that the projects were quite complex, incorporating a range of computer science concepts and skills. In addition, students were asked what a computer scientist is before and after the implementation of the curriculum, and showed a much more in-depth understanding after engaging with the instructional materials. Outcomes Computational Thinking Outcomes Our analysis of test scores indicates that there were statistically significant improvements on student performance of computational thinking.   The questions we selected tested students on their understanding of algorithms and programs, data structures, models, and control flow and data flow. Students performed significantly better on items related to sequencing, conditional logic, and algorithmic thinking.  Student Identity Development Outcomes  Students were given the "Is Computer Science Me?" survey to measure their interests in and identification with the field of computer science. The survey mostly included three-point Likert scale items. We analyzed changes from pre- to post-survey scores and found that students significantly improved in the following categories: 1) students' experiences with computer science, 2) their perceptions of computer science, 3) their perceptions of themselves as computer scientists, and 4) family support for computer science. Students also reported more support for computer science from their friends, but this result was not statistically significant.
