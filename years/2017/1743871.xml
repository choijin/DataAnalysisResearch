<AbstractNarration>Many wildlife populations exhibit massive fluctuations in numbers across different habitats and through time. Among the most remarkable of these are the 10-year cycles, synchronized across all or parts of continents, shown by some mammal species in the northern hemisphere. Understanding the mechanisms that create and dampen these cycles, and synchronize them across a species' range, can illuminate the fundamental processes that influence population dynamics of wild species. Snowshoe hares exhibit classic 10-year population cycles across their northern range in Canada and Alaska, but in the southern part of their range (the northern continental U.S.) the cycles are thought to dampen or disappear, possibly due to habitat fragmentation and climate change. This project extends a long-term study of snowshoe hares across the western US and Canada to determine whether cycles are dampened in the lower 48 states, the role that climate change and habitat fragmentation play in cycle dampening, and the role that animal movement plays in synchronizing population dynamics across large spatial scales. The resulting data will both improve our understanding of a fundamental natural phenomenon and test hypotheses about the effects of human-caused changes on wildlife population dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this project continue to garner widespread interest among policymakers, forest managers, and the general public, as they have direct implications for recovery of the threatened Canada lynx, a specialist predator on hares. More broadly, results will examine how forest fragmentation and climate change affect population dynamics across continental scales. The project will foster strong collaborations with hundreds of citizen scientists and involve dozens of undergraduate and graduate students and international scientists in the research. The lead investigator will present at least 2 invited lectures or discussions per year to state and federal agencies, and the research will continue to attract attention from diverse media outlets.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp; This NSF LTREB award has supported field, laboratory, and computational research that has revealed key principles underlying wild animal population dynamics; it also has provided practical science-based guidelines to improve wildlife and land use decisionmaking on a dynamic planet.&nbsp; The key focal species -- snowshoe hares -- is a high profile species to the public, the main prey of a Federally Threatened species (Canada lynx), and a scientific poster child for understanding drivers of dramatic 10-year population cycles. The overall project included two closely related 5-year LTREB projects. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decadal LTREB research plan extended to 20 years the PI's snowshoe hare population dynamic studies in &gt; 35 sites in the Western U.S., creating the most spatially and temporally extensive and intensive time series of snowshoe hare dynamics in the U.S. (&gt; 2,000 hares captured). &nbsp;&nbsp;Coupled with novel computational population models and genomic assays, both at the focal study sites and across the hare?s range, the field data led to several key findings: a) heterogeneity in forest stand structure -- driven by both natural forest-meadow patchiness and by forest harvest practices ? is sufficient to dampen snowshoe hare cycles in the southern part of their range (essentially, south of the US/Canada border); b) historic and ongoing breaks in hare movement and gene flow resulted in 3 genetically different groups of snowshoe hares in the Northern Boreal, Pacific Northwest, and Rockies; d) novel patch based approaches to silviculture can greatly reduce negative effects of logging on snowshoe hares (and the Canada Lynx), while still accomplishing the silvicultural goals of increasing tree growth and yield; c) hares have some scope for accommodating stressors through behavioral shifts, although there are firm limits to the breadth of such plasticity.</p> <p>&nbsp; Importantly, these field studies, complemented by genetic and computational tools, led to the serendipitous discovery that the hare's annual color molt from brown to winter white as camouflage against seasonal snow is severely compromised by the global trend of decreasing number of days with snow on the ground.&nbsp; Camouflage mismatched hares suffer higher mortality, sufficient to drive future population declines.&nbsp; These discoveries have established seasonal coat color mismatch (occurring in 21 diverse mammal and bird species worldwide) as a charismatic model system both for interdisciplinary research into the scope for local adaptive rescue in a changing world, and for compelling outreach to policymakers and the general public.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus, the research funded by this award has been interdisciplinary and collaborative in nature, and served as a platform providing experiential learning, science mentoring of students, practical science-based recommendations to improve land and wildlife management, and public outreach. As a measure of interdisciplinarity and collaborative scientific output: publications from this project have been numerous, highly cited, and included &gt;70 coauthors across two dozen universities and at least nine countries.&nbsp; My teams have included &gt;75 undergraduate and 6 graduate students. Further, this LTREB project has provided specific management recommendations for recovery planning for Threatened Canada lynx (<em>Lynx Canadensis</em>). These practical insights from our research include: a) how novel logging practices could maintain hare (and lynx) densities; and b) new ways for managers to rigorously estimate hare densities at large scales using hare pellets and DNA based individual genotypes coupled with cutting edge statistical capture-recapture models.&nbsp; Our work also engaged a broad community of &gt;100 biologists, trappers, hunters, naturalists and other citizen scientists in research outcomes (eg collection of samples for our genetic analysis, time series for our population analyses.&nbsp; Finally, although this award did not support work outside U.S., the work has fostered collaborative international relationships in Portugal, Austria, Scotland, Sweden, and Bhutan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/09/2020<br>      Modified by: L.
