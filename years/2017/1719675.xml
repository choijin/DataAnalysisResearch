<AbstractNarration>Ocean warming is affecting life on our planet in many ways. High temperature can disrupt the endosymbioses between dinoflagellate algae (Symbiodinium spp.) and reef-building corals (i.e. coral bleaching), thereby risking the global loss of a critical marine ecosystem. The physiological, ecological and evolutionary responses of coral-dinoflagellate symbioses to environmental stress brought on by global climate change are complex. The spread of certain types of symbiotic algae may increase the thermal stress tolerance among corals and help them persist in warmer oceans, but perhaps not without trade-offs to the health of the coral. The dinoflagellate tentatively named Symbiodinium trenchi has become increasingly more common in numerous corals throughout the Caribbean, but is often at low-abundance relative to other symbionts. While S. trenchi can increase in abundance during and after warming, it is often displaced by other symbionts following a return to normal conditions. Genetic evidence indicates that S. trenchi recently invaded and/or expanded in the Caribbean and has developed associations with many corals that seem to be poorly optimized, or mal-adapted, relative to the symbioses it maintains with corals in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the symbiosis ecology and physiology of S. trenchi in corals from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Bleaching experiments will examine the effects of increased temperature on transfer of carbon from the algae to the host coral (via stable isotopic tagging), as well as photosynthesis and growth among colonies harboring S. trenchi compared to colonies harboring other Symbiodinium spp. The potential for symbiont community shifts as well as altered long-term colony growth based on bleaching severity and recovery time will be investigated. A reciprocal transplant study will examine the competitive interaction and stability of symbionts among Pacific corals. These studies will test if the continued spread of S. trenchi will affect coral growth in the Caribbean and whether it might behave similarly in the Indo-Pacific if environmental conditions worsen. The results from this project have the potential to supply transformative information regarding how (or if) a widely distributed symbiotic algal species may influence the resilience of reef-building corals and their potential to survive projected increases in ocean warming due to climate change.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In addition to training one postdoctoral scholar and several graduate students, this project will enhance scientific discovery and participation of underrepresented groups via several outreach efforts with the Palau National Aquarium, Palau International Coral Reef Center, and local schools. Educational units in marine symbioses and science will be developed with several local high school teachers and students, and unique research opportunities will be provided to students at the Palau Community College. Likewise, a new educational display addressing how global climate may impact coral reefs, and describing the current research to better understand the physiology of coral-algal symbioses, will be developed and presented at the University of Delaware open house "Coast Day." The display will be donated subsequently to the Palau Aquarium for future use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International and Integrative Activities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="p1">The goals of this project were to investigate in detail 1) the ecology and physiological performance of the symbiotic algae <em>Symbiodinium trenchii </em>(type D1a) relative to other <em>Symbiodiniu</em>m spp. and 2) the role of <em>S. trenchii</em> as a functional symbiont critical to the health and growth of reef-building corals from the Caribbean and the Pacific. This work investigated the potential for competition between different <em>Symbiodinium</em>, which is important to understand how coral-<em>Symbiodinium</em> populations respond to thermal stress. We examined the physiological trade-offs that may exist for the coral host when associating with symbiont species of different thermal tolerances. The experiments we conducted were designed to address questions about the costs and benefits of <em>S. trenchii</em> spreading to other coral communities around the world as oceans continue to warm and/or as thermal regimes de-stabilize.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Experimental thermal stress treatments indicated differences in uptake and translocated dietary products between species and within biological compartments (animal, algal, skeleton). Interestingly, under thermal stress (32 &deg;C) symbiotic algae retained the ability to uptake inorganic carbon. However, downstream translocation of the metabolized carbon appeared to be significantly reduced in the skeletal compartments of corals that did not host <em>S. trenchii </em>(with the exception of <em>Porites rus</em>). These results indicate that many corals in Palau, which do not associate with <em>S. trenchii</em>, translocate lesser amounts of carbon to skeletal components under thermal stress. These results provide alarming biological evidence of future climatic scenarios as predicted by IPCC. Our research locations in Nikko Bay have been characterized to have the biogeochemical and thermal properties of what is generally predicted for &ldquo;normal&rdquo; conditions in the tropical Pacific in the year 2100. That is, decreased pH to approximately 7.8 and seawater temperatures at least 1 &deg;C greater than the present offshore Palauan coral reefs. Therefore, these biological measurements and our physiological comparisons are of paramount importance for understanding how coral respond to climatic stressors.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Additionally, in Palau we examined natural abundance isotopic <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>13</sup>C values of coral host tissue,<em> Symbiodinium</em>, and CaCO<sub>3</sub> skeleton. The results indicate that 1) corals located in Nikko Bay are receiving less autotrophically fixed carbon than conspecifics from offshore reefs and 2) corals from Nikko Bay are functioning at a higher trophic level (i.e., heterotrophy) as indicated by &delta;<sup>15</sup>N and &delta;<sup>13</sup>C than conspecifics only 6 km away on &ldquo;pristine&rdquo; offshore reefs. This apparent flexibility in trophic function (photoautotrophy to heterotrophy) is somewhat novel and is likely partially facilitated by the host&rsquo;s ability to associate with <em>S. trenchii</em>. Using isotopes, we have documented, described, and compared food-web dynamics of 8 different scleractinian corals from Nikko Bay and an adjacent coral reef (current conditions). Corals from Nikko Bay: 1) mostly associate with the thermally tolerant <em>S. trenchii</em>, 2) show no differences in the amount of inorganic carbon that is metabolized and incorporated in the coral skeleton at the increased stressful temperature 32 &deg;C, and 3) obtain more carbon via holozoic processes (i.e., heterotrophy) than offshore counterparts. This is in direct comparison to the offshore conspecific corals that 1) associate with various types of clade &ldquo;C&rdquo; <em>Symbiodinium</em> spp., 2) show significant decreased amounts of metabolized photosynthetically-fixed inorganic carbon in CaCO<sub>3 </sub>skeleton at the increased stressful temperature 32 &deg;C, and 3) obtain majority of carbon via photoautotrophic symbiosis instead of holozoic processes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our research was well represented at the 13<sup>th</sup> International Coral Reef Symposium where PI&rsquo;s and students presented some of our findings to the coral research community. Furthermore, we have given dozens of professional seminars at national and international venues that have featured our research findings in Palau. There is great interest in our results from this project and we have participated in several events to communicate our research to the &ldquo;non-scientific&rdquo; public and grade school children. Additionally, we have added infrastructure to Palau International Coral Reef Center by donating our experimental tank system (pumps, tanks, and shade cloth) for future research use of the facility (Figure 1).</p> <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p> <p>In conclusion, the inshore coral reef habitats (Nikko Bay) of Palau resemble temperature and pH conditions similar to those projected by 2100 AD. In contrast to many studies that focus on one or two taxa, we compared the trophic ecology of eight species and thermal physiology of six species of reef-building coral found from both inshore and offshore reefs. Coral from inshore habitats were found to associate with <em>Symbiodinium trenchii</em>. Corals from Nikko Bay relied on zooplankton for metabolism considerably more than conspecifics from offshore reefs. Offshore corals depended more on autotrophy and harbored different species of symbiotic algae. These findings indicate that corals rely more on a combination of energy sources to acclimatize to stressful environments. Our findings across genetically diverse taxa demonstrate that trophic flexibility and symbiotic association are essential to maintaining coral metabolism to cope with increased ocean warming.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/09/2017<br>      Modified by: Dustin&nbsp;W&nbsp;Kemp</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1719675/1719675_10238943_1499633835296_IMG_0142--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1719675/1719675_10238943_1499633835296_IMG_0142--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Corals of Nikko Bay, Palau"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1719675/1719675_10238943_1499633835296_IMG_0142--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Corals of Nikko Bay, Palau"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Coral reef community from Nikko Bay located in the  Rock Islands of Palau.</div> <div class="imageCredit">D.
