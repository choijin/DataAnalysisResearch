<AbstractNarration>Spinal and rib cage deformities that result from scoliosis (curvature of the spine) in adolescents can have devastating consequences, including severe restrictions in mobility, pain, and problems with lung function. While spinal fusion surgery is the gold-standard for correcting scoliotic spine deformity, patient outcomes are generally poor as the fusion does not support the continued growth of the spine that is expected in this population. There is currently a lack of both adolescent cadaveric scoliotic spine specimens and computational models of the scoliotic spine, which severely limits the systematic engineering of improved surgical and device interventions for treating scoliosis. This project is developing and validating computer models of the adolescent, scoliotic spine and rib cage and then demonstrating the feasibility of such deformity-specific models in the medical device design process by optimizing novel spine deformity correction systems from Globus Medical, Inc. The scoliotic deformity-specific computer models will serve as predictive tools to reliably guide the design, placement, timing and method of surgical intervention. The modeling and simulation tools developed in this study will significantly reduce the time needed to design, test and implement investigational deformity correction devices, which will subsequently improve the quality of life for individuals with scoliosis. In addition to the research collaboration, this project is integrating undergraduate and graduate student training into the research project and providing them with opportunities for interaction and internships with a medical device company. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is pursuing three specific objectives to accomplish the overall goal of developing and validating a model of the adolescent, scoliotic spine. 1) This project is creating a finite element model template of the normal 10-year-old thoracolumbar spine (with pelvis) and rib cage and validating this model using in vitro kinematic data from biomechanical testing of adult cadaveric specimens. 2) The research team is developing a deformity-specific thoracolumbar spine (with pelvis) and rib cage finite element model for the Lenke 1AN curve type and validating this model using in vivo spine range of motion data previously collected from adolescents with scoliosis.  3) In collaboration with Globus Medical, Inc., the research team is conducting a feasibility study to apply the validated deformity-specific model for the design and placement optimizations of conventional scoliosis implants and a novel, growth-friendly spine deformity correction system. Upon completion of the proposed objectives, the foundation will be laid to effectively integrate medical image processing, computational modeling, and device design and testing for scoliosis treatment.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional (3D) deformity that is characterized by lateral bending and axial rotation of the spine. Severe cases of AIS deformity (Cobb angle&gt;40?) undergo surgical intervention. Recently growth friendly interventions for skeletally immature AIS subjects have shown promising results. Anterior Vertebral Body Tethering (AVBT) is one such growth friendly intervention that provides 3D correction of the deformity along with restoration of range of motion (ROM) of the spine. However, various parameters affect the outcome of this surgery, such as curve location, number of screws and amount of tether tension. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop and validate a 10-year-old normative pediatric thoracic and lumbar spine Finite Element (FE) model with rib cage and pelvis that can be used to create a deformity-specific AIS FE model to simulate and optimize surgical intervention using AVBT.</p> <p>Chest and abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scans were used to create a normative 10-year-old thoracic and lumbar spine FE model with rib cage, pelvis with age-, and level-appropriate material properties for bone, intervertebral discs and spinal ligaments. This normative FE model was morphed to a 16-year-old Lenke 1AN deformity-specific AIS FE model using dual-kriging and used to simulate AVBT surgeries. A total of 48 AVBT simulations were performed with various parametric combinations of number of instrumented levels (2: all and alternate), screw placement (2: lateral and anterior-lateral), applied force levels (3: all, ends only, and apex?1) and tether force (4: 100, 200, 300 and 400 N). Clinical parameters of interest such as Cobb angle, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis and axial vertebral rotation were computed, and optimal parameter combinations for surgical planning were identified.</p> <p>Intellectual Merit: The normative and deformity-specific AIS FE models created in this study are the most comprehensive pediatric FE models available, till date. Such FE models could serve as valuable pre-operative clinical tools to aid in patient-specific surgical planning and interventional prognosis for AIS spine deformity treatment along with the potential to optimize surgical parameters and reduce surgery times, and thereby minimize the risk to pediatric patients.</p> <p>Broader Impact: The integration of computational modeling to optimize pediatric spine deformity device design can be translated beyond guiding AIS treatment to also understand other pediatric thoracospinal deformities due to spinal muscular atrophy, early onset scoliosis, pectus excavatum etc.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/08/2020<br>      Modified by: Sriram&nbsp;Balasubramanian</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1748167/1748167_10506504_1599159233099_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1748167/1748167_10506504_1599159233099_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1748167/1748167_10506504_1599159233099_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">FE hexahedral mesh of the 95th height percentile 10 year old male normative spine, ribcage, pelvis, and Intervertebral discs and spinal ligaments.
