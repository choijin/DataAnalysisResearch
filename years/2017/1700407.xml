<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the travel expenses of participants in the conference "Ergodic Theory and Operator Algebras" that will be held from June 5-9, 2017, on the campus of Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, Texas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will be run as one of the two concentration weeks in the 2017 installment of the Workshop in Analysis and Probability, which takes place each summer at Texas A&amp;M University.  Recent separate developments in both the field of ergodic theory and operator algebras means that a conference on the interaction of these subjects is timely.  This conference is unique in that it will focus on the intersection of these areas and aimed at graduate students and junior researchers. Funds from this award will support the participation in this conference by U.S. graduate students and junior researchers without other sources of funding. More details are available at the conference website http://www.math.tamu.edu/~kerr/etoa2017/.</AbstractNarration>

The Concentration Week responded to what the organizers recognized as an urgent need for a meeting that would be primarily directed at graduate students and junior researchers and would tap into the considerable amount of leading expertise that the U.S. boasts in ergodic theory and its connections to operator algebras, with the aim of sparking the growth of a new generation of researchers poised to tackle the interdisciplinarydemands of these areas.
