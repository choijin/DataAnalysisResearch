<AbstractNarration>The research supported by this award will investigate the taking on of ethical choices and non-violent identities under conditions of confinement. From airport security lines and waiting rooms to mass incarceration, confinement has become entrenched in everyday life. The researcher will focus on what happens when life under confinement is not reduced to either defiance or compliance. The goal is to understand if ethical solutions, rather than intensifying rules or surveillance techniques, can solve crisis-level problems, such as cycles of rage and violence. To investigate this question, the researcher will focus on the extreme example of prisons, taking advantage of the research opportunity offered by the introduction of "faith and character-based programs" across Alabama state prisons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted by Johns Hopkins University anthropology doctoral student, Thomas Thornton, with guidance from Dr. Naveeda Khan, inside a maximum-security prison faith dorm. Through ethnographic fieldwork grounded in long-term observations, interviews, and engagement with prison and chaplaincy personnel, the researcher will pursue three overarching questions: How does penal compliance connect to an ethics of nonviolence? How is nonviolence effectively encouraged through textual study? How is nonviolence cultivated and embodied by the prisoners? By studying how faith is practiced among male inmates, the researcher's project will examine the micro-processes through which nonviolent life is fostered, even adjacent to the perpetual presence of violence.  Findings from this research will contribute to prison policy discussions among scholars, legislators, and the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Based within a maximum-security prison "faith dorm" in Alabama, the researcher's fifteen-month ethnographic (or qualitative) project examined the relationship between religion and penal security.  By engaging with faith-dorm residents and observing attending chaplains' ministry both inside the prison and as part of a local prison-ministry organization, this project tracked how religion (specifically Christianity) worked to create spaces of nonviolence inside a highly understaffed, under-resourced, and statistically violent prison.  It began with central questions: How do prison security and Christianity or its ministry shape one another?  How does this overlapping relationship affect the ethical commitments of the prison, the inmate, and the surrounding Christian (and secular) communities?  Rather than exploring these questions by continuing anthropological studies of church-based Christianity, this project focused on chaplaincy (a rising enterprise across the US), and it showed how its presence in nontraditional religious spaces (like the prison) affects the ethical projects, social texture, and embodied dispositions of spiritually inclined persons.  The 176-man, non-cellular faith dorm, which allowed for all prison-recognized faiths (or no faith), is informally "graced-based."  Here, grace is not specifically Christian, but it speaks to an open possibility of social redemption beyond the prison's moral economies of incentives, earning or indebtedness.  Through an initial gifting of space, reduced noise, less physical violence, new family-connection possibilities, etc., this faith dorm uses a ethic of restorative justice - where crimes against the state are reframed as harms against people or communities - to aim at crafting ethical life primarily through social reflection on one's interconnectedness within an overcrowded prison above the ongoing system of penal governance, where individuals adhere to pre-existing rules.   The researcher found that while demarcating spaces for religious ethics are only moderately successful as a tactic of nonviolent population management for under-resourced prison officials, deploying faith dorms inside the prison expands the local public engagement with the correctional facility and, internally, opens up other ethical possibilities for service and community among inmates difficult to locate within the prison's un-nuanced behavioral rubric of  compliance or defiance.  The researcher found the faith dorm is both another tool of social control and a way to open space for inmates, chaplains, and local townsfolk to imagine the prison (and the prisoner) as something otherwise.  To be clear, the response is not one of social utopia: nonviolence is a state never attained, the heavy majority Christian religious volunteers are more likely to have a limited approach to Muslim inmates, and while opening new ethical possibilities for inmates the idea of religion or the Christian notion of human nature as fundamentally broken could lead to moral scorekeeping among inmates as frequently as it opened new vistas of community.    Regardless of how statistically successful the faith dorm is in diminishing the prison's official infraction rates, the import of the researcher's project for mass-incarceration lies in showing how the prison works to narrow its real and imagined gap with mainstream society.  In tracing how the faith dorm creates a surrounding community of chaplains and support personnel that extend well outside of Alabama, the research shows how alternative frameworks of justice beyond thinking punishment as unending moral indebtedness to the state can open the prison up to new communities and possibilities of so-called free-world engagement, which can expand the ethical possibilities available to inmates as they do the everyday work of inhabiting dangerous carceral space.    This research lays an important foundation for offender reentry, a vitally important, yet under-funded, aspect of our society, considering between 80 and 90 percent of the nearly two million incarcerated U.S. persons will eventually be released.  Within prisons, the research's focus on a "grace-based" carceral environment affects how we consider inmates' understandings of themselves and their carceral environments in ways other than as prisoner.  And this research empowers prisons to see their management strategies beyond crude efficiency problems of a population or as behavioral economies seeking to correct an inmate's "bad choices" through incentives that double as basic needs.  Stepping away from the Christian connotations of grace, the researched prison model encourages turning this upside down: building penal ethics from a foundation of ensured basic needs, rather than stripping them away to be earned back one by one.    More broadly, this project shows how the punitive vocabularies of "choice" or "population" or "incentive" that circulate and sediment not only in prison governance but in mainstream Western democratic politics can be complicit in the same violence it seeks to efface.  Alternatively, this research highlights the need for different framings of justice, carceral spatial arrangements, and interpersonal networks that move across the prison threshold in order to think the prison and the prisoner otherwise.  Ultimately, the impact of this project lies in initiating a longer and challenging set of conversations about how we might begin to decouple social accountability from carceral punishment in the U.S.           Last Modified: 04/17/2019       Submitted by: Thomas Thornton]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
