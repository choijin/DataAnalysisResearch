<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The team aims to make topological superconducting nanowires as the building blocks of new quantum computers that are more robust and energy efficient than current quantum computers.  Nanodevices based on these nanowires are used to demonstrate the basic rules for quantum computations.  The superconducting nanowires are made of indium doped tin telluride, and are expected to alleviate some of the challenging technical constraints imposed on a competing system, a semiconducting nanowire with large spin orbit coupling.  A portion of the research is included in the undergraduate and graduate physics curriculum to inspire and encourage students to pursue research.  Undergraduate students are involved in the project through senior research projects, REU programs, and summer research internships.  Collaboration between Yale University and the University of Maryland at College Park provide broader networking opportunities to graduate students.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The team aims to demonstrate braiding anyon world lines using indium-doped tin telluride (SnTe) topological superconductor nanowires and nanowire junctions.  Indium-doped SnTe - SnTe junction nanowires are synthesized via a growth method that adapts the vapor-liquid-solid growth mechanism.  Superconducting topological nanowires eliminate the need for superconducting contacts.  Nanodevices using the heterojunction nanowires are be fabricated to demonstrate the signatures of Majorana fermions (MFs) at the junctions and perform fusion and braiding operations.  A half quantum flux magnetic field is to be applied parallel to the nanowire to ensure the topological superconducting phase while small additional local magnetic fields are to be used to generate, manipulate, and fuse MFs.  Quantum dot devices on the nanowire are  used to read out the parity through the parity-to-charge conversion.  The use of magnetic fields, instead of electric gating, combined with relaxed conditions for the placement of chemical potentials, represents technical advantages for this system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funded project is to make nanowires of topological crystalline insulator tin telluride (SnTe), induce superconductivity into the nanowires, and measure the predicted topological superconductivity and presence of Majorana bound states that are expected at the ends of the nanowires.  Topological crystalline insulators are no ordinary insulators and possess special surface electronic states that are robust against impurities and defects.  When superconductivity is induced into the special surface states in a one-dimensional confined geometry, special electronic bound states known as Majorana bound states are expected.   Using Majorana bound states, the proposed system is a promising material platform to realize robust quantum bits, known as qubits, in contrast to existing qubits that use conventional electrons for quantum computations.    Very narrow nanowires of SnTe were sucessfully synthesized and Josephson junction devices were fabricated on these nanowires to probe the detailed nature of the electronic properties of the nanowires.  Josephson junction devices comprise of two superconducting metals that sandwish a short segment of the SnTe nanowire.  Careful characterizations of the Josephson junction devices reveal in detail the nature of the superconductivity induced in SnTe nanowires.  The measurements suggest that the observed superconductivity is novel with unique s +/- is symmetry, which has not been found in any other systems previously.  For such experiments, it was critical to measure narrow nanowires, where the novel effects can be clearly seen.  All the conditions to realize the predicted Majorana bound states are met and experimentally verified.  The broader impact of the funded project is development of a unique material system that can realize and support Majorana bound states, potentially enabling robust quantum computers that do not suffer the major issue of decoherence that plagues existing quantum bit technologies.  The project lays the material foundation for future works on developing qubits based on Majorana bound states.
