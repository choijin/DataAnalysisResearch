<AbstractNarration>The hormone testosterone (T) occurs in females as well as males, and there is growing interest in understanding the role of T in female reproductive behavioral biology. This doctoral dissertation project investigates relationships between T and maternal behaviors in free-ranging monkeys. The study of T in relation to motherhood in these non-human primates will contribute to the literature on the hormonal mechanisms of parenting, and provide comparative data for understanding the development of human-like parenting behavior during primate and hominin evolution. The project will facilitate training in STEM fields for undergraduates and graduates, including women from underserved and underrepresented backgrounds. This project will also support research collaborations and public science outreach about human and primate biology and evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the role of T in regulation of maternal care away from the current offspring towards future reproduction, and displays of aggression to other group members who can potentially harm offspring ('maternal aggression'). The investigators will collect longitudinal data on behaviors and physiology from 49 Cayo Santiago rhesus macaque mothers during their first 3 months postpartum, when maternal care steeply decreases in preparation for the reproductive transition to the next offspring, and when maternal aggression towards others is heightened. Advances in field endocrinology, including the measurement of fecal hormone metabolites, will enable the continuous tracking of physiology along with a rich suite of behaviors and provide new methods for future studies. Comparative data from living non-human primates are valuable for investigating the evolutionary origins of human behavior. The project will therefore contribute to nascent efforts to expand the study of T across taxa and sexes, and to enhance our understanding of how parental care evolved in primates and early humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project and outcomes   Despite studies of the relationships between testosterone (T) and parenthood in male vertebrates, these relationships are relatively unexplored for female vertebrates. The gap in existing studies is especially true among non-avian taxa including primates, the order to which humans belong.  Recent evidence has begun to suggest that T may influence parental behavior in women, as it does in men, by modulating: 1) trade-offs in caretaking effort; and 2) motivation to display aggression towards others to protect offspring. As yet, no studies to date have examined the role of T in female reproductive behaviors, using direct measures of behaviors in relation to individual variation in T concentrations, in any free-ranging primates.

Using the behavioral and physiological data, we tested the following hypotheses and predictions:  H1. Postpartum T mediates reproductive trade-offs in female rhesus macaques.  Prediction 1.1. Larger increases in T concentrations predict a shorter time to next conception.  Prediction 1.2. Larger increases in T concentrations predict reduced maternal care in current offspring.  H2. Postpartum T mediates the expression of maternal aggression in female rhesus macaques.  Prediction 2. Larger increases in T concentrations predict higher maternal aggression.
