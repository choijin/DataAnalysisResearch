<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical&lt;br/&gt;Current wireless systems, such as WiFi and 4G cellular networks, operate at microwave frequencies below 6 GHz.  Since transfer speeds in this limited spectrum are typically only 10s of megabits-per-second, an important aim of 5G is the development of gigabit-per-second wireless networks providing speeds more similar to wired networks.  Recently, intense research has demonstrated that gigabit wireless is possible by exploiting millimeter-wave bands at 60 GHz and above, yet at those frequencies signal losses from obstacles are prohibitive and the cost of semiconductor devices is currently high.  This project proposes acquisition of a channel measurement instrument allowing detailed study of the 10-40 GHz frequency range (the Ku-Ka bands), likely providing the needed bandwidth increase for gigabit wireless, but without some drawbacks present above 60 GHz.  To date, the Ku-Ka bands have received little attention, and detailed information on signal transmission in the presence of common building materials in Ku-Ka is not openly available.  Measurements performed with the proposed instrumentation will correct this situation, resulting in an open database of building materials for the Ku-Ka bands.  This database is expected to have immense value to industry and academia in the assessment and planning of wireless networks operating in the 10-40 GHz range, supporting the development of practical gigabit wireless networks and devices. The instrument will also support new experiments in multiple-antenna communications, radar, and remote sensing. The instrument will find extensive use in undergraduate teaching and research, exposing approximately 80 students per year to state-of-the-art equipment and techniques.  Availability of the instrumentation to other institutions within the Lehigh Valley at no cost will provide opportunities for new collaborative research.&lt;br/&gt;Technical&lt;br/&gt;To support detailed characterization of the Ku-Ka bands for 5G networks and beyond, this project proposes the acquisition of a 4-40 GHz channel sounder consisting of a high dynamic range vector network analyzer, where two of the ports may be optically remoted up to 150m.  Further, switches at the ports accommodate up to 8 antennas per port for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) propagation studies.  This instrumentation enables a comprehensive database of building material properties, such as permittivity, conductivity, and rough surface and random volume parameters, to be developed for the Ku-Ka bands, which is expected to be extremely important for wireless networks in 5G and beyond.  In-situ measurement of building materials at several sites on and off campus will allow the database to include not only mean values, but also statistical variation of properties.  Employing the extracted properties in detailed ray-tracing simulations will reveal which bands are most suitable as a replacement for currently used wireless bands, and will allow the true necessity and/or benefits of beamforming, MIMO transmission, and massive MIMO to be quantified.  The capability of the system to support direct MIMO measurement of 8x8 channels at up to four nodes will allow the underlying accuracy of the extracted material properties to be assessed.  Given the flexibility of the system, new experimentation in MIMO communications, MIMO radar, and sensing from unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) will help advance the state-of-the-art in those areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the past few decades, personal wireless communications has become an integral part of people's lives, allowing them to stay connected with family, friends, and co-workers, as well as to have instant access to a wealth of online services and information.  Data-hungry mobile applications, such as video conferencing, video streaming, online gaming, etc., are becoming the norm, which not only is leading to high congestion of radio-frequency (RF) bands, but also is limiting the performance and number of users that can be supported by mobile services. A solution envisioned for 5G networks and beyond is to use much higher frequencies for the RF signals than have been used previously.  For example, traditional networks use the UHF band, with frequencies of 3 GHz or lower.  By moving to millimeter wave (mm-wave) bands above 30 GHz, a huge amount of bandwidth is available, effectively relieving wireless congestion.  The ability to deploy wireless networks successfully in mm-wave bands requires detailed knowledge of how these high frequency RF signals interact with building materials, such as glass, concrete, and drywall.  Although UHF signals tend to easily pass through or bend around most building materials, mm-wave signals may be easily blocked by the same materials.  The two key parameters for assessing how mm-wave signals interact with materials are the permittivity and the loss tangent.  Permittivity indicates how much a material will reflect a signal that hits it.  Loss tangent on the other hand quantifies how much a signal will be weakened by traveling through the material. Permittivity and loss tangent together are referred to as the "complex permittivity," and having an accurate estimate of the complex permittivity of building materials is critical for developing high performance wireless networks.  A system was developed in this NSF MRI project that allows the complex permittivity of common building materials to be measured with seamless coverage over the 4-40 GHz frequency range, providing a more complete picture of how material properties change when transitioning from traditional bands near 3 GHz up to mm-wave bands above 30 GHz.  The main components of the developed system are depicted in Fig. 1, consisting of (a) a ZNB40 vector network analyzer (VNA) that can generate and measure RF signals from 0-40 GHz, (b) horn antennas which connect to the VNA and launch and receive radio waves, and (c) a compact anechoic chamber where building samples can be measured without interference from the surrounding environment.  In addition to developing this measurement system, algorithms and computer software were created to allow complex permittivity to be accurately extracted from the VNA measurements, despite many possible sources of error.  The software leverages the power of a graphics processing unit (GPU) to accelerate computations, allowing very fast estimation of complex permittivity from the data.  There are currently two important scientific impacts of this work.  First, details of the measurement system, computer codes, and example data sets are now freely available online for interested researchers.  It is expected that these resources will help other individuals and organizations develop their own measurement capability, resulting in increased knowledge on building material properties in mm-wave bands.  Second, we have extracted the complex permittivity of a number of important building materials in the 4-40 GHz range, including drywall, plywood, oriented strand board (OSB), clay brick, concrete, glass, and foam insulation.  This published data can be used for network planning and optimization of current and future wireless networks using mm-wave bands.  The acquisition of the 4-40 GHz measurement system has also positively impacted education and student research opportunities at Lafayette College.  For example, the equipment has allowed several undergraduate student researchers to be trained in state-of-the-art RF measurements.  Approximately 20-30 students per year have also benefited from the instrumentation in the form of electromagnetics demonstrations and hands-on coursework.  Finally, this equipment has been used in a research collaboration between electrical engineering and biology to develop radio-frequency identification (RFID) hardware to help track local species of birds for studies in animal behavior and evolution.  Outside of Lafayette College, the instrumentation has been used to support projects in a nearby aerospace club for high school students, teaching the students and their parents about radar technology and its critical role in aerospace applications.
