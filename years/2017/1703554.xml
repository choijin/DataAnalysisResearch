<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2017 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Lien-Yung  Kao is " Thermodynamic formalism and its applications to deformation spaces." The host institution for the fellowship is University of Chicago, and the sponsoring scientist is Amie Wilkinson.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The field of dynamical systems was pioneered around the turn of the 20th Century by Henri Poincar and George Birkhoff. Since then, its development has been influenced by adjacent areas of mathematics (e.g., number theory, geometry, probability), and other natural sciences (e.g., celestial mechanics, statistical mechanics, population biology). The proposed project belongs to that rich tradition and focuses on deriving fundamental results for systems arising from geometry and topology, in particular, through a dynamics tool?thermodynamic formalism.      With the same spirit of thermodynamics, thermodynamic formalism was introduced by Sinai, Ruelle, and Bowen in the 1970s as a tool for describing the behavior of large ensembles of trajectories and related dynamics objects such as entropy and equilibrium states. Entropy is a crucial number in dynamics that quantifies the dynamical complexity. Interestingly, in many cases, entropy captures the geometric features of the systems. Thermodynamic formalism intertwines dynamical and geometrical perspectives of entropy and other dynamics quantities. Hence, it becomes a convenient tool for understanding dynamics and geometry.       Many proposed problems are completed and match with the expectations. In what follows, the outcomes of the project in intellectual merit and broader impact.  Intellectual merit  The proposed project concerns applying dynamics tools to study geometry and topology problems. Especially using entropy, a dynamics quantity, to reveal the geometry of the ambient space, so-called entropy rigidity. On top of the, using entropy rigidity to study the shape of deformations spaces of surfaces.       Many results are known in this direction when the surface is closed. During this project, the PI successfully generalized these results to surfaces with punctures.
