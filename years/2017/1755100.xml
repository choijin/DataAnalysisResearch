<AbstractNarration>Social scientists have long theorized about the influence of networks on behavior, how they sustain cooperation, transmit information, and facilitate economic transactions. With the increasing availability of network data in a variety of social contexts, scientists now have the opportunity to subject theory to rigorous empirical testing and uncover new facts to improve understanding of social behavior and better design economic policies to advance the national welfare. Toward this end, this research develops new econometric tools for the analysis of network models, especially models of network formation. New tools are needed to account for the unique structure of network data and complexity of network models.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The investigator studies econometric models of network formation with strategic interactions. These are latent-index models that allow links formed by other individuals to directly influence one's own propensity to form links. A main objective of this research is to prove a central limit theorem relevant for inference both in static models which use as data only a single snapshot of a large network, and dynamic models which exploit a short time series of a large network. The investigator also develops practical methods for inference. In studying the dependence structure of large networks, this research is also relevant for inference in models of social interactions when the network is endogenous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Network science has historically been primarily a theoretical field, but the past decades have seen significant progress in the collection of network data.

Accordingly, the last few years have seen rapid growth in the development of statistical tools for the analysis of network data. However, there remains a lack of appropriate tools for answering questions of interest to economists. The economic perspective on network science emphasizes models with strategic interactions, where an agent’s decisions are functions of other agents’ decisions. A well-known example is peer effects in adolescent drug use. Strategic interactions generate a nonstandard form of autocorrelation between units in the network, and standard inference tools that fail to account for this autocorrelation can be erroneously optimistic about the statistical significance of estimates.     This project develops new econometric tools for the analysis of network data with strategic interactions and large-sample theory justifying the use of these tools in the typical setting where the analyst observes a small number of large networks. Specific outcomes include new network autocorrelation robust standard errors for experimental and observational data, algorithms for computing equilibria, and central limit theorems (CLTs).
