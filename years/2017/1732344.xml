<AbstractNarration>This project will explore the question of the origin of Inupiaq culture in northwestern Alaska at the end of the first millennium AD. The project will document the cultural histories, social interactions, population diversity and dispersal, and environmental changes from data collected at Cape Espenberg and in relation to the greater Bering Strait and Arctic regions.  The research team will work together with community members in Shishmaref to conduct archaeological excavation, paleoecology and ancient DNA research to better understand who were the people that first settled the area around AD 1000, when and from where they came, and in what environmental conditions these events took place. At the same time they will work with cultural advisers and Shishmaref community members who have ancestral ties to the area to explore how material culture and landscape is interpreted to talk about the past and tell history.  The project will promote progress of science and education by conducting basic research and developing new methods in the several research fields involved. By insuring and promoting proper conservation of artifacts the project, will increase awareness and capacity to preserve the growing catalog of perishable organic artifacts, increasingly exposed due to eroding coastal and thawing permafrost. By including indigenous perspectives on material culture, the research will promote an archaeology that is more receptive to multiple voices. The project will also foster national and international collaborations between four US research institutes, a French University (U. of Panth√©on Sorbonne), a rural Alaska community and a regional non-profit corporation. Associated with the project a variety of initiatives represent opportunities in research, education and training for a number of underrepresented Alaska minorities, women, and undergraduate and graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aims of this multidisciplinary program of research is to explore human interaction, settlement history, climate and landscape dynamics in relation to the Birnirk archaeological complex at ca. AD 1000. After a period of hiatus, Birnirk site KTZ-304 at Cape Espenberg (Inuigniq) was occupied at a pivotal cultural and environmental moment in Northwest Alaska and the larger Bering Sea region, just before AD 1000 and prior to the emergence of Inupiaq culture around AD 1300. Cape Espenberg is a key location for this cultural history both because of the presence of Ipiutak, Birnik and Thule archaeological sites and as ancestral land of today's Kigiqtaamiut of Shishmaref. Interrelated and integrated analytical approaches involving cultural and physical anthropology, archaeology and paleoecology will (a) form the framework for continued excavation at site KTZ-304 (b) contribute to study architectural features, archaeofauna, ceramics, and artifacts in order to elucidate social networks, subsistence systems and technology, and to understand the impact of climate and resource availability on peoples activities, decisions and movements; (c) guide the collecting of paleoenvironmental data through targeted sampling of swales and ridges to date dune ridge stabilization, reconstruct terrestrial vegetation and map the location of the ocean relative to the site; (d) integrate ancient DNA (aDNA) studies to establish the broader genetic relationships of Inuit societies in the region and beyond; (e) explore how Kigiqtaamiut interpret material culture to understand the past, narrate history and generate knowledge (f) foster a dialog on the role of material culture today in the community of Shishmaref and in between the Kigiqtaamiut and the scientists to construct more reflexive interpretations of the past, and thus (g) advance understanding of the origin of Inupiaq culture through the development of a high-resolution chronology of settlement and landscape formation, cultural shift and climate variation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary aims of this project were to  1. Identify mitochondrial genetic diversity among prehistoric Birnirk and Thule people inhabiting Cape Espenberg and sites on the north coast of Alaska,  2. Analyze the faunal remains from archaeological excavations at Cape Espenberg to clarify dietary adaptations and strategies of these early arctic peoples,  3. Develop a molecular screening method to identify the species of small seals often found in archaeological sites in the region, and  4. Use this method to help reconstruct paleoenvironments in the region over time.  Our examination of mitochondrial genetic variation in early Birnirk peoples resulted in mitochondrial DNA sequences from 23 ancient individuals from four archaeological sites, Cape Espenberg, Piqniq, Kugok, Nunavak, and Kugusugaruk.  We identified five distinct mitochondrial lineages across the sites.  This level of diversity is also consistent with the pattern of mitochondrial diversity seen in later Thule peoples.  We successfully developed a simple screening method for determining seal species by sequencing the DNA from 35 modern seals and nearly 50 ancient seal samples recovered by archaeological excavation at Cape Espenberg.  The analysis of faunal remains from the two houses excavated at Cape Espenberg yielded a surprising result.  The earlier Birnirk house appears to have been more reliant on whales, and perhaps whaling, than the later Thule house, which appears to have relied more heavily on small seals in the diet. This is the opposite of expectation.  However, we confirmed this pattern by examining DNA in the soil form the living floors of each house.  There was a preponderance of whale DNA in the Birnirk house but far more seal DNA in the floor of the Thule house.  The faunal analysis also found that dogs were present at these early Cape Espenberg sites, and that they were of two very different sizes, one very large, the other fairly small.  No intermediate sized dogs were found.  Preliminary results from both traditional and molecular faunal analyses suggest that there was more open water around Cape Espenberg during the Birnirk occupation than during the Thule occupation. The presence of whaling and the ratio of small seal species support this conclusion, although further analysis is needed to confirm this result.
