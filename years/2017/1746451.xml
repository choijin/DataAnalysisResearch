<AbstractNarration>This award will help to support student attendance at the 58th IEEE Annual Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) in Berkeley, CA on October 15 through October 17, 2017, as well as to support attendance by some qualified postdoctoral fellows who do not have other sources of travel funding. FOCS and its sister conference, the ACM STOC meeting, are the premier broad-based conferences on the Theory of Computing. FOCS has a record of strongly encouraging participation by students, for whom the conference serves as a valuable educational experience, both for the technical content of the talks and for the opportunities for networking that it provides. In recent years, the annual FOCS conference has been attended by eighty to one hundred students who have comprised more than a third of all attendees. This award will provide partial support to fifteen or more students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award helped support the attendance of a selected set of US-based students and postdocs to the well-known FOCS conference (IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science) in 2017. The Chair and Vice Chair of the IEEE Technical Committee on the Foundations of Computing helped select the supported candidates.  The intellectual merit consisted of exposing these junior researchers to cutting-edge research on the foundations of computer science; in turn, this field has always benefited from the contributions of junior researchers, and we anticipate that this attendance will spur further contributions to the field. We particularly believe that the burgeoning areas of data science and machine learning will likely see fundamental contributions through such attendance: specifically in the form of rigorous methods in these fields. The broader merit included the encouragement of under-represented groups in the selection process. We hope that such steps will contribute toward the goal of attracting more under-represented groups to computer science research. The conference attendees also benefited from the greater attendance of students, postdocs, and under-represented groups that this travel grant made possible. Given the increasingly ubiquitous role played by algorithms, data science, and computer science in society, we believe that this award helped broaden participation in the vital areas covered by FOCS.
