<AbstractNarration>A Data Science Innovation Lab workshop, "Quantitative Approaches to Biomedical Data Science Challenges in Our Understanding of the Microbiome", will be held at the Wylie Inn and Conference Center, Boston, MA, June 19-23, 2017.  (See http://www.bigdatau.org/innovationlab2017/.)  The Innovation Lab will bring together early-career biomedical and quantitative investigators to engage in intensive multidisciplinary interactions, with a goal of developing new and bold approaches to address data science challenges involving the microbiome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2017 Innovation Lab will focus on novel approaches for analyzing high-dimensional big data derived from microbiota associated with a health or biomedical research objective.  While many approaches have been applied to identify and explore interactions and potential causal relationships between the human microbiome and the health of the human host, mechanistic modeling of gut interactions largely remains an unfulfilled goal.   New mathematical frameworks, analytic tools and computational models will allow for a deeper quantitative understanding of these mechanisms, leading to improved treatment of microbiome-related illness.  Funds from this award will support travel for participants to attend the workshop.</AbstractNarration>
