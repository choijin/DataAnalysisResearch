<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to reduce or eliminate damage/loss of property and protect public health and safety by introducing infrared and eye-safe laser radar (lidar) technology for high sensitivity remote plume characterization.  The technology has the potential to meet a diverse range of customer sectors for such applications including: early detection of wildfires; tracking pesticides drift in agricultural settings; tracking dispersion and transport of air toxins and pollutants in civilian and military settings; and detecting emissions and leaks in industrial settings. Lidar has already successfully penetrated a range of markets including range finders, speed monitors, 3D imaging and surveying systems, cloud ceiling height measurement at airports and weather centers, and most recently for remote wind measurements in wind energy applications. Successful introduction of laser radar systems to new markets can have significant economic, safety and health impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project capitalizes on compact eye-safe infrared lidar technology developed for remote characterization of atmospheric aerosols or target trace gases with high sensitivity.  The systems utilize robust infrared laser transmitters such as semiconductor lasers, fiber lasers, or quantum cascade lasers, operating at eye-safe levels, and yet achieving high detection sensitivities.  Because these sources are invisible to the human eye, they do not interfere with operators of machinery or aircraft and can be broadly deployed.  The systems are built on a rigid carbon fiber platform to add to their robustness in a broad range of ambient temperatures.  The lasers operate in the pulsed mode with pulse duration in the nanosecond range and at high pulse repetition rates to tens of kilohertz.  The lidar receiver section employs state-of-the-art infrared detectors together with hardware and software signal processing to achieve required performance levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Light Detection and Ranging-lidar, is a remote sensing technology for ranging and characterizing remote targets. This ICorps project explored commercialization of compact, eye-safe, scanning infrared extended target lidars. Several customer segments where considered during the ICorps discovery process.  These included applications in early wildfire detection, gas leak detection, air quality, and precision agriculture.  Lidars for these applications have the potential for higher sensitivity and better ranging and localization than competing technologies.  The team conducted 105 interviews during the customer discovery process, with an initial focus on wildfire detection.  The interviews included federal, state, and local agencies that monitor and battle wildfires, as well as remote vacation communities, and logging companies that have incentives to protect their groves.  The outcome was conclusion that early detection in these customer sectors is not a major concern.  A major focus in this regard appears to be on the development of mitigation approaches in order to reduce impacts on life and property.  The team also conducted a few interviews in the gas leak detection area both in production and distribution (utilities) sectors.  While there is potential in this area, there are significant barriers to entry due to the need to have the technology qualified for such applications. Similarly, the team conducted a few interviews in the air quality area with state and local agencies.  The team concluded that this customer sector is limited in size and funding, and again there are regulatory barriers to large scale adoption of new technologies as well.  The ICorps team then focused on lidar application in agriculture. Customer discover Interviews in the agriculture sector led to the identification of a need to monitor and optimize crop spraying. Improper crop spraying causes drift which can lead to crop damage or unwanted pesticide use in neighboring non-target crop areas. It may contaminate nearby bodies of water or be an issue for human health.  This can lead to fines or legal liability for the farmers or spraying companies.  Furthermore, inefficient crop spraying can results in too much or too little application of pesticides which leads to respectively reduced efficacy or increased expense.  Lidar technology may be applied to solve this problem through the implementation of a sensor system which would remotely determine the efficiency of sprayer machines and the spray pattern of the pesticides.  The system can potentially be used continuously and in real time. Farmers will benefit through reduced costs of wasted materials resulting from over-spraying, while protecting against pest and fungus infestation resulting from under-spraying.  While initially the business hypothesis was that large corporate farms will be the customer sector, through interviews, the team converged on large orchards, vineyards and tree farms. These farmers generally deploy airblast sprayers which are highly inefficient and waste up to 45% of the material.  Lidar can be used to better characterize and calibrate the sprayer nozzles through 2D or 3D imaging of the spray pattern.  Further, it can be used to monitor the spraying process itself to ensure that the sprayers are properly targeting the canopy under various wind conditions, reducing both waste and drift.  The customer segment is still farmers or sprayer companies.  Furthermore, through the discover process, key activities in the business model canvas evolved from being primarily physical manufacturing of systems to also providing calibration and data services for spraying applications.  After the closing of the I-CORPS workshop in September 2017, the team continued market research including meetings with various types of orchards and farms, spraying companies, competitors, and academia.  The entrepreneurial lead (Morann Dagan) also developed a relationship with potential customers (vineyards) in the finger lakes region of New York.  As of February 2018, Ms. Dagan founded a company, Atolla Tech. Through this company, she submitted an NSF SBIR proposal in July. Ms. Dagan earned her Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Grove School of Engineering at City College of New York in June 2018.  She continues to explore other funding opportunities including PowerBridge (New York State).  She has received expression of interest by angel investors and is pursuing related relationships.  The ICORPS workshop on developing a business model canvas and the customer discovery process has also been of great benefit to the rest of the team including the second entrepreneur lead, Mr. Adrian Diaz Fortich, who is still continuing his doctoral training in the remote sensing field, and the PI (Fred Moshary) and Co-PI (Mark Arend).  They have continued to support Dr. Morann Dagan's efforts, and employ much of what they have learned in developing new research directions.
