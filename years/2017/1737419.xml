<AbstractNarration>This project develops algorithms and techniques for holistic scene understanding from images. The key barrier to building the next generation of vision systems is ambiguity. For example, a patch from an image may look like a face but may simply be an incidental arrangement of tree branches and shadows. Thus, a vision module operating in isolation often produces nonsensical results, such as hallucinating faces floating in thin air. This project develops a visual system that jointly reasons about multiple plausible hypotheses from different vision modules such as 3D scene layout, object layout, and pose estimation. The developed technologies have the potential to improve vision systems and make fundamental impact - from self-driving cars bringing mobility to the physically impaired, to unmanned aircrafts helping law enforcement with search and rescue in disasters. The project involves research tightly integrated with education and outreach to train the next generation of young scientists and researchers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses the fundamental challenge in joint reasoning by extracting and leveraging a small set of diverse plausible hypotheses or guesses from computer vision modules (e.g. a patch may be a {sky or a vertical surface} x {face or tree branches}). This project generates new knowledge and techniques for (1) generating a small set of diverse plausible hypotheses from different vision modules, (2) joint reasoning over all modules to pick a single hypothesis from each module, and (3) reducing human annotation effort by actively soliciting user feedback only on the small set of plausible hypotheses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Webpage: http://computing.ece.vt.edu/~dbatra</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this proposal is holistic scene understanding, i.e. inferring all properties of the scene (Who, what, where, doing what?) that produced this image.     The key questions being considered are: &mdash; how can vision systems hedge against ambiguity by jointly reasons about different vision "modules" or sub- components (3D scene layout, object layout, pose and activity recognition)? &mdash; Idealized probabilistic models that reason about all variables of interest are typically computationally intractable even for a single module. Jointly reasoning about multiple modules simply seems out of reach due to the combinatorial explosion of search space (= {all-3D-layouts}&times;{all-segmentations}&times; . . . &times;{all-object-poses}). How can we overcome this combinatorial explosion of state space?     Major Activities:  1. To address these questions, we have developed a technique to extract and leverage a small set of diverse plausible hypotheses or guesses from vision modules. This technique (called DivMBest) leverages a line of work in the PI’s lab for finding a diverse set of highly probable solutions under a discrete probabilistic model. 2.

Given an image and a natural language question about the image ("What kind of store is this?", "How many people are waiting in the queue?", "Is it safe to cross the street?"), the machine’s task is to automatically produce a concise, accurate, natural language answer ("bakery", "5", "Yes"). Answering any possible question about an image is one of the ‘holy grails’ of Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence requiring vision, language, and reasoning. In a limited sense, this task is the visual analogue of the famous Turing Test.  Scientific Impact:  Our work on Visual Question Answering has been *highly impactful*.

Examples include aiding visually-impaired users in understanding their surroundings ("What temperature is this oven set to?"), analysts in making decisions based on large quantities of surveillance data ("What kind of car did the man in the red shirt drive away in?"), and interacting with a robot or autonomous system ("Is my laptop in my bedroom upstairs?").
