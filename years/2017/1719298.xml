<AbstractNarration>The theme of the 2017 Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering (CMBE) conference in Waimea, Hawaii, January 3-7, 2017, will be "A Gateway toward the Future:Imaging and Reprogramming of the Cell".  The need for this conference lies in the unique opportunity to bring these investigators together in one room for the first time to exchange ideas and brainstorm new strategies for moving the field of molecular and cellular engineering, mechanobiology and biomechanics for therapeutic applications forward. The CMBE field is experiencing exponential growth. A new international journal of Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering was launched in 2008. The first BMES-CMBE conference was launched in 2013. The meeting has been held annually since then. Building upon these successes, the 2017 Conference will bring together leaders in the field of biology, medicine, and engineering to address pressing topics in CMBE research and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to support travel awards for students, postdoc fellows, and young independent investigators (Rising Stars) for the 2017 Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering (CMBE) Conference. The purpose of this meeting is to foster interdisciplinary interaction and to capitalize on the rapidly expanding scientific developments in several cutting-edge fields: molecular engineering, genomic editing, molecular imaging and manipulation in live cells. The main outcome of the meeting will be new strategies for the integrated application of these different technologies toward immuno-engineering and stem cell engineering under the context of mechanical microenvironment for therapeutics. There are two specific aims of this meeting: (1) Delineate the current status of different fields of molecular engineering, genomic editing, molecular imaging and actuation, mechanobiology and biomechanics, and immune and stem cell engineering; (2) Foster the free exchange of information across regions around the Pacific Rim in order to jointly push forward the boundaries of engineering and science in CMBE by leveraging the strength from different regions. We believe that this conference is the first of its kind and will create a gateway for the next generation of bioengineers and will be a vehicle toward future development in the midst of an amazing convergence of multiple cutting-edge areas in engineering technology, physical and mechanical sciences, and biomedical applications.</AbstractNarration>
