<AbstractNarration>This workshop will launch a network of key stakeholders from the biomimicry community to develop and implement a shared vision for the design of an undergraduate curriculum platform to enhance research and coordinated education and training. This exciting interdisciplinary field is built on the premise that biological systems can inspire new solutions to technical problems in the human built environment which include renewable energy and access to clean water. There are amazing sources of inspiration for design in biology (for example how an octopus can dynamically match the three-dimensional color and texture characteristics of its environment in milliseconds to "disappear" and how a gecko can rapidly stick and unstick to nearly any surface) that could engage all students and attract new talent and ways of thinking, including underrepresented and underserved students. Despite this, current biomimicry research and education is mostly conducted on an ad hoc basis and there is a general lack of collaboration and coordination among sites that have developed formal and informal programs. The interdisciplinary nature of the field (at the intersection of biology, engineering, design, and business) relies on translation and collaboration that is not typically taught in individual disciplines. A successful biomimicry network could leverage a broad array of research platforms at the participating sites (e.g., post-doctoral, industrial, graduate and REU platforms) and help train the next generation of scientists at the multiple interfaces that contribute to biomimicry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be led by the University of Akron Biomimicry Research and Innovative Center and will include representatives from Great Lakes Biomimicry, Plant Biomechanics Group (Botanic Garden of Freidburg University), NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland Institute of Art, the Biomimicry Center (Arizona State University), and the Center for Biologically Inspired Design (Georgia Institute of Technology). The intensive, collaborative 2.5 day workshop will engage participants in a creative design process of brainstorming and presentation sessions addressing research platforms and undergraduate curricula. The discussion will also cover biomimicry education philosophy and standards and the roles of a national network in defining and executing undergraduate training in biomimicry. Outcomes and deliverables of the workshop will immediately inform pedagogy and degree programs poised to advance biomimicry as a scalable and repeatable paradigm for innovation and sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).</AbstractNarration>

Consistent with the charrette approach, our original agenda was dynamically modified during the conduct of our gathering (especially the second half of day one). The first half of day one (Saturday, October 7) was devoted to orienting charrette participants to the RCN-UBE program/solicitation and to overviews by the individual sites of their research, education, and other activities in the area of biomimicry/biomimetics/biologically inspired design. The second half of day one was devoted to site-specific development of statements reflecting the <strong>expectations</strong>, <strong>objectives</strong>, <strong>activities</strong>, and <strong>vision</strong> that should define the specific development of our collaborative RCN-UBE proposal. Day one concluded with 1) a first attempt to synthesize materials surfaced during the day by asking participants to prepare and present short elevator pitches for the RCN-UBE proposal, and 2) an agenda setting discussion for day 2.

The output of these working groups identified major topic-specific themes for development of the draft RCN-UBE proposal such as:  Using the network to share, evaluate, and enhance biomimicry pedagogy research for undergraduate education as a major and novel way to address pressing problems such as the global grand challenges and STEM recruitment/persistence and expansion to STEAM Explicit integration of biomimicry research methodologies into pedagogy and curriculum development for research and training enhancement for undergraduate education but also beyond (e.g., for serving informal educational settings and also professional settings) Leveraging of existing biomimicry research and teaching to cross-pollinate across programs within sites (e.g., site REUs, experiential learning centers, community partners), as well as across sites through face-to-face and digital student and faculty experiences in classes and projects.   The intellectual merit and broader impacts of our workshop/charrette are tightly integrated by virtue of our objectives: using transdisciplinary research themes contributing to biomimicry/bio-inspired design/biomimetics to develop network infrastructure for training of and dissemination to undergraduate students taking courses in biology.  The major outcomes of our project include:  New working relationships among sites that will facilitate collaboration on teaching and research initiatives in biomimicry A completed and submitted RCN-UBE full proposal submitted to Panel January 2018 A commitment to share biomimicry teaching materials and to seek funding to strengthen our biomimicry network              Last Modified: 10/29/2018       Submitted by: Peter H Niewiarowski]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
