<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Chemistry Division's Environmental Chemical Sciences Program.  Professors Daniel Giammar and Jeffrey Catalano and their groups at Washington University in St. Louis study uranium and lead, which are naturally-occurring, toxic elements and important environmental contaminants.  Uranium and lead often exist in nature as oxides (bonded to oxygen). Uranium and iron oxide reactivity in the environment depend on their oxidation-reduction ("redox") chemistry. The recrystallization of these species can impact their toxicity. This study extends our understanding of the occurrence and environmental impacts of redox-driven recrystallization of uranium and lead oxides.  The work builds on related studies of recrystallization of other metal oxides, notably iron oxides ("rust") and manganese oxides.  The scientific knowledge gained by this project can be used to reduce exposure to uranium in contaminated groundwater and to lead in contaminated drinking water.  The research is integrated with educational activities that involve curriculum enrichment, graduate student training, and outreach to K-12 students and other members of the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project explores redox-driven recrystallization as a general phenomenon of environmental significance common to many semiconducting metal oxides.  Specific targets include measurements of the rates and the extent of isotope exchange between aqueous uranium (VI) and solid uranium (IV) oxides and between aqueous lead (II) and solid lead (IV) oxides. The impacts of recrystallization on the composition, structure and size of the resulting particles is being characterized. Isotope exchange and recrystallization under conditions relevant to remediation of uranium-contaminated groundwater and the control of lead in drinking water distribution systems are being used to quantify the impacts of recrystallization on contaminant mobility.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project advanced scientific understanding of redox-driven recrystallization of metal oxides.  Redox-driven recrystallization of metal oxides is an exciting environmental phenomenon that can influence biogeochemical cycles of both nutrients and contaminants.  The project objectives were to (1) determine the rates and extents of interfacial electron transfer and atom exchange for the PbO2-Pb(II) and UO2-U(VI) systems, (2) elucidate the mechanisms and products of redox-driven recrystallization of PbO2 and UO2, (3) assess the occurrence of these processes in environmental media with fluid flow, and (4) quantify the impact of redox-driven transformations on PbO2 and UO2 stability.  The research approach measured the rates and extents of isotope exchange between aqueous U(VI) and Pb(II) and UO2 and PbO2 solids, respectively, and it characterized the impacts of recrystallization on the composition, structure and size of the resulting particles.  The project filled important knowledge gaps regarding adsorption and interfacial electron transfer reactions at the mineral-water interface for uranium and lead.  The isotope exchange experiments and associated solid characterization suggest that redox-driven recrystallization is applicable to PbO2 solids, which expands the range of systems for which this phenomenon is applicable.  The &alpha;-PbO2 and &beta;-PbO2 behaved differently when interpreted by incorporation models, which indicates that &alpha;-PbO2 has a larger amount of the mineral volume (beyond the surface) that is accessible to the solution.  Under all conditions studied, &alpha;-PbO2 dissolved faster than &beta;-PbO2, which may help explain the observation of &beta;-PbO2 as the dominant Pb(IV) oxide on LSLs in field studies.  The adsorption of Cu(II) and Zn(II) inhibited the reductive dissolution of PbO2.  Pb(II) shows uniform adsorption mechanisms to the PbO2-analog rutile across a range of pH values and surface loadings. This suggests that the surface exchange mechanisms between dissolved and adsorbed Pb(II) on PbO2 phases are not substantially affected by fluid composition.  In contrast to the Pb(II)-PbO2 system, no isotope exchange was observed for the U(VI)-UO2 system within the experimental timescale of months.  Oxidative dissolution of U(IV) oxide was found to be a strong function of trace lead loading, with adsorbed Pb(II) and adsorbed U(VI) substantially inhibiting dissolution.   The project has had broad impacts through its integrated research and education plans.  New scientific findings regarding the environmental chemistry of PbO2 and UO2 have major societal benefits by offering insights into methods for reducing exposures to these toxic elements. The project results have been broadly disseminated through publications and presentations.  The training of three doctoral students and the involvement of undergraduate and high school students in the research approach supported the development of a capable and diverse scientific and engineering workforce.  The experiments and findings were integrated into lectures and laboratory sessions of two courses.  In collaboration with the St. Louis Science Center, an educational display on lead service lines for their Water Infrastructure exhibit was developed. The display included an interactive java-based app with animations that allows museum guests to explore the ways in which the chemistry selected by the water provider affects the plumbosolvency of corrosion products.
