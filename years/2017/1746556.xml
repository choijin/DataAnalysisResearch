<AbstractNarration>This STTR Phase I project will undertake the development of iron coordination complexes as alternatives for gadolinium contrast agents which are currently used in clinical MRI diagnostic exams.  New MRI contrast agents are needed to serve the segment of the population who cannot tolerate Gd(III) agents.  This includes patients with kidney disease and those who have frequent MRI scans and may accumulate Gd(III).  The proposed research involves the study of new trivalent iron coordination complexes based on those initially studied in the co-PI?s university laboratory. New iron complexes will be prepared and studied as contrast agents in live mice to improve characteristics of the agents such as clearance from the body.  Fundamental studies of the iron complexes will add to the body of knowledge on the paramagnetic properties of iron.&lt;br/&gt;For the most promising Fe(III) contrast agents, the synthetic procedures will be adapted for large scale preparation and purity determination.  Iron MRI contrast agents may also be beneficial to society by reducing gadolinium in water supply.  Furthermore, iron as an abundant element is less expensive and more readily available in the USA than is gadolinium. The commercialization of iron MRI contrast agents will create jobs in chemical manufacturing, sales, and in health-related occupations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lead Fe(III) coordination complex on which this project is based produces longitudinal (T1) relaxivity of water protons that rival clinically used Gd(III) complexes at 4.7 Tesla, both under in vitro conditions and also in live mice. Importantly, these complexes contain macrocyclic ligands that stabilize iron in the trivalent state (negative redox potentials versus NHE) and do not produce reactive oxygen species even in the presence of ascorbate as a reductant and peroxide.  The importance of outersphere water and innersphere water interactions will be studied by varying the coordinating pendent groups on the macrocyclic ligand which is bound to Fe(III).   The ancillary group will be varied to increase binding to serum proteins and to modify the clearance route of the contrast agents either through kidneys or through hepatobiliary routes.  The complexes will be optimized for kinetic inertness towards release of iron under biologically relevant conditions.  Toxicity studies in cell culture will be carried out on each of the new complexes. This research will focus on both pilot scale preparation for the study of the Fe(III) complexes in vitro and also on larger scale preparations and HPLC analysis of the most promising new derivatives.  In vivo MRI scans in mice on a 4.7 T scanner will be used to track the distribution and clearance of the iron contrast agents as a function of time.      &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA?s) for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are being scrutinized for potential negative health outcomes.  There are increasing concerns about accumulation of the lanthanide metal ion gadolinium in the brain, bone, and skin of patients.  The health implications of these deposits remain unknown at this time.  Additionally there is an underserved segment of the population that is unable to take advantage of this diagnostic tool due to existing restrictions on their use for patients with impaired renal function.     Dr. Patrick Burns at Ferric Contrast, Inc. and the laboratory of Professor Janet Morrow at the University at Buffalo have worked together on iron-based alternatives to GBCA?s.  Starting with complexes patented by Dr. Morrow, our research was focused on determining modifications to our lead complex that would produce longitudinal relaxation and pharmacokinetic properties that best parallel GBCA?s and market need.     Over the course of this award, different iron-based complexes were synthesized. These complexes were then purified, characterized, and analyzed.  Furthermore, complexes were characterized for their ability to remain intact under biologically relevant conditions, as well as to retain the correct oxidation state of the iron.  Lastly, the complexes were studied in vitro and in vivo through collaborative efforts with Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center to determine their ability to generate high quality magnetic resonance images.  Consultation with an expert in our field led us to begin work toward a second generation of compounds with a focus on modifying charge and water solubility to optimize the distribution of the complex in mice.  Over time, the PIs met and discussed their project with potential strategic partners and vendors to begin collaborations to help expedite R&amp;D efforts and hasten our path toward commercialization.     Our research shows, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that trivalent iron coordination complexes have produced relaxivity profiles in mice that are higher in certain organs than gadolinium-based contrast agents.  One of the complexes we have studied shows strong promise as kidney-specific imaging agent, while another can be used to study the liver.  Future goals are to identify a replacement for the class of gadolinium-based contrast agents used in the clinic in terms of distribution and clearance in mice.
