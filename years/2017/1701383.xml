<AbstractNarration>The origin of mammals has long been of interest to scientists because mammals are one of the most diverse groups of animals on the planet.  This research investigates how certain complex dental characteristics evolved in the ancestors of modern mammals (therapsids), and thus informs our understanding of the selective forces driving mammalian evolution from their "reptile-like" ancestors. Mammal teeth are considered more complex and specialized than reptiles; however, these assumptions have not fully considered extinct species. As such, the evolution of complex dental traits is not entirely understood, which leaves our understanding of the ecology and evolution of ancient mammals incomplete. Histological data and analyses from this work will be made available to the scientific community, and the data will be useful for systematists interested in the evolution of vertebrates. Public outreach through displays and programs at natural history museums will also occur. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dentition of mammals is unique among living vertebrates, and therapsid fossils have shed light on the evolution of mammalian innovations like a regionalized dentition (heterodonty), multiple tooth roots, and tooth-to-tooth occlusion. While it is relatively straightforward to assess these characters using gross morphology, the evolution of other significant features can only be examined through histological thin sections, and thus remain unknown for many fossil taxa. This research fills this void by using paleohistology and micro-computed tomorgraphy data to determine character states for important dental traits in therapsids. Preliminary data suggest that dental traits once thought exclusive to mammals evolved multiple times in their therapsid forebears. This project also tests for correlative evolution between dental and life history traits along the mammal line as well as in reptilian taxa that have independently evolved these complex traits. The work will provide insight into the selective pressures on the acquisition of mammal innovations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The mammalian dentition is often considered the most specialized vertebrate dentition and is often credited with the successful radiation and diversification of mammals that we see on our modern-day landscapes. In spite of this, our understanding of the evolutionary history of the derived features of the mammalian dentition is often contained to fossil mammals and does not consider the evolution of these features throughout the entirety of the fossil synapsid lineage spanning nearly 300 million years. The major objectives of this project were to collect a large source of primary data on the histology of fossil synapsid dentitions, explore patterns of trait acquisition in synapsid evolutionary history, and disseminate these findings to a scientific and broad audience all while providing professional development for the researchers involved. This project has produced outcomes on all of these major objectives.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primary data was collected in three countries at six different museums. Data was collected on 457 fossil jaws that provide a robust data set of 25 families of synapsid families. Histological thin sections of 17 synapsids totaling in over 100 thin sections were produced, &nbsp;micro-CT scans for 4 synapsids, and scanning-electron microscopy (SEM) was conducted on 4 synapsid specimens. All of these data are available either publicly on MorphoBank (projects 3650, 3543, 3605) or per request on unpublished data. Importantly, SEM, histological, and micro-CT are expensive and/or destructive sampling methods and a core goal of this project was to reduce redundancy in data collection. By making this data accessible, this project provides data not just for the aim of this research but other researchers and other projects.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A major outcome from this project was the completion of the co-PI&rsquo;s dissertation that reports on evolutionary patterns in synapsid dentitions and documents instances of convergent evolution in dental features as well as a reduction in phenotypic diversity in synapsid dentitions through time. Through this dissertation, there were significant outcomes in professional development in collections research, mentorship, and attendance at scientific conferences to present the findings of this project. Additionally, surprising findings added unexpected outcomes and results including the earliest evidence for torpor in the fossil record (Whitney and Sidor <em>in Review</em>) and a peculiar pathology (Whitney et al. 2019).</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, three publications (Whitney et al. 2019; Whitney and Sidor 2019; Whitney and Sidor <em>in review</em>) and eight conferences abstracts have been supported by this project with two additional publications in preparation. Many of these outcomes involved undergraduate researchers as lead author or co-author. In addition to mentorship through the scientific process, this project provided undergraduate training in fossil histology techniques, SEM, and 3D segmentation.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, this project supported outreach through events hosted by the Burke Museum of Natural History. These events included unpacking fossils from fieldwork related to this project as well as microscope activities for visitors to examine fossil histology for themselves, providing a novel interface for the public to learn about charismatic fossils.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/04/2020<br>      Modified by: Megan&nbsp;R&nbsp;Whitney</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1701383/1701383_10476567_1591296289736_EnamelPolarized20xcopy--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1701383/1701383_10476567_1591296289736_EnamelPolarized20xcopy--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Tapinocephalid Enamel"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1701383/1701383_10476567_1591296289736_EnamelPolarized20xcopy--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Tapinocephalid Enamel"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Histological image of the enamel of a tapinocephalid, a fossil synapsid.
