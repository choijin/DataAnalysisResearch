<AbstractNarration>The Framework for Transformative Geoscience Education Research project is a one-year effort to engage the geoscience education research community in setting ambitious goals for geoscience education research that will be achievable within ten years and will have significant impact on geoscience education teaching and learning. The objectives of the proposed project are: (1) to identify themes that span multiple geoscience education research (GER) topical areas to define the spectrum in which GER operates and has the potential to impact; (2) to articulate and prioritize "grand challenges" in GER for each of the themes that are of high interest to the geoscience education researcher and practitioner community; and (3) to develop strategies to address the prioritized grand challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities of the proposed project include: (a) a survey of the GER community to determine what members see as important research questions to address in GER in the next 10 years; (b) a workshop and oral session at the 2017 Earth Educators' Rendezvous (EER) for researchers to discuss and prioritize the grand challenges that emerge from the survey and to propose strategies to address the grand challenges; (c) continued online GER Toolbox development to support researchers as they address grand challenges in GER; (d) a GSA town hall and a second survey to share the workshop-proposed GER priorities and strategies with the broader community for their review and comment; and (e) a white paper about the synthesized findings of the project to share broadly the community's proposed research agenda for GER.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Geoscience education research (GER) is an emerging field of scholarship that focuses on teaching and learning in the geosciences. The geoscience education researcher community has been growing. It is therefore important to take stock of the current state of this research field and consider the best course forward so that it can have the greatest collective impact on advancing teaching and learning in the geosciences. The purpose, objectives, and activities of this NSF-funded project were designed to address this need.</p> <p>The project, <em>A Framework for Transformative Geoscience Education Research,</em><strong> </strong>aimed to engage the community in setting ambitious goals for GER that will be achievable over the next decade and will have significant impact on <em>undergraduate</em> geoscience teaching and learning. The specific objectives were to: (1) identify themes within current geoscience education research, (2) describe and prioritize <em>grand challenges</em> (i.e., overarching research questions) for each theme that are of high interest to researchers and educators, and (3) recommend strategies to address those grand challenges. Towards these objectives, the project engaged ~200 geoscience educators and education researchers through a sequenced series of virtual and face-to-face events to consider the existing research and share and critique new ideas. Ten themes were defined, and a subset of researchers formed working groups. They identified two to five grand challenges per theme, and then became author teams and wrote a comprehensive document that summarizes their findings and makes recommendations.</p> <p>The primary outcome is a 155-page, 13-chapter report. The report is titled: <strong><em>A Community Framework for Geoscience Education Research</em></strong> (aka, the <strong><em>GER Framework</em></strong>). &nbsp;This single framework was a true community effort; it has 48 authors and received feedback from the broader community. The chapters include one on Framework Development, chapters for each of the ten Research Themes, a Synthesis chapter, and a Closing the Loop chapter which makes recommendations for the transfer of research findings to practice. The theme chapters reflect the state of research knowledge and practice in each area, as well as research needs and opportunities going forward. The report thus aims to be a catalyst for action - for getting important work done by researchers to improve undergraduate geoscience teaching and learning. In sum, the report lays out a prioritized, and community-endorsed, geoscience education research agenda. The report can be&nbsp;<a href="https://commons.lib.jmu.edu/ger_framework/15/" target="_blank">downloaded</a>, as can&nbsp;<a href="https://commons.lib.jmu.edu/ger_framework/" target="_blank">individual chapters</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a href="https://commons.lib.jmu.edu/ger_framework/14/" target="_blank">cross-theme correlation matrix</a>. It is also accessible on the National Association of Geoscience Teachers <a href="https://nagt.org/nagt/geoedresearch/GER_framework/index.html">website</a>.</p> <p>The thematic grand challenges outlined in the GER Framework should stimulate new research. In addition, there are five cross-theme recommendations that the report makes regarding strategies for future research that we think will impact the discipline. These recommendations are that:</p> <ul> <li>Future geoscience education research should be better grounded in theory.</li> <li>The collaborative network needs to expand within and outside of GER to include additional expertise.</li> <li>More attention needs to be given to assessment to ensure that the most valid, reliable, and up-to-date instruments and techniques are used in GER.</li> <li>Focusing the power of GER to improve undergraduate teaching and learning about the Earth needs to involve both testing of geoscience education research hypotheses, as well as developing and evaluating new geoscience teaching innovations and curricula.</li> <li>Future research must happen at multiple scales (e.g., case studies to large multi-institutional studies), but we should work towards increasing the depth and size of studies so the outcomes are more generalizable, which can support evidence-based decisions.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <ul> </ul> <p>Lastly, this work does not exist in a vacuum; some of the ideas raised in this report either echo or complement other national efforts to improve STEM education in general, or geoscience education specifically.
