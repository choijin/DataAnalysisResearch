<AbstractNarration>Today's societal challenges are complex and compelling. To increase the effectiveness of STEM research in addressing these challenges, it is essential to formulate appropriately significant research questions. This collaborative project from the SUNY System Administration and SUNY at Buffalo seeks to pilot a new platform -- Germination Space -- for aiding investigators to construct and define transformative research questions. The investigators will test a repetitive process with defined steps: question formulation, reflection, and redefinition. Participation will be open to all faculty members, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students in the SUNY system. This open-door approach should facilitate involvement of a diverse spectrum of participants, given SUNY's strong history in recruiting individuals from underrepresented and underserved groups into STEM fields. If successful, this study may develop a new approach that will lead to transformative research to address key societal challenges. If this project identifies underlying principles for formulating open and transformative research questions, the results could be applied more broadly by academic institutions to formulate strategies and innovative organizational and program structures to effectively stimulate risk-taking and impact-driven research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The platform to be developed -- Germination Space -- will consist of a multiple-iteration process including formulating, reflecting upon, and redefining research questions. Researchers will be guided to examine their research questions, challenge fundamental assumptions, and leverage existing knowledge and solutions in other disciplines, ultimately arriving at highly transformative research questions. Faculty and students from across SUNY campuses will be invited to participate in this project. Research will be conducted to understand the underlying principles of formulating open and transformative research questions. It is expected that these principles will inform both individual approaches to asking questions, and the social and institutional arrangements that can serve to catalyze individual explorations. Delineating underlying principles will be an essential prerequisite for effective scaling of the Germination Space process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many societal challenges we are facing today are complex and pressing. One needs look no further than the COVID-19 pandemic to see that significant societal challenges are frequently interconnected, interdependent and multiple faceted.  They call for transformative research and innovation. Naturally, it is critically important to ask transformative research questions first in order to open the possibility of conducting leading-edge, high-impact research.  Transformative research questions are frequently open and not limited by constraints such as disciplinary boundaries and availability of resources; and tend to challenge stated and hidden assumptions. This project explored an experimental approach, called Germination Space, to stimulate the formation of transformative research questions that hold the potential to address large societal challenges.  The Germination Space process is to bring together a cohort of researchers with diverse academic background who participate in individual and group exercises designed to help them: (1) formulate initial research questions, (2) reflect upon constraints, stated and hidden assumptions, and preconceptions in their initial research questions, and then (3) redefine their research questions based on information acquired through the Germination Space process.   In this project, four cohorts of faculty researchers at four State University of New York (SUNY) campuses participated in the Germination Space process.  Each cohort began with 15 participants from diverse academic background and focused on a topic area selected by the campus research community based on their unique research strengths. Subgroups consisting of 2-3 participants were formed within each cohort.  A Germination Space process is designed and best practices are documented.    One topic area was selected for each cohort to ensure that it is (1) relevant to the existing campus research strengths so that the conversations among participants can be interactive and substantive; (2) broad enough to inspire interest among researchers from various academic background, which is fundamental to nurture dynamic, interdisciplinary collaborations; and (3) pressing and urgent that greatly motivates researchers to pose fundamental research questions in order to address the issue. It was observed that topic areas selected based on above criteria were effective in stimulating interactions and exchange of ideas among participants during the Germination Space process.  We evaluated the process by measuring the numbers of new ideas, suggestions, questions, invitations and general comments generated as well as the self-satisfaction of participants. We also examined factors such as rate of academic publication, openness to the process and subgroup intellectual diversity and demographic diversity. Given the limited scope of this project, our observations are preliminary and not conclusive.
