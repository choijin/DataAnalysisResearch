<AbstractNarration>Water-limited ecosystems are especially sensitive to precipitation changes, and understanding the controls on land-atmosphere interactions and how they influence larger scale feedbacks will become increasingly important as climatic and other global changes continue to alter the water availability in these ecosystems.  Despite comprising a relatively large percentage of the Earth's land surface, water-limited ecosystems are poorly represented in land-surface and global circulation models.  This research will address water limited ecosystems function by linking small scale processes investigated in field and experimental efforts with large scale processes using a modeling approach that  takes advantage of a simple conceptual framework combined with remote sensing products.  Over a decade of field work has highlighted the importance of deep soil moisture in the functioning of water-limited ecosystems.  Emergent hypotheses on the role of deep soil moisture in water-limited ecosystems will be addressed using a simple framework based on moisture in two soil layers (e.g. surface layer: 0 - 20 cm, deep layer: 20 - 60 cm).  This robust framework is ideal for developing and testing hypotheses in both educational and research settings.   Furthermore, the project will use this framework to test hypotheses in other uniquely water-limited ecosystems (e.g. snow-dependent subalpine, arctic tundra).  Plot- to ecosystem- scale findings will be used to support hypothesis testing at larger scales using a modeling approach capable of multiple layers of moisture and incorporating remote sensing products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearly 40% of the global land surface is classified as arid to semiarid; a percentage that is almost certain to increase based on current climate trends.  Historically, these water-limited areas have also been locations of major population increase.  This problematic combination of sustained climate change and population growth creates fundamental changes to native ecosystems that will undoubtedly have major impacts on watersheds and rivers; these impacts are likely to exacerbate further climatic changes.  This research emphasizes monitoring in water-limited ecosystems to better predict the behavior and functioning of these ecosystems under global change and also better understand their contribution to global water, carbon, and energy cycling.  Further, the project will  engage students (especially underprivileged and underrepresented students) in the process of science as a means to ready them for the workforce.  This is particularly crucial with the growing need to train students to effectively communicate the importance of scientific research to the general public. The simple two-layer moisture framework highlighted in this research is ideal for tackling both of these integrated research and educational challenges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This funding supported the development and utilization of a simple yet innovative conceptual framework that could be used to drive both education and research agendas in the context of ecohydrological controls on land-atmosphere interactions in water-limited ecosystems.   Over 40% of the global land surface can be classified as water-limited &ndash; a number which is increasing and includes areas of major population growth; therefore understanding the consequences to our ecosystems as a result of global change that will undoubtedly have major impacts on our water resources in these areas is of urgent concern.  This project?s conceptual framework was used to develop testable hypotheses around soil moisture controls on vegetation activity water-limited ecosystems.  This framework was then incorporated into a modeling framework that can scale up the findings and demonstrate linkages to at the land-atmosphere interface that can feedback to the climate system.  Our research highlighted the importance of precipitation dynamics capable of wetting the soil beyond the reach of atmospheric demand to support vegetation in water-limited natural ecosystems.  Our findings underscore the importance of heavy rainfall events to water-limited ecosystems and the implications changes of precipitation regime. We also found that our conceptual framework can be used to inform irrigation and stormwater management strategies in urban areas.  This funding supported a PhD student, three MS students, a postdoctoral research scholar, and over 20 undergraduate research assistants; all of these students presented their research in formal outlets, some presented at national conferences, and some also resulted in student authorship on peer-reviewed publications.  Based in part because of the student demands created from this funding, (1) modular computer programming lessons based in MATLAB for "Environmental Data Processing" have been developed to train undergraduate and graduate students in a research setting that enables workforce readiness and (2) a new course was developed "Global Change and the Ecohydrology of Cities".  Overall, research supported by this funding has contributed to the publication of at least 11 peer-reviewed manuscripts, which have collectively been cited over 200 times.
