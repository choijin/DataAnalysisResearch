<AbstractNarration>Bony fishes are more diverse than any other class of vertebrates. However, we do not have a clear understanding of their history. Determining what led to this diversity will greatly help us understand how life has formed on our planet. It will also allow us to understand how future environmental perturbations might affect this diversity. Transitions to new habitat types, such as from freshwater to marine habitats, or tropical to temperate, may have increased fish diversity. Previous studies have examined the transition of fishes between these habitats and found varying amounts of support for the importance of each transition type. However, these transitions have only been examined in distantly related groups of fishes. This study will be the first to examine the evolutionary transitions between these habitats within a group of relatively closely related fish. These groups contain familiar and economically important species such as largemouth bass and sunfish. Outreach to the public and K-12 students will occur through presentations, social media, and museum displays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will take a novel approach to answer two macro-evolutionary questions: How have diversification rates in the Centrarchiformes varied between (1) tropical and temperate habitats and (2) between freshwater and marine habitats? To answer these questions phylogenetic relationships among Centrarchiform species will be resolved using dense taxonomic sampling and thousands of unlinked nuclear loci. The phylogeny will be fossil calibrated and used in a variety of analyses to test for shifts in the diversification rate and their potential associations with salinity or thermal habitat transitions. Furthermore, this project may provide general insight on the diversification of other aquatic groups that span diverse habitat types.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The funded project titled &ldquo;DISSERTATION RESEARCH: Phylogenomics and Evolutionary Rates associated with Salinity and Thermal Shifts in Centrarchiformes&rdquo; has looked into the relationships for an order of fishes that has only recently been recovered in the literature. With little understanding of how the 15 families and 285 recognized species contained in this order are related, this project has successfully gathered the largest amount of genomic data for this order to date. These data have been instrumental in helping us understand what factors influenced the diversification in this group and how evolutionary dynamics have shifted over time and space for these fishes. The project has revealed numerous cases of taxonomic confusion where the current understanding of fish relationships in this order is challenged. While the taxonomic status of certain groups are still being updated, this project has already resulted in the taxonomic revision of one species, a description of a new genus, and the revision of two marine fish families. Furthermore, the direct products of this award have resulted in international collaborations between research labs in four countries. Results from this project are still being reviewed and published, but have already resulted in two publications in peer-reviewed journals, and two conference presentations. The project has directly resulted in the training of three undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in STEM in genetic laboratory techniques and analytical approaches. All three students trained resulting from this project have been included on peer-reviewed publication that are either already published, or currently in review. Finally, data and topics from this project have been included in a variety of public outreach events associated with the LSU Museum of Natural Science, and have been featured in social media posts targeting audiences across the globe.
