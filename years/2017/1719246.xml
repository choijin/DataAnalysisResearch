<AbstractNarration>Title: Rapid Access Ice Drill (RAID) Science Workshop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will support members of the Geological, Glaciological, and Earth Science communities for a two-day workshop in order to develop a long-term plan for science deployment of the Rapid Access Ice Drill (RAID) platform and create a planning document that defines the science community?s anticipated use of the facility. The workshop will ensure broad participation by including researchers from many different scientific fields both within and outside of the Antarctic community. The workshop will &lt;br/&gt;Include early-career researchers and members of underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rapid Access Ice Drill (RAID) was designed to quickly penetrate Antarctic ice sheets in order to create borehole observatories and take cores in deep ice, the glacial bed, and bedrock below. The Rapid Access Ice Drill is a sled-mounted mobile drilling system that will make multiple long, narrow (3.5 inch diameter) boreholes in ice sheets of Antarctica. The Rapid Access Ice Drill (RAID) enabled research will include 1) a better understanding of the climate feedbacks internal to the Earth System that drove ice ages to switch from a 41-kyr periodicity to the irregular 110-kyr periodicity seen today, 2) constraints on future sea level rise from the heat flow and bed material property information obtained, 3) creation of a new interdisciplinary style of Antarctic "Subglacial System Science" that fosters across-discipline synergies, and 4) entrainment of young researchers in polar science via the excitement of discovery of the largely unknown ice sheet interior.  The RAID Science Planning Workshop will                                                                                                      provide a venue to: 1) bring diverse scientists together to explore science questions and approaches; 2) define science goals to be addressed by the drill; 3) seek synergies between different disciplines interested in the Rapid Access; 4) develop a coherent science plan for the use of the drill; 5) set priorities between the science targets; and 6) engage early-career and underrepresented researchers.  The workshop will provide support for a two-day conference with a total attendance of about 60 members of the Antarctic glacial- and subglacial-science communities. The support provided by NSF will cover partial travel costs for 20 key US participants and full travel costs for 12 early-career researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported a 2-day science workshop on the topic of the Rapid Access Ice Drill (RAID) and its potential scientific uses.  This National Science Foundation-sponsored drilling system is currently being tested in Antarctica, and is expected to be ready for use by the science community for research drilling in 2020-2021 austral summer.  RAID is unique in the sense that it rapidly drills through the ice sheet without taking ice cores, in contrast to conventional ice coring.  RAID then takes a small number of short cores of ice and bedrock with high scientific value.  Whereas a conventional ice core typically takes 5 years to complete, RAID can drill through the 2-mile-thick Antarctic ice sheet in 48 hours.  This rapid mode of exploration allows many holes to be drilled in one season, greatly increasing the rate of scientific discovery.  Searching for the oldest ice on the planet and mapping the bedrock geology of Antarctica are two of the main science goals of RAID, but many other goals are also possible.  The first samples of the mud at the base of ice sheets will likely be obtained by RAID; likewise the first systematic study of the geothermal heat coming out of the Earth will be enabled by RAID.  The fate of the ice sheets in future centuries, as the world warms, may be better informed by RAID samples and borehole observatories that will be kept open for borehole logging for 5 years after drilling.  The purpose of the 2-day science workshop was, broadly speaking, to flesh out all of these science goals and produce a document prioritizing them.     The workshop was widely advertized, open to all comers, and special attention was given to seeking out and actively inviting young researchers and students.  In total, 37 participants turned out.  The meeting was held in the historic Martin Johnson House on the campus of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.  Discussion was vigorous and continued during a catered onsite dinner.  Broad agreement converged on an initial set of goals comprising glaciology, bedrock geology, paleoclimatology, solid earth geophysics, and subglacial biology.  A surprising consensus emerged that the Gamburtsev mountain region (a subglacial mountain range about which little is known) would be the most compelling initial target for RAID deployment.  A five-year science plan was sketched out and fine-tuned.  Many informal conversations and idea-swapping no doubt spawned new collaborations.  Overall, the outcome of this workshop set the stage for the next phase of RAID deployment, and (in terms of broader impacts) entrained young researchers in the excitement of the research enterprise.  Three members of underrepresented groups were in attendance, along with 8 females.  The broader impacts also include the astonishingly interdisciplinary nature of the assembled participants, comprising no fewer than 7 separate scientific disciplines.
