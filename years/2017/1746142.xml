<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 1 project includes: accelerating the pace of healthcare improvement by making information on high-need/high-cost patients instantly accessible and individually tailored to health care providers; transforming health intervention databases into active and dynamic learning communities about caring for high-need/high-cost patients; reducing the burden on safety net providers to sort and sift through dozens of information sources about delivering care to high-need/high-cost patients. Health Information Networking Tool (HINT) will be a unique combination of customized algorithms that will fill in critical gaps in knowledge, especially around health disparities, the social determinants of health and underserved conditions; boost opportunities for safety net providers to connect with peers to engage in collaborative problem-solving; reduce duplication and repetition of errors and failed interventions across safety net healthcare organizations; increase public recognition for safety net institutions that develop promising interventions; and enable technical advancements in machine learning to suggest models of care for high-need/high-cost patients. The commercial impact for HINT includes: reducing the cost and improving the quality of care delivered to high-need/high cost populations; and creating opportunities for safety net institutions and providers to market their expertise on caring for complex, underserved patients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project was conceived on the belief that ingenious solutions in caring for society's most vulnerable populations occur daily across the safety net health system; that HINT will accelerate innovation by bringing an unprecedented resource to disseminate voluminous and constantly changing healthcare information; that the proposed information network will reduce the fragmentation of information and duplication in errors and failed interventions that currently occur; and finally that unlocking and disseminating innovations and advice from peers - in similar institutions and caring for similar patients - will accelerate successful practices to improve the health of high-need/high-cost patients. HINT proposes to develop unique crawling, clustering, text mining, collaborative filtering, bipartite matching, and ranking algorithms. The team will integrate the six algorithms into a customized social content management system, and address challenges around design and functionality.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   In Phase of our  Small Business Technology Transfer award from the National Science Foundation,  we built a prototype of our technology, the Health Information and Networking Tool or HINT.  Our market research and competitive analysis established HINT?s feasibility as a unique healthcare information resource.  Our extensive customer discovery process established the limitations of traditional sources of health services information as applied to the safety net context and the need for direct, actionable information and peer examples to improve patient care and operational efficiency.  HINT is designed to deliver information directly to safety net clinicians and administrators to support new hospital processes or reengineer current ones. Our Phase I research demonstrated how technology can automate traditional consulting services into a software solution, classifying content and using technology to help hospitals build programs and protocols. Our Phase I research established the feasibility of the project technology to address the unmet need that clinical and administrative leaders in safety net hospitals have for reliable, practical information to respond to new priorities, improve operational efficiency and effectiveness, provide better patient care and connect with peers.    Phase I technology built a framework to collect, sort and synthesize vast amounts of material from multiple sources to provide content that is actionable and tailored to safety net clinicians and administrators. HINT?s successor is BestPractices Rx(TM), currently in development. BestPractices Rx will give safety net clinicians and administrators an unprecedented capability to connect directly to peer and subject experts for practical, implementable advice and to establish a platform for collaboration. BestPractices Rx will be available as a commercial product in 2020. We expect BestPractices Rx(TM) to have significant, broader impact beyond the commercial product.  The vast and constantly growing supply of healthcare information is overwhelming and spread across numerous sources.   The ability to manage and evaluate this information is compromised by the sheer volume and lack of direct approaches.   Clinicians, public health practitioners, health services researchers and policymakers all struggle to stay current and to integrate information in a meaningful way into their work.  Safety net practitioners often face additional challenges in obtaining information to improve care for their patients:  a limited body of research on the social determinants of health; inadequate staffing resources and significant time constraints; and no established avenue for direct connections to peer practices and expert advice.  As a result of these constraints, effective practices and lessons learned are often not assessed or disseminated.   Our project provides the vehicle to uncover innovations, successes and failed attempts, and unexpected consequences.  Our commercial product will provide a way to overcome these challenges and, as a result, accelerate information about patient care improvements and hospital practices across the safety net. Further product development has significant potential to improve care for underserved patients.  Although our initial focus is on the safety net hospital market, we expect BestPractices Rx to have broad applicability in the near future across the hospital industry and in other healthcare settings.  Our research will contribute to the field of computer science particularly to further understanding of algorithmic design for speed and accuracy.   Our project will also contribute to the field of dissemination and implementation research, specifically understanding the translation of research into implementable findings.
