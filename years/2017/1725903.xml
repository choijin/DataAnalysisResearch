<AbstractNarration>This grant is to acquire a spectroscopic ellipsometer for advancing materials research at Kettering University. This award will allow the university to expand research capabilities, support integration of research and experiential learning into courses, and enhance outreach programs in science and engineering fields. As many new educational programs have been established at Kettering recently, research projects targeted at engineered materials and surfaces have been launched, spanning a wide range of collaborative disciplines. An ellipsometer will add breadth to the growing laboratory capabilities essential to many ongoing research projects on campus. Undergraduates will benefit from using the ellipsometer not only as a part of the research experience, but also as a part of their courses, since many research-grade instruments are integrated into their classes. Additionally, the university is expanding its graduate offerings and is currently developing a Master?s program in Materials Science and Engineering. Therefore, this instrument will also greatly benefit the new graduate program. This award will also enrich the outreach programs offered through the university, designed to spark interest in science and engineering fields in the Flint community and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed instrument is a J.A. Woollam M-2000 Ellipsometer. This model can reach a wide audience with ease of use, while also offering full research-grade capabilities, such as measuring film thickness, optical constants, refractive index, and pore size distribution. Materials science and engineering related research projects recently established at Kettering encompass multiple disciplines. Investigators involved in this proposal mentor many undergraduate research assistants. This ellipsometer will enable researchers to overcome the challenges associated with developing the process-property relationships, necessary to optimize and engineer new materials and surfaces. Examples of projects, which will be supported by this ellipsometer, include developing engineered surfaces for orthopedic implants, investigating the deposition behavior of organosilicons in plasma, creating new materials and models for sodium-ion batteries, improving food storage materials, monitoring of surface-initiated polymerization kinetics, depositing silicon dioxide thin films with plasma, synthesizing materials for tissue engineering and wound repair, and understanding refractive index for thin ferrofluid layers. This award is co-funded by the CBET Division and CMMI Division.</AbstractNarration>

Project outcomes from this grant can be summarized as the following:  Research Support and Growth: The ellipsometer has been used extensively to support research for multiple projects since installation in March 2018.  Data from the ellipsometer has been used to support four research projects at Kettering across chemical engineering, physics, and chemistry involving four faculty members and 15 undergraduate students.

Results from these proejcts have been a part of a submitted patent application and various conference presentations.  Additionally, they are going to be a part of two manuscripts in preparation.  . Enriching Undergraduate Courses: The ellipsometer has been incorporated into two different undergraduate courses.  The physics class (Optoelectronics and Photonics) has incorporated the instrument to show students how thickness and refractive index can be measured for thin films.  In a Product Design chemical engineering course, students used the elipsometer as part of their project involving coatings for automotive applications on polycarbonate.  Moreover, since the equipment installation, 15 undergraduate students have used the equipment as part of an independent research elective course.  These students are gaining experience and training using new instruments and techniques to enhance their value to employers and graduate programs.

These activities represent direct integration of research and teaching in undergraduate curriculum and it is expected that the number of research students working on projects involving this instrument will continue to grow. Expanding Outreach Opportunities:  Kettering is involved in outreach activities for high shcool students at the university.  The ellipsometer was incorporated this summer as part of a demonstration for high school students attending the Lives Improved through Engineering and Science (LITES) program for female high school students.  As a part of the polymers and materials engineering session, students were exposed to characterizing various polymers and polymer films and the ellipsometer was used as an example.  It is anticipated that more outreach events will begin incorporating this tool in the future. Developing an Integrated Materials Characterization Lab: The growing materials characterization capabilities have allowed Kettering to begin organizing an integrated materials characterization lab including instrumentation such as the ellipsometer, X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, transmission electron microscope, differential scanning calorimeter, thermogravimetric analysis, and more.  The ellipsometer has already been used as a part of an external project with an industrial co-op sponsor at the university.  More work is ongoing to create a streamlined website showing the university's capabilities in instrumentation, which willl allow the university to interface with the public and gain more exposure.
