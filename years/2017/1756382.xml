<AbstractNarration>This award will support the integration of specimens from the Southern Adventist University (SAU) into the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC) Herbarium collection.  The UTC herbarium is a moderately-sized, but scientifically and educationally active collection of dried and archived plant specimens from Tennessee, northwest Georgia, and northeast Alabama.  The SAU collection of approximately 9,500 specimens represents thousands of species from across the US and Canada.  Through historical missionary work of SAU professors, specimens were also collected from international locations including Philippines, Kenya, Lebanon, and Abu Ghraib, Iraq.  Workers at the UTC will repair damaged specimens and secure the SAU collection and integrate it into a thriving collection at UTC.    The digital data set will be made available to researchers, educators, conservationists, and hobbyists through online public portals like iDigBio (iDigBio.org).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Herbarium at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UCHT) is recognized across Tennessee and in the Southern Appalachians as a leading resource documenting Tennessee's state flora, for digitizing Tennessee's herbarium collections as part of the Southeast Regional Network of Expertise and Collections (SERNEC), for making botanical data accessible through online portals, including the Tennessee/Kentucky Plant Atlas, and as a facility to train and educate young field botanists and conservationists.  In 2014, a languishing herbarium collection of ca. 9,500 specimens from Southern Adventist University (SAU) in Cleveland, Tennessee was transferred to UCHT.  After transfer, triage work revealed extensive damage from insects, failing glue, and improper storage.  However, it also revealed the national and international breadth of the collection.  Beyond North America, specimens were observed from Kenya, Lebanon, Philippines, and Iraq, potentially representing unique biological collections not present in other US collections.  This effort will support the post-transfer curation, repair, preservation, integration into UCHT, and digitization of the SAU collection.  Students at UTC will be trained on specimen repair, digitization, efforts to make collections data available online, and collections curation.  Data from this collection will be shared through SERNEC, Symbiota, iDigBio, and GBIF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Biological specimens of Earth?s organisms represent an enormous potential database that holds many keys to our understanding of the past, present and future. In some cases, these specimens represent populations of species that have been lost from Earth or populations of species that have been lost from certain locations. Biological specimens may tell the story of what the landscape was like at points in the past or they may hold data key to our understanding of the future; for example, it is well known that DNA can be extracted from most biological specimens and as such these specimens hold vast amounts of unexplored genetic data.   The Southern Adventist University (SAU) herbarium collection in Cleveland, Tennessee was a biological collection of plant specimens that was largely disconnected from the botanical communities in Tennessee and the Southeast.  While it contained nearly 10,000 specimens of dried, preserved plant species from the southeastern US, it also contained specimens from the Philippines, Kenya, Iraq, and Canada.  It is likely that these specimens represent species or populations of species that are otherwise rarely represented in US collections of plants.  Unfortunately, the SAU herbarium had been degraded by an insect infestation and many of the plant specimens had become detached from the archival paper that should protect them. Additionally, because of faculty turnover and changed research interests, the collection with without a curator. The ultimate goal of this work was to move the SAU herbarium collection about 30 miles south to the herbarium at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UCHT), repair the damaged specimens, and then integrate them into the thriving UT Chattanooga herbarium.  After moving the SAU plant specimens to UCHT, one MS graduate student and seven undergraduate students were given the opportunity to work on and learn from this work effort.  All eight students learned how collections are organized, how to care for biological specimens, what happens to specimens if they are not properly cared for, and how to repair damaged specimens. Two undergraduate students presented their work at an internal conference here at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, called Research Dialogues.  As of November 2019, all SAU specimens were repaired and incorporated into the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga herbarium.  Additionally, all of the SAU specimens were digitized and are available to the general public via online data portals for biological collections, like the Southeastern Regional Network of Expertise and Collections (SERNEC) portal or the Integrated, Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio) portal. While this work provided immediate protection for these specimens and simultaneously provided training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, the specimens will provide data for students, teachers, researchers, and conservationists for hundreds of years.
