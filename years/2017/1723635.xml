<AbstractNarration>Experts agree that cybersecurity is a multifaceted problem that should be addressed through an interdisciplinary framework; however, most of cybersecurity curricula are offered within specific disciplines. Developing interdisciplinary programs can be challenging with issues such as: student isolation, a disconnect between faculty from the disciplinary programs, a lack of coordination in course delivery, gaps in providing student support, and a lack of a basic interdisciplinary foundation among faculty and students alike. To address these challenges, the "Bridging the Disciplinary Gaps in Cybersecurity Curricula through General Education, High Impact Practices, and Training for Incoming Freshman" project will fully integrate student-focused high impact practices into an interdisciplinary cybersecurity major and minor at Old Dominion University. In addition, an interdisciplinary cybersecurity training module for incoming freshmen will be developed and delivered, and another interdisciplinary general education cybersecurity course will be made available through open education resources (OER). Developing an interdisciplinary general education cybersecurity course will provide students the foundation they need to learn about the topic through a multi-faceted lens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrating high impact practices into interdisciplinary curricula is a novel approach that will bolster the quality of cybersecurity academic programs. These will include learning communities, service learning, internships, undergraduate research projects, and e-Portfolios. The learning communities will include freshmen learning communities, sophomore learning communities, and living learning communities.  Each learning community will have a peer mentor assigned. A process will be developed so cybersecurity majors can develop an electronic portfolio in their first-year general studies cybersecurity course, providing a framework for usage over the course of their studies. The development of an open education resource (OER) general studies cybersecurity course will provide a framework that other higher education institutions can use to develop similar courses. Integrating high impact practices into the curricula will provide a framework that can be replicated in other institutions. Graduates of these curricula will be able to fill those occupational cybersecurity positions that require an interdisciplinary background in multiple fields, as well as strong communications and critical thinking skills. In addition, relationships with regional agencies/employers will be formalized to develop service learning, undergraduate research, and internship opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="p1">The value of interdisciplinary programs and scholarship in academia is well accepted. Interdisciplinary programs are inherently flexible, innovative, and focused on solving complex problems with new strategies, and bringing together expertise from across the university. The cybersecurity program at Old Dominion University provides a firm basis for further interdisciplinary improvement through the development of an interdisciplinary general education course. In developing this interdisciplinary general education cybersecurity course, <strong>CYSE 200T Cybsercurity, Technology, and Society</strong>, we have provided students the foundation they need to learn about the topic through a multi-faceted lens. In this course, developed by a team of scholars from the sciences, engineering, business, sociology, and philosophy, and drawing exclusively upon open education resources, students come to understand not only how a technology functions, but also how technology affects society. CYSE 200T is cross-listed with the same course in the Information Technology department in the College of Business, and it is a required course in the Cybersecurity B.S. curriculum thus insuring its continued longevity and sustainment. The course has been made available online in an open access format.&nbsp; It can be accessed at: https://sites.wp.odu.edu/cyse-200/.&nbsp; Feedback from students showed that they appreciated the interdisicplinary content provided in the course and valued the use of open educational materials rather than conventional textbooks.</p> <p class="p1">In addition, this project enabled the development of a new module and video to introduce <strong>all </strong>incoming freshmen, at the start of every academic year, to the topic of cybersecurity.&nbsp; A link to view this video can be found here:&nbsp;https://odu.box.com/s/qpcl2yfhnpr2k6h5ixshksh0p8f5go66.</p> <p class="p1">Finally and most significantly, through this project, high impact practices such as learning communities, internships, service-learning, undergraduate research and ePorfolio creation, were integrated into ODU's interdisciplinary cybersecurity curricula in a manner which will insure sustainability for the most students.

Past research shows that high impact practices are especially effective in benefiting students who are disadvantaged and traditionally underserved.&nbsp; The current project builds on the past research and shows that, in particular, internships, service learning, living learning communities, and electronic portfolios were beneficial to cybersecurity students.</p> <p class="p1">To help students understand how to tie these practices together in an electronic portfolio, a video was developed.&nbsp; The video is availalbe here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTsSG0qXVWM&amp;feature=youtu.be.&nbsp; Findings from our project show that electronic portfolios can be integrated into the cybersecurity curriculum.&nbsp; A survey of students found that cybersecurity students were more likely than comparable students to report developing an electronic portfolios.&nbsp; In addition, students who understood the value of electronic portfolios were more likely to report positive responses to the teaching tool.</p> <p class="p1">Insuring the broader impacts of this project, the development of CYSE 200T, an open education resource, general studies, interdisciplinary cybersecurity course provides a framework for other higher education institutions to use to develop similar courses.
