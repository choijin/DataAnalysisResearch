<AbstractNarration>Data heterogeneity and accessibility are major barriers to scientific progress. Many community curated data repositories (CCDRs) have emerged in the paleogeosciences in response to the needs of their scientific communities, but these CCDRs are not well integrated. This project seeks to transform geoscientific research by breaking down the barriers among the CCDRs that serve geoscientists. All participating resources are closely engaged with their respective disciplinary communities and each is mobilizing data from its communities; the key need is to facilitate data interchange among CCDRs. The work will align several major CCDRs using a system that develops new shared services that rely on common standards, and demonstrates the kinds of new scientific insights that become possible with an integrated geoscientific infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project will accomplish the following: 1) A survey of existing data structures and standards, their suitability for paleogeoscience CCDRs and alignment with requirements identified by the paleogeosciences research coordination network, and their degree of adoption. This will lead to recommendations for adoption by participating resources (EarthChem, Flyover Country, IODP, LacCore/CSDCO, LinkedEarth, Neotoma) and documentation written for geoscientific audiences. 2) Alignment of participating CCDRs to recommended standards and development of a common API that will allow data exchange among CCDRs and to third-party users. 3) Development of an Annotation Engine, which will provide a credentialed, crowd-sourced system for scientists to flag changes to datasets, to connect datasets post hoc, to add context to legacy data, and to provide link-back notification among CCDRs when linked dataset attributes change. Annotation Engine will be embedded into existing scientific CCDR-based workflows, minimizing disruption to users. 4) Development of GeoNoteBase to enable scientists to generate citeable, reproducible workflows that draw information from across data resources, with workflows made available through keyword searches, with full attribution. This is a pilot effort to begin some of the work Through two pilot scientific projects, THROUGHPUT will test and evaluate these new capabilities and demonstrate kinds of new scientific insights that can be gained through integration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ability to find, access, and efficiently utilize data is a major barrier to advancing scientific research. Many scientists spend a large fraction of their time locating, reformatting, and integrating heterogeneous data sets before they can use that data to drive new discoveries. Important discoveries could perhaps come sooner if time could be shifted away from data wrangling to more productive uses.     In the earth sciences, many research communities have developed publicly-accessible data repositories to archive and share scientific data. As these repositories were largely developed independently of each other, they are not well integrated. There is a real need to connect related data across these multiple repositories. There is also a need to develop systems to archive data types that are not well supported by current repositories and to make more existing data readily accessible.     The tephra use case of the THROUGHPUT pilot project supports the broader project goals of aligning and connecting multiple community data repositories using new shared services that rely on common web standards and demonstrating the kinds of new scientific insights that become possible with an integrated and accessible geoscientific infrastructure.     "Tephra" refers to all material produced by pyroclastic volcanism ranging from thick deposits of pumice on the slopes of source volcanoes to traces of far-traveled volcanic ash carried thousands of kilometers downwind. Tephra research includes work on volcanic processes and volcanic hazards, atmospheric transport of ash, and diverse applications of volcanic ash layers as time markers. The widespread presence of volcanic ash (in soils, lakes, oceans, ice cores, etc.) and varied applications of tephra studies (natural hazards, environmental change, archaeology &amp; human origins, etc.) make tephra an ideal test case for data repository integration.     To support the THROUGHPUT project goals and the needs of the international tephra research community, the tephra use case working group has accomplished the following during the pilot project:     Identified key repositories of tephra data along with their design, terminologies, capabilities, and limitations. This process also identified important gaps in repository support, especially for sample chemistry and data collected at field sites.     Collaborated on the development of international tephra research community data standards and best practices. This includes participation in major domestic and international scientific meetings and numerous teleconference discussions.     Collaborated with existing data repositories and systems to improve support for data types needed to document volcanic ash chemistry (EarthChem repository) and to improve support for physical descriptions and other data from field sites (StraboSpot field app and repository).    Initiated two test projects using lake core sample and volcanic ash layers from Carp Lake, Washington, and Summer Lake, Oregon. These involve documenting sediment cores and volcanic ash layers and compiling chemical data for hundreds of ash samples housed in the Concord University tephra lab.     Prepared a catalog of more than 500 major tephra layers from North America, Kamchatka, Iceland, Europe, Mediterranean, New Zealand, and Japan to provide a working set of tephra names to use in keyword search testing.    Developed a new concept for a community-developed, simplified, global database of tephra deposits that has the potential to substantially improve capabilities for tephra data discovery and search. Advantages of this concept include the potential for rapid development via community crowdsourcing and the capability to link to additional, more detailed information in other major data repositories.
