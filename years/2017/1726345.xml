<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Professor Piotr Piotrowiak from Rutgers University Newark and colleagues Edward Castner, Elena Galoppini, Jenny Lockhard and Kevin Belfield (New Jersey Institute of Technology) are acquiring a pump-probe transient absorption and fluorescence upconversion spectrometer system.  This is a laser based system which enables the study of a wide range of laser phenomena that address significant challenges of social, environmental and economic importance. Research topics focus on solar energy research, renewable energy and green chemistry,  photovoltaic materials, and biomarkers linked to human health. The instrumentation strengthens research and training at three institutions: Rutgers-Newark, Rutgers-New Brunswick and the New Jersey Institute of Technology.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This pump-probe transient absorption and fluorescence upconversion spectrometer system enhances research and education at all levels. It serves researcher who are testing the interplay between electron transfer and vibrational cooling in extended donor-acceptor arrays as well as those seeking understanding of ionic liquids.  Research probing the fundamental relationship between molecular structure and nonlinear optical properties of chromophores also utilize this instrument. The spectrometer system is used to look for surface modification strategies and synthetic tools to understand interfacial charge separation and electron transfer dynamics.  Researchers carry out mechanistic studies on photocatalytic properties of hybrid materials to unify nanoscience, coordination chemistry and catalysis. The spectrometer is important in seeking to unravel terrestrial surface photogeochemistry in the Archaen period.</AbstractNarration>
