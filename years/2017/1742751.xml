<AbstractNarration>The Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program funds research and the development, implementation, and investigation of models to transform the dissertation phase of doctoral education, postdoctoral training and/or faculty advancement of historically underrepresented minorities (URMs) in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and/or STEM education research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference convening will bring together nearly 200 principal investigators who have been funded by AGEP to develop, implement and test models of graduate education, postdoctoral scholar training and faculty professional advancement with historically underrepresented minorities in STEM disciplines and STEM education research fields.  The goals of the conference are to: (1) Serve as a forum for presenting model components from AGEP awardees for transforming graduate education, postdoctoral training, and faculty advancement in STEM that show the greatest potential for reproducibility, scalability, and sustainability across our Nation?s postsecondary institutions; (2) Provide professional development opportunities to advance participant knowledge of the academic and professional preparation for diverse STEM CAREER pathways into the professoriate; and (3) Provide professional development about NSF strategic priorities, policies, and procedures that foster broadening participation in STEM doctoral programs and the professoriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two and half-day conference is scheduled for May of 2019.  In addition to research panels, presentations and poster sessions, there will be opportunities for highly interactive discussions and activities, keynote addresses and plenary sessions.  Discussions will be focused on the AGEP Alliances and models, and on those model components with the greatest intellectual merit potential for reproducibility, scalability and sustainability.  The proposed work includes both evaluation and dissemination plans for broader impacts.</AbstractNarration>

One hundred and seventy-two people who represented 85 colleges and universities, non-profits, and community groups networked and shared research. Twenty-five AGEP Alliances convened for the first National Research Meeting hosted in the Pacific Northwest. Team leadership was successful in meeting the project goals through activities developed to advance knowledge of diverse pathways in STEM and broadening participation initiatives. Team leadership developed a plan for sessions, created materials, invited plenaries and invited speakers, and organized activities. Key activities included plenaries, panel presentations, invited speakers, technical sessions, lightning talks, and poster sessions. NSF Informational sessions were scheduled throughout the program. These activities aimed to advance diverse pathways and develop a shared vision across AGEP Alliances. Together participants shared ideas and identified strategies that foster diverse pathways in STEM.</span></p> <p><span>Intellectual Merit</span></p> <p><span>Two nationally renowned speakers presented on career preparation and pathways into the professoriate. The first, Dr. Medheva Ghee, shared about her experiences and her engagement in broadening participation initiatives. The second plenary, Dr. Karen DePauw, gave an inspired talk on the transformation of graduate education through innovation and increased participation of diverse groups. Three expert scholars, Drs. Daniel Wildcat, Paula Groves Price, and Lisa Wolf-Wendel facilitated breakout sessions on traditional ecological knowledges, culturally sustained mentoring through critical race awareness, and work-life integration, respectively.</span></p> <p><span>Interactive Technical Sessions involved brainstorming ideas around essential issues concerning career pathways across all institutional types in higher education. The five Technical Sessions were facilitated by meeting organizers to discuss and collect strategies from participants. There were three Concurrent Sessions scheduled for specific groups to work together. AGEP Alliances met with either the NSF program officers, the social science researchers, or evaluators group. During the AGEP social science research session, attendees discussed the role of the social science researcher in AGEP. Forming a coordinated dissemination strategy to reach a wider audience was considered a high need among the group. The evaluation session discussed the mechanics and challenges of implementing high quality, culturally responsive, relevant, and methodologically appropriate evaluations of AGEP activities, outcomes, and impacts.</span></p> <p><span>Fourteen AGEP Alliance participants presented research results from the NSF funded AGEP program. Most of the research models showcased aligned with the theme,&nbsp;<em><span>Diverse Pathways in STEM: Achieving the Dream.</span></em>&nbsp;The Lightning Research Talks and Poster Sessions included socially informed research models, policies, and practices to promote sustainability and reproducibility. Twenty-two of the fourteen participants also presented research posters.&nbsp; Conference agenda, presentations and other conference materials can be found at www.uidaho.edu/AGEP2019.</span></p> <p><span>Broader Impacts</span></p> <p><span>The meeting provided a platform to share information priorities, policies, and procedures to AGEP stakeholders. Participants gained insights and understanding about diverse pathways in STEM and have valuable information about the NSF's strategic priorities, policies, and procedures to broaden participation<em><span>.</span></em>&nbsp;Additionally, tribal colleges, community colleges, research universities, professional master's programs, and 4-year public universities and other AGEP stakeholders discussed opportunities and challenges of model development from the management, research, and evaluative perspectives. Additionally, in partnership with NSF, the conference provided opportunities and conversations to better define and understand the evaluation and reporting requirements for current and future AGEP and other NSF projects and priorities.</span></p> <p><span>Three presentations were developed and delivered based on the 2019 conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><span>Building a Model to Serve Indigenous Graduate Students in STEM&nbsp;</span></em>and&nbsp;<em><span>Report from the Technical Sessions at the 2019 AGEP Research Forum&nbsp;</span></em>were presented at the 2020 AGEP National Research Meeting.&nbsp;<em><span>An NSF funded project to support STEM Opportunities for American Indian/ Alaska Native graduate students&nbsp;</span></em>was presented at the Sixth Biennial Ethnicity, Race, and Indigenous Peoples Conference.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Overall, the 2019 AGEP National Research Meeting re-energized AGEP participants, fostered a sense of belonging, and built momentum for the continuous transformation of graduate education and the advancement of minoritized people into the STEM professoriate.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/01/2021<br>

The Lightning Research Talks and Poster Sessions included socially informed research models, policies, and practices to promote sustainability and reproducibility. Twenty-two of the fourteen participants also presented research posters.  Conference agenda, presentations and other conference materials can be found at www.uidaho.edu/AGEP2019.  Broader Impacts  The meeting provided a platform to share information priorities, policies, and procedures to AGEP stakeholders. Participants gained insights and understanding about diverse pathways in STEM and have valuable information about the NSF's strategic priorities, policies, and procedures to broaden participation. Additionally, tribal colleges, community colleges, research universities, professional master's programs, and 4-year public universities and other AGEP stakeholders discussed opportunities and challenges of model development from the management, research, and evaluative perspectives. Additionally, in partnership with NSF, the conference provided opportunities and conversations to better define and understand the evaluation and reporting requirements for current and future AGEP and other NSF projects and priorities.  Three presentations were developed and delivered based on the 2019 conference.  Building a Model to Serve Indigenous Graduate Students in STEM and Report from the Technical Sessions at the 2019 AGEP Research Forum were presented at the 2020 AGEP National Research Meeting. An NSF funded project to support STEM Opportunities for American Indian/ Alaska Native graduate students was presented at the Sixth Biennial Ethnicity, Race, and Indigenous Peoples Conference.   Overall, the 2019 AGEP National Research Meeting re-energized AGEP participants, fostered a sense of belonging, and built momentum for the continuous transformation of graduate education and the advancement of minoritized people into the STEM professoriate.
