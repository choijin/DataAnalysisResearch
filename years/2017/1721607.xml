<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to help environmental engineers identify and delineate the bounds and concentrations of soil and groundwater contaminants with greater speed and accuracy. Over 30,000 contaminant spills have been identified in the United States alone, with thousands yet to be investigated and returned to safe levels.  The resources and effort being applied to these sites is insufficient to ensure the safety of the affected communities across America.  Focusing the remediation resources available, in the right place increases the rate at which federal and state regulators can close site investigations. As a result, environmental professionals will perform remediation earlier, making the site safe and productive again for local communities. The innovations developed in this project will enhance understanding of contaminant migration and develop a technical capability to use these findings to prepare more accurate conceptual site models during a contaminant investigation.  Faster site models resulting in successful remediation directly translates into cost savings for environmental clean-ups, reduction in damage to the environment, as well as increased throughput and efficiency for the environmental engineering industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This SBIR Phase I project proposes to create unique summary models for the flow, extent, depth, and shape of contaminant plumes, with the goal of targeting resources to accelerate the remediation process for local communities. The project leverages algorithmically derived models of contaminant migration combined with public and private data from decades of environmental investigations across the country. Once the data are aggregated and analyzed, the project team will produce a collection of guideline statistics and software tools for use by engineers investigating future sites that are mathematically similar to those in the combined database. The project uses predictive algorithms to determine the likely extent of underground contaminations and applies statistical uncertainty measures to the conceptual site model. These mechanisms will enable environmental professionals to understand when and where additional data is required. In addition, by using a more accurate and sophisticated measure of uncertainty, the project?s models will provide definitive guidance to field engineers on where to collect new sample data and where they have sufficient certainty to remediate the site using excavation or other means.  These innovations will lead to the goal of safer and cleaner communities in less time, with fewer costs, with reduced environmental damage.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ EnviMetric is an environmental modeling tool developed with the support of the National Science Foundation through the SBIR Phase I program.  EnviMetric shows the most likely extent of underground contamination using a machine learning model synthesizing many prior spills.  The aims of this project were to examine how a machine learning model of thousands of prior spills can be applied to currently polluted sites to amend the site characterization process.  The model provides an additional line of evidence for an environmental investigation, emphasizing the common and most likely results consistent with sites that have similar soil, groundwater, climate, and topographic characteristics.  EnviMetric models are suitable for initial site characterization, verification, investigation of unknown source zone, and probability estimates of source zone contamination range estimates.  The specific model used in EnviMetric is a geospatial predictive model that produces a probability estimate for the extent and dispersion of future plumes.  The power of the model is that it learns the likely plume formation from thousands of cases of contamination without being overfit or biased by any one input case.  By removing this bias, and learning from many more contaminated sites than any expert could encounter in a lifetime, a generalizable model can be used to show how situations like the customer?s site would tend to behave.     Figure 1: EnviMetric Model projected onto example site  Figure 2: Vertical profile of EnviMetric model at example site     EnviMetric produces two results &ndash; an unknown source model, and an unknown destination model.  The unknown destination model shows the highest probability estimates for the location of the farthest detectable contaminated area down hydraulic gradient from the contamination source zone. The second output is the unknown source model.  This is for situations where contamination is detected, but the source of the contaminant is unknown.  This often occurs when one property is contaminated, while a neighboring property may be the source of the contamination.   Figure 3: Unknown contaminant destination model  Figure 4: Unknown contaminant source model  EnviMetric positively impacts the public at large, but additionally has positive impacts for the government and professionals in the environmental industry.  The single biggest impact of EnviMetric is its ability to mitigate human exposure to deleterious chemicals in the environment.  The World Health Organization estimates in 2012 that 23% of all deaths worldwide (12.6 million people) were due to environmental causes.  Exposure to environmental contamination serves as a significant barrier to achieving health and prosperity for society at large.  There is a critical need for improvement of the environmental remediation process to protect our communities.  If EnviMetric can improve the site characterization and remediation process to decrease the time and money it takes to remediate environmental contamination, we will reduce the societal risk of exposure and allow for the allocation of resources previously consumed in lengthy remediation projects to address the backlog of contaminated sites.  Further, EnviMetric ameliorates the remediation process at the administrative level; EnviMetric allows environmental regulators (at the state and federal level) to be able to remediate more quickly for less money.  This has two major impacts; first, that the cost per remediation will be reduced and that the time taken to remediate per site will be reduced.  Secondly, regulators will be able to allocate institutional resources to the remediation of contaminated sites that are currently sitting in backlog.  In EPA?s report, "The National LUST Cleanup Backlog: A Study of Opportunities" (2011) the EPA noted that there are over 100,000 leaking underground storage tank (LUST) sites across the country in the national LUST backlog.  This is the backlog is from only one of many state and federal level programs to address contaminated sites across the country. If we can make the remediation process more efficient using EnviMetric, we have the chance to chip away at the amount of contaminated sites across the country that have yet to be addressed.  Finally, EnviMetric has positively impacted environmental professionals.  Students studying environmental science and engineering were provided with the opportunity to work on our data augmentation team and have commented on the fact that this project has provided them with many learning opportunities to better understand environmental remediation. This project has provided professional development opportunities for every team member.  Additionally, EnviMetric positively impacts environmental professionals at large by adding to their informational resources when conducting a contaminated site assessment and remediation.
