<AbstractNarration>The international  conference Representation Theory at the Crossroads of Modern Mathematics will be held May 29 - June 2, 2017 at the University of Reims  Champagne - Ardenne (France). This project is to support the participation of U.S.-based researchers in the event. The conference will consist of twenty-seven talks given by the leading international researchers in representation theory and it will foster a high level of interaction and collaboration among a diverse, international group of mathematicians. Participation of U.S.-based researchers in the event will contribute to the current strength of domestic mathematical research and support the development of the next generation of researchers in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unifying theme of the conference will be the impact of the oribit method of A. Kirillov in representation theory. Talks will cover a wide range of topics in the representation theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras, including quantum groups,  integrable systems,  geometric quantization, cohomology of algebraic groups, and   applications of  representation theory in enumerative  geometry and physics. The program will advance the dissemination of the newest results in the field and catalyze and strengthen a broad spectrum of scientific exchanges and collaborations between mathematicians from around the world working in representation theory and related topics.

The project   supported  the travel of a group of US-based researchers. The  supported group  included  several female mathematicians, graduate students, early career researchers, as well as a small group of senior participants whose travel or related expenses were not supported by any federal grant. The benefits  for young researchers  came not only in the form of acquiring of the new scientific knowledge, but in the form of the encouragement to continue their research and  the career in academia.         The support by this grant was crucial for increasing of the diversity of participation of the meeting and the visibility of the US-based researchers.The event, one of the major conferences in the area during the last few years, was very beneficial for the research projects in representation theory and related areas conducted in the United States. The conference  brought together scientists from all over the world for the discussion of the major questions and achievements in the representation theory. Participants of the conference  communicated  their own research,  established new international collaborations, advertised  the projects in representation theory and its applications developed by the scientific community of the USA.
