<AbstractNarration>This dissertation examines how disaster-induced institutional reforms coupled with post-disaster capacity building through reconstruction projects have significantly enhanced governance effectiveness in the one low-income, fragile state. Governance systems are composed of networks of public, private, and international organizations that make collaborative decisions to solve public issues. Increasing the effectiveness of governance systems is critical for improving human security and prosperity across the world, especially in developing country settings. Large-scale natural disasters often create windows of opportunity for improving the effectiveness of governance systems by reforming the rules and norms that guide decisions, interactions and operations of networked organizations. Collaborative post-disaster reconstruction operations provide opportunities for augmenting the effectiveness of governance systems by improving resource capacity, informational infrastructure, and social support base of interorganizational networks. While much work has been done on expanding resource capacity of governance systems, especially in the context of post-conflict reconstruction and state building, little research has examined the sociotechnical foundations of governance effectiveness: how information and trust facilitate social learning and adaptive capacity, especially at the nexus of post-disaster reconstruction and governance reforms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this dissertation research traces Nepal's new constitution of September 20, 2015 and the resulting transition from a unitary governance system to a federal system of seven autonomous provinces back to the April/May 2015 earthquakes and the post-earthquake reconstruction efforts. The objective of such process-tracing is to reveal the mechanisms of change that logically connect the earthquakes and post-earthquake reconstruction operations with the changes in Nepal's governance system. Setting up a pre-post research design with a focus on short and medium-term effects, the research uses several sources of secondary as well as original expert interview data to measure changes in resource capacity, informational infrastructure, and the social support base. Resource capacity measures are constructed using government statistical reports, foreign aid donor reports, the Prime Ministers Disaster Relief Fund data and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs financial tracking data. The informational capacity of the system is measured using knowledge graph datasets of the "Global Data on Events, Location and Tone" database that records organizations and their dyadic interactions in the context of Nepal's governance system and post-disaster reconstruction. Changes in the social support base are measured using news articles, opinion surveys of news organizations and think tanks as well as multiple waves of post-earthquake citizen feedback surveys conducted by civil society organizations and international development organizations. Semi-structured expert interview data and field observations from Nepal cross-validates the findings of the study and uncovers nuances to the specified mechanisms of change. The resulting analyses show how the 2015 earthquakes and post-earthquake rebuilding projects have significantly shaped the governance system of Nepal. This case study contributes to the broader literature in collaborative disaster governance, humanitarian assistance, and post-disaster governance reforms in developing countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The award enabled Farhod Yuldashev to enhance the quality of his doctoral dissertation research by conducting expert interviews in Nepal and by presenting his findings at premier international academic conferences in the United States.  Yuldashev's dissertation "Natural Disasters and Governance Systems: The Sociotechnical Foundations of Post-Disaster Governance Reforms in Nepal" found that elevated levels of social trust against real and perceived threats, improved levels of resource capacity, and increased levels of organizational capacity to collect, use and exchange information interact together to facilitate reforms in the governance system. More specifically, increased levels of social trust that emerged in Nepal to overcome the hardships produced by the destructive forces of nature and to fight against the challenges of post-disaster crises created pressure for leaders to swiftly enact governance reforms. As massive amounts of resources were mobilized for post-disaster relief and reconstruction, leading actors of the governance system were motivated to make the best use of such resources in improving their autonomy and influence. Because natural disasters, just like market shocks and policy changes, have distributional consequences, actors with greatest organizational capacity or preparation prior to the disaster in managing information benefit the most from the window of opportunity.  The dissertation recommends decision makers within Nepal, United Nations, United States, and beyond to implement policies that are informed by dynamic shifts in post-disaster social trust, resource mobilization and informational capacity as they implement their long-term strategic goals in institution building. Establishing a permanent national-level agency with provincial branches in charge of disaster recovery and reconstruction would contribute to policy and program expertise to moderate the effects of dynamic shifts in the governance system.

In May 2018, Yuldashev analyzed the expert interview data and incorporated the new insights into his dissertation. On June 8th, 2018, Yuldashev presented his dissertation research findings at the 11thAnnual Political Networks Conference in Arlington, VA. On June 27th, 2018, Yuldashev presented research related to his dissertation at the International Public Policy and Association Conference in Pittsburgh, PA.  On August 8, 2018, Yuldashev defended his dissertation and obtained his Ph.D. degree on September 11, 2018.  Yuldashev also attended the 2018 annual meeting of the American Political Science Association in Boston (August 30 - September 2, 2018) as well as the 2018 Fall Research Conference of the Association for the Public Policy Analysis and Management in Washington, DC (November 8 - 10, 2018) to further disseminate the findings of his research within scholarly communities.  On April 25, 2019, Yuldashev was awarded the most distinguished record in academic achievement and service to the school in the doctoral program of the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Pittsburgh.
