<AbstractNarration>Atmospheric oxygen rose suddenly approximately 2.4 billion years ago after Cyanobacteria evolved the ability to produce oxygen through photosynthesis (oxygenic photosynthesis). This change permanently altered the future of life on Earth, yet little is known about the evolutionary processes leading to it. The Melainabacteria were first discovered in 2013 and are closely related non-photosynthetic relatives of the first group of organisms capable of oxygenic photosynthesis.  This project will utilize existing data on metagenomes from microbial mats in Lake Vanda, an ice-covered lake in Antarctica where many sequences of Melainabacteria have been previously identified.      From this genetic information, the project aims to assess the metabolic capabilities of these Melainabacteria and identify their potential ecological roles.  The project will additionally evaluate the evolutionary relationships among the Cyanobacteria and Melainabacteria and closely related organisms that will allow an advancement in understanding of the evolutionary path that lead to oxygenic photosynthesis on Earth.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will focus on extracting evolutionary information from the genomic data of Melainabacteria and Sericytochromatia, recently-described groups closely related to but basal to the Cyanobacteria. The characterization of novel members of these groups in samples from Lake Vanda, Antarctica, will provide insights into the path and processes involved in the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. The research will focus on assessing the metabolic capabilities of Melainabacteri, deriving the evolutionary relationships among Melainabacteria and Cyanobacteria and reconstructing potential evolutionary pathways leading to oxygenic photosynthesis.  The project will focus on 12 metagenomes where the researchers expect to obtain genomes for at least the eight most abundant Melainabacteria in the dataset. Melainabacteria bins will be annotated and preliminary metabolic pathways will be constructed. The project will utilize full-length sequences of marker genes from across the bacterial domain with a particular focus on taxa that are oxygenic or anoxygenic phototrophs and use the marker genes, to build a rooted "backbone" tree. Incomplete or short sequences from the metagenomes will be added to the tree using the Evolutionary Placement Algorithm. The researchers will also build a corresponding phylogenetic tree using a Bayesian framework and compare their topologies.  By doing so, the project aims to improve the understanding of the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis, which caused the most significant change in Earth's surface chemistry. Specifically, they will document a significantly broader metabolic diversity within the Melainabacteria than has been previously identified, gain significant insights into their metabolic evolution, their evolutionary relationships with the Cyanobacteria, and the evolutionary steps leading to the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis. This research will have the overall effect of constraining key evolutionary processes in the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis. It will provide the foundation for future studies by indicating where a genomic record of the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis may be preserved. Results will also be shared with middle school children through the development of scientific lesson plans in collaboration with teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
