<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase treatment options and to improve health outcomes for patients using a comprehensive algorithm-based behavior health intervention. It can address Institute of Health Improvement's Triple AIM to improve population health, improve patients' experience of care, and reduce per capita healthcare cost. The proposed platform is aimed at optimizing treatment outcomes by enhancing motivations, maximizing treatment adherence, engaging families and natural supports, and supporting self-care management for individuals with chronic/serious behavioral health conditions. The proposed technology is expected to enable patients to receive an ancillary, active treatment that keeps them functioning in daily life. By enhancing the clinical experience for patients and clinicians, individuals with behavioral health conditions can self-monitor and communicate their experiences to their clinician and record them in real time, allowing monitoring and assessment by the behavioral health provider.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop and test a novel behavior health technology intervention on improving patients? ability to feel in control of their treatment and improve their well-being.  The technology is expected to enable ongoing, real-time feedback to the both the patient's personal and professional care team to monitor the impact of enabling/impending factors on treatment progress to continually refine the care plan and interventions so that optimal results can be achieved. The platform consists of a secure mobile and web platform used to provide proactive interventions, advanced algorithms used to personalize care and provide insights to the behavioral health provider. The team plans to assess whether the combination of personal support effectively in the patients' care together with advanced correlations using deep learning can help in predicting interventions including crisis episode, improve patient's treatment planning and wellness.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Title: Developing a Comprehensive Online Platform to Enhance Care Coordination and Improve Behavioral Health Outcomes (NSF Proposal #1747845)   Project Description:  The objective of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project was to understand how to increase treatment options and possible solutions to client problems through a comprehensive technology-based behavior health intervention - the SageSurfer app. This comprehensive technology-based behavior health intervention addresses the Institute of Health Improvement's Triple AIM to improve population health, improve consumer's experience of care, and reduce per capita healthcare cost. It sought to optimize treatment outcomes by enhancing motivations, maximizing treatment adherence, engaging families and natural supports, and supporting self-care management for individuals with chronic/serious conditions. Through this technology, clients can receive an ancillary, active treatment that keeps them functioning in daily life. By enhancing the clinical experience for clients and clinicians, clients can communicate their experiences via the app to their clinician and record them in real time, clients can use technology to be goal-directed, to self-monitor, and have their behavior monitored and assessed for necessary intervention.  This Phase I Project had two goals.  Goal 1: Develop the SageSurfer app that is consumer-centric with consideration of population health differentiators. The SageSurfer app utilizes an analytics engine framework and deep learning algorithms to perform semi-supervised natural language processing on (a) client entered data; (b) support system data surrounding the client, and (c) data obtained about client needs from external reference systems like electronic health records. Sentiment, Key Phrases and entities information was retrieved using the algorithm and it was adapted to customize entity recognition by training the entity. The processing by deep learning algorithm help us to identify user patterns and correlation engine together with other components are then displayed in the app via dashboards, notifications and reports. This information enables professional care team members to obtain insights and trigger configured relevant workflows directly from the SageSurfer web application or native apps.     Goal 2: Pilot test SAGESURFER in a real-world setting.  There are three current pilot trials being conducted in a real-world settings to gather information about the SageSurfer app across providers and participation from practitioners, consumers and members of their personal support team.              Site 1: A federally funded program designed to improve coordination among primary health care, behavioral health care and social services for clients who are high users of multiple systems yet continue to have poor health outcomes. The program is designed to provide a Peer Mentor (person with lived experience and specific training to support other consumers) and family support services to assist clients (called "Peers") who are in psychiatric hospital settings to successfully transition to community-based services. Peers (N=30) have been recruited to provide data through our surveys were administered as part of a Peer's intake process for the HOPE program at initial program Entry at start of the program, Check-in (after approx.. 30 days), Exit, and Six Month Follow-up.                Site 2: A US Veteran provider organization supporting veterans struggling with PTSD and their family members (N = 27).  Site 3: NAMI (National Association of Mental Illness) / MHA (Mental Health Association) - Alameda County.   A survey was provided to caregivers (N=24) about their needs and specific features of the SageSurfer app.  Data collection is ongoing at all three sites, but preliminary analyses indicate interest in SageSurfer utilization by clients, clinical care providers, and caregivers.  There is also evidence of feasibility in SageSurfer involving personal support effectively in the client care together with advanced correlations using deep learning can help in predicting interventions including crisis episode, improve client treatment planning and wellness. In addition, advanced analytics delivered via SageSurfer's customized dashboards with correlated information from client and provider support system help in providing valuable proactive insights in achieving IHI's Triple Aim.
