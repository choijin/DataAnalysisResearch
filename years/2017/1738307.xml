<AbstractNarration>1738307&lt;br/&gt;Lauchnor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to partially support an international conference, Wetland Systems for Water Pollution Control (WETPOL) to be held August 21-25, 2017, Big Sky, Montana. This conference is the leading international conference on applications of natural and engineered wetlands for water quality improvement and has been convened biennially since 2005. The goals of the conference include making connections between fundamental science and engineered wetland applications, knowledge transfer between the different areas of wetland research and technology, increasing knowledge and acceptance of wetlands for water treatment and making cultural connections between diverse regions with different needs and potential uses for wetland technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treatment wetlands have undergone recent design advances that have drastically improved their treatment performance. In addition, treatment wetlands provide a low cost, low energy wastewater treatment alternative that can provide ecosystem services and aesthetic appeal. Despite these recent technological advancements, current understanding of the fundamental processes responsible for effective contaminant removal remains limited. By bringing together experts in treatment wetlands technology and those scientists, engineers and practitioners focused on natural wetlands and restoration of wetland systems for ecological purposes advances in understanding fundamental processes will result. The participants which are experts in natural wetlands and wetland restoration gain access too many case studies and other controlled experiments conducted by treatment wetland experts, allowing them to better understand fundamental processes affecting wetland ecology and biogeochemistry. Support for students will greatly increase the potential for their participation at the conference on treatment wetland design and participate in developing a more thorough understanding of wetlands. Industry participation in WETPOL will promote the use and development of wetland technology for various water treatment applications in the U.S. Hosting this conference in the U.S. for the first time will help to increase awareness of the benefits of treatment wetlands and enhance the potential for consultants to implement treatment wetlands and wetland restoration projects. Many U.S. communities that are conducive to small-scale, onsite wastewater treatment systems can benefit from the interactions and knowledge gained from this conference. In addition, knowledge of treatment wetlands applications for treating industrial, mining and agricultural wastewater can benefit those sectors in regions of the U.S.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The International Symposium for Wetland Systems for Water Pollution Control (WETPOL) was held in Big Sky, MT, August 21-25, 2017.  A major focus of the symposium and accompanying workshop are treatment wetlands (TW), or constructed wetland systems designed and used for wastewater treatment. The goals for the symposium included knowledge transfer between individuals involved in TW technology, linking science to application of TW, increasing acceptance of TW as a wastewater treatment technology and increasing understanding of biogeochemical processes controlling water quality in wetlands.  A pre-conference workshop on design and application of wetland technology for the treatment of domestic wastewater was given on August 19-20 on the Montana State University campus.  The workshop was presented by four international experts in TW, each with 10-20 years of experience in research, consulting and design of TW for diverse applications.  The instructors included Carlos Arias, PhD (Aarhus University, Denmark), Pascal Molle (IRSTEA, France), Scott Wallace (Naturally Wallace Consulting, USA) and Chris Allen (Montana State University, USA).  The workshop attracted 13 wastewater professionals, eight of whom received scholarships through the NSF support, and offered credit for professional development and continuing education.  Workshop topics included understanding the basic types of TW, identifying treatment capacities and using sizing guidelines to design TW systems and operational strategies for nutrient removal. The WETPOL symposium attracted 158 international attendees including 32 students who presented their work as oral or poster presentations.  Of the student attendees, 27 received scholarships for registration to the symposium, provided through NSF GOALI support.  Also among attendance at the symposium were 60 professionals and four individuals from government agencies.  The scientific program consisted of 120 oral and poster presentations on specific research topics or case studies.  Additionally, four keynote speakers and nine mini-keynotes on important topics in the wetland area were included in the program.  The venue, the Big Sky Resort conference facility within the mountain village at Big Sky, Montana, provided ample opportunities for students, researchers and professionals to network and exchange knowledge during coffee breaks, meals in the conference dining facilities and the conference dinner.  Attendees had the option to attend one of four tours to nearby natural, restored or treatment wetlands in Southwest Montana on one day of the symposium (Aug 23).  At the WETPOL website, www.wetpol.org, the scientific program and book of abstracts is available for download, in addition to many of the oral presentations that the authors agreed to make available after the conference.  A special issue in the journal Science of the Total Environment including peer-reviewed papers from the WETPOL presentations is forthcoming in 2018.
