<AbstractNarration>Many environmental issues are highly politicized. Invasive species impacts are an example of an environmental problem that has not become politicized. Invasive species are also one of the most important drivers of declines in global biodiversity, estimated to cost $120 billion annually in management and mitigation costs in the US, making this a salient and important issue for land and wildlife managers. Invasive species management can be particularly difficult because the public perception of risks associated with management can influence the success or failure of that action. Despite this, little is known about how to frame the management of invasive species in a way that facilitates public support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prospect theory suggests that the public will respond more strongly to frames that communicate losses than gains. Because invasive species policy is as yet not politicized, it provides a useful test of prospect theory in the environmental arena where costs are often concentrated and benefits. By testing prospect theory across a range of species, this research can evaluate how individuals perceive risk and salience of species identity in determining the perceived need for management. This response to messaging frames may be further modulated by the perception of a species, which can, in turn, influence the success or failure of the implementation of management strategies. By accounting for species identity in our analysis of messaging frames, we can identify how species identity interacts with messaging frames to shape policy outcomes. This project helps to unite the fields of social ecology and public policy by providing novel research to understand the role of framing in the public's perception of risk associated with environmental management. We expect that mammals and other "cute" species will reduce support for management, making messaging frames more relevant to support outcomes. In contrast, we expect that messaging frames related to species that are traditionally thought of as undesirable (e.g. reptiles or amphibians) will be less relevant in determining public support. Broadly, this project can inform managers about how to frame and message about invasive species to increase public support for management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Invasive species are an enduring problem globally; they are one of the biggest threats to biodiversity and have significant economic impacts. Invasive wildlife can lead to dangerous or costly interactions between the public and wildlife. Policies put in place to manage these interactions can be important tools for reducing risk. However, public support for such environmental policies can determine which get adopted and how quickly they are rolled out, thereby determining their effectiveness. In particular, policies focused on culling or limiting populations can be particularly unpalatable to the public and difficult to adopt. As a result, understanding ways to increase support for such policies is important for managers implementing them. Here we test how support for invasive species management varies depending on what the message conveys about how the species was introduced. These different messages represent varying levels of responsibility that humans have for the presence of an invasive species in California. We show that message frames that attribute responsibility for invasive species presence to humans result in the highest levels of support for eradication programs. Meanwhile, frames that attribute responsibility to climate change have the lowest levels of support, for both non-environmentalists and environmentalists. These findings suggest that climate change-driven shifts in invasive species distributions may not serve as a compelling case to justify eradication programs. Where appropriate, human responsibility for introduction of invasive species should instead be highlighted to increase public support.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/11/2020<br>      Modified by: Elizabeth&nbsp;Hiroyasu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
