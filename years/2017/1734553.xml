<AbstractNarration>This award would support the continued operations of the Na wind-temperature lidar at Andes Lidar Observatory (ALO) in Cerro Pach√≥n, Chile (30.26S, 70.74W, elev. 2530 m) to study the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) dynamics and ion-neutral coupling processes. The lidar at ALO is a state-of-the-art Na resonance-fluorescence Doppler lidar, capable of measuring 3D wind, neutral temperature and Na density profiles at high vertical (500 m) and temporal (1 min) resolutions in the 80-105 km altitude range with high accuracy. Two key advancements of ALO lidar capabilities featuring the extension of lidar observing profile into the lower thermosphere, with wind and temperature measurements up to 140 km altitude, and the ability to detect turbulence scale perturbations in temperature and wind would enable investigations focused on scientific topics that are at the forefront of MLT science. The physical processes that define the dynamics, structure, and variability in the MLT also operate throughout the atmosphere and in all stratified and sheared geophysical fluids, e.g., oceans, lakes, other planetary atmospheres and stellar interiors. This project would provide opportunities for a postdoc researcher, graduate and undergraduate students to participate in the science, engineering and observations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data acquired with the Na lidar at ALO will serve a broad community interested in research from the lower atmosphere to the upper thermosphere. Possible science goals that would be studied through the application of the measurements collected are: determination of turbulence fluxes and eddy diffusion coefficients of heat and momentum and the Prandtl number; investigation of the vertical transport of heat and energy caused by dissipating gravity waves at various scales,quantification of the interactions among gravity waves, tides, and planetary waves at different seasons;analysis and modeling of gravity wave evolution process through variable background atmosphere; and understanding the ion-neutral coupling processes underlying the formation of thermospheric Na layers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This one-year project supports the analysis of data acquired by a Na lidar at the Andes Lidar Observatory (ALO) in Cerro Pach&oacute;n, Chile, to determine the vertical heat and energy transports by atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) in the upper mesosphere (80-100 km altitude range).   AGWs are known to have large impacts to the atmosphere in this region because they can excerpt large force to the atmosphere to significantly change the wind through a process called ?momentum transport?.  Such transport is extensively measured and studied.  It is also known theoretically that AGWs can affect the atmospheric temperature through their heat and energy transport.   However, measurements of this transport are rare because simultaneous measurements of high-resolution temperature and vertical wind velocity are difficult to make.      This grant partially supported the Na lidar measurements at ALO during the project period and supported a postdoctoral researcher for the study of heat and energy transport using the ALO measurement.  With the high-quality data measured by the Na lidar at ALO over three years, the magnitude and seasonal variation of this transport are derived.  The result shows that this transport process has large seasonal variations that are strongly associated with waves generated by the high Andes in the lower atmosphere as the wind blows over the high topography that disturbs the air flow.  This shows a close connection of the dynamics between the lower atmosphere and upper atmosphere.  The heat transport is largely downward and causes a strong cooling in the 80-100km altitude region on the order of tens of degrees per day.  A manuscript documenting this result has been submitted to the Journal of Geophysical Research and is currently under revision.  This study provided observational evidence of this transport and will help improving general circulation models.       Last Modified: 08/02/2018       Submitted by: Alan Z Liu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
