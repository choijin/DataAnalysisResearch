<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate how the DNA genome is packaged in the cellular nucleus to create alternate gene configurations that either permit or prevent retrieval and use of the genetic information. Understanding the dynamic nature of such DNA packaging may help explain how organisms successfully coordinate normal growth and development in response to ever-changing environmental signals.  The project will have broad educational impacts by providing research and training opportunities for high school and undergraduate students, many of whom will be from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Histone proteins in nucleosome-associated DNA can be reversibly modified by addition of poly(ADP-ribose), so-called PAR, molecules, leading to alterations in chromatin conformation and changes in gene expression.  Whereas much as been learned about the action and regulation of the enzyme that adds this modification, PAR polymerase (PARP), not much is yet known about the enzyme, PAR glycohydrolase (PARG), that degrades it.  Changes in poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation levels have been attributed to up- and downregulation of PARP activity, with PARG acting constitutively to cleaving PAR at a constant rate. This project challenges that idea and poses the hypothesis that regulation of PARG activity is crucial for tissue- specific and cell cycle-specific differences in poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation rates. Preliminary results suggest that transient phosphorylation of PARG domains may lead to conformational changes in the protein, in turn affecting its activity. Using Drosophila as a model, a combination of in vivo and in vitro studies will be used to detect phosphorylation of the PARG protein and to analyze its nuclear localization and activity.  The results are expected to provide new understanding of the role of PARG in regulating steady-state levels of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and how this poorly studied histone modification controlls cell-cycle-regulated and tissue-specific gene expression.</AbstractNarration>

Two groups of enzymes are directly involved in this process: poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) that assemble poly(ADP-ribose) polymers (pADPrs) and poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolases (PARGs) that degrade them into free ADP-ribose.&nbsp; The use of <em>Drosophila</em> as a model organism has permitted the exhaustive study of PARP regulation since both key proteins are encoded by single genes.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the regulation of glycohydrolase has attracted little attention.&nbsp; PARG protein is phosphorylated in mammals, but the effect of this phosphorylation on PARG activity remains unknown.&nbsp; Furthermore, no PARG phosphorylation sites reported in mammals are conserved in <em>Drosophila</em>.&nbsp; We herein report that <em>Drosophila</em> PARG protein is phosphorylated in two specific domains, ph1 and ph2.&nbsp; Our data suggest that this phosphorylation is CK2-dependent and that it protects PARG protein <em>in vivo</em> against degradation.&nbsp; We found that this phosphorylation is involved in PARG-dependent control of stem cell maintenance, germ-line cell production, and egg-laying regulation in response to nutritional changes.&nbsp; Our data demonstrate that phosphorylation of PARG is involved in developmental control and regulation of longevity.&nbsp; Taken together, these data demonstrate that regulation of PARG protein activity via phosphorylation plays a crucial role in control of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation.</p> <p>In this project, a transcriptomic analysis of <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> third instar larvae was carried out.&nbsp; A total of 602 genes were identified, showing large-scale changes in their expression levels in the absence of PARP-1 <em>in vivo</em>.&nbsp; Among these genes, several functional gene groups were present, including transcription factors and cytochrome family members.&nbsp; The transcription levels of genes from the same functional group were affected by the absence of PARP-1 in a similar manner.&nbsp; In the absence of PARP-1, all misregulated genes coding for transcription factors were downregulated, whereas all genes coding for members of the cytochrome P450 family were upregulated.&nbsp; The cytochrome P450 proteins contain heme as a cofactor and are involved in oxidoreduction.&nbsp; Significant changes were also observed in the expression of several mobile elements in the absence of PARP-1, suggesting that poly(ADP-ribosyla)ating pathway is involved in regulating the expression of mobile elements.</p> <p>In this project, we also demonstrate that multiple functions of PARP-1 are coordinated by interactions among its three domains and different targets.&nbsp; Interaction between the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and damaged DNA leads to a short-term binding and activation of PARP-1.&nbsp; This &ldquo;hit and run&rdquo; action of PARP-1 is sufficient for initiating the DNA repair pathway at a specific locus.&nbsp; Long-term chromatin loosening necessary for sustained transcription activation is performed when the C-terminal WGR domains of PARP-1 are stably bound to histone H4.&nbsp; This long-term activity of PARP-1 results in continuous accumulation of poly(ADP-ribose) which maintains chromatin in its decondensed state, providing continuous access to DNA for transcription machinery.&nbsp; We found that C-terminal domains WGR and CAT are responsible for specific histone-dependent PARP-1 localization in promoters of multiple genes and for histone-dependent PARP-1 activation during transcription regulation.&nbsp; Although C-terminal domains are necessary and sufficient for histone-dependent PARP-1 regulation, N-terminal DNA-binding Zn-fingers I and II, previously reported only as sensors of broken DNA, also perform essential functions during PARP-1-dependent chromatin regulation.&nbsp; Our data demonstrate that DNA-binding Zn-fingers are responsible for nonspecific PARP-1 binding in chromatin, which is required for browsing of chromatin for binding sites, thus facilitating proper localization of PARP-1 and its replacement at specific sites after its activation and automodification.&nbsp; Cooperation between DBD and CAT binding occurs in response to heat shock, allowing PARP-1 to scan chromatin for specific binding sites.</p> <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Broader Impacts:</span></em> Our project provided substantial training opportunities for high school and undergraduate students in my lab.&nbsp;
