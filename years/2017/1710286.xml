<AbstractNarration>The Advanced LIGO detectors have achieved the long-sought goal of directly detecting gravitational waves, in line with a century-old prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity. The dramatic detection of the first few signals in late 2015 also opened our ears to the existence of black holes with up to about 36 times the mass of our sun, in binary orbits close enough to merge with a huge release of energy in the form of gravitational waves. However, this has only scratched the surface of what gravitational-wave signals may be out there and what we can learn from them. The research supported by this award will take full advantage of the new capabilities as the Advanced LIGO detectors improve and are joined by similar facilities in Italy, Japan and eventually India. The goal is to enhance communication and cooperation with the broader astronomy community so that the astronomical community can use all the modern tools of astronomy, from optical and radio telescopes on the ground to X-ray and gamma-ray detectors on spacecraft, to find and study the sources of LIGO's gravitational-wave signals through the electromagnetic energy and/or neutrinos that they may also emit. Specifically, this effort will help to improve the analysis software and procedures to select promising events more rapidly and reliably, with better monitoring, and to produce prompt public alerts for strong, clear events. This group will collaborate on searches for gamma-ray, X-ray and radio bursts matching up with gravitational-wave events, as well as explore how best to use the growing network of gravitational-wave detectors to search for "scalar" gravitational-wave bursts, which would be a distinctive sign that Einstein's theory is not the whole story about gravity. Finally, the PI will share his expertise and develop fun and educational hands-on activities for children and their parents to learn about science through a Family Discovery Days outreach program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LIGO-Virgo "EM follow-up program" has enlisted over 90 partner groups who have shown a strong response to the gravitational-wave events and candidates shared with them so far, but several technical aspects of the program need improvement. Building on this group's experience with the current event selection and alert generation software and procedures, the PI will help re-implement the system to be faster, more robust, easier to monitor, and ready to generate both public and private alerts during the future observing runs of the advanced gravitational-wave detector network. This group is currently discussing with LIGO and Virgo collaborators how best to manage the system design, software development and testing which will be needed. In parallel, they are working with the Fermi mission science team and LWA radio observatory users to search for gamma-ray bursts and radio transients that may be the counterparts of gravitational-wave signals, in both triggered and un-triggered search modes. According to various models, binary mergers involving at least one neutron star are likely to produce emissions across the electromagnetic spectrum, although they may be challenging to detect and to definitively identify as the counterpart. It remains an open question whether binary black hole mergers, like the events detected by LIGO so far, produce detectable emissions. To test whether general relativity (GR) is the correct theory of gravity, the PI will use a modified version of the WaveBurst algorithm to search for gravitational-wave bursts with a scalar strain polarization, distinct from the tensor polarization states which are the hallmark of GR. The group will investigate both all-sky and position-constrained (when a possible counterpart has been identified) searches; the latter can also enable a test of whether the waves travel at the speed of light (as predicted by GR) or not.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Gravitational waves are now providing the scientific community with new ways to study fundamental physics and the ways it has populated our universe with black holes and neutron stars.  NSF's Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detected gravitational waves directly for the first time in 2015, from a pair of black holes merging, confirming the prediction of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity ("GR") that gravitational waves should exist.  LIGO and its sister project in Europe, Virgo, completed the second "Advanced" observing run in 2017 and carried out a third Advanced observing run, called O3, in 2019-2020.  At this time that the funding of this award began, four gravitational-wave events had been confirmed and published, and a handful of others had been identified in LIGO and Virgo data that was still being analyzed.  This award helped to facilitate the full analysis and publication of those events plus many more binary mergers from the O3 run, as well as searches for other types of gravitational-wave signals, including cosmic strings.  The number of catalogued gravitational-wave event signals from binary mergers now stands at 50, with more from the O3 run presently under analysis.  This has transformed our observational knowledge about the population and evolution of massive stars in the universe, since neutron stars and black holes (astrophysical "compact objects") are both remnants of massive stars which have burned up their nuclear fuel and collapsed.  Also, by systematically comparing the waveform emitted as a pair of compact objects spirals toegether and mergers, we have been able to test whether Einstein's GR accurately describes the gravitational interaction in a compact binary system. So far, it passes all tests!  One of the most exciting prospects is to use gravitational-wave observations together with other astronomical observations.  LIGO and Virgo detected a merger of two neutron stars for the first time in August 2017 that also produced a gamma-ray burst and emissions across the entire electromagnetic (EM) spectrum.  That spectacular event, named GW170817, was a triumph of multi-messenger astronomy and set high expectations for further events.  Although no similar multi-messenger event was recorded during the O3 run, this award supported the sharing of "alerts" to astronomers to enable robust follow-up observations, and also improvements to the software to enable better rapid searches in the future.  This award has also supported a effort to link gravitational-wave events with weak gamma-ray bursts recorded by NASA satellites but not independently identified.  Among the broader impacts fostered by this award, three graduate students received support and scientific training from this award and also contributed to outreach to non-scientists at numerous events.  In addition, a portion of award funds were used to fund science literacy and experience programs at the University of Maryland for elementary and middle-school students.  As Data Analysis / Observational Science Coordinator for the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the PI (Shawhan) helped to shepherd over 60 collaboration papers to publication during the period of this award.  Most of these papers also have accompanying summaries for non-scientists posted on the ligo.org web site, and many also have publicly available data products.  The attached images are screen shots showing the web addresses of these resources for the public.       Last Modified: 02/28/2021       Submitted by: Peter S Shawhan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
