<AbstractNarration>The idea of sharing resources between institutions is not new and has been relatively successful in a few instances and largely unsuccessful in many cases. This proposal elaborates a plan to construct the Campus Compute Cooperative (CCC), a shared cyberinfrastructure as well as a social fabric; both computational resources and support staff expertise will be pooled and shared. The CCC will: i) connect and federate campus physical infrastructures; ii) use market-based mechanisms for resource allocation and quality of service to avoid the tragedy of the commons; iii) leverage InCommon and local identity management systems to provide integrated cross-institution authentication and access control of resources; iv) facilitate secure data and storage sharing between institutions and research labs; v) offer "cloud bursting" to member institutions; and, vi) provide paid-for, differentiated quality of service. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of on-demand, pay-per-use (cloud) resources on society has been huge. Making the most of limited resources is critical to the success of the nation's research enterprise. By rationally and securely sharing the limited computational and human resources available for research the CCC will both accelerate discovery and provide a research cyberinfrastructure with better cost/benefit.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The planning grant funded the development of a plan to construct the Campus Compute Cooperative (CCC), a shared cyber infrastructure as well as a social fabric; both computational resources and support staff expertise will be pooled and shared. The CCC will: i) connect and federate campus physical infrastructures;  ii) use market-based mechanisms for resource allocation and quality of service to avoid the tragedy of the commons; iii) leverage InCommon and local identity management systems to provide integrated cross-institution authentication and access control of resources;  iv) facilitate secure data and storage sharing between institutions and research labs;  v) offer "cloud bursting" to member institutions; and, vi) provide paid-for, differentiated quality of service. The specific planning grant objectives were to: 1)      Recruit and build the CCC team.  The team will consist of several different stakeholder classes: the technical leads represented by Grimshaw and Jha along others identified during the planning grant; the institutional research managers represented by Research Provosts and CIOs, the local research computing support organizations represented by Stewart and Knepper as well as others drawn from the XSEDE campus champions program; and science users drawn from disciplines both in traditional HPC such as physics, chemistry, and biology as well as new-to-HPC disciplines such as economics, psychology, and business. 2)      Develop a memorandum of understanding that will govern membership in the CCC and detail the roles and responsibilities of members, the economic model, and scheme for clearing persistent deficits and surpluses. The MOU will be constructed  working with institutional security/risk management officers and CIOs to ensure that the MOU will pass institutional scrutiny. 3)      Identify science cases and representative users. We have already identified a number of early science cases that are operating on the CCC today.  These include machine learning, 3D molecular modeling, bioinformatics, astro-chemistry, and radio astronomy. We will expand this set to include both additional traditional users as well as users from new communities such as  the social sciences. 4)      Recruitment of community data set holders. There are a number of community data sets that can be easily mapped into the data sharing aspects Determine what open data sets from which communities will be initially available.  With respective to these objects we were successful in the first three goals. A full proposal was submitted to the NSF on December 19, 2018.
