<AbstractNarration>The award will provide funding in support of participation by U.S. graduate students and post-doctoral researchers at the 2017 Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) and Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Chemical Reactions at Surfaces to be held back-to-back in Lucca (Barga), Italy, February 4-10, 2017. The conference and seminar will expose a new generation of scientists and engineers to the latest international advances in the area of surface science and engineering as applied to some of the world's most pressing technological challenges.  International exchanges of this type are essential for ensuring that U.S. scientists and engineers maintain leadership in areas of critical importance to the environment, sustainability, and manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GRC on Chemical Reactions at surfaces is the preeminent international meeting in the field of surface chemistry and related catalysis. Together with the GRS, it will bring together an interdisciplinary group of students and young researchers from chemistry, physics, chemical engineering and materials science. They will have an opportunity to present their work in the form of oral presentations or posters while interacting with some of the most eminent researchers in the field. The GRS and GRC will address fundamental aspects of surface chemical reactions, which are related to the grand environmental and sustainability challenges facing mankind. These include environmental interfaces, solar energy conversion to chemical energy, and capture and storage of CO2. Specific emphasis will be given to defining the next generation challenges in surface chemistry and surface science. Participation by young researchers will add significant value to this conference and will foster communications among current and future leaders in a field that combines academic and industrial issues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2017 GRC n Chemical Reactions at Surfaces was held in Il Ciocco, Italy from February 5-10, 2017.  The conference convened an interdisciplinary group of world-recognized experts and young researchers from chemistry, physics, chemical engineering and materials science to address and discuss fundamental aspects of chemical reactions on surfaces, relevant to the grand challenges facing mankind.  These topics included:  environmental interfaces, solar energy conversion, chemical energy storage, catalysis and many others.  Specific emphasis was given to delineating the status quo and defining some of the current challenges in areas such as solid-liquid interfaces, new experimental and theoretical methods, electron and photon induced surface reactions, chirality and enantioselectivity, chemistry on nanoparticles, and surfaces of novel materials.  Immediately prior to the GRC there was a Gordon Research Seminar held at the same location for young scientists in order to give younger participants an opportunity to network with one another and to become acquainted with the style and content of the subsequent GRC.  The focus of the Gordon Research Seminar on Chemical Reactions at Surfaces was on both computational and experimental methods addressing relevant problems involving chemical reactions at surfaces.  This included fundamental and applied studies investigating heterogeneous catalysis, interfaces relevant for environmental applications, interfaces in biotechnology, and energy-related technologies such as solar energy conversion, CO2 capture, or hydrogen production and storage.  The seminar took off with a keynote lecture by Prof. Gabor A. Somorjai (U. California, Berkeley), followed by three sessions spanning an assorted range of surface science methods and applications and devoted to oral research presentations by attendees.  The two poster sessions allowed the participants to exchange ideas about their research.          Last Modified: 07/24/2017       Submitted by: Andrew J Gellman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
