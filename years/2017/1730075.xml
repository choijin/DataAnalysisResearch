<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks funding for partial support (including participant travel and subsistence) of the UN/US workshop on the International Space Weather Initiative (ISWI). The ISWI program fosters international cooperation on space weather research, education and applications. The workshop informs an international community of scientists and students of the latest advances in space weather research, and provides a forum data sharing and forging new collaborations and educational initiatives. The outcome of the workshop will be disseminated to the UN General Assembly as part of a report by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.  This proposal will provide an opportunity to foster international scientific collaboration and outreach on space weather research and education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported the UN/US Workshop on the International Space Weather Initiative: The Decade after the International Heliophysical Year 2007.  This workshop marked the 10th anniversary of the International Heliophysical Year, which led to the genesis of the International Space Weather Initiative. It was organized in the framework of the Basic Space Science Initiative (BSSI) of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications to highlight the achievements made over the past ten years and to show-case the worldwide development of science, capacity building, and outreach. The UN Workshops on ISWI have been aimed at providing a global forum for space weather experts from developed and developing countries, including representatives of the major instrument operators and data providers. In particular, the Workshop focused on recent advances made in scientific research by utilizing ISWI instrument data in conjunction with space mission data in adding significant new knowledge on space weather phenomena near Earth and interplanetary space.    Some of the most significant results of the workshop were the observations and recommendations made by the workshop participants as they recognized space weather as a global challenge.  Their remarks include determining that space weather is increasingly becoming a central topic that requires improved and sustained international coordination to respond to severe space weather events.  There is also a need for more advanced space weather models and forecast tools in support of user requirements, and for the coordinated sharing and dissemination of space weather model outputs and forecasts.   Other observations and recommendations included:  1) recognition that there is an important role for international coordination for responses to severe space weather events and mitigation of their impacts.    2) it is important to raise awareness among policymakers on the potential impact of severe space weather  3) efforts should be made to improve ground- and space-based observation infrastructure for both research and operations  4) it is also important to support an open data-sharing policy and real-time data accessibility for all nations  5) to consider increased coordination on space weather forecasting services  6) to advocate for new scientific research particularly with the goal to improve modeling capability  7) to maintain and renew focus on research-to-operations and operations-to-research for improved space weather services  8) to initiate and collaborate on socio-economic impact studies for space weather, taking into account that different nations have different space weather vulnerability and needs, but also recognizing that all nations are vulnerable to impacts on technological systems and the global economy  These observations and recommendation were quite important and a unique result of the workshop.  Although there are a number of other space weather meetings held annually around the world, the ISWI workshop is one that focuses on the status and benefits of ground-based and space based space weather instruments, data access, availability, collection and modeling efforts to advance space weather research and to improve space weather forecasting.  This combined with the high-level international forum on the economic and societal effects of extreme space weather and the preparations for UNISPACE+50 made this workshop one that can facilitate the development of a coherent international policy towards an appropriate response to space weather.
