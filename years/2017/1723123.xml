<AbstractNarration>This project will support the development of an innovative strategic plan to broaden the user base, develop new capabilities, and help Flax Pond Marine Laboratory remain an epicenter for cutting edge global change research. Flax Pond Marine Laboratory (FPML - http://www.somas.stonybrook.edu/about/facilities/flax-pond-marine-laboratory/), operated by Stony Brook University, is located on a quiet salt marsh nestled within one of the few forested areas in the New York City metropolitan area. Unlike many marine laboratories that have remote locations, FPML is 50 miles from New York City on Long Island, NY, the home of nearly 8 million people and the most densely populated area in the US with over 2,151 people /km2. Over 40 state and private colleges and universities are within 60 miles of FPML and since its establishment in 1969, many colleges, state and federal agencies, high schools and non-profit environmental organizations have used and continue to rely on this facility. As scientific research priorities evolve, so too must the facilities needed to answer these complex questions. Modernizing accessible scientific facilities like FPML are critical to address the most important research priorities while at the same time meet the needs of a diverse group of users.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Present and future users of FPML have identified facilities improvements that would modernize FPML, but there is no community consensus on which improvements should have priority, and how such improvements will help FPML users achieve short-term and long-term goals. A strategic plan for Flax Pond is critical to develop transformative multidisciplinary research and facilitate collaborations that will take best advantage of local research and training talent and interests. To devise an effective strategic plan this project will identify and prioritize needs of FPML users regionally and nationwide through a series of workshops and surveys. Site visits to other marine labs throughout the country will also be used to inform a 10-year strategic plan to upgrade facilities at Flax Pond.</AbstractNarration>
