<AbstractNarration>This award will support early career scientists participating in the 12th Electromagnetic Interactions with Nucleons and Nuclei Conference (EINN2017), which is an international meeting focusing on forefront experimental and theoretical topics in nuclear and hadron physics.  The conference is designed to encourage informal and explorative discussion.  The conference will provide valuable opportunities for early career scientists to present their own research and to interact with leaders in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The conference on "Electromagnetic Interactions with Nucleons and Nuclei (EINN)" has been successfully organized biennially since 1995 on the Santorini and Milos Islands in Greece, and on Cyprus at Paphos since 2011. The series covers experimental and theoretical topics in the areas of nuclear and hadronic physics and is considered a European counterpart of the Photo-Nuclear Gordon Conference.   The 12th EINN conference (https://einnconference.org/2017/) took place in Paphos, Cyprus on Oct. 29-Nov. 4, 2017 and attracted 84 participants from 39 institutes located in 15 countries in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia. The conference was dedicated to the memory of Dr. Kees de Jager, the first conference chair in 1995, who passed away in 2016.  The conference covered a wide range of theoretical and experimental  developments in hadron physics (see program at http://einnconference.org/2017/) including: contributions beyond  single-photon exchange, the proton radius puzzle, new experimental  facilities, dark matter searches, neutrino physics, lattice QCD,  spectroscopy, spin structure of the proton, precision electroweak  physics and new physics searches.  With the study of QCD being a major  focus of present activities and future plans in physics research  worldwide, the EINN conference will continue to provide an important  international forum, particularly for young physicists, for the  foreseeable future.  Since 2011, the conference program included dedicated sessions for postdoctoral fellows and advanced graduate students, who receive financial support. The 2017 EINN conference again added a two-day, pre-conference event on Frontiers and Careers in Photonuclear Physics &ndash; skill development and talks for students, which was very-well received by the students.
