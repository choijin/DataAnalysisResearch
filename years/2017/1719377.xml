<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program provides support projects to design, implement, and assess strategies that can lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. The project at Alabama State University seeks to strengthen the research, recruitment and retention activities in STEM disciplines with emphasis in the areas of bioengineering and nanobiotechnology. The overall goal is to significantly increase the preparedness of underrepresented minority students at the University choosing career paths in STEM majors, graduate programs, and workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities that are part of this project are: academic year, as well as summer undergraduate research experiences to include international research experiences; opportunities for high school students to conduct research in the summer; faculty and student development activities such as seminars, instrumentation workshops, and workshops on innovative teaching practices; presentations at scientific conferences; and activities to assist students in the transition to graduate school.  The activities and strategies are evidence-based and what is learned through this project can serve as a model for other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of the HBCU-UP implementation project "Initiative in NanoBioengineering Undergraduate Research and Education for Minority Students (INBUREM)" at ASU were inter-disciplinary and engaged faculty and students in all STEM disciplines/departments. The HBCU-UP program was instrumental in enhancement and addition of STEM courses, providing `hands-on experience'' to students in bioengineering, nanotechnology, and biomedical sciences and other enrichment activities to increase students? knowledge base and gain experience in emerging research technologies. Through the HBCU-UP program, a rigorous undergraduate research, training and development program have been established. These programs are making a significant impact on undergraduate education and student preparation. Students are now exposed to various high-end research as well as enhanced STEM curricula.  The HBCU-UP program had set five major objectives: 1) reforming STEM curricula; 2) providing research experience to undergraduates through academic and summer research opportunities at major institutions, private companies, international institutions and federal laboratories; 3) engaging faculty in research and professional development; 4) infusing technology in educational and research programs; and 5) enhancing recruitment, retention and transition of STEM students through high school to graduate school.  The direct impact of HBCU-UP program is credited with preparing ASU undergraduate students with advanced knowledge in STEM disciplines paving the way for a robust and diverse STEM workforce that is critically needed in the US.
