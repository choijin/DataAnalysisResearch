<AbstractNarration>Critical to the health and resiliency of the Internet is the underlying security of the systems that make our online world a reality.  By bringing together leaders in cyber security, including leading-edge security researchers and implementers, globally recognized security-technology experts, and users from both the private and public sectors, the Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium fosters information exchange among researchers and practitioners of network and distributed system security. The target audience (usually around 300 people) includes those interested in practical aspects of network and distributed system security, with a focus on system design and practical implementation.   The February 2017 conference in San Diego will be the 24th NDSS symposia, demonstrating its longevity and its importance as the leading conference in network and distributed system security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students often have limited sources of funds for travel to conferences and limited opportunities to interact with in-the-field practitioners. NSF financial support will assist nineteen (19) US-based graduate and undergraduate students so that they may attend this meeting. Each travel grant is intended to cover conference registration, lodging during the conference, and as much as possible of the student?s travel (e.g., economy airfare). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participation in symposia like the NDSS is a critical part of the students' educational experiences, providing them the opportunity to interact with senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work in the field. Regardless of the field, investing in the development of human capital is crucial for the future.  Supporting and nurturing the next generation of network security experts, providing them with an opportunity to learn from and engage with established experts benefits the entire community.  Each provides the other with lessons learned, fresh ideas, and infuses a spirit of collaboration among a rather small sub-section of the technical space.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project aimed to assist nineteen (19) US-based graduate and undergraduate students to attend the Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium (https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2017/)  held in San Diego, CA on February 26 &ndash; March 1, 2017. It is an annual, three-day conference hosted by Internet Society (ISOC) that brings together innovative and forward-thinking members of the Internet community who research, design, develop, and deploy the technologies that define network and distributed system security. Participation in symposia like the NDSS is a critical part of these students? educational experiences, providing them the opportunity to interact with senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work in the field.  The National Science Foundation?s support enabled the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the NDSS, and also the NDSS and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), two institutions that benefit from a greater cross-pollination and increased academic involvement.   Women and under-represented groups were actively encouraged to apply through established networks of academics and industry leaders. Moreover, outreach was focused on networks of computer scientists who actively mentor under-represented communities in the computer technology sector, including outreach to academic colleagues at institutions where students are less likely to have travel funding available and to make sure their students are aware of this opportunity.  The fellowship committees? decision criteria included:  Evidence of serious interest and aptitude in the security field, as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience; Evidence of community leadership interests and skills, as demonstrated by engagement with the broader community;  Evidence of collaboration and teamwork activities, especially as applied to problems in the security field;  Identified benefit from attendance and participation, particularly how participating in the symposium could shape the student?s future studies and/or research;  Considerations for students from underrepresented communities and first-time attendees; and Proof of enrollment in a security-related program at a college/university located in the USA.    The award achieved its goals by supporting nineteen students, including six women, to attend the 2017 NDSS meeting when they would otherwise be unable to do so.  The selected students represent an infusion of new perspectives to the cybersecurity field, as well as the multiplier effect: taking their NDSS experience and knowledge back to their academic institutions to inspire and motivate others in the field.  Anecdotal evidence provided by each student after the event, in the form of a required Student Survey, was positive although there was consistent feedback on the need to announce student awards earlier in the future.   Support for students? attendance and engagement in the annual event advances ISOC?s mission to prepare the next generation of Internet technical leaders in two complementary ways: First, it equips emerging academic researchers and technologists to address rising challenges facing the Internet, one of the greatest being trust, security and resiliency of the Internet.  Second, as the administrative home of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), ISOC is committed to increasing cross-pollination between the NDSS and the IETF. This has the bidirectional benefit of increasing academic involvement and bringing new ideas and fresh energy to the IETF?s global standard-setting work, while providing focus and timely real-world problems and feedback for academics and researchers.  Regardless of the field, investing in the development of human capital is crucial for the future.  Supporting and nurturing the next generation of network security experts, providing them with an opportunity to learn from and engage with established experts benefits the entire community.  Each provides the other with lessons learned, fresh ideas, and infuses a spirit of collaboration among a rather small sub-section of the technical space.
