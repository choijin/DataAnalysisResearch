<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to advance the understanding of the mechanical behavior of clays as engineering materials.  Clays comprise very fine (&lt; 2 um), electrically charged, chemically active particles whose behavior and assembly are strongly affected by physico-chemical forces operating on individual particles at the smaller (i.e., molecular and interfacial) scales.  Clay minerals of different varieties occur widely in natural geological environments and are generally found in the form of aggregates or clusters whose interactions control the macroscopic engineering properties of clay-rich soils used in the design and construction of infrastructure.  While micromechanics-based experimental and computational research has advanced significantly the understanding of the behavior of sands (particle sizes greater than 75um), the importance of the particulate nature of clays has not been extensively investigated.  This collaborative project aims to develop and validate a new multiscale framework for understanding the macroscopic (i.e., continuum scale) mechanical properties of clays by studying the microscale aggregation of elementary clay particles and the interactions between the resultant clay aggregates. The project will provide the fundamental understanding needed to develop the next generation of constitutive models for mechanical properties of clays that can be used for subsurface engineering, ultimately reducing risks and costs associated with the design of foundations, underground construction and use of geological energy resources (e.g., clay shales, etc.).  The research will impact directly upon the education of future geotechnical engineering and geomechanics students through the creation of online modules related to the small-scale measurement and multiscale modeling of clay behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research work comprises a closely-integrated program of multiscale experimentation, atomistic and coarse-grained multiscale simulations for one common clay mineral, illite.  The research involves the following main tasks: 1) modeling and experimental validation of individual clay aggregate behavior under a range of porewater chemistry conditions; 2) development of new modeling techniques and experimental methods for investigating aggregate-aggregate interactions and fabric (i.e., quantitative measurement of particle orientation and of orientation distribution function); and 3) validation of multiscale model predictions through comparison with macroscopic measurements of clay properties.  Experimental measurements will use existing laboratory facilities at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass) as well as the analytical facilities at the Argonne National Laboratory, while numerical simulations at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) will take advantages of NSF eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) national supercomputing resources.  By developing a framework for understanding particulate-based clay micromechanics, the research aims to provide an innovative multiscale perspective for explaining the underlying basis of continuum-based clay properties such as cohesion and creep, which have to date only been observed phenomenologically via macroscopic approaches.  The long-term goal is to generalize the methodology to enable bottom-up prediction of mechanical properties for complex natural soils that comprise mixtures of different clay minerals with silt- and sand-sized particles as well as varying porewater chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

Other computational objectives consisted of bottom-up computational modeling, including molecular and mesoscale simulations, to determine the potential functions for clay aggregates, which were then used to model inter-aggregate interactions.

For aggregate microstructure, 2DXRD were employed to characterization orientation distributions of clay particles inside individual aggregates. Illite was selected as the model clay mineral extensively studied in this project, due to its abundance in marine environments and chemical properties intermediate between kaolinite and smectites.

This is a unique advancement when compared with conventional macroscale element-based geotechnical testing systems. The developed micromechanical characterization techniques can be easily extended to study other fundamental soil behavior and properties and their underlying microscopic mechanisms, such as attractive forces due to water meniscus (unsaturated), and localized measurements of solid cementation between two particles. A second advancement is the contact mechanics-based analyses of the load-deformation-stress-strain of individual clay aggregates, which led to the determination of elastic modulus and yield strength of individual clay aggregates that experience nonuniform stresses and strains when subject to compression loading. Such an analytical approach was also extended to 2 or 3 aggregate interactions, and could be extended to mesoscale bulk soils consisting of numerous aggregates (investigated by numerical simulations).</p> <p>Understanding of aggregation mechanisms was achieved by studying particle/aggregate size kinetics of flocculated clay suspensions with varied ionic strength, pH, and hydrodynamic shearing. In general, higher salinity combined with a lower pH can result in larger and stronger aggregates, and higher turbulent flow shear stress can further result in mechanical strength improvement of the aggregates. However, higher hydrodynamic shearing can also reduce the size. The entire compression of an aggregate can be divided into 3 different stages: purely elastic, elasto-plastic, and elastic densification stage featuring rapid load increase with relatively smaller deformation.</p> <p>The microstructure of aggregates can vary with the clay mineralogy and the environmental factors such as salinity, pH, and hydrodynamic shearing. Basically two different microstructures were observed: homogeneous microstructure with more or less uniform interparticle pores, and hierarchical structure with a macro-aggregate consisting of multiple micro-aggregates and hence double porosities. Under compression loading, aggregates with these two microstructures exhibit contrasting load-deformation curves: the former usually exhibits a relatively smooth, monotonic curve, while the latter is characterized by multiple serrations, which are characteristic of localized slippage or failure. For clay particle orientation, despite some local preferred orientation of clay particles within the flocculi, globally clay particles inside a macro-aggregate do not exhibit preferred orientation. However, under compression loading, especially in the 3<sup>rd</sup> stage (i.e., elastic densification), highly preferred orientation gradually develops with increasing deformation.</p> <p>Multiple aggregate interactions result in the merging of two adjacent ones. The interaction forces could be then attraction for two partially joined aggregates. As such, adhesive contacts are considered in the interpretation of aggregate-to-aggregate interactions. The elasticity and yielding of aggregates also vary with particle size, and hence can be best described by Weibull distributions.
