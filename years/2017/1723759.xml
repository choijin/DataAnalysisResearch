<AbstractNarration>This Postdoctoral Research Fellowship supports the career development of a recent Ph.D. graduate from the University of California, Berkeley in the field of Linguistics. The research is supervised by two professors from the Center for Language Science at the Pennsylvania State University. This interdisciplinary research project is an important step toward understanding the commonalities and differences between monolingual and multilingual language processing. Bilingualism has historically been treated as its own separate field, but the current study contributes a unique set of data that can be exploited to better understand the cognitive resources that underlie all language processing. A better understanding of bilingual/multilingual linguistic norms is critical for the development of effective teaching curricula and assessments. In addition, the results of this work have the potential to be useful for diagnostic and treatment materials in a clinical setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research incorporates methods from phonetics, corpus linguistics, cognitive psychology, and cognitive neuroscience to better understand the time course of processes underlying speech production and speech perception. The project uses bilingual language processing as a context that can reveal cognitive mechanisms that are otherwise hidden in monolingual speakers. The specific research questions target the interplay between the neural signature of inhibitory processes, as revealed using Event Related Potentials (ERPs), and the behavioral outcome of that inhibition, as revealed in acoustic measures of speech articulation. The studies take advantage of bilinguals' ability to switch languages mid-sentence. The training component of this project is both theoretical and methodological. The project capitalizes on the Fellow's previous training while simultaneously familiarizing her with the theoretical background necessary to conduct research related to the cognitive psychology of bilingualism, and the methodological training necessary to incorporate neurocognitive and eyetracking methods into her future work. The intellectual merit of the proposed research is its ability to tie together findings from traditionally separate approaches to studying language.</AbstractNarration>

we are currently exploring this hypothesis.&nbsp;Second, even if codeswitching is associated with a cognitive cost, we cannot infer the direction of causation: it is possible that the intention to switch languages causes a processing cost, or it is possible that when speech planning becomes more difficult (for incidental, unknown reasons), bilinguals tend to switch languages to relieve the planning difficulty.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second phase of the project, we conducted a controlled speech perception experiment and found that (1) highly proficient bilingual listeners with extensive codeswitching experience were able to detect anticipatory phonetic cues to codeswitching, and (2) the ability to anticipate codeswitches allowed listeners to more effectively inhibit the activation of the non-target language (Figure 3;

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In all bilingual communities that have been studied thus far, switching between languages during conversation is commonplace.  Yet controlled laboratory experiments generally find a "switch cost", i.e., a processing cost for switching languages that can be seen in the time it takes to name pictures, the pronunciation of particular sounds, and in neurocognitive measures such as Event Related Potentials.  This presents a puzzle: If language switching is cognitively costly, why do bilinguals do it with such regularity?  This project compares bilingual language processing in the laboratory with natural, conversational speech to better understand the commonalities and differences between these types of language use.  Is there evidence that switching languages during spontaneous conversation is cognitively costly?  Are there factors that can mitigate the switch costs that have been observed in laboratory settings?              In the first phase of the project, we combined acoustic phonetic analysis and psycholinguistically informed mixed effects statistical modeling to ask whether the acoustic record of bilingual speech could provide any information concerning the time course of cross-language activation or the difficulty of switching languages during natural conversation (Fricke, Kroll, &amp; Dussias, 2016).  In three analyses, we found that (1) bilinguals produced slowed speech rate immediately before switching languages (Figure 1), (2) the production of English consonants became more Spanish-like (i.e. voiceless stops had lower voice onset times) leading up to a codeswitch, but not following one (Figure 2), and (3) bilinguals were more likely to produce disfluencies (such as "um") in utterances containing a codeswitch than in matched utterances not containing a codeswitch.              These findings suggest that increases in cross-language activation during spontaneous conversation may incur some cognitive processing cost, but they must be interpreted with caution.  For one, it is possible that speech rate is just one of several prosodic features (such as intonation, placement of pauses, etc.) that changes when bilinguals codeswitch; we are currently exploring this hypothesis. Second, even if codeswitching is associated with a cognitive cost, we cannot infer the direction of causation: it is possible that the intention to switch languages causes a processing cost, or it is possible that when speech planning becomes more difficult (for incidental, unknown reasons), bilinguals tend to switch languages to relieve the planning difficulty.              In the second phase of the project, we conducted a controlled speech perception experiment and found that (1) highly proficient bilingual listeners with extensive codeswitching experience were able to detect anticipatory phonetic cues to codeswitching, and (2) the ability to anticipate codeswitches allowed listeners to more effectively inhibit the activation of the non-target language (Figure 3; Fricke, Kroll, &amp; Dussias, 2016). This indicates that sensitivity to accentedness during spontaneous conversation could help mitigate any processing costs associated with understanding codeswitched speech.              In the third phase of the project, we conducted further corpus analyses to better understand the psycholinguistic factors that promote spontaneous codeswitching (Fricke &amp; Kootstra, 2016).  One of the key findings was that codeswitching can be primed; put simply, codeswitches tend to follow other codeswitches (Figure 4).  While this pattern can be partially accounted for by lexical overlap (e.g. "Se ponen peluca para Saint Patrick," followed by "She got a green peluca", where the codeswitch can be attributed to the repetition of the Spanish word peluca), even when we statistically controlled for lexical overlap, there was still significant priming.  This begins to answer the question of why bilinguals switch languages during conversation: during stretches of increased cross-language activation, it is likely easier to switch languages than to not switch languages.              In the final phase of the project, we conducted two follow-up experiments: (1) an accented spoken word recognition task that builds on our earlier perception study to clarify which cognitive attributes allow bilinguals to use accentedness to their advantage during speech perception, and (2) a picture naming task that will illuminate the factors that impact cross-language activation during cued language switching. Data collection for these experiments is complete and we are currently conducting the analyses.              In summary, the project's primary intellectual merit is that it furthers the scientific study of codeswitching by combining methodological approaches in a novel way, bringing new data to bear on the question of how bilinguals' language experience affects their linguistic processing.  Careful, statistically and psycholinguistically informed analysis of spontaneous language use is crucial for understanding how speakers use and process language in their everyday lives, but because corpus analyses necessarily only yield correlational data, they must be combined with controlled laboratory experimentation to infer causation, as we have done.  The project's broader impact is that it takes an important step toward understanding bilingual linguistic norms, which is critical for the development of effective teaching curricula and assessments in an educational setting, and of diagnostic and treatment materials in a clinical setting.
