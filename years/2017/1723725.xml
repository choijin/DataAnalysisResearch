<AbstractNarration>Cybersecurity education is critical for the development of future cybersecurity professionals, and for protecting IT assets. The advent of new network technologies such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has resulted in a high degree of flexibility in network infrastructure, but at the same time brought new security challenges. Although current research efforts have prompted positive progress in addressing security challenges and opportunities in SDN and NFV, the latest results appear in few educational materials targeting SDN and NFV security. With emerging SDN and NFV technologies, there is a need for education to keep pace. This project from the San Jose State University Foundation aims to develop effective educational materials on SDN and NFV security for preparing students to protect the emerging SDN/NFV-based network infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance the knowledge of cybersecurity education by creating hands-on labs and curriculum on SDN/NFV. The course materials, along with nine hands-on labs, will aim to increase the educational resources for cybersecurity, particularly for security in new networking technologies. Further, this project will advance the usability and effectiveness of using a cloud-based open laboratory to support hands-on labs on SDN/NFV security. The knowledge generated from this project can be applied to transitioning research in security to teaching materials, and integrating into computing curricula, as well as building faculty capacity in security education. In addition, the joint effort in this collaborative project will improve the partnership among three institutions to collaboratively improve cybersecurity education.</AbstractNarration>
