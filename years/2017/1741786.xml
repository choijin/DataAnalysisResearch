<AbstractNarration>This four-year mixed methods research project is investigating whether, how, and why need-based financial aid affects the behavior and success of undergraduate students in STEM programs.  The primary goal of the study is to estimate the causal effects of financial aid on choice of and success in a STEM program or major.  The project tracks and compares 1,800 low-income students (900 students randomly selected to receive additional financial support with 900 students with similar economic backgrounds who do not receive additional support).  The randomized control study tests three hypotheses associated with the assumption that financial aid assists in student degree completion.  Hypothesis One:  Additional financial aid will reduce the number of hours spent working and the number of students working more than 20 hours per week will decline.  Hypothesis Two:  An increase in financial aid will stimulate an improvement of the quality of study time and that this will lead recipients to attempt more credits in STEM and achieve higher grades.  Hypothesis Three: Additional funding will permit recipients to increase their participation in STEM enrichment activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The Price of STEM Success: Explaining the Impact of Need-Based Financial Aid on STEM Student Behavior Dr. Sara Goldrick-Rab Project Outcomes Report     Many students from low and moderate-income families start college with an interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields; however only a small fraction of those students complete a STEM degree. Can additional need-based financial aid improve those outcomes?     This project utilized a rigorous and uncommonly-used research design?a randomized controlled trial?to examine these important questions.  Specifically, we tested whether a need-based financial grant in the amount of $1,000 per year could increase the odds that low and moderate-income students would select a STEM program, persist, and successfully complete associate and baccalaureate degrees in three broad types of STEM fields.  In order to do this, we created, ran, and evaluated a grant program for four years, using a lottery to distribute a supplemental grant to 1,000 undergraduate students attending ten Wisconsin colleges and universities. All of the students completed the federal financial aid application (FAFSA) and had an ?expected family contribution? of within 200% of the threshold for Pell Grant eligibility.  The grant was distributed strictly based on financial need, did not include academic requirements or messaging about the importance of STEM, and continued receipt of the grant did not require participation in STEM coursework.     We find that the financial grant increased STEM participation and retention among low and moderate-income students over the three-year period for which data are now available. Three years after starting college, 48.2% of students offered the financial grant had ever pursued a STEM major, compared to 38.7% of students not offered the grant (p=.003).  Moreover, persistence rates in STEM were also higher?during year three 38.7% of students offered the grant were still in STEM, compared to 32.6% of students not offered the grant (p=.052).  These effects were more pronounced in the agricultural and biological sciences, and in the health and psychology fields, compared to science and engineering.     Most need-based grants are targeted to low-income, Pell-eligible students and to those with the highest standardized test scores. This project examined whether moderate-income students (those above the Pell cutoff but within 200% of the Pell threshold) and students with more modest test scores also benefit from grants.
