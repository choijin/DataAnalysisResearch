<AbstractNarration>This study will enable the mobility of vapor bubbles in the absence of gravity-driven buoyancy from surfaces experiencing boiling.  The research team will fly a slightly modified version of a flight hardware package called the Pore Formation and Mobility Investigation (PFMI) furnace aboard the International Space Station (ISS).  The inability of vapor bubbles to detach from a surface has long impeded the implementation of efficient phase-change heat dissipation from electronics components in space.  The research team's efforts are based on a novel asymmetric surface micro-structure that produces movement of vapor bubbles without the use of externally applied forces.  The textured surfaces are in the form of repeating millimetric-scale asymmetric ratchets with 30-60 degree faces. The hypothesis to be tested is that such structured surfaces provide mobility to vapor mass in boiling for electronics thermal management under adverse terrestrial orientations and microgravity environments, thereby mitigating premature burnout. The potential to affect passive motion of vapor bubbles in variable gravity environments, as well as in adversely oriented heated surfaces could have far reaching benefits. The long-term goal is to develop a simple, passive, self-regulating micro-structured surface technology for heat sinks used in consumer electronics and aircraft electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ISS experiment design, development, and implementation will be pursued in conjunction with CASIS implementation partner TBE, leveraging the aerospace contractor's extensive flight experiment expertise.  The specific objectives are three-fold: to verify lateral bubble motion observed in microgravity flight experiments aboard the ISS lab, to perform ground-based experiments and analysis to validate/ refine an analytical model, and to explore terrestrial applications. Sealed square cross-sectioned ampoules inserted into the PFMI will be reconfigured to accommodate a planar heated ratcheted surface. The ampoule design will be guided by terrestrial experiments in a modified open-ended channel facility.  High-speed visualization and sensor measurements in ISS and terrestrial environments will be generated as a part of the project. These data can be used by computational experts in the heat transfer community as validation cases for numerical simulations of boiling.  The data and video images obtained from ISS and terrestrial experiments will be disseminated on NASA's Physical Science Informatics (PSI) data repository for experiments performed on the ISS. Apart from providing an avenue for graduate student mentoring, the project will enable the participation of under-represented undergraduate students through the McNair scholar program at UCD and the Alabama Space Grant program at Auburn.</AbstractNarration>
