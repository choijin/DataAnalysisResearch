<AbstractNarration>Despite its long and successful history in academic research, approximate computing has not become mainstream in commercial products. This award supports the organization of a workshop to bring together researchers and practitioners to brainstorm ideas for bridging the gap between the state-of-the-art research on approximate query processing and real-world use-cases for data science and cluster computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organization of this workshop has broader impacts on the related scientific research communities and the society at large.  In the short term, this mutually-informative interaction will help academic research align its focus with real-world challenges, and will help practitioners learn about new opportunities made possible by approximate computing. In the long term, this workshop will also foster future collaborations and real-world adoptions.</AbstractNarration>
