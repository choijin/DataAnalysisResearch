<AbstractNarration>A wealth of information is being created at an increasingly fast rate from social media sources such as Twitter. Many researchers need text analytics on social media data to obtain domain-specific insights, by doing various computational tasks such as keyword search, regular expression, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis. A main challenge is their lack of IT background, making it hard for them to conduct research efficiently. In addition, very often they need to use machine learning models to do deep analysis, and the data-preparation process for generating labeled instances for training models can be time consuming and labor intensive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies how to support text analytics on social media data by users who do not have a strong IT background. It develops an open-source system with the following goals: (1) modularizing common text computation as basic operators; (2) providing a graphic user interface (GUI) for users to form a workflow plan declaratively without writing code; (3) supporting text analytics as a Web-based service; and (4) supporting indexing whenever possible to improve performance. The system has been under development on Github for more than 15 months with more than 30 committers and 21 thousand lines of high-quality source code. An initial prototype is setup and used by Public Health researchers at UC Irvine to analyze Twitter data. The techniques are general-purpose, systems-oriented, and can benefit many other domains as well.</AbstractNarration>

Frontend Improvements: Many advanced features have been developed in the frontend, including:   Significant improvement on the user interface   Support preview minimap   Support zoom in, zoom out, and panning operations   Schema propagation: whenever a new operator or edge is added to the workflow, we can propagate schema information from the source operators to downstream operators   Auto complete for different fields of an operator   Allow users to drag and drop a file to upload data   Show the latest statistics of an operator during the execution of a workflow    3. Backend results:   Studied various frameworks including Storm, Spark, Actor Model etc to choose from and finally chose Actor Model   Got a better understanding of the actor model   Developed an engine using actor model: Akka, Orleans   Ran scale tests on cloud frameworks   Learnt design decisions that contribute to scalability   Learnt the intricacies of working with distributed systems   Developing a debuggable parallel runtime engine called Amber for Texera.   We developed a backend engine called Amber to support debugging during the execution of a workflow task.  After starting the execution, the user can pause the job at will, investigate the states of the cluster, modify the job, and resume the computation.  She can also set conditional breakpoints to pause the execution when certain conditions are satisfied.

Professor Joshua Lawrence, Department of Education, University of Oslo, is collaborating with our team to use Texera to conduct text analytics on academic texts.      Prof. Ju Fan at Renmin University, China is currently using Texera in his course "Computational Communication." The purpose is for students in the School of Journalism, who do not have a strong IT background, to conduct analytics on social media data using a GUI interface provided by Texera.
