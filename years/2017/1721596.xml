<AbstractNarration>The broad impact of this SBIR Phase I project is  in the development of a new cokeless process to melt iron and scrap steel while meeting  stringent environmental regulations. The process being investigated will potentially shift the paradigm of difficult pollution control to the use of a clean fuel, such as natural gas.  It has the potential to cut down 75% of the greenhouse gas emissions by comparison with coke fired cupolas that continue to cover 70% of the world production of castings. By leveraging the existing network of natural gas pipelines, it intends to put back the US at the forefront of developing clean technologies for metal casting and provide opportunities to expand to new foundries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal focuses on a specially designed furnace that primarily incorporates two interconnected chambers with two different zones of melting and superheating. This design is aimed at overcoming the limitations of natural gas fired cokeless cupolas and rotary furnaces,and rapidly dwindling coke-fired open hearth furnaces.  The key objective of this project is to demonstrate  that the innovative furnace can melt pig iron at the required rate, but with lower pollution emissions than competitive technologies, and in compliance with stringent environmental regulations. In particular emissions of CO2, lead, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates will be lowered by finding a range of favorable operating conditions through systematic experimentation. Slag damage to  furnace lining will also be managed.</AbstractNarration>

Scrap iron consisting of engine blocks, broken pipes, crankshafts, brake drums were melted. Emissions of Carbon Monoxide, Carbon dioxide, Nitrogen Oxides, Sulfur dioxides were measured during melting tests.</p> <p>The tests confirmed that with proper steps to ensure the correct air to fuel ratio, proper cooling of the flue gases and heat recovery to combustion air, the Twin Chamber Cokeless Furnace overcame the stigma that natural gas would not achieve the high temperatures to melt iron while achieving very low emissions. The research tests confirmed that the invention has the potential to reduce emissions from the steel and iron industry by substituting natural gas to coke or electricity generated from fossil fuels at lower tacit efficiency.</p> <p>A number of jobs were created through the test program and new skills were acquired.</p> <p>The invention was presented at the 122nd Congress of the American Foundry Society and received positive feedback. While it may be difficult to displace the electric arc furnace, or electric induction furnace in the USA, the Twin Chamber Cokeless Furnace has the potential to create an intermediary industry between collecting bulky scrap and the foundry industry by refining scrap into clean ingots, while removing excessive quantities of unwanted alloying elements such as manganese, boron, chromium and nickel. The Twin Chamber Cokeless Furnace can incinerate better some oil contaminants that would have caused explosions in electric melting furnaces.
