<AbstractNarration>Unprecedented ice melt in the Arctic Ocean is opening a "new ocean," creating the potential for new and expanded economic opportunities. To date, there has been little research on developing Arctic economies and the potential effects on the social, cultural, and ecological system of the Arctic. This award would support a workshop of environmental, natural resource, international, finance, and subsistence economists to discuss changing Arctic economies and how economic research can contribute to our understanding of these changes. The research agenda shaped during this workshop has relevance in other regions; while there are many unique issues in the Arctic, the challenges of balancing economic uses and environmental health are similar to those being addressed in coastal regions around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a small exploratory workshop to define an agenda for economic research related to the Arctic. The project will a) define key research issues and appropriate methodologies, b) identify gaps in existing data systems that need to be filled for research and policy purposes, and c) form the nucleus of a network of experts that will improve the opportunities for scholars to collaborate and encourage more professional journal articles and conference presentations. Over two days of discussions, 10-12 experts will address a set of questions that will be sent to attendees in advance of the workshop, and respond to a commissioned paper intended to stimulate the discussions from different fields of economic research. These fields include regional, environmental, natural resource, international, finance, and subsistence economics. The workshop will also include representatives from the practitioner community with knowledge of the important policy-relevant questions that would benefit from economic research; potential funders of economic research; and an Arctic ecologist to assist with making the linkages between the environment and economics. The event will be held in Monterey, California, and hosted by the Center for the Blue Economy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On November 6-8, 2018, an Arctic Economics workshop funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation was held on the Monterey campus of The Middlebury Institute of International Studies (MIIS) in Monterey, California. The workshop was organized by Dr. Judith Kildow of The Center for the Blue Economy (CBE) at MIIS and Professor Michael Goldstein of Babson College, and attended by 16 academic and government participants from the US, Norway, and Canada.  The workshop was convened to better understand the state of economic research about the Arctic, search for possible reasons for the relatively few publications by economists and, throughout this meeting to encourage more research by economists about the Arctic.     The time was ripe for such a workshop. The changing Arctic sea and land area may be the last new opening of underexplored (and unexploited) geography on the Earth?s surface to substantial economic activity. Economic activities (local and commercial) are becoming more difficult on land as permafrost thaws and the seasonal duration of travel on frozen ground diminishes. Despite its severe&mdash;albeit changing&mdash;environment and sparse human population of about 4 million people throughout the Arctic nations, the Arctic is resource-rich and an important part of the biodiversity and global ecosystem. The economic opportunities for investment as well as the risks faced in this dynamic polar location are of interest to many economic actors (e.g. corporate CEOs, national governments, and tribal corporations). A changing Arctic presents an enormous challenge for policymakers and economic decision-makers attempting to balance economic development, safety, equity regarding indigenous cultures, and ecological issues in a formerly inaccessible area of ocean becoming available de novo.  Perhaps due to the previous lack of data, a literature review showed academic economists were writing far fewer articles on the topic than non-economists such as anthropologists, lawyers, political scientists, and sociologists.  The workshop was thus convened to be an exploratory examination of the status of economic research about the Arctic, particularly research done by credentialed economists (authors with graduate degrees in economics or business) as either sole authors or among interdisciplinary teams.   The workshop gathered a diverse team of experts &ndash; some were focused on the Arctic, some were not; some were economists, and some were in related fields; some were academics, some were practitioners, and some were government experts&ndash;to discuss why so few economists were publishing works about the Arctic and what might be done to encourage such work.   Participants included:  4 government agency experts:      2 from the US &ndash; NOAA, NSF;  1 Canadian from Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and  1 from Norway, Statistics Bureau.          9 credentialed economists:    5 focused on the Arctic,  3 mainstream economists representing environmental/resource economics, regional economics;  1 financial economist; and 1Arctic subsistence economist.          5 social scientists, representing political science/political economy, governance/policy and law, security, and socio-ecological coupling.      2 Polar natural scientists:    1 NSF administer (the Director of Arctic Programs) 1 marine biologist/ecologist (the Director of SEARCH).    The workshop started with the description of the current state of the literature.  it then proceed with three keynote talks:  1. Keynote #1:  ECONOR III 2015 Update, by Dr. Iulie Aslaksen, an economist with Statistics Norway, who presented a summary and an overview of the ECONOR III 2015 Update study for which she was the project leader and co-editor.   2.  Keynote #2:   Environmental Values and The Economy by   Dr. Brendan Kelly (Executive Director of SEARCH: Study of Environmental Arctic Change, and Professor, University of Alaska, Fairbanks), a Marine Biologist specializing in Arctic marine mammals, who described where economic impacts are being felt and how economics could contribute to a greater understanding of these impacts.  Dr. Kelly discussed the implications that current trajectories and uncertainties hold for the various economic sectors, particularly maritime transportation, but also the enormous problems that melting tundra and increased rainfall will have on roads and buildings and suggested that the latter may be the costliest.   3.  Keynote #3: Policy and Governance Issues and Economic Information by Dr. Oran Young, (Distinguished Professor Emeritus,  University of California at Santa Barbara), who described the dynamics and structure of the political economy of the Arctic, explaining the strong links between governance, institutions and geopolitical variables to economic decisions.  Each keynote talk was followed by designated discussants and then general discussion.   The workshop identified a variety of research themes and questions, as well as impediments to future research, including funding and lack of organized datasets.  A workshop report was produced and disseminated and a new society (Artic and Sub-Arctic Economic Association) was suggested and is being organized.  The Journal of Ocean and Coastal Economics will run a special issue on Arctic Economics, in which the summary of the workshop, papers from the keynote talks, and others will be published.
