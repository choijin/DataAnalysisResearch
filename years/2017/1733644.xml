<AbstractNarration>The construction industry is one of the largest job providers in the U.S. and plays a major role in producing well-paying, middle class, high-quality jobs. Thus, many communities of color are underrepresented in the construction labor force. According to a recent dataset from the U.S. Census Bureau (2014), male workers in the construction sector, on average, comprise 16% more than their female counterparts, and white workers, on average, comprise almost 24% more than their black or African American counterparts. The challenges in the construction workforce are many, and the solutions are complex. Increasing racial and gender diversity in engineering is an imperative for the National Science Foundation and a priority driven by the changing demographics and need for high-quality engineering workforce, including in the construction industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using multiple data collection methods, the investigators propose to obtain initial data studying inequalities and biases in construction/civil/architectural engineering. More specifically, the investigators aim to study the current inequality situation within the construction workforce by race/ethnicity and gender, along with the spatial distribution of wage gaps among U.S. metros/trades by utilizing nationwide data sources and structural inequalities and biases within the national educational system as they relate to AEC by surveying high school students about their perceptions/ interests/ images/understanding on the AEC industry. In particular, this study will focus on African American, Hispanic, and women. The timing of this study is optimal because it possesses great promise in addressing an imminent labor shortage issue while helping the construction industry recruit a more diversified labor workforce.</AbstractNarration>

However, the Construction industry is experiencing difficulty in hiring skilled labor, as well as increasing racial and gender diversity. A number of studies have laid out the problems of segregation and inequality in general, the labor shortage in the construction industry, diversity and discrimination in the construction industry, and the education of minority students.

Here are the key takeaways from the project outcomes:  1) The gender differences in employment in the Construction industry demonstrated that a gap exists, and illustrated that the trend has not changed over the years.  2) Wage gaps against Women and Ethnic Minorities (WEM) are evident for both Architecture and Civil Engineering (A&amp;E), and Construction occupations.  3) Women are underrepresented in AEC occupations in general, but the gap between gender is more considerable for racial minorities, including Hispanic and Black workers.  4) The Great Recession widened the gender wage gap against women in Construction occupations, and this pattern against the Hispanic and Black women's workforce is stronger compared to the White Non-Hispanic (WNH) women's workforce. During recovery (2011-2015 period), the gap against WEM improved with the growing demand for construction workers.  5) Unlike Construction occupations, gender inequality against women for A&amp;E occupations improved during the recessionary period (2007-2011 period). This was mainly due to the reduced wage gap by gender for the WNH ethnic group. Even for the Hispanic workforce, the wage gap against women widened only by 3.68% during the recession. This indicates that the higher skill levels required for A&amp;E could minimize potential wage losses among the WEM groups.  6) The study provided a comprehensive geographical overview of the gender wage gap A&amp;E, as well as Construction occupations, in order for practitioners to understand both the temporal and spatial patterns of the gender wage gap in the U.S. before the recession (2007), during the recession (2011), and in the recovery period (2015).  Based on this project, the project researchers: 1) published two journal papers in the American Society of Civil Engineering's (ASCE) Journal of Management in Engineering (the top journal in the construction engineering and management domain); 2) published two conference papers in the ASCE Construction Research Congress (CRC) proceedings; 3) produced one master's thesis (with one Ph.D. dissertation coming in summer 2020); 4) delivered two poster presentations; and 5) gave and three conference presentations.  This project's outcomes contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the area of Labor and Personnel Issues, specifically Workplace Diversity and Discrimination, and help the construction industry to: 1) better understand the wage gap and workforce distribution; 2) further investigate the problem; 3) and make an effort to decrease the wage gap.
