<AbstractNarration>Core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) are direct probes of stellar evolution and the dominant producers of heavy elements. Significant advancement in our understanding of the CCSN mechanism has occurred in the last decade, highlighted by the understanding that the CCSN problem involves the complex interaction of many physical inputs that can only be fully considered in three-dimensional (3D) simulations. The number of 3D simulations, which include sufficient realistic physics, that have been completed is still small and the simulations are generally under-resolved. Recent observational surveys have greatly increased the number of well observed CCSN and identified many of the pre-supernova stars, establishing a more direct relationship between the characteristics and the details of the explosion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will survey the range of the stellar mass of CCSN progenitors using the state-of-the-art CCSN code Chimera on the Blue Waters system to understand how the variations in pre-supernova structure affect the explosive outcomes. The simulations will begin from progenitor stars that span the range of stellar masses from the lightest to heaviest stars that might explode. The progenitor star models will be from the first generation of stars formed from the primordial gas of the Big Bang as there exists a class of second-generation stars contaminated by only the ejecta of first-generation supernovae that offer a unique opportunity to measure the ejected products of individual CCSN. This choice offers an important contrast to prior studies which have focused on metal-rich stars. The project will compute five 3D simulations over the course of 2 years with 1-degree resolution. This surpasses the resolution of any current self-consistent, full-physics CCSN simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project include the engagement of local and visiting students (graduate and undergraduate) and post-docs, providing training in both astrophysics and high-performance computing that our students and post-docs carry with them to later jobs in academia and industry.  The project will also make frequent public lectures on supernova-related topics to enhance public understanding.</AbstractNarration>

The first figure shows a slice through the developing  explosion for one of our 3D models illustrating its complex structure.</p> <p>We  computed five 3D models through the revival of the shock, with three of  those extending far enough to show the development of the explosion.  For these the developing explosion energy grows very differently [Fig.  2]. One of the models staturates the explosion energy quickly at a low  value, while the other two take longer to explode, but develop larger  explosions following the pattern seen in their 2D (axisymmetric)  counterparts. The pattern in the explosion energy is matched by the  neutrino heating rate [Fig. 3] where there are large differences in the  heating rate driving the explosion. This is correlated with the neutrino  fluxes (not shown) and with the growth and mass of the NS [Fig. 4],  where we see the strongest heating and explosions for the most massive  NS.</p> <p>We also computed a dozen 2D models, varying only the initial  mass, and they showed a similar correlation in the explosion energy,  heating rate, neutrino fluxes, and NS masses to the 3D models. The  growth of the NS mass is connected to the&nbsp; structure of the star before  collapse -- the mass of the iron core and the densities and thicknesses  of the shells that immediately surround it.</p> <p>We have also computed  several 2D models to understand the impact of the nuclear equation of  state (EoS; the relationship between the pressure, temperature and other  properties of the dense, nuclear matter in the central NS) which is not  fully determined from nuclear physics inputs. These models [Fig. 5]  show the modern EoSs to be relativly similar with the more traditionally  used EoS of our 3D models being a relative outlier, This points to the  need to use a more modern EoS in any future runs (2D or 3D).</p> <p>Outside  our immediate interest in the nature of the CCSN explosion mechanism  and its variety the data generated by this project will be used to  understand the gravitational wave and neutrino signals from CCSNe in the  hope of a nearby (and detectable) event and the elements and isotopes  made in the explosions.These analysis are already underway using the  data we have archived from these runs.
