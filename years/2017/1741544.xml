<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the 2017 Midwestern Graph Theory Conference held at Grand Valley State University in Allendale, Michigan, on October 6-7, 2017.  The meeting is the 58th in a longstanding series of conferences dedicated to the dissemination of new ideas and techniques in graph theory and its applications.  The conferences are held nearly every year at various institutions located in the Midwest and the surrounding regions.   Attendees, including undergraduates as well as graduate students and post-doctoral scholars, are drawn from across the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference features plenary research talks by two well-known graph theorists, as well as contributed talks on a variety of topics such as graph coloring, structural and extremal problems on graphs and hypergraphs, and applications of graph theory (e.g., to computer science, biological and social networks, etc.). The entirety of the funds from this award will be used to support the travel of participants, including students and early-career mathematicians.  More information about the conference is available at the conference website: http://www.gvsu.edu/math/mighty-lviii/</AbstractNarration>

non-native English speaker, and religious minority.</p> <p>The goals of this particular conference were to provide an atmosphere that encourages the dissemination of new results along with collaboration on future ones, to support the development of students (especially undergraduates) and early-career mathematicians, and to encourage and support the increase in diversity of researchers and participants in STEM.</p> <p>The conference featured Douglas West (Zhejiang Normal University and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) and David Galvin (University of Notre Dame) as the two
