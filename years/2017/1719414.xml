<AbstractNarration>Implementation projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, and assess strategies that can lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. The project at Fisk University seeks to establish the foundation for building STEM student success. The goal of the project is to prepare students to contribute in an enduring way to new knowledge as a result of more competitive preparation for graduate school and careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities that are part of this project are: increasing students' deeper learning and successful transition to advanced courses by supplementary instruction into General Biology and College Algebra courses; increasing student confidence and competence in quantitative and computational approaches related to the biological sciences; and  increasing enriched faculty-mentored undergraduate research opportunities across the STEM disciplines assured by intentional  quantitative and computational integration into courses and faculty research collaborations. The  activities and strategies are evidence-based and will inform further efforts by the institution to strengthen STEM undergraduate education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Lay Outcomes Report for NSF 1719414  Our globalized society communicates digitally and advances through our now-omnipresent knowledge economy. The emerging workforce must be both competent and confident in applying quantitative and computational skills in evidence-based decision making, both professionally and as thoughtful global citizens.   The emphasis of this one-year project has been to lay the groundwork for strengthening undergraduate education at Fisk University that applies quantitative and computational skills in the sciences and, in fact, across the curriculum, to grow the next generation of scholars and leaders in our country. Specifically, we have recruited two talented new faculty to lead the transformation of our STEM and non-STEM curricular in computational thinking.  Dr ClarLynda Williams Devane and Willysha Jenkins, the new faculty, have created a new Technology Literacy course which was previewed May 2019 by faculty, in both face-to-face and in online formats. Feedback from faculty has made it possible to improve this course for its pilot offering this four in four 25-student sections.   We have also created a reciprocal learning mechanism among faculty to increase faculty confidence as well as competence in emerging computational tools so that we can similarly enrich upper level courses and foster interdisciplinary faculty research to apply these tools to the acquisition of new knowledge via discovery and deeper student learning in all of our STEM courses.
