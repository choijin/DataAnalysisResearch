<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will determine the feasibility of a new high risk technology for treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The technology is an AAV2-mediated concurrent expression of recombinant proteins to intracellularly suppress the critical growth factors VEGF-A (vascular endothelial growth factor A) and PDGF-B (platelet-derived growth factor) in a single injection.  AMD is the leading cause of blindness in the US. The standard of care intravitreal anti-VEGF (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor) injections (injected monthly) achieve an initial improvement in visual acuity in the first 3 or 4 months of treatment is followed by a plateau that persists for 2 years, followed by visual decline over the subsequent 5 years. Studies examining retinal remodeling provided initial clues as to the importance of VEGF and PDGF in wet AMD, while work in cancer models provided an impetus to pursue anti-VEGF/PDGF combination therapy for the treatment of wet AMD. This project will lead to an effective product for the treatment of wet AMD and related diseases.  A long-term VEGF inhibition and PDGF suppression without repetitive intravitreal injections would significantly reduce the number of intraocular injections and the risks of infection, bleeding, retinal detachment, fibrosis, and pain for the patient. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes an AAV2-delivery vehicle for expressing intraceptors which sequester VEGF-A and PDGF-B. The primary innovation is the development of a novel gene therapy to concurrently suppress VEGF-A and PDGF-B, using a bicistronic AAV2 vector.  The proposed studies in mice will determine feasibility for potential commercialization of this alternative which would be injected annually and provide long-term sustained suppression of the two key mediators of neovascular AMD, including the potential for reduced fibrosis (scarring) with PDGF-B blockade. Further, this therapy?s ability to block intracellular autocrine loops may complement or improve upon the efficacy of current extracellular treatments, while avoiding neurotoxicity of diffuse extracellular VEGF suppression. This project?s innovations earned a patent in 2012 (US Patent No. 8,211,864 B2). The proposal will refine the product and develop a modified AAV virus with selective tropism for CNV and minimize off-target side effects.  The proposed feasibility studies Aims 1 and 2 will establish a baseline for future safety and efficacy studies in non-human primates which is a key mile stone for investors. Aim 1 will involve AAV2 manufacture, while Aim 2 will evaluate safety and efficacy, using histology, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Background:   Death of cells in the central part of the retina (macula) together with bleeding or tissue swelling is the central feature of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), with the advanced neovascular form affecting 1.7 million Americans. Current management of this is monthly injections of anti-VEGF drugs; as can easily be imagined, injections to the eye can be painful and pose risks of infection, retinal detachment, and hemorrhage. iVeena is developing a long-term noninfectious gene therapy approach to restore the normal vascular barriers and preserve retinal cells.  As each of these monthly injections typically costs thousands of dollars, anti-VEGF treatments will account for $10.3B in US sales by 2019.

Intellectual merit  a)      Flt23k is a "paradigm" shift in the management of wet AMD. This project?s innovations for which a patent has been awarded in 2012 (US Patent No. 8,211,864 B2) include:     Intracellular blockade of VEGF by disrupting autocrine loops (unlike the existing anti-VEGFs on the markets or the AAV.sFlt-1 vectors in clinical trials)  Potential to replace the ?standard of care? for wet AMD that currently involves monthly injections  Long-term suppression of intracellular VEGF secretion.  This would be injected once every 12-18 months instead of monthly anti-VEGF treatments.  Reduce Wet AMD treatment cost due to significantly reduced physician administered injections over the treatment period.        b)      AAV delivery of both Flt23k and PDGFR&beta;23k for anti-VEGF resistant neovascular AMD   It is known that chronic anti-VEGF treatment causes PDGF upregulation, leading to pericyte recruitment and neovascular membrane maturation pericytes are the source of resistance to anti-VEGF therapy in neovascular AMD, hence there is a physiologic rationale for a combination of anti-PDGF and anti-VEGF therapies. Ophthotech has developed a PDGF inhibitor, (Fovista, formerly E10030) but requires two separate injections- the Anti-VEGF and PDGF inhibitor Suppression of fibrosis and retinal toxicity      Broader Impacts  The broader societal impact of this Phase I project is significant both within the U.S. and globally. Dual suppression of angiogenic and fibrotic pathways should enhance long-term visual outcomes for patients.  Reduction of the frequency of injections would reduce the risks of bleeding, infection, and retinal detachment that patients incur. Reducing the need for frequent clinic visits would allow retina surgeons to spend more time with patients and use their time in more productive ways than an "assembly line of injections", as well as reduce the cost of multiple visits for macular degeneration to the health-care system at large.
