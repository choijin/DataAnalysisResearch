<AbstractNarration>The Marine Advanced Technology Center (MATE) at the Monterey Peninsula College will continue to manage a program that places interns in at-sea technical positions in collaboration with the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) and the United States Coast Guard (USCG). The program will provide 12-14 undergraduate students with two to twelve-week internships and one student with a six-month internship each year for the next three years (2018-2021). MATE interns work with marine technicians and scientists onboard research vessels and these experiences provide them with the opportunity to develop their technical, scientific, seamanship and interpersonal skills. Ships that are part of the UNOLS and the USCG fleets will serve as internship hosts. UNOLS and USCG are committed to providing berthing space and meals on their vessels during a research cruise and marine technicians who act as mentors. These internships provide students with the opportunity to develop their technical, scientific, seamanship, and interpersonal skills, and give ocean-related employers access to qualified technical professionals who can fill their workforce needs. While the program is open to all U.S. undergraduates, recruitment efforts are focused on community college students enrolled in marine technology programs and university students interested in marine technical careers. This training effort is important for the continued operation of the U.S. academic research fleet and for the marine industries that benefit by hiring the highly skilled technicians who graduate from the program.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a focus on recruiting students from community colleges who are interested in careers as marine technicians, MATE internship program fills a unique need in the continuum of support for undergraduate students in marine sciences. This program provides an excellent bridge between students who need training and experience and academic and industrial employers who need technical support. The MATE internship program will provide a total of forty-five undergraduates with internships over the three-year period. Most of the funding provided supports student stipends and travel to meet the research vessels where they will be working. The MATE internship program supports national goals by developing the next generation of technically skilled workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skills and experience gained through all MATE internships vary depending on the research vessel, cruise goals and tasks the mentors need to accomplish during the cruise. Typical experiences include: 1) cruise preparation and coordination; 2) operation and maintenance of specific oceanographic equipment [e.g. Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD), Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), fluorometer, transmissometer, temperature and salinity sampling, nutrient sampling, sonar and echosounders, current profilers, corers and nets, underwater cameras, AUVs, ROVs]; 3) trouble shooting instruments and equipment; 4) chemical analyses; 5) operation and maintenance of computer hardware and software; 6) programming software for data retrieval, analysis, and archiving; 7) seamanship, marine operations, and safety procedures; 8) navigation skills; 9) application of basic oceanographic and meteorological knowledge to sampling design and execution; 10) teamwork and other interpersonal skills; 11) experience working in a marine and scientific environment; and 12) communication skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
