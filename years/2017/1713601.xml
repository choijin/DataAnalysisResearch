<AbstractNarration>Research tells us that media -- be it on television or film or in the form of radio podcasts -- are the most widely utilized and trusted sources for public science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning.  Media narratives can shape opinions and knowledge about STEM as well as either reduce or enhance cultural biases and perceptions of STEM.  However, little is known about the process by which STEM media professionals develop and assess mastery of "STEM Media," or to what extent evidence-based communication strategies and data-supported effective practices are considered and used by creators of STEM media.  This conference proposal will bring together STEM professionals and media creators to determine how STEM media makers develop and assess expertise in STEM media making and articulate best practices.  The goal is to promote cross-industry collaboration between media producers, STEM professionals and communication researchers in crafting evidence-based media for the public.  The project will also create a 2-year STEM Media Fellows program as well as expand the Science of Communication Strand at two Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festivals (JHWFF) and at the Science Media Awards and Summit in the Hub (SMASH) conference in 2018.  The work will be led by Jackson Hole WILD, a nonprofit professional organization, in partnership with Colorado Mesa University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will employ three strategies to advance effective STEM media production and product effectiveness.  First, an initiative to provide professional development in Communication Science will be part of the 2017 and 2018 Jackson Hole WILD conferences to increase the attending STEM media professionals' understanding of evidence-based practices.  The content will be presented through structured sessions at the conferences with recordings of the sessions made available online as well as through partner organizations.  Second, the STEM Media Fellows program will recruit emerging STEM professionals who are interested in media making.  The goals of the STEM Media Fellows program are to prepare these diverse STEM professionals with knowledge and skills for media development, and form collaborations among the STEM professionals and media creators.  Third, in collaboration with Colorado Mesa University, the project will conduct a Delphi study to determine how mastery of STEM media making is acquired and assessed.  The Delphi study will involve gathering perceptions and experiences from the world's leading STEM communicators and media makers regarding how they learned to be professionals and how they would determine the level of expertise of other STEM media makers.  The results of the Delphi study will synthesize models and identify best practices that could be used to inform the STEM media industry efforts to align media production with evidence-based practices.  These results will be disseminated through appropriate peer-reviewed journals, industry associations, and other outlets of research on informal science education.   This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.  This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Communicating STEM project implemented three interventions over the course of 2 years in order to achieve its objectives. A fellows program consisting of a cross-industry cohort of emerging STEM professionals and emerging STEM media makers helped reveal the need for best practices across industries (research and communication) to inform collaboration resulting in effective adoption of evidence-based communication best practices applied to STEM media for lay audiences. A Delphi study helped identify industry norms around evaluating expertise in STEM media making, revealing a lack of consensus among content creators about variables which lead to expertise in STEM storytelling. This elucidated further need for a community of practice recognized among content creators to develop and communicate shared definitions for industry jargon like &ldquo;impact&rdquo; and to define the benchmarks for expertise in STEM storytelling. Lastly, the Communicating STEM project presented both formal and informal professional development through two Jackson WILD-led conferences, Delphi focus groups at AAAS events, and multiple presentations of project results at additional film industry conferences in the US, UK and EU. Project outcomes have informed presentations/workshops by the project PIs at Jackson WILD, SMASH, International Wildlife Film Festival, Wildscreen, Sunny Side of the Doc, and AAAS.</p> <p>The primary outcomes of the project have served to largely reveal that there is still a great deal of work to do to bring the paradigms through which STEM media (e.g. science and nature documentary programs, podcasts, and social media) into better alignment with evidence-based best practices. The importance of this goal is informed by a long history of research which demonstrates that non-scientists acquire much of their science (STEM) knowledge from media they encounter through traditional print and digital outlets, including social media news and themed television programming. This STEM knowledge in turn affects STEM literacy &ndash; the ability non-specialists have to make informed decisions about STEM topics, ranging from opinions about vaccines and stem cell research, to their beliefs about climate mitigation and global health. The survey results from the Communicating STEM programming at Jackson WILD &ndash; combined with findings from the Fellows program and the Delphi study &ndash; indicate that STEM storytellers want to positively impact audience education, but are often unequipped with the training and insights to determine the best practices and processes which are applicable to their unique stories. The project PI&rsquo;s therefore believe that by improving the rigor of professional development for STEM media creators (i.e. storytellers, filmmakers, broadcasters) to include access to evidence-based best practices, case studies, and the opportunity to foster collaborative relationships with STEM professionals and communication experts who can better inform their narratives, the media industry stands to increase the impact their products have on the STEM literacy of public audiences.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/25/2020<br>      Modified by: Ru&nbsp;Mahoney</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1713601/1713601_10513044_1587856870895_JW_lobby--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1713601/1713601_10513044_1587856870895_JW_lobby--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Jackson WILD Conference 2017"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1713601/1713601_10513044_1587856870895_JW_lobby--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Jackson WILD Conference 2017"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Conference attendees network in the lobby of the Jacskson Lake Lodge</div> <div class="imageCredit">NA</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ru&nbsp;Mahoney</div> <div class="imageTitle">Jackson WILD Conference 2017</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1713601/1713601_10513044_1587855964255_WildscreenRu--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1713601/1713601_10513044_1587855964255_WildscreenRu--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Wildscreen Masterclass 2018"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1713601/1713601_10513044_1587855964255_WildscreenRu--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Wildscreen Masterclass 2018"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Project PI Ru Mahoney presents project learnings as part of a masterclass for emerging STEM media professionals at Wildscreen 2018 in Bristol, UK</div> <div class="imageCredit">NA</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ru&nbsp;Mahoney</div> <div class="imageTitle">Wildscreen Masterclass 2018</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1713601/1713601_10513044_1587856988960_JW_Jennie--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1713601/1713601_10513044_1587856988960_JW_Jennie--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Jackson WILD Conference 2019"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1713601/1713601_10513044_1587856988960_JW_Jennie--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Jackson WILD Conference 2019"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Project fellow Dr. Jennie Berglund returns to the 2019 conference as a panel moderator, advanving conversations about communication best practice between media makers and scientists.</div> <div class="imageCredit">NA</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ru&nbsp;Mahoney</div> <div class="imageTitle">Jackson WILD Conference 2019</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
