<AbstractNarration>1748712 (Gonzalez). This workshop will convene U.S. experts from a diverse set of disciplines to address specific science topics of the urban-climate system, while facilitating a broader participation of students and post-doctoral fellows. The workshop will be held in August 2018 in New York City. Specific outcomes of the workshop are targeted to be (a) improved understanding of the role of megacities in the global climate system, (b) strategies for scalable climate-resilient urban environments, and (c) an outline of effective technological and socioeconomic interventions to reduce atmospheric greenhouse emissions from cities (via low carbon transportation, low carbon buildings, data science). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes will be a documented research and educational agenda, as well as road maps identifying: (a) scientific gaps, collaborative research projects, and data sources to needed to implement the agenda; (b) resources needed; (c) stakeholder involvement; and (d) scientific and societal benefits. These discussions, expected road maps, and long term actions will be designed to have significant benefits to the scientific community, the urban planning community, and emergency responders in cities across the U.S.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Urban Climate and Resiliency-Science Working Group (i.e. The WG) was convened in the summer of 2018 to explore the scientific grand challenges related to resiliency of coastal cities.  The WG leveraged the 10th International Conference on Urban Climate (ICUC10) held in New York City August 6-10, 2018 as input forum.  ICUC10 was a joint collaboration between the International Association of Urban Climate, the American Meteorological Society, and the World Meteorological Organization.   ICUC10 attracted more than 600 participants from more than 50 countries resulting in close to 700 oral and poster presentations under the common theme of ?Sustainable &amp; Resilient Urban Environment?.  The WG consisted of more than 25 urban climate scientists; university faculty (13), national laboratories scientists (3), post-doctoral fellows (2), and doctoral students (8).  WG members met before the meeting, attended the conference sessions, and reconvened after the meeting to reflect on key emerging scientific challenges to further advance the field of urban climate and weather in the context of increased resiliency to extreme weather and climate events.  The WG organized the recommendations for research along the lines of the following three Grand Challenges:   The Modeling Grand Challenge:    Human-permitting modeling:  Urban canopy models (UCMs) commonly rely on a horizontally-averaged approach, where the roughness-sublayer is represented as a single column, often representative of statistically-homogeneous urban geometries. However, urban surfaces are statistically heterogeneous at those scales of interest, and are also composed of a wide range of length scales. Hence, current theories are limited in their predictive capabilities and such a deficiency calls for improved physically-based parameterizations that enable to account for the complex three dimensionality of the flow field and its heterogeneity. Future efforts to incorporate complicated three-dimensional effects will have to account for the hierarchical structure of scales of urban canopies. Improve weather/climate prediction of extremes for coastal cities:  Current models still lack skills in providing forecasts at the spatiotemporal scales demanded by stakeholders. To assess interconnected weather-infrastructure-environment impacts and hazards, there needs to be a concerted effort to integrate models across disciplines (weather, hydrology, biomass, agriculture, energy) pertinent to coastal cities. Urban big-data harness:  Newly available datasets provide new opportunities to improve the model development and applications. For instance, the concept of local climate zones or World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools has been widely discussed at ICUC10.  A significant challenge is the availability of data at model-relevant scales (kilometer).     The Observational Grand Challenge:   Representativeness of observations: Experimental data should be thoroughly investigated for relevant representative spatio-temporal scales. Data Redundancy: It is imperative that all data across all sensors in field experiments are recorded, stored, and eventually shared.  Explore Public Datasets: Several government agencies collect a variety of data that could be used to study the Urban Boundary Layer (UBL). These datasets can be used to validate and force urban climate models.   QA/QC:  Current field experiments sample data from various sources (fixed/mobile/remote) and care should be taken to implement the necessary and relevant quality control protocols.  Further, urban climate scientists should be wary of using current technologies like machine learning to interpret large datasets.    The Cyber Informatics and Data Management Grand Challenge:  Urban Cyber-informatics is defined as  ?the collection of digital information and approaches for processing and analysis of both environmental data and data relevant to the theater of urban operations.?  It can be further elaborated as follows;  Organic/administrative and Citizen generated data: These datasets consists of: (a) Socioeconomic data on wealth, health, and education, (b) City administration data, including logistics of operation (e.g. waste etc.) and financial matters, available in data rich cities, (c) Health data, collected for public health monitoring and epidemiological studies (these data include vector borne, water borne, infectious, and environmental diseases (air quality and toxic chemical exposure; heat stress); and hospital admissions for various disease conditions);  (d) Crowd-sourced data, generated from the rapid growth of social media and information technology that has resulted in large volume of social data such as patterns of mobility and sentiment.  Sensor data:   -          Remote/spaceborne: The large spatial coverage and legacy of the spaceborne data is of great value, and the respective imagery delivers good spectral resolution, however the spatio-temporal resolution are not simultaneously delivered at high fidelity. The emerging developments in high resolution interferometric synthetic aperture radar will be a great asset when deployed. -          Remote/ground based and airborne: Data processing techniques for ground based remote sensing instruments (lidars, radars, sodars and radiometers) are being advanced by co-operating them in a manner that allows for multiple spatial and temporal scales to be identified - particularly important in the complex urban-coastal environments.  -          In-situ (static/ mobile): For in-situ instruments that are designed for high sensitivity and high accuracy, mobile applications require precision time/space signatures.  However, the emergence of low-cost micro sensors and internet of things is promising. It can result in wide spread application.
