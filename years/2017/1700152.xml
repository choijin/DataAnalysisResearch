<AbstractNarration>Los Angeles Mission College (LAMC) will prepare community college and high school students for jobs in biotechnology. The new programs developed will explicitly address skill development and offer students counseling, tutoring, industry field trips, external speakers, and internship opportunities. Combined with excellent instruction in the classroom, these activities will prepare students for entry-level, middle-skill technician positions. LAMC serves a large underrepresented student body and will provide these students with employment opportunities in a high growth sector that needs a skilled workforce. Project evaluation will focus on measuring student progression, success, retention, and degree attainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LAMC will develop new academic pathways and curricula in biotechnology leading to stackable certificates and an Associate of Science degree. Stackable credentials will prepare students to enter the workforce in a short period of time while retaining the opportunity to pursue higher degrees at a later date. It will also allow for flexibility that will contribute to student retention and success. The project will provide high school students an opportunity to earn college credit and credentials that will ultimately assist them in obtaining employment.</AbstractNarration>

LAMC has implemented and institutionalized a new academic pathway in biotechnology that offers stackable certificate (Biotech Lab Assistant, Biotech Research Lab Assistant) and associate degree programs to better serve underrepresented students with low-socioeconomic backgrounds. Services, such as counseling and tutoring, in addition to industry field trips and speaker series, a well-defined biotechnology curriculum, and industry internship and employment opportunities make up a holistic approach to help ensure that students are prepared for high-demand biotechnology jobs in Southern California.</p> <p>The LAMC biotechnology program has awarded more than 80 certificates and degrees in the last three and half years. About half of the students have gained employment and many others are being interviewed by local industry partners. Those served range from high school students to graduates from four-year universities looking for training to gain employment.</p> <p>Student feedback:<em>&nbsp;"</em><em>Thank you for offering this course and program. I feel that it changed my career goals and professional outlook.?, ?Before this course I thought I was stuck working in a labor kind of job. And now I?m happy to see I can actually work in a lab.", </em>"I<em>&nbsp;have never been more excited to learn as I am now through this program. It is unbelievable that before even finishing the program, I have an interview. I am excited that I have an interview with Takeda Pharmaceuticals, the largest Clinical Trials company?.</em></p> <p>LAMC's affiliation with local and national organizations provided additional collaborations and program improvement. The program has solidified its collaboration with high schools, industry partners, Work Source centers and Veterans' centers to create awareness of the biotechnology educational pathway and employment opportunities in this field. Though challenging, the program continued with its efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic to train qualified technicians to place them in high demand jobs in this sector. Comments from industry partners include: "<em>I was not sure how the students would handle internships in the middle of a Pandemic, but I'm very pleased with Brett, who has been exceptional. He is an asset to my unit, and I am getting more and more used to his helping hand. Hope he can stay beyond his internship.", "Josh is an exceptional intern. I like how he jumped into learning a new project from the very first day. He has finished more hours than he initially committed to. Working with Joshua, I'm very pleased with the LA Mission College program."</em></p> <p>The LAMC biotechnology program has been recognized by its accomplishments nationally.&nbsp; In 2018, a group of four LAMC biotechnology students were selected by an expert panel of judges as one of ten finalists for the NSF Community College Innovation Challenge. As a finalist, the team attended the Community College Innovation Challenge Boot Camp that took place in Alexandria, VA. This was a great accomplishment for these students who were mainly first generation students. In 2020, LAMC biotechnology program was rated as one of the top 10 programs at California Economic Summit's Partnerships for Industry and Education Contest.</p> <p>The biotechnology pipeline at LAMC is commended for its flexibility, innovation, and persistence and for its commitment to biotechnology education in the region.
