<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in resolving the long-standing graphical access problem for millions of blind and visually-impaired (BVI) people. Lack of access to these substantial informational components of daily life represents one of the biggest challenges to the independence and productivity of BVI individuals. This project addresses this vexing accessibility issue through a viable information access solution built on commercial, low-cost touchscreen-based smart computing devices such as smartphones and tablets. The solution will assist BVI people by potentially providing dynamic access to digital school books and test materials, graphics in vocational settings, digital maps, and graphical contents of printed materials.  The broader impact of this project is that it will promote empowerment of BVI individuals by supporting increased educational advancement, vocational opportunities, enhanced quality of life, and overall greater independence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corp project will explore the commercial potential and market fit for a touchscreen-based graphics screen reader. This solution will allow blind people to freely explore and access graphical information via vibration and auditory feedback on a smartphone or tablet. Through a battery of usability, psychophysical, and technical experiments, the technology has been shown to be effective compared to existing solutions and is accurate in conveying informative graphical materials such as graphs, shapes, patterns, and indoor maps. The focus of the proposed I-Corp project is to understand the commercial fit and usability of the solution in meeting end-user needs and problems.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project was to&nbsp;evaluate the efficacy of a new information-access solution, called a graphics screen reader, which allows blind and visually impaired (BVI) people to freely explore and access graphical information via vibration and auditory feedback on a commercial smartphone or tablet. Current technologies for providing nonvisual access to graphical content are extremely expensive, only convey static information, are based on one modality (such as touch or auditory descriptions), and are rarely available to users. The lack of access to this information represents one of the biggest challenges to the independence and productivity for this demographic. By contrast, our graphics access solution is inexpensive, based on dynamic information, inherently multimodal, and based on universally designed commercial hardware that is already broadly adopted by BVI users. This I-Corp project allowed us to conduct critical customer discovery relating to our product, which if commercialized, will promote empowerment of BVI individuals by supporting increased educational advancement, vocational opportunities, enhanced quality of life, and overall greater independence. We have already shown, through a series of experiments, that our solution is most effective compared to existing solutions (i.e., hardcopy graphical equivalents) and is accurate in conveying informative graphical materials to BVI people, such as: (1) digital school books and test materials (e.g., SAT), (2) graphics in vocational settings, and (3) digital maps.</p> <p>Throughout this I-Corps project we explored the commercial potential and market fit of our invention through a rigorous set of customer interviews with key stakeholders across the country within the BVI demographic and its broader ecosystem.
