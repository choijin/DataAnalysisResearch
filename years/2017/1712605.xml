<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to transform existing data entry and document archiving systems by introducing an Automatic Data Capture System (ADCS) enhanced by machine learning.  Today many sectors, including the mortgage industry, manufacturing, healthcare, and government agencies, are using cumbersome data entry and document processing techniques. This process not only adds substantially to cost, but also increases inaccuracies in the data pool, cutting into the competitive advantage of industries and agencies. The new system eliminates traditional methods of data extraction and document classification by using a self-learning software program that gathers information from any scanned document in any paper-intensive business processes.  Implementing Robotic Process Automation in data entry business processes in a structured way can accurately extract and process data much faster at a very low cost point.  In addition, the proposed project plan will enhance knowledge about and research on electronic data capture systems used in healthcare, allowing the development of more efficient data-processing techniques that can improve patient care and speed up billing cycles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will implement an effective solution that eliminates time-consuming and error-prone manual data entry. The project will provide valuable insight into the process of scanning, data capture techniques, and machine learning.  The development of technical skills will also be enhanced by an innovative learning framework that explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to data capture and processing.  This proprietary approach to utilizing CNNs in a non-traditional manner has led to exceptional results in identifying and extracting information from scanned documents, making it possible for the first time to fully automate paper-intensive business processes. The commercial success of such a software program is validated by the efforts several companies are making to develop a similar product themselves because currently available technologies, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), cannot offer the level of accuracy required. This new Automated Data Capture System will also enhance research on virtual data systems for representing, querying, and automating data derivation - research that is used in applications such as virtual data language interpreters and data grids.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to determine the commercialization feasibility of a prior master?s project work in the area of robotic process automation in the data entry business.  Manual data entry is an inefficient and time-consuming business process for the public sector, private industry, and U.S. citizens at large. Our Automatic Data Capture System (ADCS) eliminates traditional methods of data extraction and document classification by using a computer program which gathers information from any scanned document in any paper-intensive business process.  The funding as well as instructor/mentor support from the I-Corps program were used to conduct a series of interviews for potential customer discovery. During the project time, the team conducted more than 110 interviews with experts in the field, who, through their industry knowledge, provided valuable insights which helped guide the focus of the project. The major activities performed throughout the duration of the I-Corps program can be subdivided into two categories:  (a) conception of business plan for future commercialization, and  (b) activities aimed at the further development the Automatic Data Capture System (ADCS).  Regarding the conception of the business plan, the central focus was the development of a business model canvas, in which all the elements of a commercially feasible business were conceptualized, tested (through interview analysis), and detailed. A significant portion of the total interviews were considered by the team as "customer segment exploratory interviews," as they were intended to determine the software?s niche.  The interviews also validated the team?s hypothesis that extracting information from hard documents and manual data entry is not only a time consuming and tedious endeavor but also most of the time inaccurate; a process which can be improved through artificial intelligence software.  The outcomes of the interviews were analyzed and channeled with the assistance of the I-Corps instructors/mentors and reflected in the business model canvas on a weekly basis for the duration of the course. Constant assessment of the progress, along with feedback from other teams in online sessions, was crucial in the success of the project.  For example, the team Initially targeted Airlines, Banks and Title companies as the potential customer segments. But based on the interview results and lessons learned, the team decided to drop airlines and banks from the customer segment list and started to investigate other potential customer segments such as insurance companies, law firms and E- discovery. At the end the project phase the team decided to pursue further with title companies (mortgage) and E- discovery.  The initial value propositions of the project were also to:  -          reduce injury data entry time from 5 minutes/injury to instantaneous  -          reduce data entry tasks by 10% from the personnel in business center operations  -          decrease personnel scheduling errors by 80%  -          increase accuracy (98% vs 62% manual) and  -          get instantaneous data extraction and archiving.  In this regard, however, the team found out that most of the potential customer segments would only be willing to pay for increased accuracy (98% vs 62% manual) and instantaneous data extraction and archiving.  Regarding the latter activity of the project, the narrowing of the scope of ADCS allowed the team to channel development efforts toward a specific use, and future modifications to the software will reflect these changes, which will increase the likelihood of commercialization success.  In an effort to continue the commercialization of the product, a proposal for funding has been submitted to the Small Business Innovation Research Phase I program.
