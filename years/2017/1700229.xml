<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "Southeastern Analysis Meeting 2017" that will be held March 17-19, 2017, on the campus of the University of Tennessee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event is the latest installment in a thirty-two-year-long series of conferences covering a wide spectrum of subareas of analysis. In particular, the Southeastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM) has become the leading conference venue in the U.S. for function-theoretic operator theory. SEAM 2017 will again span a broad swath of analysis, featuring five plenary speakers who will address topics in operator theory (Alexandru Aleman, Ken Davidson, Alexei Poltoratski, Karl-Mikael Perfekt); harmonic analysis (Betsy Stovall); and frame theory, sampling theory, and interpolation theory (Shahaf Nitzan). The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
