<AbstractNarration>Human activity has caused a decline in global biodiversity through resource overexploitation, habitat modification, and introduction of non-native species. When rare species are lost, communities exhibit decreased functionality and provide devalued services to humans, which is an environmental and a socioeconomic problem. Although biodiversity loss is global and affects all ecosystems, biodiversity in freshwaters is threatened by much higher extinction rates compared to terrestrial habitats. Therefore, a better understanding of the causes and extent of rarity in freshwaters is urgently needed. Species rarity can be assessed using the species abundance distribution (SAD), which is a measure of the relative abundances of common and rare species. Although the SAD has been investigated for more than 70 years, little is known about the underlying mechanisms that determine the patterns of abundance inequality. The study will address this knowledge gap by developing a novel framework which predicts the response of the SAD in freshwater habitats along environmental and spatial gradients. The study will also investigate how the SAD affects regional biodiversity. Finally, the study will inform decisions for watershed management and biodiversity preservation by elucidating the causes of rarity in species targeted for conservation. This project will also provide research training for one postdoctoral associated, one graduate student and several undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project formulates specific hypotheses, predicting the SAD variability in response to niche and dispersal-related mechanisms as a function of scale, body size, and connectivity. These hypotheses will be tested with global data on freshwater algae, invertebrates, and fish, collected from running and standing waters by US and foreign agencies. Then, it will be determined how, in turn, the SAD constrains the patterns of beta diversity, a key component of regional biodiversity, by employing null model approaches. The SAD of communities and species groups of conservational or environmental importance will be fit with appropriate models. The variability of the parameters of these models will be analyzed statistically along gradients of water chemistry, climate, land use, latitude, longitude, and altitude, and across scales, habitats, and organismal groups. Implementation of the proposed framework would lead to better integration of metacommunity ecology and conservation.</AbstractNarration>

Broader impacts. Texas Stream Team is a 28-year-old statewide organization involving citizen scientists in monitoring the 191,000 miles of waterways in Texas. In 2018, the PI's lab founded the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) Stream Team, whose mission is to educate the public about water quality issues, engage it in citizen science, and contribute to the monitoring efforts of the City of Arlington. All members of the PI's lab became certified Texas Stream Team trainers and taught undergraduate students from a variety of science and engineering departments at the UTA how to collect water samples, measure physico-chemistry, and assess water quality. Graduate and undergraduate student members of the UTA Stream Team monitored small wadable streams and the obtained data complemented the data collection by the City of Arlington, whose monitoring program focuses primarily on larger water bodies.  Summary. This research resulted in seven published articles in leading ecology and microbiology journals, one submitted manuscript, eight presentations at regional, national, and international conferences, mentoring of one postdoctoral researcher, three PhD students, and sixteen undergraduate students, many from underrepresented groups (i.e., nine women, five Hispanic, and one African American), and the establishment of the UTA Stream Team.
