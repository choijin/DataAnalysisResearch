<AbstractNarration>This Track 1 Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program project at Doane University aims to respond to the critical need for highly-effective science and mathematics teachers in Nebraska by producing twenty-five certified STEM teachers with the skills to teach effectively in high-need school districts and persist in their profession. The project activities are designed to: 1) increase the number of STEM majors and STEM professionals who pursue secondary teaching; 2) improve the preparation of teachers, specifically for teaching in high-need schools; and 3) increase the number of STEM education graduates who teach and remain teaching in high-need schools. To accomplish these goals, the project aims to help the prospective teachers gain in-depth content knowledge, and participate in independent research experiences.  The project also aims to help prospective teachers to learn specific instructional skills, develop social knowledge, and gain cultural competencies for teaching in high-need schools. The project will use evidence-based strategies and proven best practices that include increased classroom experiences, rigorous STEM research experiences, a seminar program involving high-need school partners, joint advising, enhanced mentoring experiences, and support programs for new teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of the project, Doane will partner with high-need districts in urban, suburban, and rural Nebraska, specifically: Crete Public Schools, Fairbury Public Schools, Lincoln Public Schools, Minatare Public Schools, Niobrara Public Schools, and Wilber-Clatonia Public Schools. STEM professionals and undergraduate majors in biology, biochemistry, chemistry, environmental science, and mathematics will be recruited to the program. The PIs will investigate how and to what extent increased time in high-need schools, coursework, and seminars focused on high-need school issues enhance the preparation of secondary teachers. They will also investigate the degree to which joint advising, enhanced mentoring, and post-graduate support improve persistence in teaching in high-need schools. The PIs will disseminate information about the results of the project and project activities through publication in peer-reviewed journals and conferences, seminars, and workshops so other teacher preparation programs can replicate or adapt these activities to address the unique needs of their communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
