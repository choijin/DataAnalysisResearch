<AbstractNarration>The International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII) is the premier international forum for interdisciplinary research on the design of systems that can recognize, interpret, and simulate human emotions and related affective phenomena. Its broad scope includes: multi-modal recognition or synthesis of human affect, psychological, cognitive, and neurological affect modeling, affective computing for social and behavioral sciences, and affective interactions for social robotics and virtual agents.  The conference presents latest research in these and related areas and it plays an important role in shaping related scientific, academic, and educational programs. A theme of this ACII 2017 will be to emphasize the affective computing in action. The theme will showcase how affective computing can impact scientific knowledge and address societal challenges. Besides the main conference program, the conference will also feature workshops, tutorials, exhibitions, and a doctoral consortium. This project is to support the travel of approximately 10 U.S. Ph.D. students to attend the 7th ACII conference to be held from October 23rd to 26th, 2017 in San Antonio, Texas, USA.  Besides attending the main conference program, the Ph.D. students will also attend the Doctoral Consortium, where they will share their research results with the community and receive feedback from senior researchers in the field. This will help the students only learn the state of the art in affective computing research but also have an opportunity to present their own work to, and receive feedback from, an invited committee of faculty and industry researchers along with other students working in related areas. The event organizers will make a particular effort to support underrepresented students (in particular, women and minorities) to maximize the benefits of the NSF support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals of the doctoral consortium are to provide an opportunity for face-to-face interaction and constructive feedback for doctoral research of student participants; to promote collaborative research with peer Ph.D. students and senior researchers; to develop a supportive community of scholars in the affective computing field; and to support the next generation of researchers and provide advice on academic, research, industrial, and non-traditional career paths in the field. The Doctoral Consortium solicits extended abstract (4 pages plus 1 page for references) from students from any U.S. PhD granting institution whose research falls within the Affective Computing field. Students are expected to be the sole authors on their submission. For student selection, the DC committee is committed to student and research diversity. The event organizers will make a particular effort to achieve a diversity of research topics, disciplinary backgrounds, methodological approaches, and home institutions in ACII 2017 Doctoral Consortium cohort. Each student participant will be assigned a mentor based upon similarity of research interests and experience, and have a one-one-one meeting to discuss the work. There will be a Doctoral Consortium poster session, in which all participants will present their doctoral work or a recent paper that is part of their doctoral work.</AbstractNarration>
