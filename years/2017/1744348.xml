<AbstractNarration>The landscape of jobs and work is changing rapidly, driven by the development of new technologies. Intelligent, automated machines and services are a growing part of jobs and the workplace. The potential benefits of these technologies include increased productivity, job satisfaction, and new opportunities. But, technology connected to work can also come with risks. The workshop supported by this award will identify research imperatives related to the effects of emerging autonomous trucks on the U.S. economy and, more specifically, how autonomous trucks will affect the current and future trucking workforce. The workshop will promote the convergence of computer science, transportation and civil engineering, autonomy, economics, education, law, psychology, and sociology to define key challenges and research opportunities at the nexus of humans, technology, and work. This convergence workshop will employ deep integration of knowledge, theories, methods, and data from multiple fields to form new and expanded research frameworks. The results will include identification and sharing of new research directions and tools to understand and harness the value of autonomous vehicle technologies on the trucking workforce, while mitigating potential negative consequences. This convergence workshop addresses the future of work at the human-technology frontier. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this workshop seeks to develop a holistic and integrated research agenda for investigating the impact of emerging autonomous vehicle technologies on the trucking workforce from both technical and social dimensions. The transportation system is expected to undergo major changes with the introduction of autonomous vehicles. By 2050, 80% of vehicles will likely be autonomous vehicles. This is expected to result in an estimated 21,700 lives saved and 4.2 million fewer crashes each year as well as reduced traffic congestion, increased fuel efficiency, and increased productivity. As a disruptive yet beneficial technology, autonomous vehicles, ranging from driver assistance to fully automated vehicles, will also have implications for the trucking workforce. The introduction of AVs may also create new job opportunities for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics employees, including the skilled technical workforce, contributing to the development of enabling technology. This workshop will integrate perspectives from different domains to identify the challenges, barriers, research needs, and potential solutions related to autonomous trucks. Although previous efforts have focused on individual components or isolated systems with respect to the deployment of autonomous trucks, the proposed workshop will develop a fully integrated, system-wide approach to address this topic. The workshop attendees will represent a group of experts that will identify the optimum strategies and techniques to address the impacts of autonomous truck deployment on the U.S. economy. One of the primary outcomes will be a report describing research and education opportunities for academia, in concert with public and private sector stakeholders. The proposed workshop and future research agenda will ultimately benefit all road users and consumers in addition to those working in the trucking industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As a disruptive yet beneficial technology, automated trucks (ATs) will profoundly affect the U.S. economy. This technology has the potential to eliminate jobs; however, the introduction of ATs may also create new job opportunities for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-tech employees.    The first day of the workshop had two objectives: (1) provide general knowledge on the different AT deployment scenarios; and (2) begin the process of identifying research gaps that would likely impact drivers with the deployment of ATs. The workshop had 53 participants, including organizers, panel members, stakeholders, and small group moderators. The discussions and findings of the workshop are presented here as research needs for future NSF program solicitations. Types of Jobs Needed Under These Different Implementation Scenarios  More research is need to understand how jobs that still require a human will be completed&mdash;for example, when the AT is driving terminal-to-terminal with no safety driver. Relevant questions include how vehicle inspections will be performed; what happens when an AT is involved in a crash or experiences a software of mechanical malfunction; what occur when law enforcement personnel stop an AT, etc.? Certification Processes Needed to Ensure a Formal Safety Framework How safe do ATs need to be? There was consensus that automated trucks need to be far safer than human drivers, but how much safer? Data are needed to answer these questions; the question is what type of data? Regulatory, Insurance, and/or Legal Perspectives Needed as Automated Truck Technology Matures The government should be involved in the regulation of desired safety outcomes (rather than specific technologies). Research is needed to understand what these outcomes should be and how these data are shared with the government.  Types of Trucking Operations Likely to be First Adopters of ATs ATs will, at least initially, be purchased by well-capitalized fleets. Thus, one area of research would be to evaluate how this technology could be distributed across the spectrum of different sized fleets. Changes in Organization of Carriers Due to the Introduction of ATs An assumption was made that driver demand will largely be focused on local delivery, which could be similar to local drayage markets that exist at ports. Thus, research is needed on how to make these positions more attractive, including mandating a living wage. The Potential Impacts to Drivers and Other Workers in the Delivery Process During the First Decades of AT Implementation Skill demands for drivers under Level 4 automation will be different, and potentially more mentally taxing. During this time, when drivers are not actively involved in the driving process, what can be done to keep them engaged and ready to take over if needed? The Location Choices of Warehouses, Distribution Centers, Manufacturing Factories, and Truck Stops in an AT Future There are important questions regarding how uncertainty will impact investment, something that will affect many stakeholders. Research that includes land-use and highway planners, etc. should certainly be part of this conversation. Optimization analysis needs to work on identifying the types of freight, the types of lanes/customers, and the types of motor carriers serving them, that justify AT investments. How the Current Truck Driving Workforce Can Be Integrated with ATs Do we train human drivers to adjust their driving style to that of ATs or should we program ATs to drive like human drivers, only safer? The Barriers to Effective Integration with ATs  With more pickup and delivery operations, how can well help older, less physically fit drivers do this work? Research is needed to understand whether the new generation of workers will be more or less interested in trucking as an occupation and whether they will have the additional technical skills and inclinations that might be needed. System Design to Enhance the Driver-AT Interaction and Interface Some attendees questioned whether truck drivers were being engaged in this discussion as anything more than an after-thought. Research is needed to understand how these technologies can be co-created with truck driver input. The Skills Truck Drivers Have That Could Transfer to New Jobs Created by ATs Research is needed to understand the existing skills that truck drivers have beyond the skills associated with driving a truck. Thus, there needs to be research with a representative sample of truck drivers to identify the range of potential skills that translate to other areas, especially STEM areas. The Cross-Disciplinary Research Challenges in Designing New Curricula for Reskilling Research is needed to understand and identify the new specific jobs (and skills) that will be required with the deployment of automated trucks The primary challenge in designing new curricula for reskilling truck drivers is this uncertainty of what jobs/skills will be required. Opportunities for Public-Private Partnerships in Reskilling Truck Drivers  Research is needed to understand how to best engage in this type of partnership with regard to reskilling truck drivers.
