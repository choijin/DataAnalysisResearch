<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to act as a catalyst in the growth of distributed generation and microgrid industries. This artificial intelligence based control system will potentially provide an electrical network that is reliable by reducing outages and restoration costs with incredibly fast bidirectional power flow, secured with real time diagnostics, self-healing and adaptive capabilities, and more economical by reducing equipment failures and minimizing power losses. The product potentially three broad markets, including utilities, distributed generation and consumer. The solution will enhance energy generation from renewables, improve microgrid efficiency, reliability, stability and power quality, and add intelligent control to conventional power systems. Inverter capabilities are presently a significant challenge for integrating distributed generation sources. The proposed innovation would potentially provide an appropriate solution to address this challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project develops a neural network control technology for microgrid control and management. Microgrids are one path for integrating renewable and distributed generation sources into the grid and can generally support a future smart electricity grid.  A key challenge in microgrid adoption is adequate control of power inverters. Problems include high oscillations when connecting or disconnecting an energy source, fluctuating voltage and frequency, malfunctions and reliability, competing control between inverters, and high harmonic distortions. The proposed innovation uses adaptive dynamic programming and artificial neural networks to implement microgrid control. It integrates into one controller the advantages of conventional control methods, including optimal control, proportional integral control, predictive control, and sliding mode control. The proposed innovation has the potential to overcome the limitations of the conventional control technologies and better meet customer demands and requirements.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Overview:</p> <p>This project aims to build a path toward the commercialization of a transformative and disruptive AI-driven real-time control technology for inverter-based resources (IBRs). The proposed technical approach is grounded on a deep understanding of a major shortcoming of the commonly used control solutions of inverters that exhibit a competing control nature when applied to a voltage source inverter (VSI) , which is the root cause for many irregular IBR operations reported by the industry. Without solving this fundamental limitation, abnormal IBR operations occur more and more often, and the power industry is still unable to find a viable solution to solve these problems. With our solution [US Patent 9,379,546 and 10,333,390], robust, reliable, and efficient IBR operations will be assured for either grid-tied or islanded integration of IBRs to the grid in grid-following (GFL), grid-forming (GFM), and hybrid manners. This is achieved via an innovative AI-driven IBR control technology. It overcomes the competing control deficiencies of existing control technologies and integrates traditional physics- and data-based inverter control solutions together into one AI-driven controller for reliable and robust IBR-grid integration. The project will bring broad economic and societal impacts to the United States as the nation&rsquo;s renewable penetration is expected to increase significantly in the coming years and several states have set the vision of 100% renewables in 2050.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Intellectual Merit:</p> <p>A VSI-based IBR requires a voltage control signal at its final stage before the PWM. In the existing standard vector control technology, for example, the d-axis (or q-axis) voltage control action generated by the d-axis (or q-axis) current or power controller actually, in theory, controls the q-axis (or d-axis) current. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the voltage control signal Vd from the active power controller actually contributes to the reactive power control while the voltage control signal Vq from the reactive power controller contributes to the active power control. These shortcomings of the existing technologies can cause an IBR into an irregular operation when the generated voltage signal is beyond the VSI PWM saturation constraints, which was found to be the root cause for many subsynchronous resonances, weak grid issues, harmonic instability, etc. reported in the literature. Our solution is built upon neural network (NN) and approximate dynamic programming (ADP) and involves a unique approach to assimilate physics-centric and data-centric strategies into the development of AI-driven IBR control technologies. Different from the existing technologies, our AI-driven controller obtains its control ability through learning. It is developed based on the full IBR system dynamic equation by precisely considering the coupling, uncertainty, and disturbance impacts for both GFM and GFL inverters. After the training, the controller learns how to achieve d-axis loop only, q-axis only, or joint d- and q-axis loop control based on a voltage control action offered in an optimal combination of information from all neurons instead of relying on one &ldquo;competing&rdquo; loop, as illustrated in Fig. 2. In addition, it integrates traditional physics- and data-based control approaches together through an interactive design and machine-learning mechanism at the training and/or implementation stages of the controller.
