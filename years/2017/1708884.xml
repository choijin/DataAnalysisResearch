<AbstractNarration>The International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation (ISSAC) is the premier annual conference to present and discuss new developments and original research results in all areas of symbolic mathematical computation.  In July 2018, ISSAC will be held at the CUNY Graduate Center in July 2018.   This travel award can defray travel and registration costs for selected US-based students and post-docs to participate, and for 3 eminent researchers to present educational tutorials.  Selection criteria can be found via http://www.issac-symposium.org/ several months before the event. The aim is to support junior researchers, especially researchers who are members of under-represented groups, to present their innovative ideas and research results and to interact with their peers, senior colleagues, and researchers from institutions inside and outside of the U.S. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary  This grant supported ISSAC (International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation) 2018 and 2019 conferences, which were the 43rd and 44th meetings in the series, which started in 1966 and has been held annually since 1981. The two supported conferences together featured 91 refereed contributed presentations, 6 tutorial lectures, 6 invited presentations, 11 refereed software demonstrations, 31 refereed poster presentations, as well as an ACM Student and Early Researcher Mentoring Session. The 2018 conference was held at the CUNY Graduate Center and New York University. The 2019 conference was held at Beihang University. The video recordings of presentations made at the conferences can be accessed at the YouTube channel of the ACM.  Intellectual Merit  The conference presentations contained highest quality results in symbolic and algebraic computation. The meetings resulted in forming new research collaborations, and new discoveries within the discipline have been made based on presentations. The algorithms and software that were presented at the conferences and that will be produced as a result of new discoveries based on discussions held at the conference could be used by researchers from other disciplines who use computer algebra systems (e.g., Maple, Mathematica, etc.).  Broader Impacts  The project provided more opportunities for junior researchers to interact with each other and with senior researchers who participated in the conference and to learn about the most recent research results and future research directions in the field. 13 junior researchers were supported to participate in ISSAC 2018, and 8 junior researchers were supported to participate in ISSAC 2019.  Both supported conferences had self-contained 3-hour introductory tutorial courses on specific subareas of computer algebra and symbolic computation, given by leading experts of the respective subarea. The level of a tutorial being similar to a graduate course, the tutorials were especially valuable for junior participants.
