<AbstractNarration>The workshop will consider future innovations in transportation technology and policies in the Arctic that could address challenges associated with rapid climate change. One transportation challenge, for example, is the limited network of roads which are now being undermined by permafrost thaw and flooding; while another challenge is the subsistence based rural economies which may face food shortages. The workshop will bring together a number of natural and social scientists and engineers with relevant expertise to consider how autonomous and robotic transportation might address transportation challenges of the new Arctic in the context of social, cultural, economic and environmental systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will consider future innovations in transportation technology and policies in the Arctic that could address challenges associated with rapid climate change. This workshop proposes not only to look at the technological and engineering advancements of robotic transportation but to expand collaborations between engineers, social and natural scientists in order to develop new convergent ways of thinking about this technology and its social and environmental impacts.  These issues are particularly relevant in the north because of the long distances, rural economies, fragile environments, and majority Indigenous communities that pose both opportunities and challenges to robotic transportation, particularly within the context of globalizing social and economic systems and environmental change.  The workshop will be structured to enhance convergent outcomes through a combination of lightning talks, co-design exercises and recombining the initial organizing committees into convergence teams. The workshop will promote convergence by focusing on the critical societal concern of limitations to inland transportation in the Arctic and by bringing together experts from many relevant disciplines of social science, natural science and engineering to devise new creative approaches to address these limitations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project explored how the rapidly changing Arctic enviroment and rapidly advancing robotic technology produce the need and opportunity for new systems of transportation to be created.  Changing climate, particularly as it affects permifrost, will dramaticaly alter where and how people and materials are transported.  Conventional methods of constucting and maintaining roads, already difficult, will become untenable.  Technologies for self-driving vehicles are focused on automobiles in urban and highway settings but these methods could be developed for use off-road and over snow and ice. This project produced a workshop that brought together Arctic physical and social scientists and robotics technologists to exchange information and ideas, education each other, and identify specific challenges and research opportunites.

The participation of Arctic communities will be crucial in formulating these systems, ensuring their succesfull implementation, and evaluating their benefit and consequences. Education, not simply new technologies, will be crucial in engaging society and ensuring effective use of new methods of transportation.  These and other recommendations were produced by the workshop.  A new community of researchers has formed and is collaborating to identify and pursue convergent research in Arctic transportation.
