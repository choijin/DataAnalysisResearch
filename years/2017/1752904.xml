<AbstractNarration>Carnegie-Mellon University proposes to engage leaders in computer science (CS) education in re-imagining the way CS is taught in response to 21st Century Challenges. Many CS departments are currently facing significant increases in undergraduate enrollment and much of the growth may be attributable to students who are interested not just in CS, but in CS combined with other computing-enabled disciplines. This trend could well accelerate as the national effort to increase access to computing and computational thinking in grades K-12 gains traction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project includes a 2-day workshop that will bring together 100 CS education experts from various colleges including research universities, liberal arts and minority-serving colleges, and community colleges, along with professional computing organizations and leading industry partners. It will focus on a number of key questions that seek to understand growing enrollment pressures in various types of colleges and regions, the need to continue efforts to increase diversity in computing, the readiness of the computing education community to embrace institutional changes that might, for example, provide multiple and/or multi-disciplinary pathways through their programs, and whether it is time for a larger summit of CS education leaders to start to develop a roadmap for broad and sustained change at the undergraduate level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Given the convergence of burgeoning enrollments in CS across many universities and colleges in the United States and the need to re-imagine the way computer science is taught to address 21st century challenges, the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University hosted a 2-day summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania using funding from the National Science Foundation.  The summit focused on reviewing recent reports about increasing enrollments and brainstorming ways that the education community, and supporting constituents such as computing organizations, governmental agencies and industry, could work toward a fundamental transformation in CS undergraduate education. The summit brought together over 75 CS education experts from various college levels, including research universities, liberal arts and minority colleges, community colleges, computing organizations and associations and leading industry partners to come up with common goals that can be brought to the greater CS education community.  The summit focused on a number of key questions that sought to understand growing enrollment pressures in various types of colleges and regions, the need to continue efforts to increase diversity in computing, the readiness of the computing education community to embrace institutional changes and whether it is time for a larger, broader summit of CS education leaders to start to develop a roadmap for broad and sustained change at the undergraduate level similar to a recent effort done in the field of biological sciences.  Results of the summit indicated a need for more resources to create tools to scale efforts already in place to handle large-scale instruction of computing at colleges and to disseminate these efforts widely and rapidly. The summit participants also described a great need to connect community college and minority-serving institutions with larger research universities and strong liberal arts colleges to provide more opportunities for engagement in computing, potentially leading to a more diverse population venturing into graduate study and a greater set of role models in computing for future generations. A summary report of the various breakout groups at the summit has been supplied to the National Science Foundation to help guide future programs to address enrollment growth and diversity measures.
