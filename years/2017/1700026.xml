<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the conference, "The 2017 Great Lakes Mathematical Physics Meeting," that will be held June 23-25, 2017, at Michigan State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the field of Mathematical Physics.  A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.  The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.  More information will be made available at http://instmathphys.msu.edu/glamp2017.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2017 Great Lakes Mathematical Physics focused on recent developments in the field of Mathematical Physics. The conference had 41 participants, of whom 34 were young researchers (postdocs and graduate students). David Damanik (Rice University) gave a mini-course on "The Mathematics of Aperiodic Order".  In addition there were five hour-long lectures by senior researchers:  Thomas Chen (UT Austin), "Dispersive theory for density matrices in quantum dynamics and kinetic theory" Ian Jauslin (IAS), "Crystalline ordering and large-fugacity expansion for hard-core lattice particle systems" Ramis Movassagh (IBM), "Quantum Information and Many-Body Science" Bob Sims (U Arizona), "Localization Properties of the Disordered XY Spin Chain" Mei Yin (U Denver), "Statistical physics of exponential random graphs"   In addition, there were 18 contributed talks by young researchers.    Mathematical Physics is a broad area of research in mathematics and theoretical physics, covering various sub-fields in which researchers apply techniques of matheamtics to study problems from physics.  The general goal is to illuminate and clarify physical theory by identifying and studying mathematical structures that are relevant to various models of the physical world.  The 2017 GLaMP meeting gave young researchers working in diverse areas of mathematical physics an opportunity to meet with each other and various senior researchers to discuss and learn about work in various different sub-fields.   In addition, we held a workshop on careers in mathematics and mathematical physics.  More information about the conference, including slides from the mini-course, is available at  http://instmathphys.msu.edu/glamp2017.
