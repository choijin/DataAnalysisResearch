<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pilot field test controlled release polymers (CRPs) as an in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) remediation material. With a controlled time release of the oxidant payload, the CRPs technology treats contaminated water over longer periods eliminating the occurrence of contaminant rebound resulting in overall shorter cleanup time and total cost. ISCO is the fastest growing field among sub surface contaminant remediation technologies. Current commercial ISCO deployment methods utilize liquid oxidants as reagents which possess short term reactivity (days). To address contaminant rebounding, these injectable formulations require costly re-injections. This project would result in a novel product that is environmentally  benign  and  achieves sustained release  of  oxidative  agents  over extended  treatment  periods  (months  to years)  with  a  single application. CRPs are a novel technology, offering a highly tunable remediation amendment for the $1.4B Chemical Treatment Remediation Market. Ultimately, CRPs based treatments will decrease exposure to groundwater contaminants known to cause many human health disorders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objectives in this Phase II research project will be to field test CRPs patented, controlled release polymer technology for in situ chemical oxidation of contaminated groundwater.  To support field testing, a pilot scale manufacturing process for the initial minimum viable product established in Phase I will be developed. Manufacturability will be tested in terms of product quality and stability, throughput, and cost. CRPs formulations based on multiple oxidants, will be manufactured to address a broad range of environmental contaminants including chlorinated solvents, BTEX (benzene/toluene/ethylbenzene/xylene), PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether), and petroleum hydrocarbons. CRPs will be pilot tested at two field sites with impacted soil and groundwater. The rate and duration of oxidant delivery and contaminant degradation will be measured. In particular, pilot field testing will assess the ability of CRPs to eliminate rebounding. Field data and computation modeling will be used to create a remediation design tool to prescribe future CRP dosing deployment strategies. Collectively, this Phase II program will result in a clear understanding of in-field performance of the CRPs technology to guide future full scale deployment and market uptake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

With tens of thousands of contaminated sites in the US alone, the environmental professionals responsible for designing remediation plans face many issues ranging from cost to safety. One of the biggest pain-points for these project managers is contaminant rebounding, which is the reoccurrence of contaminant levels following a remedial treatment. Rebounding increases cost by at least 50% and prolongs the time needed to reach "No Further Action" status (i.e., job completion) by months to years. More broadly, the impact of contaminant rebounding is increasing the risk of ecological exposure to the lingering environmental contamination.              Currently, periodic liquid injections of chemical oxidants are one option for treating contaminated sites.

This STTR Phase II program focused on demonstrating RemRx&trade; CRP efficacy in the field at pilot scale. Specific objectives of this Phase II program included: testing a scaleable and sustainable manufacturing process to produce RemRx&trade; CRP; performing two in-field pilot tests to demonstrate controlled release of oxidant over extended times (e.g., years); developing a remedial design tool to inform appropriate RemRx&trade; CRP deployment strategies; and designing full-scale deployment scenarios where RemRx&trade; CRP could remediate a wide range of contaminants in various hydrogeologies. Market feedback was received throughout the program by interviewing various stakeholders in order to maximize the commercialization potential of our groundwater remediation technology.      Key Phase I Accomplishments:   Optimized CRP persulfate formulation      for robust, stable form; Successfully tested our manufacturing      process for RemRx&trade; CRP that meets production requirements, reproducibility,      product specifications, safety considerations, and economic requirements; Completed two pilot field tests:      one of RemRx&trade; CRP permanganate and one of RemRx&trade; CRP persulfate; Proved controlled oxidant release      in the field, demonstrating oxidant release maintained up to 2 years; Achieved contaminant reduction      between 20-90% site wide at one pilot test site. Created a proprietary remedial design      tool that allows for prescriptive, site-specific deployment strategies for      RemRx&trade; CRP. Designed      full-scale deployments for twenty-two different sites of varied size,      contaminant type, hydrogeology, and remedial goals.  Solidified our      go-to-market strategy and next steps for Phase III.      In summary, this Phase II STTR program tested our RemRx&trade; CRP technology is real-world environments. Key resources were established including manufacturing, engineering design, and analytical testing capabilities. Key activities including regulatory approval, securing intellectual property, and identifying innovator/early adopter customer segments were achieved to support the commercialization efforts.
