<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation research will utilize multiple sedimentary and organic geochemical proxies to develop a high-resolution record of past hurricane activity at two sites on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico.  The research will provide a better understanding about the hydrologic processes that influence deposition during hurricanes, as well as serve a proxy for marine incursion events independent of overwash sand layers.  When applied on a regional level, the research has the potential of providing new mechanisms for investigating past storm activity in regions that presently lack paleohurricane reconstructions.  Findings from this research will be used for coastal management and risk assessment, and will be directly relevant to environmental managers, community planners and coastal emergency management officials.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reconstruction of past hurricane activity is largely reliant on sedimentary proxies of overwash due to hurricane storm surge. A primary objective of this project is to develop a new proxy of pre-historic hurricane activity by determining the source(s) of organic matter associated with hurricane overwash deposits. The project will collect sedimentary cores and perform multiple laboratory analyses including chronological, sedimentary, geochemistry, isotopic and biomarker analysis.  The combination of stable isotope and biomarker analyses would provide a sensitive indicator of storm events and will be used to assess whether such overwash deposits contain organic matter derived from marine sources.  This method will also provide information about the complex interactions of storm surge and in-shore flooding processes which are not yet well understood. Determining the relationships between these processes is necessary for predicting the response of coastal environments to future storm impacts, and are important considerations for coastal resource management.</AbstractNarration>

A detailed analysis of shoreline retreat at a coastal lake in Louisiana showed the site is progressively becoming more sensitive to hurricane impacts, which influences the way hurricane overwash events are recorded at that site. Over the past 35 years, nearly 300 m of coastal land has been lost to shoreline retreat, at an average rate of 12 m per year. During a period of high hurricane frequency from 1998 &ndash; 2013, this average shoreline retreat rate jumped to over 21 m per year. These results indicate that hurricanes are a major cause of shoreline retreat, and that the rate of coastal land loss in the Gulf of Mexico is not necessarily constant. This trend is also apparent on longer time scales. An analysis of historic maps showed shoreline retreat of over 2 km in the past 130 years, coincident with profound environmental changes that were detectable within several sediment cores collected from the same coastal lake in Louisiana. Analysis of these cores show the site underwent a gradual transition from an inland freshwater lake to a brackish backbarrier lagoon and was subjected to increasingly more frequent marine inundations, likely through hurricane storm surge overwash processes. This indicates that this site has become more sensitive to hurricane impacts over time, meaning that hurricane deposition at this site is recorded differently today than it was in the past. This change is important for reconstructing past hurricane activity and interpreting pre-historic hurricane records, as increasing site sensitivity could lead to inaccurate hurricane frequency counts.
