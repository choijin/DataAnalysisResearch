<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop new low cost, high performance tooling materials for composite manufacturing. The use of advanced fiber reinforced composites in aircraft has become a necessity to achieve higher performance and greater fuel efficiencies.  Boeing?s 787 and Airbus?s A350 are two such aircraft that exemplify the push to increase composite content above 50% by weight.  There is a similar push in other transportation vehicles as well. A large opportunity exists for RTM process technology to reduce costs and streamline composite manufacturing operations.  Phase I results will have a large impact on the composites industry through cost reduction and manufacturing efficiency gains. It will allow a broader manufacturing base to produce composite parts.  Society will see benefits through the broader use of fuel efficient composites in air and land based vehicles.  The technology developed can generate $10-$20M in annual revenue within 5 years of the program end. This effort will also foster collaboration between Advanced Ceramics Manufacturing and large aerospace manufacturers.  Undergraduates at the University of Arizona and local high school students will have an opportunity to work on the project.  Results of this research will be disseminated in multidisciplinary conferences and journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is developing low cost materials and manufacturing processes that enable composite materials to be produced in high rate resin transfer molding (RTM). Compared to autoclave based processes, RTM offers several key advantages.  This includes: high internal and external geometric complexity, less waste, lower volatile emissions, higher production rates, and excellent surface finish.  However, the injection of high pressure ? high temperature resin presents a tooling challenge.  Tooling can be a limiting factor for utilizing RTM as the preferred manufacturing route. A large opportunity exists for new tooling technology that can withstand RTM conditions and be easily extracted from the composite after the cure cycle.  A soluble RTM capable material will allow RTM applications to grow and reduce the cost of composite manufacturing. The project will develop a new soluble binder-aggregate system that can withstand all RTM process conditions.  The results of the Phase I will demonstrate a low cost RTM compatible tooling system that can be formed at high rate and used in high rate composite RTM cycles.</AbstractNarration>
