<AbstractNarration>Informal science educators, researchers, and evaluators are interested in directly engaging with the challenges and opportunities of increasing diversity and meaningful intersectionality. The annual meetings of organizations like the American Alliance of Museums (AAM), the Association of Science and Technology Centers (ASTC), and the Visitors Studies Association (VSA) have consistently featured sessions relevant to these topics. NSF's goal of broadening participation means there are also project specific efforts currently underway to directly address methods and strategies for increasing diversity and inclusion in STEM. The Connected Audience Conference will provide an opportunity to engage in an international conversation that directly leverages this momentum and has the potential to motivate focused collective action among participants producing a greater impact on the field. This travel award supports an enhanced U.S. presence at the Connected Audience International Conference to be held in Vienna, Austria September 14-16, 2017. The premise of the meeting is that the role of museums and other cultural institutions in society is rapidly changing as these institutions strive to become more vital resources and partners in initiatives designed to support science learning, social development and growth in an increasingly science and technology-driven world. The goal for U.S. participation is to support established researchers in this area as well as mid-career professionals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting is comprised of: thought leaders, case study presenters, poster presenters and general participants. Thought leaders will highlight theoretical and practical approaches to broadening participation designed to be provocative and stimulate discussion in the breakout sessions. Case study presenters will be paired to illustrate similarities and/or differences in project design, implementation, or outcomes. Structuring the case studies in this way supports conversations focused on cross-country and cross-institution synergies. The poster session presenters were selected and grouped to encourage productive and comparisons specifically exploring the potential for cross-cutting methods to more effectively engage with audiences. U.S. attendees supported under this travel grant represent those who are engaged in this work actively and positioned to continue making important contributions to the field. International participants represent a range of cultural institutions with the largest proportion attending from science centers and children's museums; however, all participants come because of their interest, concerns and expertise in issues related to equity and greater participation. The structure of the meeting will provide participants with significant time for iterative reflection and active discussion to make each session personally relevant and meaningful. This intentionally allows lots of room for pushback and even outright disagreement with any of the ideas proposed by the thought leaders, case study presenters, and poster session presenters. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This award is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences.  The Connected Audience conference is designed to significantly contribute to an international conversation about the future of informal science education institutions in the learning ecologies of 21st century citizens. Through exploration of new findings and international cross-pollination of best practices, conference participants will be able to develop improved strategies for increasing and diversifying who participates in informal science education experiences as well as how they participate. A white paper written by the U.S. participants will be used to share findings and insights with the broader informal education field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A select group of approximately 100 international policy makers, museum administrators, researchers, evaluators, and museum design and education professionals from 20 countries met in Vienna, Austria September 17-19, 2017 to explore how to enhance the capabilities for broadening participation within and across free-choice science and cultural learning institutions.  The meeting was co-designed and co-facilitated by the Institute for Learning Innovation and Kulture Agenda of Austria.  This three-day working meeting was designed to begin to affect change within participants? own institutions in ways that are reflective of emerging global best practices related to issues of diversity and audience needs. With support from the National Science Foundation, the participation of eight U.S. informal science professionals were partially or completely subsidized.  In all cases, these participants would not have been able to participate in this important international meeting without NSF support.     A key focus was on how museums and other informal education institutions can begin to more effectively respond to and meet audience needs in the 21st century.  Worldwide the needs, demographics and expectations of the public are changing and free-choice learning institutions need to proactively, re-think how they deal with their diverse publics.  Speakers emphasized the need for informal institutions to adapt if they expect to successfully compete in the world?s rapidly changing education and leisure marketplace. Also discussed were how institutions can be more responsive to the highly personalized and diverse histories and needs of their audiences; particularly traditionally under-represented audiences. The meeting served as unique professional learning opportunity for each of the participants, both European and American.  Each participant came away from the experience with greater knowledge of how these issues are being addressed across the field. U.S. participants learned new approaches about these issues from their European colleagues that they could bring back to their institutions, while Europeans learned as well from the contributions of their American colleagues.  The post-conference evaluation revealed that participants overwhelmingly viewed this conference as useful and necessary ? particularly for the European community, as there are fewer Visitor Studies learning opportunities in their region. The majority of respondents indicated that meeting had already had an impact on their everyday practice.  The evaluation also revealed numerous examples of on-going, post-meeting national and international collaborations between participants, including between U.S. and European institutions.
