<AbstractNarration>Part I Project Significance and Importance&lt;br/&gt;Hurricane Harvey has caused unprecedented damage to wastewater infrastructure in southeastern Texas, resulting in the release of sewage contamination into surface waters and the potential for widespread microbial pathogen exposure to humans. This proposal seeks to understand the potential for human exposure to pathogens and assess the extent of wastewater releases during Hurricane Harvey. Comparisons of transport and other factors measured during the study will be made with the objective of building a predictive framework for assessing wastewater contamination following severe flooding. The investigation will focus on smaller towns in southeast and lower central Texas rural locations to provide much needed and urgent data on the effects of sewage spillages on the water quality of smaller towns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part II Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hypothesis of this research is that sewage overflows and stormwater runoff during and after Harvey have released high levels of potentially pathogenic organisms into Texas waterways. This hypothesis will be tested by evaluating the presence, abundance and fate of fecal indicator bacteria, human mitochondrial DNA and selected human pathogens in flood-impacted surface waters in southeast and lower central Texas rural locations. Specific measurements include the quantitative analysis of fecal indicator organisms (E. coli, Enterococci, and Human-specific Bacteroidales), together with human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and selected human pathogens (E. coli O157:H7, Campylobacter spp., Vibrio spp.) in water and sediment samples. This project will advance fundamental understanding of fecal source tracking and expand the understanding of fecal indicators for identifying sources of fecal contamination in coastal and surface waters through the use of human mtDNA as a direct measure of fecal contamination.</AbstractNarration>
