<AbstractNarration>Understanding how extreme events, like hurricanes, impact coastal ecosystems and the cycling of elements like carbon and oxygen, is important for improving our ability to predict how the global carbon cycle will respond to climate. This team of investigators, who have already been working together on understanding the carbon cycle in the Gulf of Mexico continental shelves, have important recent data against which to measure the effects of the passage of Hurricane Harvey in August, 2017. They will sample the waters and sediments of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico in September, October, and January to assess Harvey's impacts on a timescale of weeks to months. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers pose three specific questions: 1. Will the region become a major source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, releasing carbon accumulated in the bottom water and sediments, and will this potential impact be faster and greater than during normal fall and winter mixing events? Will this process acidify the surface water and for how long? 2. Will the metabolic balance be substantially pushed toward net heterotrophy as a result of the storm in comparison to other years? 3. Can the amount of material delivered or redeposited across the continental shelf by a tropical cyclone be considerably larger than that related to winter storm systems? The PIs will measure water column nutrients, oxygen, organic carbon, and inorganic carbon system parameters; determine water column and benthic metabolic and nutrient flux rates; and sediment organic matter deposition rates. They will also collect end member river samples. They will compare the immediate (mid-Sept) but limited post-hurricane data and one-month post-hurricane, more detailed data with those collected in July and April to study the impacts of the storms. they will also compare 2017-2018 seasonal data to seasonal data over the same region collected in the past (2006-2008 and 2009-2010). They will also compare the impacts of Hurricane Harvey to those of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (2005) and Tropical Storm Cindy (June 2017). The project will involve graduate and postdoctoral research and work to communicate results to the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching major scientific goal of this collaborative project was to discern impacts of a major storm event (Hurricane Harvey) on carbon cycling, community metabolism, and phytoplankton community composition. The effort comprised an examination of post-hurricane conditions in the northern Gulf of Mexico following Hurricane Harvey and comparison to available pre- and post-hurricane observations related to carbon and nutrient cycles, metabolic balance, ocean acidification and phytoplankton biomass and community composition.  The specific goals of this PI?s portion of the project were the following:  1.  To analyze water samples for inorganic nutrient and dissolved organic carbon (on a subset of samples) concentrations during two cruises in the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) following the passage of Hurricane Harvey.   2.  To examine and compare these new observations with data acquired on cruises prior to the storm (April and July 2017) and following the storm (January 2018) and during similar times of the year from past studies in the same region of the nGOM.  3.  To combine our data with collaborators to examine the integrated impact of major storm events on carbon cycling, community metabolism, and phytoplankton community composition.   The passage of Hurricane Harvey in late August and Hurricane Nate in October (during our cruise) resulted in the water column in the nGOM, particularly the western portions in the paths of both hurricanes, being largely mixed for extended periods.  Overall across the sampling region of the broader shelf, concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients and organic carbon were greater during the pre-hurricane period (April and July) than immediately after (September and October) the passage of Hurricane Harvey. Overall, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were inversely correlated with site depth, with the lowest concentrations at the deepest sites furthest from the coasts. During the summer, DOC concentrations were always significantly higher at the surface than the bottom, while during the fall we typically observed no significant difference between surface and bottom DOC concentrations. DIN concentrations away from the river outlets were typically lower in the surface than bottom waters in the summer but the pattern was much weaker after the passage of Hurricane Harvey.  The results from this effort demonstrated a significant impact of Hurricane Harvey nutrient and organic carbon dynamics as well as chlorophyll concentrations and phytoplankton community composition, a massive remobilization of surface sediments, and increased water column and sediment respiration resulting in dissolved oxygen uptake and dissolved inorganic carbon release.  The net result of these impacts was the region temporarily turning from a CO2 sink to a source and the surface waters becoming transiently acidified. The large amount of data generated from this ongoing, multi-disciplinary collaborative effort will greatly improve our understanding of the impacts of hurricanes on nutrient and carbon cycling in coastal environments.
