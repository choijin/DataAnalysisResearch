<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2017 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Nicholas K. Salter is "Surface Bundles, Mapping Class Groups, and Moduli of Riemann Surfaces." The host institution for the fellowship is Harvard University, and the sponsoring scientist is Joseph Harris.</AbstractNarration>
