<AbstractNarration>A unifying characteristic of all life forms is the need to acquire resources. Resources relating to food and feeding, also known as trophic resources, have been a leading factor in driving the diversity of life on this planet. One of every three living vertebrate species is an acanthomorph fish, a group of spiny-ray finned fishes that includes cichlids and many reef fishes. Members of this group consume a wide variety of resources, ranging from scraping scales off other fish, filtering plankton from the water, biting off chunks of coral, or actively hunting other vertebrates. How effectively the fish feed on these resources is intimately connected to their physical anatomy, especially how well the fish can maneuver and capture prey. Some anatomical traits are thought to lead to increased speciation or decreased extinction rates (these are known as key innovations) but may limit possible flexibility in diet evolution. This is the key question addressed by this research. In addition, this research compares how communities of different ages are shaped by their trophic ecologies. Acanthomorphs are also common aquarium fish, providing a great opportunity to educate the public about form and function in biology, which this research will do by producing interactive software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the ecological factors that generate and maintain diversity is a major goal in biological research. Trophic ecology is one such factor and is a major driver of evolution. Acanthomorph fishes provide the perfect system to study trophic evolution as they are extremely speciose and diverse in their trophic ecology and morphology. Specifically, this research investigates how trophic ecology may promote or constrain rates of morphological evolution, how morphological key innovations may constrain or promote rates of diet evolution, and how communities of different ages may have different patterns of trophic evolution that have shaped the respective fish fauna. This research will use comparative phylogenetic methods and, for young radiations, phylogenomics, to elucidate relationships of species and test these hypotheses in a comparative evolutionary framework. This research will provide insight into how diet evolves and the macroevolutionary consequences that trophic ecology has on morphology.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>All life must acquire resources for survival. Resource acquisition has had a profound effect on the evolution of life on earth. Understanding how resource use promotes or constrains evolution through time may unravel biological patterns and processes. For example, trophic resources (resources related to feeding and nourishment) drive biodiversity. We investigated how trophic resources, specifically dietary specialization, and associated traits (e.g. specialized jaws for feeding) have affected broadscale evolutionary patterns in ray-finned fishes, the most species rich group of vertebrates. Fish are extremely diverse in their feeding habits; diets range from plants to other vertebrates. Diet may influence traits, especially those related to prey capture, which may either promote or constrain aspects of trait evolution. Some traits, known as evolutionary innovations, associated with diet may promote the success of certain evolutionary lineages by allowing them access to new adaptive zones. By using a combination of phylogenetic comparative methods, diet data, and functional morphology, we tested hypotheses related to the impact of trophic ecology on evolutionary patterns.</p> <p>In coral reef fishes, we found that species that specialize at the extremes of trophic levels have the greatest morphological diversity and fastest rates of evolution for morphological traits associated with feeding. These species have very narrow diet breadths and specialize on feeding exclusively on plants and fishes, respectively. Omnivorous taxa, species that feed the most broadly across available prey, had the slowest rates of trait evolution. This result conflicts with the expectation (based on prior literature) that morphological diversity and rates of evolution should be greatest in taxa with broad diets. Our results reveal the importance of trophic position in shaping evolutionary dynamics, as well as highlight the incredible trophic and morphological diversity present in coral reef fish assemblages. We also investigated how a proposed evolutionary innovation, pharyngognathy, affects evolutionary patterns in ray-finned fishes. Phayrngognathy is a condition in which the second set of jaws in a fish's throat (the pharyngeal jaws) have been heavily modified. It has been hypothesized that this provides benefits to fish that possess this condition, as it allows their oral jaws to capture food and the pharyngeal jaws to process it. Thus, this condition might provide fish with access to a greater wealth of prey, which might drive the evolutionary success of phayrngognathous fish. Our results suggest that pharyngognathy does not yield increased diversification rates in fish lineages that possess the trait, contrary to what was previously hypothesized. Additionally, pharyngognathous fishes do not have substantially different rates of trophic evolution. They occupy the same adaptive zones as non-pharyngognathous fishes in dietary space and possess similar diet breadths. These results suggest that pharyngognathy does not lead to increased diversification and ecological diversity, as previously suggested in the context of the trait as an evolutionary innovation. This highlights the need to broadly test evolutionary innovations using phylogenetic comparative methods.</p> <p>As part of this grant, one undergraduate student conducted research, gave a public presentation, and began drafting a publication. Results from this research were used in teaching a grade 1-8 class on fish biology as part of the University of Tennessee's KidsU program. As fish are common aquarium pets, the co-PI presented this research to aquarium clubs. We have published two papers and an R software package for conducting trophic ecological analysis. An additional R package that provides access to the California Academy of Sciences Catalog of Fishes is in late stage development and two additional manuscripts describing the results are in late draft stages.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/27/2020<br>      Modified by: Samuel&nbsp;R&nbsp;Borstein</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1701913/1701913_10471973_1603775334926_PJA_Distribution--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1701913/1701913_10471973_1603775334926_PJA_Distribution--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Pharyngognathous Fishes in the Fish Tree of Life"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1701913/1701913_10471973_1603775334926_PJA_Distribution--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Pharyngognathous Fishes in the Fish Tree of Life"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Pharyngognathy is a purported evolutionary innovation found in seven families of fishes (shown in red) and has evolved an estimated six times.
