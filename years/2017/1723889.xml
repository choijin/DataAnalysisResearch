<AbstractNarration>This grant award provides support for the 2017, 2018, and 2018 Annual Phenomenology (PHENO) Symposia at the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, under the direction of Professor Tao Han.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the Annual Phenomenology (PHENO) Symposia is to present and discuss state-of-the-art results in theoretical and experimental particle physics;  to stimulate new ideas in cutting-edge research and foster collaborations among physicists;  and to encourage the participation of junior physicists and nurture their career development.   In recent years, the annual PHENO conferences have been devoted, in large part, to studying the physics that might emerge from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva, Switzerland, and to the connections between these experimental results and results from other collider- and non-collider-based experiments in both elementary particle physics and astrophysics and cosmology.  Junior physicists are especially encouraged to attend the Pheno Symposia.  Indeed, a characteristic feature of the PHENO Conferences is the significant involvement of junior physicists (graduate students and postdocs) attending from many institutions in the US and abroad.  Physicists from under-represented groups are also specifically recruited and well represented.   As a result, the PHENO Conferences have become nothing less than the largest professional student meetings in high-energy physics in the United States.   As such, this grant serves the national interest by supporting the development of a cutting-edge scientific infrastructure in the United States and the training of junior physicists to take part in the most current research developments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    PITT PACC once again successfully held the 3-day "Phenomenology 2019 Symposium", during May 6-8, 2019. There were 296 registrants from 28 States, 20 countries. The high quality plenary program brought the participants to the most updated cutting-edge research by the world leading experts in particle physics, astro-particle physics and cosmology.       The plenary talks were selected from a broad range of theoretical and experimental topics of current importance. They were split between 10 theorist talks and 8 experimentalist talks.      The 182 talks in the parallel sessions offer a great forum for presenting specific research results, especially for students and postdocs. Presentataion and discussion are of the state-of-the-art results in the field of high energy physics, and involvement of jonior researchers.  A special career development forum was held for the 150 student participants.       Graduate students and postdocs made up a significant part of our participants this year. In fact, one of the trademarks of the Pheno Symposium is the large participation by students. It boasts the largest number of student presentations about their research in any high energy physics meeting in the US. Many students give their first-ever conference talk at our Pheno symposium. A breakdown of the percentages of students and postdocs of the participants and parallel session talks follows:  Student percentage of participants: 50% Postdoc percentage of participants: 19% Student percentage of parallel session talks: 59% Postdoc percentage of parallel sessions talks: 31%              Last Modified: 07/08/2020       Submitted by: Tao Han]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
