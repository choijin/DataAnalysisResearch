<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to support the deployment of the newly developed C-band Doppler, polarization radar on the research vessel (R/V) Roger Revelle to support the SPURS-2 cruise, to be conducted in the eastern tropical Pacific intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) near 10N-125W from mid-October to mid-November 2017. SEA-POL will mark the first deployment of a polarimetric Doppler radar to study tropical convection from a ship platform. The project seeks to gain new insights into tropical deep cloud formations including how these deep clouds (called "convection") respond to sea surface temperature (SST) changes and the modulation of ITCZ convection by Easterly Waves.  Soundings launched from the ship will be used to characterize the environmental convective available potential energy (CAPE) and shear to provide important context for the radar measurements. New ideas will be explored on spectral processing of the received radar signals to suppress sea clutter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most important features of this EAGER project are that: (i) it provides a seaborne polarimetric radar platform (previously tested on land) deployed on an ocean field campaign (SPURS-2), (ii) will provide unprecedented observations of cloud microphysical processes in both tropical convection and stratiform cloud structures, and (iii) the field study will verify stated goals of the previously funded NSF MRI project to develop the SEA-POL radar.  This project supports the creation of rain maps to support the science team during the SPURS-2 deployment at sea.  Rainfall data will be used in conjunction with other onboard experiments from the same research vessel and to validate satellite estimates of ocean salinity.  The results of this field campaign will be of interest to the radar community and, more broadly, to those interested in the microphysical processes of clouds and rainfall at sea ? particularly associated with the ITCZ.  This project will also fund the training of one postdoctoral research scientist and a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Under this award, the Colorado State University&rsquo;s new SEA-POL (seagoing-polarimetric) radar was deployed on the R/V Roger Revelle to support the SPURS-2 field campaign. SPURS-2 aimed to document the impact of freshwater (in the form of rain) on the salty ocean water. Since rain (freshwater) is less dense than the salty ocean water, the freshwater &ldquo;puddles&rdquo; produced by rainfall do not readily mix downward and therefore can be heated by the Sun&rsquo;s energy and thereby provide focus points for new convection (especially under light wind conditions). This process is poorly understood and SPURS-2 observations are expected to improve model simulations of this process, including climate models. The R/V Roger Revelle departed San Diego on 16 October 2017 and worked in the area of the east tropical Pacific Ocean for approximately 30 days, returning to San Diego on 17 November 2017. SEA-POL marked the first time that the U.S. deployed a polarimetric Doppler radar (C-band) on a research ship. The SEA-POL radar was built in house at CSU under support of a Major Research Instrumentation award from the NSF. Copious observations of rainfall were observed by SEA-POL and the radar worked very well on its maiden voyage. A picture of SEA-POL installed on the forward deck of the R/V Roger Revelle is shown in an attached figure. The radar itself is contained in the seatainer, with the radar antenna and other components contained in the large radome. The radome protects the antenna and various electrical components from the harsh saltwater environment. SEA-POL operated 24/7 while at sea.</p> <p>SEA-POL was deployed to map rainfall, identified as patches of fresh water created on the ocean&rsquo;s surface. Other instruments were then used to measure the reduction in salinity and how rapidly the salinity gradient mixed out, especially as a function of wind speed and other factors. Custom radar scans were designed to produce rain maps extending to 100 km from the ship, providing 3-5 minute temporal resolution. Rain was mapped using radar reflectivity as well as two of SEA-POL&rsquo;s polarimetric variables, differential reflectivity and specific differential phase. This algorithm is very sophisticated and was developed over the course of several years of research at CSU. SEA-POL also was used to study the dynamics and microphysics of convective systems over the ocean.</p> <p>&nbsp;A very interesting finding during SPURS-2 is the distribution of convective and stratiform rain points and convective and stratiform rain rates based on SEA-POL observations. Another attached figure summarizes these results. For raining points, only 18% of the pixels containing echo were identified as convective, compared to 81% stratiform. Interestingly, 76% of the rain volume was convective, compared to 23% stratiform. We note with interest that these values are very close to what was learned from the DYNAMO field campaign using two-dimensional video disdrometers, where 81% of the rain volume was convective with the remaining 19% contributed by stratiform rain. The convective fractions are higher than previous fractions which are more like 60/40; 70/30 based on years of research using radar data to identify and separate convective and stratiform rainfall. We reason that these higher convective rain fractions are due to the better detection of rain from shallow, ubiquitous convective warm rain showers by the 2DVD instruments, and the higher resolution of the SEA POL antenna (1 deg. beamwidth) compared to earlier ship radars used since GATE (1.5-1.6 deg. beamwidths). We believe the local peak near 8 mm/h in the convective rain rate PDF is attributed to copious warm rain showers over tropical oceans. The convective peak near 20-30 mm/h is associated with more intense convection involving the melting of graupel and ice particles. Why is this partitioning between convective and stratiform rainfall of interest? This partitioning impacts the heating of the tropical atmosphere by convective systems, which is a major source energy that drives the large-scale wind field in the tropics, with couplings to the mid-latitudes. Characteristic heating profiles of convection and stratiform precipitation are weighted by these relative rainfall fractions. The resulting impact on the tropical general circulation is quite sensitive to this partitioning.</p> <p>&nbsp;CSU extends their sincere appreciation to NSF for supporting this exciting research.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/15/2018<br>      Modified by: Steven&nbsp;A&nbsp;Rutledge</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1742760/1742760_10502664_1534347750327_Convective_Stratiformraindistribution--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1742760/1742760_10502664_1534347750327_Convective_Stratiformraindistribution--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Convective and stratiform rainfall distribution"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1742760/1742760_10502664_1534347750327_Convective_Stratiformraindistribution--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Convective and stratiform rainfall distribution"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The frequency distribution of convective and stratiform rain rates from the SPURS-s cruise. 18% of the raining points are convective and 81% are stratiform.
