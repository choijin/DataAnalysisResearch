<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gruev, Victor&lt;br/&gt;1603933&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, cancer surgeons use their naked eye and palpitation because other imaging technologies are not conducive to the operating room. This proposal deals with the design of an image-guided surgical platform where surgeons would wear goggles and a specialized imaging device to obtain an enhanced view of the boundaries of a tumor site&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While many imaging technologies exist, none are conducive to the operating room either due to size or incompatibility with surgical tools. To address current limitations the PIs propose a biologically inspired solution that mimics the compound eye of the mantis shrimp. They will employ pixelated filters with a transmission ratio of 90% and the pixel pitch will match that of a CMOS photodiode array</AbstractNarration>
