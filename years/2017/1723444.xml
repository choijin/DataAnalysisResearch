<AbstractNarration>This project will organize the first annual PI Meeting for the NSF Big Data Hubs and Big Data Spokes programs. This meeting will be held in conjunction with the PI meeting of the NSF BIGDATA program. Together, these meetings convene all Principal Investigators in these programs. The meeting is to take place on March 15-17, 2017 in Washington DC. This will be an opportunity for academic researchers, industry participants, and representatives from government agencies to interact, learn about the latest research and applications in Big Data, identify opportunities for collaboration, future research directions, and funding opportunities, and to discuss barriers and gaps. The meeting will consist of invited talks, presentations by researchers funded through these programs, panels with academic, industry, and government representatives, a poster session, and multiple topical breakout sessions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF is funding research through its programs in Big Data to cover all aspects of the Big Data ecosystem, including infrastructure development, methodological progress, application development, and community-building. These research programs cover mathematical, statistical, and algorithmic foundations, the development of new technologies and techniques, hardware and software infrastructure-building, and applications requiring innovative uses of Big Data. The PI meeting will serve an the main opportunity for all these communities to come together and explore new ideas and partnerships. This meeting is expected to play a major role in growing the Big Data community across a broad range of sectors and technologies, and performing outreach to others interested in learning about these programs and contributing as future proposers, sponsors, or partners.</AbstractNarration>

Students benefited from being exposed to research and ideas from outside their disciplines, and learned about the range of work being done outside academia in the Big Data ecosystem.  There were a number of sessions on March 16 and 17, including invited talks, panel discussions, "lightning" presentations of projects (one minute, one slide), and poster sessions. Some details are presented below. The full schedule, including slides, is available at https://www.bi.vt.edu/nsf-big-data/schedule.  The keynote talk on March 16 was given by Dr. Amen Ra Mashariki, of the Mayor?s Office of Data Analytics (MODA) of the City of New York. He presented examples of problems MODA has worked on, which require complex data assimilation and rapid response. He also discussed the platforms and practices NYC is building to facilitate better informed decision-making.  The first panel discussion, titled "Federal Collaborations, Data, Funder's Panel", involved representatives from NASA, DHS, NIH, and USDOT. They discussed the various kinds of data available through their agencies, challenges in managing and sense-making from these data, and funding opportunities.  This was followed by a "Real World Data Challenges" panel. Participants from Research Data Alliance, Elsevier, Internet 2, and University of Illinois, discussed multiple issues including data sharing challenges, infrastructure, community building around data, and more.  The afternoon sessions started with an Industry panel, with representatives from Google, Intel, Microsoft, Amazon, and the Tokyo Institute of Technology talking about Big Data infrastructures and initiatives being developed in industry.  This was followed by a Lightning Talk session, where 44 projects were presented by researchers, each being allocated 1 slide and 1 minute. The projects presented spanned a range of topics, both theoretical and applied.  Representatives from multiple NSF directorates comprised the next panel, discussing various funding opportunities as well as the NSF vision for fundamental research and education to support innovation in Big Data and Data Science.  The final session of the day was a poster session, combined with a networking reception.  Sessions on March 17 were devoted to the NSF Big Data Hubs and Spokes programs. Dr. Fen Zhao (NSF) began by giving a brief overview of the programs. She also provided information about the next round of the solicitation.  This was followed by a panel discussion featuring the Executive Directors of the four NSF Big Data Hubs.
