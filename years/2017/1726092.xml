<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Professor Hairong Guan from the University of Cincinnati and colleagues are acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonace (NMR) spectrometer. An NMR spectrometer analyzes signals from atomic nuclei in a sample stimulated by light from the spectrometer. This enables the identification of the atoms (for example, hydrogen, carbon etc.) in the compound. This analytic technique is used to study chemicals, drugs, and proteins or to identify unknown substances. This NMR spectrometer is used to develop energy storage materials, environmentally benign reagents and materials for drug delivery and medical applications. Undergraduate and upper level students are trained in the use of this powerful tool preparing them for future careers in academia or industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NMR spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. It impacts research on the preparation and characterization of molecules for rationally designing catalysts as well as the identification of photo processes for storing energy via metal complexes. The instrument also aids in developing processes that use earth-abundant materials or renewable feedstocks and in producing environmentally benign reagents that require smaller amounts of solvent. The spectrometer is also used in designing polymeric materials for carbon dioxide capture and in exploring methodologies of compound delivery that may have potential medical uses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this project is to support and enhance the research and teaching capabilities of the University of Cincinnati (UC) through the acquisition of a state-of-the-art 400 MHz NMR spectrometer.  The NSF-funded instrument has allowed major users to make significant progress and provide valuable training in the areas of homogeneous catalysis, electrocatalysis, photochemistry, mechanochemistry, and biomass conversion.  During the funding period for this award, a number of important discoveries have been made, in which the new NMR spectrometer played crucial roles.  Notable examples include: (1) the discovery of unique copper hydride clusters that can increase or decrease nuclearity during chemical reactions, (2) rapid identifications of products from electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 or C-C bond forming reactions, (3) first in-depth study of crystal disintegration and movements induced by gas release where the photomechanical effects are directly correlated with the structures, (4) the discovery of the significance of ion pairing in mechanochemical reactions, and (5) a deeper understanding of structure-activity relationship between alkylation degree of lignins and their positive or negative effects on the enzymatic hydrolysis.  Broader societal outcomes of the research involve the development of technologies and materials that will potentially impact the chemical and energy industries.  The research activities have also proven to be an effective training and outreach tool by involving more than 150 undergraduate and graduate students, including those involved in the ACS Project SEED program, NSF-REU program, and UC Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program.  The availability of a new NMR spectrometer has also provided instructors at UC the opportunity to incorporate NMR techniques in several lab courses.
