<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is focused on the substantial opportunity to utilize circuit-level electricity usage data to identify equipment faults, allocate energy costs, and increase operating efficiency in the residential and commercial building sectors.  By monitoring electricity at the circuit level, it is possible to detect when equipment is about to malfunction.  By sub-metering electricity in multi-tenant facilities, it is possible to fairly charge each occupant.  By auditing energy use and benchmarking against other buildings, it is possible to identify investment opportunities that increase operating efficiency or equipment inefficiencies.  All of these benefits, as well as many others, stem from greater visibility into electricity usage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project concerns a new type of electricity sub-meter that dramatically reduces installation cost and complexity, the main impediments to greater adoption of the technology. These results are possible today because of substantial prior research into ultra-low power energy-harvesting circuits.  These circuits enable self-powered sensor operation, clip-on installation that reduces installation cost and eliminates the need for electrical shutdowns, new calibration methods that can jointly calibrate the sensors and front-end electronics for better overall accuracy and lower cost, and a novel method of non-contact voltage sensing that allows true power measurement without high installation cost and safety risks of conventional voltage sensors.  When the data that these new types of electricity sub-meters generate are analyzed and processed by algorithms, it is possible to identify equipment faults, allocate energy costs, detect inefficient operations, and reduce high grid demand.  This solution addresses key accuracy, cost, and deployment challenges, filling an important gap in the electricity sub-metering industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Growing pressure from federal, state, and local mandates are forcing utilities and ratepayers to adopt energy saving measures. While many improvement options exist&mdash;occupancy-driven HVAC, high efficiency chillers and air handling units, demand-driven ventilation, advanced lighting controls, daylight harvesting, among others&mdash;financial concerns require a data driven approach to project selection and savings validation. However, critical gaps exist in the measurement technology needed to benchmark baseline electricity use, prioritize efficiency investments, and validate predicted savings.  This has led the DOE to articulate the need to accurately, inexpensively, and wirelessly sub-meter building electricity usage at the circuit-level.  Existing circuit-level metering systems are too expensive (due to the high cost of the meters themselves as well as difficult installation and/or cumbersome calibration procedures) or too inaccurate (due to an inability to faithfully calculate power from synchronized current and voltage channels).  This project explored the commercial potential of novel energy metering systems that address national needs without the limitations of current approaches.  Intellectual Merit.  With support from NSF, we have developed novel energy-harvesting energy meters for circuit-level (and plug-load) metering of electrical loads that approach DOE cost ($100/circuit) and accuracy (~2-5% error) targets while providing unprecedented installation ease (~30 sec/circuit), support for 3-phase measurements (supporting commercial &amp; industrial settings), battery-free/mains-free perpetual operation (that requires no maintenance), and wireless transmission of encrypted meter data.  These results are possible because of ultra-low power energy-harvesting circuits, clip-on installation that eliminates the need for electrical shutdowns, new calibration methods that can jointly calibrate the sensors and front-end electronics for better overall accuracy and lower cost, a method of non-contact voltage sensing that allows true power measurement.  These advancements create a new approach to energy metering that addresses many accuracy, cost, and installation complexity problems with current solutions.  Broader Impacts.  The energy meters enabled by these features translate to key CAPEX, OPEX, and privacy benefits for customers who need to benchmark baseline electricity use or verify realized savings for energy-saving facility improvements.  The sensors can be used for predictive maintenance and automated fault detection in addition to basic metering functions.  They existence will support both public Federal sector (GSA-managed) and private sector (commercial and industrials) applications.       Last Modified: 11/13/2017       Submitted by: J.
