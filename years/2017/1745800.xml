<AbstractNarration>This grant supports student travel for select students to participate in the Doctoral Consortium (DC) at the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS), to be held in June 2017 in Pittsburgh, PA.  ICAPS is a top-tier conference for researchers and practitioners to share and learn from each other in the field of planning and scheduling using artificial intelligence techniques. This consortium is oriented on research and career development for students who have identified their PhD topics and are just embarking on that independent research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sponsoring student travel to ICAPS fosters a community of research in theoretical and algorithmic advances in planning and scheduling, as well as a range of applications of such automated planning, such as in manufacturing, health care, logistics, space systems, software engineering, robotics, and entertainment.  The entire event provides an opportunity for students to engage in discussion with scientists from around the world and to explore new research directions and topics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Automated planning and scheduling are technical areas that are key aspects of software engineering, robotics, manufacturing systems, and software development, amongst other areas. To share information among researchers and practitioners in these areas, there is an annual meeting held: the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS). This conference occurs in different locations, both within the US and internationally, typically changing location each year.     This proposal supported students to participate in the Doctoral Consortium,  an important components of the annual ICAPS conference. This doctoral consortium is a key effort to encourage, support, and increase retention for graduate research students working in the areas of automated planning and scheduling.  The primary aim of the doctoral consortium is to provide an opportunity for graduate students to obtain career and research advice from peers and mentors beyond their institution, present preliminary results and plans for their dissertations, and build professional relationships. It is held as a special one day event in conjunction to the main conference.  During it, students presented to each other and senior mentors. This event also included invited speakers who provided valuable meta-level career development advice. In addition to this, doctoral consortium students presented posters of their research work at the main conference, enabling them to benefit and network with the broader community of researchers in the automated planning and scheduling.     The funds from this proposal helped provided financial support to students to travel and participate this annual ICAPS doctoral consortium.
