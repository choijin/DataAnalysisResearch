<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to explore the challenges of developing E-Witness - a system that allows civilians to use their smart devices to collect forensically sound multimedia evidence. In order to be considered authentic and forensically sound, a digital evidence needs to have a proof of being untampered and the time and location of the event needs to be attested in a way that it is immutable. Such research on forensically sound and anonymous evidence gathering is hard due to various challenging requirements: user friendly application interface, unbiased, collusion-resistant and privacy-preserving time-stamping service as well as accurate location attestation. The effectiveness of each aspect needs to be proved to build a robust system. The overarching reward of this project is its ability to record and validate facts in real-time while bringing forensic accountability to such collected evidence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The building blocks of E-Witness consist of: (a) a secure smart phone application, (b) a time-stamping service implemented as a public blockchain maintained by individual miners, and (c) a location-attestation service that provides confidence on the truthfulness of the location reported by the evidence device. A prototype will be developed and performance analysis will be performed over a testbed deployment to ensure correctness of all components of the system. A pilot study involving University users will be performed to identify the challenges of a large-scale deployment.</AbstractNarration>

The most notable outcomes are:  Involvement of undergraduate and graduate students at a private research university and a minority serving institute.  Collaboarted on outreach through participation in tech incubators to explore commercialization prospects and widespread adoption of the technology.  Publications at conference proceedings and technical reports.  Presentations at numerous talks on disinformation.   Partnership with venture backed startup companies to bring the technology to market.  Collabborated with an MSI to submit an NSF IIP proposal.
