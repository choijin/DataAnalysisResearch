<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be engineering a new silicon-based cost-effective, precise, mechanical chip technology to perform gene knockdowns and editing at the single-cell level.  The technology will enable this on a parallel scale as well as the eventual applicability to T cell immunotherapy. The ability to target and profile specific genes and pathways in single cells with a nanoneedle-based microrobotic device will constitute a major technological advance that will enable researchers to monitor cancer progression, study the- underlying mechanisms and develop therapeutic T cell engineering. The technology is primarily addressing a fundamental problem associated with cell and gene therapy: viruses used to program cells before transplant into the body provoke undesirable immune response, may cause adverse effects as viral DNA integrates into the human genome, involve costly production and lengthy protocols, and can typically only be used once. This technology will enable an alternative engineering solution to this fundamental therapeutic problem which can eliminate such toxicity issues encompassing major applications in other areas including livestock, industrial biology, agriculture, drug discovery and development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will further develop a technology that allows editing of single T cells with high transduction efficiency and minimal invasiveness. Parameters such as target efficiency, sensitivity/specificity of manipulation and delivery, device functionality after repetitive transduction, uniformity of manipulation across different single cells, as well as precision, reproducibility, hysteresis and stability of the motion of the microrobotic actuator will be optimized. The silicon-based microrobotic actuator is designed such that it can accurately track and target desired positions within single cells under an open loop control without a position feedback sensor, thus avoiding complicated control system electronics. A platform has been developed that includes a microrobotic actuator, which consists of a microstage driven by capacitive components that moves in 3D using an electrostatic field responsible for the independent motion to the nanoneedles. The key innovative concept here is to integrate the parallel architecture based 3D actuator technology with multiple nanoneedle biosensors so that each of them can be independently moved for targeted single-cell manipulation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mekonos (with two PhD team members from UC Berkeley and Stanford along with an industry mentor with a 30 year career in the pharmaceutical industry)  is creating proprietary silicon based nanomachines to engineer cells without using viruses to tackle diseases such as cancer.  These nanomachines are designed to deliver gene editing payloads to provide a safe and reliable just-in-time manufacturing process for users who research, develop or produce gene and cell therapies.  The primary goal of undertaking the NSF I-Corps training was to validate/invalidate as well as refine multiple value propositions and diverse customer segments in order to find optimal product-market fit and gain insights to drive final development of the product.   After successfully completing the NSF I-Corps National training with 115 customer discovery interviews, the team conducted an additional 135 interviews during the grant period.  They found product-market fit with stem cell and regenerative scientists working on rare and orphan diseases who had a need for both speed and safety.   The team continues to tighten the product-market fit while improving the technology based on the insights gained during customer discovery.  The team has raised $1M in seed funding since starting the program and will continue to bring the product to market.
