<AbstractNarration>Water is the basis for life on this planet, making aquatic ecosystems some of the most critical in the world, but they are also the most imperiled.  ND-LEEF is a globally unique field site where scientists and engineers can find solutions to some of our greatest environmental challenges, especially threats to aquatic systems. The facility represents a unique combination of interconnected streams, ponds, and wetlands in the form of experimental watersheds. Researchers can manipulate ecosystem types, individually or linked, while still being embedded within the natural environment that bridges a critical gap between laboratory and field scales. Set within a local park in St Joseph County (IN), ND-LEEF's location facilitates access to the public and allows for meaningful research translation and outreach. In four years, programming has reached &gt;1400 individuals, including 800 local k-12 children. This project will maximize the scientific, education and outreach potential of ND-LEEF by identifying potential users, roadblocks that may be limiting current use, and help develop a plan to overcome hurdles to maximize the impact and efficiency of ND-LEEF. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to create a five-year strategic plan for ND-LEEF to inform further infrastructure growth, identify potential users, draw these users to ND-LEEF, facilitate regional scientific collaborations, provide a platform for undergraduate education and enhanced local STEM outreach. The plan will include identification of potential users within a 150-mile driving distance. The project team will conduct interviews to identify barriers for usage, and identify strategies to increase use by researchers and their students.  The project includes a one-day regional workshop for current and identified potential researchers/educators that will (i) explore the growth potential of ND-LEEF in greater detail, (ii) identify required novel infrastructure, (iii) identify current barriers to use, (iv) promote regional collaboration across research and educational interests, and (v) lay the groundwork for growing an ND-LEEF community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to allow us to maximize the scientific, education and outreach potential of the Notre Dame Linked Experimental Ecosystem Facility (ND-LEEF), a unique experimental facility that includes interconnected streams, ponds and wetlands, embedded in a local county park. Our goals were to identify potential future users of ND-LEEF, learning what roadblocks may be preventing them from currently utilizing ND-LEEF and then developing a plan to remove or alleviate those roadblocks so as it maximize this unique facility's impact and efficiency on the scientific community as a whole.  In addition, these planning activities will guide us to effectively target ongoing fund raising efforts and to prioritize facilities which will foster the most research, education and outreach at ND-LEEF.  To this end, we hired a consultant to design and implement a survey/interview of 26 potential users to determine: awareness of ND-LEEF, potential for use and preferred facility modifications to ND-LEEF.  Based on the results of this survey we have identified some key improvements which we are now prioritize as we continue development of ND-LEEF.  This includes seeking opportunities to expand the facility by adding a multi-purpose building with a classroom, basic facilities, equipment storage lockers and wet lab space.  Additionally, we are exploring the possibility of adding new experimental features such as the ability to tightly control the temperature of ponds and streams, which was a common desired capability that the surveyed researchers mentioned.  ND-LEEF has a large set of outreach programs, with many including formal or informal interactions between the public and our researchers. By attracting even more research to ND-LEEF we will be able to impact our community even more deeply with our ever diversifying programming and offerings.
