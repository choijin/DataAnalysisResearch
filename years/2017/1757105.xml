<AbstractNarration>This proposed research project will study the most efficient form of unemployment support using a large data set on the employment history of over 400,000 workers. This employment data will be combined with expenditure and unemployment compensation data for the study.  The researchers will categorize different types of unemployment compensation (unemployment insurance, lump sum payments, and no insurance) and use sophisticated methods to analyze how the type of unemployment compensation unemployed workers receive affects affect their consumption over time.  The researchers will then develop a theory that combines the insights of both economics and psychology to explain the observed differences in consumption patterns of unemployed workers receiving different types of unemployment compensation. The researchers will then use the results to discuss policy recommendations.  The results of this research will provide valuable inputs into unemployment compensation policies in both developed and developing worlds.  The results will also be used as an input to develop policies to improve the functioning of labor markets, hence enhance economic growth both in the US and around the world.  Finally, the results of this research project can be used by individuals to plan their consumption during periods of unemployment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The debate about the optimal choice between (combinations of) unemployment insurance (UI) and lump sum payment at the time of layoff focuses on the tradeoff between the disincentive from the former to the inability to smoothen consumption because of the uncertainty of unemployment duration in the case of the latter.   There is very little empirical and theoretical investigation of this tradeoff, especially in developing countries that are struggling to develop their unemployment compensation systems.  The proposed research project will use theory and large data sets to investigate how the type of unemployment compensation scheme affects the consumption trajectories of laid off workers.  The project follows a strand in the economics literature that documents consumption profiles around economic shocks. The PIs will build a new high-frequency longitudinal microdata of formal employment and expenditure for more than 400,000 individuals and exploit this dataset and a rich empirical setting with multiple sources of variation in unemployment insurance schemes across workers to document new empirical findings. The project will then estimate structural models of behaviors that explain these consumption patterns and evaluate their ability to explain the empirical observations. The project will then use the estimated models to discuss policy implications for unemployment compensation schemes, particularly for developing countries. The results of this research project will provide critical inputs into the formulation of unemployment compensations schemes and other labor market policies, improve the functioning of labor markets and in the process, increase economic growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Government policies providing income support to workers upon layoff or mandating firms to provide such support (i.e., <strong>job displacement insurance</strong> programs) are increasingly prevalent across the developing world. The share of countries with <strong>unemployment insurance (UI)</strong> programs (in which <em>workers receive some amount periodically as long as they remain without a job</em>) has remained stable since the 1970s at about 95% in richer countries (Figure 1a). By contrast, it has tripled over that period in the rest of the world (Figure 1b), from about 10% to about 30%. In addition, while the share of countries with government mandated <strong>severance pay (SP) programs</strong> (in which <em>workers receive some amount in a lump-sum (i.e., one-off) fashion upon layoff</em>) was about 40% in both groups of countries in the 1970s, it has increased to less than 70% in richer countries, but to more than 80% in the rest of the world.</p> <p>In this context, this project provided new evidence on displaced workers' need for insurance and on the welfare gains from job displacement insurance in developing countries. We followed an approach in the literature that documents expenditure profiles around economic shocks, and uses its findings to inform individuals' need for insurance. We implemented this approach by combining high-frequency expenditure data and matched employee-employer data for more than 400,000 formal workers over five years in Brazil. Displaced formal workers being eligible for both UI and SP in Brazil, we were able to compare the welfare gains of SP and UI for workers in the same context, which had not been done even for richer countries.</p> <p>We found that workers <em>increase</em> non-durable consumption by more than 30% at layoff, when they receive their SP, <em>despite</em> experiencing a long-term consumption loss of 17%, when they stop receiving their UI benefits (Figure 2). Using administrative data on UI payments, we also find that workers spend 20% more in the week they receive their monthly UI paycheck (Figure 3). In addition, they fail to smooth consumption in anticipation of the (expected) drop in income when workers exhaust UI benefits, which is associated with a 10%-15% drop in consumption (Figure 4). This sensitivity of consumer spending to cash-on-hand is present across spending categories, including sub-categories of non-durables such as food expenditures.</p> <p>Our results showed that the need for job displacement insurance can be sizable even in a developing country context. Indeed, we estimated a long-term loss in consumption, once workers exhaust all their job displacement insurance benefits, that is comparable to estimates from richer countries. Informal sector employment, which is prevalent in developing countries (including in Brazil), thus serves, at best, as an imperfect form of self-insurance, and social insurance could lead to large welfare gains for displaced formal workers. Our results also showed that consumption is highly sensitive to cash-on-hand even after the loss of a formal job. We showed that this evidence is consistent with workers being "present-biased," leading them to over-spend a windfall of cash and under-save for an expected drop in income. Taken together, our results imply that the disbursement policy of job displacement insurance programs may affect their welfare gains for workers. In particular, the tranched payments of UI benefits may be particularly important in helping displaced workers better smooth consumption compared to a SP program.</p> <p>The academic article presenting our results was published in March 2021 in the <em>American Economic Review </em>(Gerard and Naritomi, 2021). The results were also presented on numerous occasions at both academic (e.g., Duke, LSE, Oxford, UC Berkeley, Stanford, Yale) and policy institutions (e.g., Bank of Mexico, UK Department of International Development, World Bank). Finally, over the lifetime of this award, the project provided educational benefits through research assistance to 7 doctoral students and one pre-doctoral student.</p> <p>Gerard, Francois and Joana Naritomi (2021).
