<AbstractNarration>On 11 March 2011, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant experienced a meltdown due to a large earthquake. What followed was a release of radioactive material to the surrounding area, leading to thousands of displaced citizens and unusable farmland. This research will use plants as a technique for showing the danger of radiation and serve as a means for restoring uninhabitable land. The research will be conducted with Dr. Kosuke Noborio, an expert in the field of Agriculture. The collaboration provides on-site sampling in Iitate Village, laboratory access at Meji University, and the opportunity to work with fellow graduate students of Dr. Noborio.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term objective of this project is to use plants as bioindicators to evaluate ecological health of 137Cs contaminated areas while retroactively collecting samples for analyzing the plant species as potential sources for phytoremediation trials. The aim of this research is to support this objective with a systematic approach, in which areas contaminated and uncontaminated with 137Cs are chosen to serve as sample and control groups. Plant growth will be monitored to establish side effects of 137Cs uptake and how varied concentrations of contamination affect plant physical appearance. While the bioindicators are being studied, samples from the plants will be collected for measuring the amount of 137Cs uptake to indicate whether phytoremediation will be an applicable technique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview:   The long-term objective of this project was to use plants as bioindicators to evaluate ecological health of 137Cs contaminated areas while retroactively collecting samples for analyzing the plant species as potential source for phytoremediation trials. The aim of this research was to support this objective with a systematic approach, in which areas contaminated and uncontaminated with 137Cs are chosen to serve as sample and control groups. Plant growth was monitored to elucidate any side effects of 137Cs uptake and how varied concentrations of radionuclide contamination affects plant physical appearance. While the bioindicators were being studied, samples from the plants were collected for measuring the amount of 137Cs uptake to indicate whether phytoremediation will be an applicable technique.  Intellectual Merit:   The research conducted addressed the explorative technique plant use as bioindicators for analyzing 137Cs contamination in lieu of other relatively high costs technological methods.  With a bachelor?s degree in chemistry and three years of laboratory experience conducting research, I believe that I was qualified to see this project proposal to fulfillment. Establishing the use of plants as bioindicators will allow residents, specifically in Iitate Village, to see the movement of radiocesium and gain a direct understanding of ecological health. The two plants to be used as bioindicators have shown to be very effective in their uptake of 137Cs, leading to a high confidence that they would also work in Fukushima Prefecture. With the collaboration of my international colleagues, the organization of this project has a detailed timeline for 10 weeks. These 10 weeks would include, but are not limited to, evaluating potential land areas for planting, area prepping and planting the bioindicators, and germination of the plants. Given the proximity of my host professor to Fukushima Prefecture, there was sufficient access to the resources both in the field and in the laboratory.  Broader Impacts:   The extensive environmental science described in Intellectual Merits represents an ideal component for research and collaboration with Japanese scientists. Establishing a direct line of communication allows simultaneous research and on-site testing. This project proposal not only benefited the scientific community by providing evidence for the use of plants as bioindicators, it also provided evidence for Iitate Village farmers that their produce meets radiation contamination guidelines.  Iitate Village, due to its proximity to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, struggles to sell food products due to fear that food may be contaminated.  This study, although revealing no evidence supporting the bioindicator hypothesis, positively impacts the Iitate Village farmers by confirming little radiation contamination in their food products.   By actively participating in this collaborative multidisciplinary research, residents of Iitate Village and participating students of Meiji University had opportunities to engage in a broad range of environmental science experiences, including, but not restricted to, collecting soil samples, designing experiments based on phytoremediation models, and interpreting fundamental measurements that evaluate the impacts of 137Cs contamination. This project proposal was of great benefit to Japan and other areas directly affected by large quantities of 137Cs.
