<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support for student participation in the 11th Workshop on the "Principles and Applications of Control in Quantum Systems."  This conference covers many of the research topics central to Quantum Information Science. The support of students through this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in quantum information science acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop on Principles and Applications of Control in Quantum Systems, which this award supports, is scheduled to be held in July 11-17, 2017 in Seattle, WA.  This conference offers an opportunity for students to present their research results and to interact with senior scientists from the United States, and also the broader international community. This conference also offers students an opportunity to learn about quantum information science applications in several fields. Support is provided only for US students (students enrolled in US universities).</AbstractNarration>

All supported students were from U.S. institutions.   Intellectual Merit:The development of technologies for the 21st century, coupled with fundamental scientific inquiry, is driving new theoretical and experimental research on control in quantum systems. Experience has shown that systematic use of quantum control theory leads to significant improvements in technologies ranging from magnetic resonance to prototype quantum computers. Compelling case studies of quantum control have been developed in wide-ranging fields such as chemistry, metrology, optical networking and computer science.  This award provided the means for students to disseminate their research results, learn  the latest results in this field from the experts in the field, and network among professors, industrial scientists, and their peers to further their reserach and career goals.   Broader Impacts: The broader impact of this award was to give PhD students in the area of quantum control professional development skills in the area of scientific presentation and networking. This training of students in this field is expected to provide the needed workforce in the emerging field of quantum technologies.
