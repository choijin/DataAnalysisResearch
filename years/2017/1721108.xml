<AbstractNarration>This award will support attendance by early career researchers at the 19th Rust Belt RNA Meeting to be held at the Sheraton Indianapolis City Centre Hotel in Indianapolis, Indiana on October 13-14, 2017.  The format of the meeting is a combination of talks and posters, which will promote scientific exchange in both formal and informal settings. A number of activities are aimed at professional development and mentoring for early career scientists. There will be ample opportunity for sharing the latest research results and for networking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ever-increasing impact of RNA science has been fueled by its immense potential to shed light on a wide array of important problems ranging from the origin of life to the molecular basis of inter-cellular communication. Some of these advances will be among the topics featured in the scientific sessions, which will include: RNA-protein complexes, mRNA maturation, ribosome assembly and translation, and RNA-dependent regulation.  In addition, some of the sessions will focus on emerging areas of RNA research such as RNA nanotechnology, and bioinformatics and systems biology of RNA. The results will be disseminated by publication of abstracts on the meeting website.</AbstractNarration>

Furthermore, first time in RRM&rsquo;s history, pre-meeting activities were offered to trainees starting Friday morning with two Computational Workshops followed by a Career Mentoring Lunch.</p> <ul> <li>The first workshop organized by Dr. David H.

Moreover, first time in 2017, the meeting provided training opportunities free of charge to students and postdoctoral fellows in the form of two Computational Workshops that were led by nationally recognized leaders of the field. The meeting has a rich history of spotlighting trainees, nearly all of whom presented their research either as a poster or a talk.&nbsp; All but two of the twenty-eight oral presentations were delivered by students or post&shy;doctoral scholars, as were the vast majority of posters. The poster session featured 133 entries judged by nearly 40 faculty members, two per poster. &nbsp;Each talk was followed by incisive questions from the audience and the exchanges between trainees and PIs at the poster session were also very lively. &nbsp;Unique features of the 2017 meeting were 1) two computational workshops, 2) a lunch that focused on career-related issues faced by trainees featuring representatives from industry and multiple academic institutions - both of which scheduled on friday morning before the main conference, enabling early depature of delegates on saturday 3) two of the four sessions were chaired by PIs from PUIs. As has been customary since 2013, NSF funds were utilized to fund accommodation and registration of 12 underrepresented minority trainees. In summary, the RRM is an exceptionally valuable meeting for researchers pursuing diverse aspects of RNA science.&nbsp; Although regional, it features very high-quality talks and posters comparable to (and in many cases arguably better than) national and international meetings? it is affordable and conveniently located? and provides outstanding opportunities for trainees to present their findings and interact with PIs and fellow students in their field.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/20/2018<br>      Modified by: Sarath&nbsp;C&nbsp;Janga</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721108/1721108_10473281_1521414278953_Awardees-with-chairs1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721108/1721108_10473281_1521414278953_Awardees-with-chairs1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Awardees with organizing chairs of RRM 2017"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721108/1721108_10473281_1521414278953_Awardees-with-chairs1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Awardees with organizing chairs of RRM 2017"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Group photograph of all the award recipients of  RRM 2017 with the organizing chairs</div> <div class="imageCredit">RRM 2017 organising committee</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sarath&nbsp;C&nbsp;Janga</div> <div class="imageTitle">Awardees with organizing chairs of RRM 2017</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721108/1721108_10473281_1521413772876_RRM-2017-audience1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721108/1721108_10473281_1521413772876_RRM-2017-audience1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="RRM-2017-audience"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721108/1721108_10473281_1521413772876_RRM-2017-audience1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="RRM-2017-audience"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Photograph showing the audience for RRM 2017 meeting</div> <div class="imageCredit">RRM 2017 organising committee</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sarath&nbsp;C&nbsp;Janga</div> <div class="imageTitle">RRM-2017-audience</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721108/1721108_10473281_1521413922656_RRM-2017-keynote1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721108/1721108_10473281_1521413922656_RRM-2017-keynote1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="RRM-2017-keynote-speaker"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721108/1721108_10473281_1521413922656_RRM-2017-keynote1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="RRM-2017-keynote-speaker"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Photograph of Keynote Speaker, Prof. Christopher Burge, at RRM 2017</div> <div class="imageCredit">RRM 2017 organising committee</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sarath&nbsp;C&nbsp;Janga</div> <div class="imageTitle">RRM-2017-keynote-speaker</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721108/1721108_10473281_1521563632189_Poster-presenter1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721108/1721108_10473281_1521563632189_Poster-presenter1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Representative image of live poster session at RRM 2017"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721108/1721108_10473281_1521563632189_Poster-presenter1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Representative image of live poster session at RRM 2017"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Representative image of live poster session showing interactions between young scientists</div> <div class="imageCredit">RRM 2017 organising committee</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sarath&nbsp;C&nbsp;Janga</div> <div class="imageTitle">Representative image of live poster session at RRM 2017</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721108/1721108_10473281_1521563932063_RRM_2017_booklet1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721108/1721108_10473281_1521563932063_RRM_2017_booklet1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Cover page of RRM-2017 program booklet"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1721108/1721108_10473281_1521563932063_RRM_2017_booklet1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Cover page of RRM-2017 program booklet"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Coverpage of the program booklet distributed to all the conference attendees at RRM 2017</div> <div class="imageCredit">RRM 2017 organising committee</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sarath&nbsp;C&nbsp;Janga</div> <div class="imageTitle">Cover page of RRM-2017 program booklet</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>

The RRM attracts a diverse array of participants from both research intensive and predominantly undergraduate institutions (PUIs) located in the "Rustbelt" and surrounding areas.  A central goal of the RRM is to provide unique opportunities for professional development of trainees through presentation of talks and posters combined with events designed to promote networking and career development.  Overview The 19th annual RRM provided a professional scientific meeting at a very reasonable cost, easily affordable for students, postdocs and principal investigators from large research universities, small liberal arts colleges and intermediate size schools with a mixed mission to attend.  The meeting was held in Indianapolis, IN at Sheraton City Center Hotel on October 13-&shy;14, 2017.

Through a full schedule of nearly 133 posters and 26 oral presentations by student and post&shy;doctoral trainees, the RRM provided a high caliber intensive experience for participants and fostered collaborative interactions between trainees and PIs across traditional disciplinary boundaries.  The meeting featured a keynote lecture by Professor Christopher Burge from MIT &ndash; who made exceptional contributions to the field of RNA Computational Biology.

The second workshop led by Dr. Sarath Chandra Janga focused on analyzing and interpreting CLIP-sequencing data. The Career Mentoring Lunch organized by Dr Timea Gerczei enabled interactions between 60 trainees and 14 mentors from diverse institutions.   Intellectual Merit The intellectual merit of the RRM revolves around the sharing of new (generally unpublished) research in RNA science, broadly defined.  Recent years have witnessed breakthroughs in the identification and characterization of regulatory and catalytic RNAs, as well as in genome wide approaches to RNA expression and folding.
