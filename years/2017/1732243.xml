<AbstractNarration>Continued United States (U.S.) economic competitiveness and global leadership in technology and science necessitate a well-prepared science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce. Ensuring that this critical workforce is broadly inclusive of individuals with relevant capabilities and skills requires a highly adaptive, networked system of interdisciplinary educational collaboration, and innovative employment preparation strategies, programs, and approaches. This approach constitutes a partnership of scientists and engineers, educators, trainers, innovation networks, laboratories, research institutions, and employers. This science policy research report addresses these issues, detailing barriers and opportunities for increasing participation in STEM fields among under-served populations, focusing on people with disabilities and high technology industry and non-government employers. Distinct applications of related research are studied, such as the inclusion of veterans who became disabled in the line of service, and with applicable education and training, could be new participants in the STEM workforce. This is especially important as both these populations might not be aware of, or not actively involved in social networks of STEM innovators, and conversely technology innovators might not fully consider these individuals. The report explores new frameworks, decision support tools, dissemination design parameters, and knowledge-generating communities to provide lessons learned and guidance for innovative best practices and inclusion in STEM disciplines. Addressing the under-representation of people with disabilities in STEM fields, it offers an analysis of relevant research and policy approaches and looks to inform related government agenda setting and decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much research on the STEM participation of people with disabilities has tended to emphasize specific disability characteristics. Building upon findings generated during the 2016 Symposium on the Science of Broadening Participation (SoBP), sponsored by the National Science Foundation, this project takes a wider, interdisciplinary perspective, looking a range of social, economic, methodological, institutional, and policy contexts. Identifying barriers and opportunities for increasing participation in STEM fields among under-served populations and policy approaches, the report addresses the need for novel approaches to developing and nurturing a qualified, diverse, and agile U.S. STEM workforce. The report articulates a framework for developing tools and approaches to understand the role of collaborative networks of innovation that encourage STEM participation of individuals with disabilities. The report explores research that can enhance broadened participation, and addresses areas in which targeted efforts would be valuable, including a toolkit for assessing innovative practices and organizational structures in the context of knowledge transfer and closing knowledge-practice gaps, and a sustainable design for a Professional Inclusive Innovation Network (PIIN) of innovation nodes and researchers to test inclusive practices. The PIIN presents the SoBP community with an opportunity to capture relevant research and policy data, cultivate meaningful programs at the appropriate scale, and develop a network of mentors, advocates, and others to inform the SoBP community and other stakeholders. The toolkit coupled with an iterative observatory approach allows for bottom-up insights that speak specifically to regional context, culture, and population needs, promoting favorable outcomes.</AbstractNarration>

This is especially important as these populations might not be aware of, or not actively involved in, social networks of STEM innovators and, conversely, relevant employers might not fully consider these individuals as productive contributors to innovation systems.  The report also explores the potential of new frameworks, dissemination design parameters, and knowledge-generating communities to provide lessons learned and guidance for effective practices and inclusion in STEM disciplines.  Addressing the underrepresentation of individuals with disabilities in STEM fields, this report offers an analysis of relevant research and policy approaches.  It also looks to inform related government and industry agenda-setting and decision-making.  This report has identified several areas on which policy development and analysis might focus in relation to broadening the participation of individuals with disabilities, including veterans, in the STEM workforce.  Broadly, these include:   multidisciplinary integration of knowledge related to understanding and assessing underrepresentation in STEM fields;  enhanced focus on empirical observations (data, metrics, and statistics) related to assessing underrepresentation in STEM fields;  curated knowledge focused on educational preparation, including assessment of educational attainment, contextualizing educational access, opportunities, and outcomes, and identification of critical causes of underrepresentation in STEM fields;  expanded research focused on identifying workforce dimensions and dynamics, contextualizing occupational access, opportunities, and outcomes, and investigating recruitment, retention, and network inadequacies leading to underrepresentation in the STEM workforce; the need to conduct additional research targeting the economic impacts of inclusion and non-inclusion in the workforce of STEM-trained individuals with disabilities; and design of a Professional Inclusive Innovation Network (PIIN), which is a "network of networks" with regional nodes of innovation that offer access and bring together successful industry innovators, academic and technical specialists, and young STEM professionals (and aspiring students) with disabilities.     There is still a critical need for awareness, outreach, and professional networks of practice for increasing participation of individuals with disabilities in STEM occupations.  Against this backdrop and looking to the extant literature, a variety of strategies have been suggested for further exploration and engagement, including (1) building a sustainable, targeted "network" of innovation nodes and researchers, (2) an "observatory" or ongoing review of inclusion in STEM fields and cultures, and (3) a "toolkit" for assessing innovative practices and institutions in the context of knowledge transfer and closing the knowledge-practice gap.  It should be noted that the intersectionality of the construct can turn on other axes of inequality--e.g., race, sexuality, nationality, wealth--all of which can cut across notions of disability at different angles and can affect observed outcomes in participation and inclusion.  Also considered here is a somewhat overlapping group of underrepresented individuals:  military veterans with STEM training (especially more applied forms).  U.S. military veterans have been widely excluded from the conversation, especially those veterans with service connected disabilities.  The education, training, and skills that military veterans possess cut across a wide range of STEM disciplines, from microbiology to hydrology, and from computer science to robotics.  Any viable path for an expanded pilot of the proposed PIIN platform should consider including this group.   Participants in the Veterans STEM Innovation Network:  Participatory Design Workshop, held at Georgia Institute of Technology in connection with the production of this report, indicated the need for a better system for translating veterans' service records into a form that is meaningful for employers in STEM and STEM-related sectors.  One example is PurePost (https://www.purepost.co), a resume builder for members of the military and veterans.  Other tools that could help address the implementation of policies and practices aimed at improving the participation of veterans (particularly those with disabilities) in the STEM workforce include:   customized personal skills assessment and pathway for employment; an informational network/app; communications to the public and employers about the advantages of      hiring a veteran; online resources for veterans and potential employers; trainings with career advisors; combined professional development and scholarship programs for      veterans; Veterans Affairs benefits that support "stackable credentials," referring to movement from more technical vocational training to      professional education; and online educational opportunities (e.g., MOOCs) for veterans only.   Various approaches can be employed to both explore and address issues noted above as well as offer potential scalable initiatives that could generate data to better inform and develop policy that more closely fits the specific characteristics of the target groups.
