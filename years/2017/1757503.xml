<AbstractNarration>This award supports a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Physics at the University of Texas at Dallas. The site supports between six and eight students per year for ten weeks of research in projects in experimental or theoretical physics.  Student participants will develop research, problem solving and communication skills by immersion in cutting-edge research in physics and through a series of workshops and seminars. As well as developing independence in research, working in the framework of a mentor's research group along with graduate students, participants will build teamwork skills. Special workshops will increase awareness of graduate school, academic and non-academic career options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will be able to choose from research topics including biophysics, computational physics, condensed matter physics, cosmology and gravity. The key objectives of the program are to instill in the participants the excitement of research and careers in science, and to build their research skills both independently and in research teams.  The development of core, transferable research skills such as data analysis, computer programming and statistics will underpin each of the research projects and will be the focus of student workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The students were integrated into the research groups of their faculty mentors, working on research topics concerned with physics operating on the smallest to the largest scales in the Universe. During 2020 the program operated online, due to the closure of campus as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.  One of the key research priorities of the NSF is quantum-based research, aimed at understanding and harnessing the quantum mechanical phenomena that operate on tiny sub-atomic scales. This research field has also been emphasized by an act of US congress as being critical to future economic prosperity and national security. Three students worked on projects aimed at the theoretical underpinnings of quantum computing, opening a window on this critical field to the next generation of researchers. Quantum computing has the potential to solve extremely complex problems, for example understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change, and developing new materials.   Eleven REU projects were concerned with physics on large scales, including studies of the gravitational interactions between black holes and stars, and between stars and planets in other solar systems; the detection and properties of exoplanets; dark matter in galaxy clusters; studies of Einstein's equations and General Relativity.    Many of the REU projects were directly relevant to improved human health and well-being. For example three student projects involved experimental or computational biophysics: specifically applications of physics to the experimental study of cancer metabolism and to the study of anti-cancer drug activity, and computational study of mutations of proteins impacting disease.  In addition to working on research projects, the REU students received training on topics foundational to research such as computer programming and science communication.
