<AbstractNarration>Bacteria colonize and perform critical functions for their animal hosts. There has been an increased understanding of the bacteria that are associated with specific animal hosts, but the proceses and mechanisms by which specific animals become colonized with characteristic beneficial bacteria and avoid colonization by harmful (pathogenic) bacteria are not well-understood. This project uses a simplified system in which an animal organ is colonized by only a single bacterial species as a way to examine these processes and mechanisms. Molecular genetic approaches will be used to identify bacterial genes and processes that are critical to host colonization, and comparative approaches will be used to determine how the gene circuits in different bacteria evolve to either keep the same animal partner or allow the bacteria to switch and colonize a new animal host. This work has the potential to impact studies of bacterial aggregation, a process that occurs readily and has broad implications for the ability of bacteria to perform beneficial or harmful functions in natural and man-made environments. Climate change has been shown to influence bacterial-animal associations, so a deeper understanding of the molecular basis to these interactions will allow us to better prepare for changing environmental conditions. Finally, the evolution of infectious diseases depends on pathogen interactions with animal hosts, and therefore it is critical to discern regulatory changes that influence microbe-host communication. Students will be trained in modern genetics and genomics, and bioinformatics to address "big data" questions. Outreach activities are focused on broadening the representation of future STEM field leaders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microbial symbioses are prevalent in animals and are crucial to the health and development of both partners. These relationships have evolved robust mechanisms to ensure the faithful transmission of symbionts during each new host generation. This project applies modern genomic and genetic methods to examine how host specificity develops in a horizontally transmitted animal-microbe symbiosis. The project focuses on the binary association between Vibrio fischeri bacteria and the bobtail squid hosts. Preliminary data have revealed the importance of biofilm formation (bacterial aggregation) during host colonization, both in V. fischeri colonization of squid and in many bacterial colonization systems. In the canonical squid symbiont ES114, the RscS histidine kinase activates biofilm genes that are necessary for normal host colonization. A comparative approach identified strains that do not use RscS for colonization, and in the project molecular genetic approaches will be undertaken to identify the signal transduction pathways regulating aggregation and colonization in closely related symbiont strains. By taking an integrative approach that encompasses natural populations, genomes, pathways, and genes, the project will yield an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that maintain symbiont-host fidelity and facilitate co-evolutionary dynamics in horizontally-transmitted bacterial symbionts. A pilot workshop is proposed that integrates with the research aims and trains undergraduate and graduate students in modern bioinformatics techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Symbiotic microbes play critical roles in development and nutrition, and modern technological and conceptual advances have led to an enumeration of remarkable diversity of bacteria in wild animals, model organisms, and humans. This project sought to characterize how environmentally-transmitted bacteria colonize their cognate animal hosts robustly during each new host generation. Host-microbe relationships are not random, yet the molecular underpinnings of specificity in animal associations are poorly understood, especially compared to well-studied plant symbioses.  Vibrio fischeri provides a reductionist model to examine the genetic basis of host specificity in an animal symbiont. We demonstrated previously that in V. fischeri the ability of bacteria in the North Pacific Ocean to colonize squid corresponded with the acquisition of the biofilm regulator RscS.

This work led to the publication of 12 peer-reviewed publications, including work on bacterial physiology and metabolism, signal transduction, competition, and evolution. Here I focus on two principal findings from the studies.  In 2016 (DOI: 10.1128/JB.00037-16) we described the discovery of a novel biofilm regulator, BinK. Bacteria must aggregate in sticky biofilms as they colonize the squid host. We identified BinK as a strong negative regulator of biofilm formation, and we demonstrated that the protein is conserved throughout V. fischeri. A key question is how bacteria change from swimming freely in the ocean to aggregating in a biofilm at the host surface, and BinK provides an opportunity to study the molecular details of this process.  Earlier in 2019 (DOI: 10.1128/JB.00033-19), we examined BinK function, and biofilm formation broadly, across the V. fischeri evolutionary tree. We characterized three distinct groups of V. fischeri. Amazingly, only one of these groups use the canonical biofilm regulatory pathway to colonize squid; the other two groups use distinct means toward the same aggregative outcome.  Together, these studies demonstrated that there is substantial diversity in how similar bacteria colonize an animal host. Biofilms are important environmental structures, and our work suggests that biofilm regulatory evolution is a prominent way by which environmental bacteria become associated with specific animal hosts.
