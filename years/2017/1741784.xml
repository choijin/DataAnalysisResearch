<AbstractNarration>Can self-driving cars be hacked? Can US highways become even more dangerous? This project will engage students in learning how to design and program secure technologies for the future. Combining multiple theories, such as the fusion of activity theory, social constructivist learning theory, and project-based learning (PBL), as the conceptual framework for this study, the investigators will apply the Concerns Based Adoption Model (CBAM) to guide professional development that uses PBL to help grade 9-12 science teachers integrate computational thinking into their teaching.  The project will use smart vehicles as a means to engage career technical education (CTE) and mathematics teachers, alongside with grade 9-12 students, and to better understand how to embed computational thinking in the curriculum.  The program is designed to contribute meaningfully to the understanding of effective characteristics of professional development.  The project is funded by the STEM+Computing program, which seeks to address emerging challenges in computational STEM areas through the applied integration of computational thinking and computing activities within disciplinary STEM teaching and learning in early childhood education through high school (preK-12).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate whether a PBL focused topic is an effective medium for making mathematics more engaging and relevant to students.  The investigation will address common concerns inhibiting teacher enactment of computational thinking in mathematics and CTE, and whether a relationship exists between teachers' CBAM score and implementation of PBL. The practice of developing collaborative partnerships between mathematics and CTE teachers to design and test their courses employing PBL techniques is unique and may serve as a powerful and replicable model for making mathematics more relevant to students.</AbstractNarration>

Czerniak1, Ahmad Javaid1  1The University of Toledo                  Overview. INITIATE was a 3-year, STEM+C Partnership Program Design and Development project that partners high school Mathematics and Career Technical Education (CTE) teachers in Toledo Public Schools (TPS). Due to mathematics oftentimes serving as a gatekeeper for further STEM study, including technical careers, and to the strong reciprocal relationship between mathematics, Computational Thinking (CT), and preparation for STEM careers, the project included teachers of Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, and Statistics/Analysis. The topic of smart vehicles coupled with project-based learning (PBL) blended mathematics with science (e.g., physics), technology, and engineering.                  Project Goal. The overarching goal of the INITIATE program was to create and test a teacher professional development intervention that encourages teachers to integrate computational approaches into their teaching. By the conclusion of the 4-year project, we expected to provide professional development to 35 mathematics and career technology education teachers.  We identified six objectives that helped reach the overall goal of INITIATE:    1)      Increase the number of students who pass Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II courses and high school Ohio mathematics tests,  2)      Improve student computational thinking skills (Data Practices; Modeling &amp; Simulation Practices; Computational Problem-Solving Practices; and Systems Thinking Practices),  3)      Increase student interest in STEM and STEM-related topics, courses (e.g., 12th grade elective Statistics and Analysis), and career paths,  4)      Increase CTE teacher understanding of state mathematics standards,  5)      Infuse project-based learning strategies into mathematics teaching, and  6)      Increase mathematics and CTE teachers’ ability to work together to improve the mathematics and CTE curriculum.     Broader Impacts. INITIATE will have broader impacts because the model will better motivate and engage poor, culturally diverse, and female students in mathematics courses that oftentimes serve as a gateway that limits future STEM study. The practice of having mathematics and CTE teachers collaborate to design and test their courses utilizing PBL techniques is unique and may serve as a powerful and replicable model for other districts aiming to make mathematics more relevant to students. The dissemination of PBL modules/courses will provide teachers across the country with a proven means to incorporate CT into these subjects. Using smart vehicles as a topic not only helps us reach Computer Science Standard (CSS) goals but it links grade 9-12 teachers and students with academia, industry, and corporate partners to prepare students in becoming informed citizens who understand how computational thinking, engineering design, and mathematics can help solve today’s scientific and technical problems. Finally, we anticipate that increased student interest and ability in STEM and technical careers could help close the gap in today’s workforce.     Project Outcomes. INITIATE resulted in the following outcomes.    Mentoring of graduate assistants in presentation and pedagogical techniques. Training and development of faculty members involved in the project in PBL and mathematics standards during lesson design and planning.  Mentoring 9-12 teachers in PBL and research and theory in mathematics/CTE education.  A website for disseminating information about the project and to make lesson plans available to both professional developers and high school teachers (http://www.utoledo.edu/research/initiate/).  Lesson plans involving the subjects of smart cars and cybersecurity that can be used for teaching Algebra 1, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus I, Calculus II, and Statistics. Data on teacher confidence in adopting the INITIATE model.  Data on teacher computational thinking assessment.   At the end of the project, results of the following evaluation questions were affirmative:   a.    Does INTIATE teacher professional development improve teacher understanding of CT standards and PBL? b.    Do teachers integrate CT into their mathematics and computer science teaching? c.    Does the INITIATE model work? d.    Does the Stages of Concern Questionnaire function as an effective tool for diagnosing and addressing teacher concerns and implementations?
