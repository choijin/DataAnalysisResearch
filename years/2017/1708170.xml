<AbstractNarration>This award supports the U.S. National Committees (USNCs) within the Board on International Scientific Organizations of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The primary goal is to support effective U.S. participation and strong leadership in international science. The U.S. mathematical and physical sciences communities are represented by USNCs in seven international scientific organizations: the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), the International Commission for Optics (ICO), the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr), the International Mathematical Union (IMU), and the International Union for Radio Science (URSI). &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This three-year award will provide dues payments to the seven international scientific unions (one year only for IUCr) and provide support for the management of the USNCs at the National Academies. USNC staff will coordinate U.S. activity within the unions; coordinate committee preparations for union meetings; work with the committees to identify research topics, issues, and programs of interest to their specific disciplines; and identify and support U.S. scientists to participate in union activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is demonstrated through activities related to the utilization of knowledge for the achievement of social goals, establishing nomenclature and standards, participating in the governance of the seven international unions, and advancing knowledge and understanding across the research community. Union activities encourage cooperative research and education efforts that reach across international boundaries and are designed to further develop and enhance each discipline nationally and internationally. The broader impacts of this project manifest themselves through union activities that promote teaching, training, and learning, that promote the growth of and diversity in the national and international workforce, and that help shape the international dialogue in the respective disciplinary areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant funded U.S. participation in and dues to international scientific unions:  International Astronomical Union (IAU), International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), International Union of Mathematics (IMU), International Commission for Optics (ICO), International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), and International Union for Radio Science (URSI).  The International Union of Crystallography was funded for one year.  The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is the U.S. adhering member, and membership responsibilities are conducted its U.S. National Committees (USNCs).  Intellectual Merit  IUPAP and IUPAC contributed heavily to the redefinition of four of the seven base units of the International System of Units (SI)--kilogram, mole, Kelvin, and Ampere. Within IUPAP, USNC members Bill Phillips and Peter Mohr provided leadership in the redefinition of the kilogram.    IUPAC develops resources for the worldwide chemistry community. IUPAC's Color Books are the world's authoritative resource for chemical nomenclature, terminology, and symbols.  The International Chemical Identifier (InChI) provides a non-proprietary identifier for chemical substances and is used in printed and electronic data sources enabling easier linking of diverse data compilations.   Scientific resolutions approved at the IAU General Assembly in 2018 addressed the Geocentric and International Terrestrial Reference Systems and Frames, the digitization and scientific exploration of historical astronomical data, and the renaming of the Hubble Law as the Hubble-Lemaitre Law.   The U.S. National Committee for URSI (USNC-URSI) organizes the annual National Radio Science Meeting (NRSM) and co-organizes the annual summer USNC-URSI/IEEE International Symposia on Antennas and Propagation.  In addition, every 5-7 years, the USNC/URSI and the Canadian National Committee for URSI co-organize a North American Radio Science Meeting.  The latter was held virtually in January 2021. Information from each meeting is shared with URSI and its international commissions.    The United States is very active in the governance of all these unions, and highly-qualified U.S. scientists and mathematicians are regularly elected to officer positions.  U.S. scientists and mathematicians also serve as union board members, and as officers and members of Divisions and Commissions.   Hosting international meetings gives the United States a chance to showcase science and mathematics in this country, increase awareness of their role in the U.S. economy, advance education at all levels, and serve as a draw for scientists and mathematicians in nearby countries.  The USNC/IMU is exploring a possible U.S. bid for the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 2026.   Broader Impacts  In order to develop a future generation of scientists capable of leading international decisions, programs, and initiatives, Early Career Researchers (ECRs) must be exposed to meetings and activities where international scientific decisions and exchanges take place.  All of the USNCs focus some of their efforts on ECRs.  IAU and its member countries wanted to include more early career astronomers, so a new category of junior membership was proposed in 2017.  The USNC/IAU provided a number of suggestions and junior membership was subsequently approved at the 2018 IAU General Assembly.  The USNC/IAU also continues to sponsor and help organize Young Astronomers (YA) events at the IAU General Assembly.  The USNC/IUPAC is heavily involved in the Young Observers (YO) program that facilitates the participation of chemists under the age of 40 at the IUPAC General Assembly and Congress.  Since the program's creation in 1977, the USNC has supported more than 230 YOs providing them an opportunity to become exposed to and involved in the work of IUPAC.  The USNC/IUPAC held a YO Summit in March 2019 that looked at the program's accomplishments and how it can contribute further to the future of chemistry.   The USNC/IMU sponsored a breakfast for Early Career mathematicians at the IMU's International Congress of Mathematicians in 2018.  The USNC/ICO continues to support the Winter College in Optics at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy.  The USNC/IUPAP uses private funds to support the Canadian-American-Mexican (CAM) Graduate Conference, the Women in Physics Conference, and IUPAP's African Schools on Electronic Structure Methods and Applications (ASESMA).  Using private funds, the USNC/URSI continues to support the attendance of over 100 early career radio scientists per year at USNC-URSI and URSI meetings. In the last five years, it has provided over $252,000 in non-NSF funds to 526 young scientists to attend the NRSM to expose them to new research, and give them an opportunity to present their research. The USNC-URSI also continues to organize and support the Student Paper Competition on both the national and international levels.    International Years and other anniversary celebrations provide opportunities to share exciting science with the public.  In 2019-2020, IAU and IUPAC organized very active and successful centennial programs.  IUPAC and IUPAP also were heavily involved in the International Year of the Periodic Table.  The online Periodic Table Challenge was especially effective in reaching high school science students and the general public.  The USNCs supported and helped promote all of these.
