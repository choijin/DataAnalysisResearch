<AbstractNarration>Algebraic objects are often perceived as complicated and mysterious. In combinatorial representation theory one seeks simpler ways to represent them in order to understand, organize and apply them to other subjects. This project deals with tensor products of representations, which is a way to combine representations. The main problem that the project seeks to understand is how to decompose tensor products into sums of simpler representations. One can think about it as the problem of recovering individual signals from a mixture of signals. The tensor product decomposition is a difficult problem but also very important, because it shows up in many fields, including algebraic combinatorics, complexity theory, and statistics, and has applications in medicine, computer vision, physics, chemistry, and fast matrix multiplication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental open problem in combinatorial representation theory is to describe in the decomposition of the tensor product the multiplicities of two irreducible representations of the symmetric group; these multiplicities are called Kronecker coefficients. The problem of finding a combinatorial interpretation for these coefficients has been labeled as one of the "main problems in combinatorial representation theory." The PI and collaborators have been able to connect the Kronecker coefficients to the partition algebra. This connection led to the discovery of the "universal characters" of the symmetric group, which are symmetric functions that specialize to characters of the symmetric group when evaluated at roots of unity. These symmetric functions connect several difficult problems in combinatorial representation theory and will lead to the resolution of several of these problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Objects arising in algebra are often viewed as complicated and mysterious.  In combinatorial representation theory we seek to find simpler ways to represent these objects in order to understand and organize them.  The easier representations are often used to model physical phenomena. This proposal explored several projects related to decomposition of representations of the symmetric group and the general linear group.  In particular, decomposing tensor products of representations of the symmetric group is an important and difficult problem that shows up in many fields, including algebraic combinatorics, complexity theory, and statistics, and has applications in medicine, computer vision, chemistry, and fast matrix multiplication. Essentially, it is the problem of recovering individual signals from a mixture of signals.  This award provided funding for the PIâ€™s investigation in combinatorial representation theory.  In particular, the research centered on three major open problems in the area, the restriction problem, the Kronecker problem and the plethysm problem.   All these problems ask for combinatorial descriptions of coefficients that occur when decomposing representations of the symmetric group and the general linear group.   The investigation led to the discovery of new symmetric functions.  The discovery of these symmetric functions has provided a natural framework for these outstanding problems and it has also led to the introduction of new combinatorial objects and new connections with other algebraic objects.      In addition to the discovery of new symmetric functions, we have also introduced a new algebra of multiset partitions that is closely related to Kronecker coefficients.  We have also extended the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth algorithm to include set and multiset tableaux. This extension provides a combinatorial explanation of the decomposition of tensor product representations of diagram algebras.   Problems in representation theory have been linked to quantum physics and to theoretical computer science. Thus, the results will have a broader impact once they become mainstream.   In addition, the PI has involved undergraduates and graduate students in her research program.  By serving in the council of the AMS, the PI has continued her involvement with programs that improve the diversity, equity and inclusion in STEM fields.  Additionally, the PI has been involved in the mentoring of female mathematicians through a number activities and workshops.
