<AbstractNarration>Superparamagnets switch back and forth between two stable states without requiring an external power source, using only thermal energy. This project will investigate the potential for a new type of low power computing using superparamagnets, where the switching frequency can be controlled by a small voltage or current. Nanofabrication techniques will be used to make electrical connections to individual superparamagnets, and then the superparamagnets will be coupled together. To evaluate the potential of this approach for probabilistic computing, logic gates and related devices will be built and tested. for performance and energy efficiency in multiplication and in logic operations. The results will be used to estimate the potential power reduction and processing speed of probabilistic logic gates based on superparamagnetic tunnel junctions. If superparamagnetic tunnel junctions can be optimized for reasonably fast, low power probabilistic computation, the results would have tremendous impact on sensors and hand-held electronic devices, where speed is less critical than battery lifetime.  A graduate student will gain experience with nanofabrication and high frequency electronics. Hands-on and web-based demonstrations of logic gates will be developed for high school and middle school students, and both the graduate student and undergraduate researchers will be trained as STEM ambassadors, learning to communicate technical information to a broad audience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research project will design, fabricate, and test superparamagnetic tunnel junctions that can be controlled by a voltage or current, for use in logic devices for probabilistic computing. Suparamagnetic tunnel junctions will be optimized for large changes in the telegraph signal over relatively small difference in the bias voltage or input current. Different alloys will be investigated to reduce the energy barrier for switching, and therefore the speed of the devices. Hard-wired devices will be fabricated, and the thermal switching rates as a function of bias voltage and input current will be measured using high frequency electronics.  Following calibration of the individual superparamagnetic tunnel junctions, they will be coupled together into hybrid circuits and the resulting devices will be tested for use in probabilistic computing.  Analog multiplication will involve two independent voltage-controlled superparamagnetic tunnel junctions and a CMOS AND gate. Here the time-average value of the output is predicted to be the product of the time-average values of the  input signals. This operation is lower energy with probabilistic computing because it does not require analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion steps. Groups of three interconnected superparamagnetic tunnel junctions will also be investigated as prototype logic gates (AND and OR). The output will be measured as a function of the bias voltages controlling the individual tunnel junctions to optimize the coupling strength between devices necessary for the truth table of the logic gate.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this project was to investigate magnetic tunnel junctions with a superparamagnetic free layer, and their applications. In a superparamagnet, the thermal energy of the surrounding environment is sufficient to switch the magnetization direction, and the time between switching events is random. This makes superparamagnets undesirable for data storage, but useful for low energy probabilistic computing. Ensembles of interacting superparamagnets have been proposed for computing based on the Boltzmann or statistical probability of the different collective states. While ideally each superparamagnet could be programmed with its own external magnetic field, this is impractical for microelectronic devices. The key to probabilistic computing that was investigated here is the ability to independently modulate the signals coming from individual superparamagnets electronically.&nbsp;</p> <p>The main Intellectual Merit of this research has been an improved understanding of how to control superparamagneticfluctuations in magnetic tunnel junctions with a current or voltage, and the demonstration of how such devices could be coupled together to form probabilistic logic gates.&nbsp;There were different stages of development for the superparamagnetic tunnel junctions for three targeted applications where there are potential advantages over conventional semiconductor-based electronics. The first stage was to demonstrate that superparamagnetic tunnel junctions can be used as low power random number generators. The second was to couple two of these tunnel junctions together, programming them independently with bias voltages, and showing that they could perform analog multiplication, where the time average of the output is the product of the time averages of the inputs. The third was demonstration of an invertible logic gate made by coupling three superparamagnetic tunnel junctions together.&nbsp;</p> <p>There were several significant outcomes. For low power random number generators, perpendicular magnetization was preferable because it enabled the use of voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy. However, for analog multiplication and logic operations, in-plane magnetization devices performed better because the time-average magnetization could be tuned over a wider range using spin transfer torque. This leads to an S-shaped or sigmoidal response curve, so that the time-average magnetization can be tuned as a function of voltage. This enables the uncoupled state of individual superparamagnets to be programmed independently. For the logic gates, the output voltage of each tunnel junction is used as feedback, shifting the position on the sigmoid curve of the other superparamagnets. The magnitude and polarity of the feedback is chosen to minimize the energy of the microstates consistent with the truth table of the desired logic gate. For example, this means that statistically, the fraction of time spent in states corresponding to an AND logic gate will be greater than that spent in inconsistent states. An important feature of probabilistic logic gates is that they are invertible, so that the statistical likelihood of particular inputs can be determined from the time average of the output. Invertible logic gates therefore have potential uses in decryption, while random number generators based on superparamagnetic tunnel junctions have advantages for high speed hardware-based data encryption.
