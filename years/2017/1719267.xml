<AbstractNarration>TITLE: Adaptability of a key Arctic freshwater fish to climate change&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rapidly changing climates uniquely challenge Arctic fish that rely on interconnected, seasonally available habitat. The Arctic grayling migrates annually between breeding sites in streams and unfrozen overwintering habitat. Their movement is restricted to a small number of interconnecting waterways. Warmer climates are creating dry streambeds when fish need to migrate to winter habitat. Warmer streams could challenge fish adapted to cooler water. Substantial movement, plasticity, or adaptive genetic variation might allow for resilience to these stressors. This study proposes to study populations from three representative Arctic streams that differ in temperature, connectivity, and sensitivity to climate change. Pilot data indicate increasing drying events that threaten the grayling?s return to overwintering sites as well as substantial population structure among and within watersheds. Species can respond to climate change through movement, phenotypic plasticity, or local adaptive evolution. Most research fails to address one or more of these fundamental strategies, and these gaps currently limit our ability to predict future responses with accuracy. This study addresses all three strategies to understand the persistence of a key Arctic species. The researchers will address five broader impact areas: 1) expanding opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, including promoting opportunities for minority involvement of native Alaskans; 2) building upon existing links between Arctic research field crews and K-12 educators in the lower 48 states; 3) broadening scientific understanding in Arctic minority communities, including residents in Barrow, AK and initiating new outreach to Anaktuvuk, AK; 4) enhancing public education via governmental outreach, media relations, and publicly accessible web resources; and 5) expanding cooperation with state and federal agencies in developing management recommendations for Arctic fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will 1) assay movement at four time scales ranging from days to centuries; 2) evaluate plasticity and adaptive differentiation among populations; 3) assess populations for loci under selection; and 4) determine natural selection against grayling subpopulations by integrating data on selected loci with the movement of individually tagged fish. This study will test how watershed characteristics influence movement patterns using individual tagging, otolith micro-chemistry, and genomics. Individual tagging records fine-scale daily movement, otolith micro-chemistry allows the reconstruction of lifetime movement patterns, and genomic data reveals recent and historical movement across the landscape and genes under selection. Lastly, this study will quantify genetic and environmental contributions to performance of fish from divergent environments.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Arctic grayling is a key Arctic species because it is often the only fish species in thousands of miles of streams and is an important food item for larger fish such as Lake trout and Arctic char. To survive, Arctic grayling migrates annually between breeding and feeding sites in streams and rivers and unfrozen overwintering habitat, which is also where Lake trout live year round. Warmer climates are creating dry streambeds in the fall when fish need to leave freezing streams to migrate to winter habitat. Warmer streams and lakes could also increase the food demands of Arctic grayling because warmer fish need more food. Changes through either plasticity or adaptation might allow resilience to these stressors.</p> <p>Here, we quantified how migration plasticity and adaptation to local environments mediate the climate responses of Arctic grayling. We assayed movement at four time scales ranging from days to centuries, evaluated plasticity and adaptive differentiation among populations, looked for a genetic signature of natural selection, and integrated this data on selected loci with the movement of individually tagged fish.</p> <p>We found migration timing and duration of arctic grayling is determined by changes in day length and temperature that regulate migration readiness, but initiation of migration is triggered by high river discharge events.&nbsp; Migration is also delayed or completely stopped by late season droughts that are increasing as the Arctic warms. This suggests that changes in river discharge can have profound effects on the timing and successful completion of migration and thus survival. We found that timing of migration into overwintering lakes was related to size, with larger fish moving first and smaller fish moving later.&nbsp; The combination of darkness, which lessens the detection probability, and lower temperature, which slows the strike times of Lake trout, provides a refuge from predation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p class="Normal1">Arctic grayling show metapopulation genetic structure associated with large-scale river systems that developed during distinct glaciation events, with local scale variation exacerbated by drying events.&nbsp; Assessment of population structure and factors influencing gene flow could help identify populations susceptible to local extinction and aid in conservation measures that mitigate extirpation risk. Gene flow from genetically unique headwater populations to the coastal population might provide resiliency to the metapopulation by creating a genetic reservoir from which genotypes are redistributed. However, continued river drying might exacerbate population isolation, increase headwater population extinction risk, and alter metapopulation dynamics.</p> <p class="Normal1">Arctic grayling also show microgeographic variation in traits and survivorship within a river system associated with migration distance from overwintering locations and river temperature.&nbsp; Variation in movement patterns of spawning adults that might have evolved through selection due to variation in habitability (i.e. river drying and temperature) has implications for Arctic grayling local population persistence in a rapidly changing Arctic climate.</p> <p class="Normal1">The migration of Arctic grayling is an important mechanism for the distribution of energy and nutrients across the landscape, and provides a key trophic supplement that sustains large Lake trout fish in headwater lakes. Migratory Arctic grayling effectively increase ecosystem size (i.e., habitat) beyond lake boundaries, permitting predator populations (i.e. lake trout) to overcome bottom-up constraints of small lentic ecosystems.
