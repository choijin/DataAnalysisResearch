<AbstractNarration>Title:  Minority Population Experiences of Healthcare&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will analyze the healthcare experiences and needs of racially diverse sexual and gender identity minorities (SGMs) patients within two different healthcare organizations to reveal factors that shape SGM decisions about seeking or delaying access to healthcare. By doing so, this project will bridge urgent gaps in our knowledge about how social forces influence SGM access to healthcare, as well as contribute a theoretical model to help future scholars understand how organizations impact healthcare use. Insight generated by this project will address the important social problems of discrimination and inequality within healthcare by helping to decrease barriers to care for minority populations at high risk of underutilization and poor health.&lt;br/&gt; Compared to heterosexuals, SGMs are in poorer health as indicated by a wide variety of measures and at every stage of the lifecourse?yet SGMs are significantly less likely to access healthcare. Although one primary strategy for addressing SGMs' underutilization in the U.S. has been the creation of SGM healthcare organizations, how different organizational contexts influence SGM healthcare experiences and use has yet to be empirically examined. This project uses interviews with patients and providers as well as ethnographic observation at two healthcare organizations in New York City: one specialized for SGMs and one designed for the general population.  Questions driving the project include: why do diverse SGMs delay seeking healthcare? How do they make decisions about care? What do diverse SGMs understand to be their specific needs within different health settings? And (how) do organizational factors and contexts shape diverse SGM patients' experiences and healthcare decisions? Gathering and analyzing three data sources: patient perspectives, provider perspectives, and direct observation will allow for triangulation during analysis, which will help ensure robust findings about how individual and organizational factors come together to influence minority experiences of and decisions about care.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Emily Allen Paine has completed data collection for her dissertation project, supported by a NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant. This dissertation qualitatively examines the healthcare experiences and decisions of LGBTQ adults across healthcare contexts. Although LGBTQ people are at high risk of poor health and healthcare avoidance compared to their straight counterparts, what compels LGBTQ people to seek or avoid care remains unclear. There is a dearth of research on two groups most likely to delay care: LGBQ cisgender women and transgender men. And despite evidence that exposure to stigma and discrimination differs across contexts, the ways that gendered and sexed organizational processes are shaping LGBTQ experiences of&mdash;and subsequent decisions about&mdash;healthcare has yet to be examined.     This dissertation project asks: What happens during everyday healthcare interactions to compel LGBTQ adults to continue or avoid care? And how are organizational processes shaping LGBTQ healthcare experiences and decisions?     To address theoretical and empirical gaps, Paine collected original data in the form of in-depth interviews with 50 racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse LGBTQ adults, ethnography of a LGBT Community Health Center, and interview with 23 providers and staff at this field site (total N = 73). 45 of these interviews and 3 (out of 10) months of ethnography observation took place during the funding period and were made possible by this grant. In three papers emerging from this study, Paine triangulates data to reveal how medical constructs of gender and sexuality deployed through organizational practices across health settings play key roles in LGBTQ care experiences and decisions.     The first publication from this study, "Embodied Disruption: ?Sorting out? Gender and Nonconformity in the Doctor?s Office," is now published in Social Science &amp; Medicine and received recognition from the American Sociological Association as well as the Society for the Study of Social Problems. Paine finds that nonconformity to dominant medical schemas of sex, sexuality, and gender becomes salient in health interactions through the process of embodied disruption, in which providers mis/recognize patients and respond in ways that further stigmatize patients. By illustrating how medicalization of sex, gender, and sexuality influence LGBTQ experiences through medical interactions, Paine advances theories of gender and sexuality within medicine, stress and stigma and encourages future researchers to attend to gender nonconformity, embodied visibility, and structural factors.     Paine is currently drafting two additional papers from this study to submit to sociological journals. After she defends her dissertation in February 2019, Paine will write a book based on this project.       Last Modified: 08/29/2018       Submitted by: Emily Paine]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
