<AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation award supports a 5-day CBMS conference on "The Solution of Problems in Multiply-Connected Domains," at the University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, June 18-22, 2018.  Broadly, this conference is based around the use of methods from complex analysis to solve problems that arise in water waves, fluid flow and nuclear physics. The conference features the principal speaker, Professor Darren Crowdy of Imperial College London.  He is a leading expert on the applications of complex analysis. Prof. Crowdy will deliver 10 lectures and produce a monograph to be published in the CBMS series, providing an important reference for mathematicians and engineers. This award will sponsor a diverse group of additional speakers and attendees from both Southern California and the the remainder of the United States. The chosen dates follow the SIAM meeting on Nonlinear Waves and Coherent Structures which will be held in nearby Anaheim, CA, June 11-14, 2018. This activity increases the research activity within Southern California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced topics in complex analysis are being studied from a computational point of view with increased depth. Important examples are the numerical computation of conformal mappings, computing with compact Riemann surfaces using a variety of methods and the numerical solution of Riemann-Hilbert problems. These topics are important for a large array of (applied) mathematical areas such as integrable partial differential equations, random matrix theory, special functions, etc. These themselves lead to a variety of science and engineering applications. Very recently, in multi-phase physics the so-called Laplacian growth problem has been realized to have an underlying integrable structure linking it to the Toda and Whitham integrable hierarchies. The principal speaker has been very much a part of these developments in the last 20 years. Prof. Crowdy has pioneered a new constructive framework for solving problems in multiply connected planar domains which has led to a panoply of new results in the applied sciences. One of the most visible examples of Prof. Crowdy's work is his extension of the famous Schwarz-Christoffel formula from 1860 to multiply connected domains.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The CBMS Conference on the Solution of Problems in Multiply Connected domains was held at the University of California, Irvine, June 18-22, 2018.  The conference was organized by Professors Bernard Deconinck (University of Washington), Stefan Llewellyn Smith (University of California, San Diego) and Thomas Trogdon (University of California, Irvine).   The conference included 38 registered participants from 10 countries (16 participants with international affiliations).  Graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and other early-career researchers were supported to attend the meeting.  The majority of the particpants were either graduate students or postdoctoral researchers (22/38).  Approximately one quarter of the participants were from underrepresented groups. During the meeting the organizers facilitated discussions on open research problems and encouraged collaborations.  The conference included 10 lectures by Professor Darren Crowdy of Imperial College London on the solution of problems in multiply connected domains. These lectures were titled:  The geometry of complex functions The Schottky-Klein Prime Function Constructive potential theory Automorphic functions Multiply connected conformal mapping Cauchy transforms of planar domains Quadrature domains and applications in physics The geometry of Fourier transforms Fourier-Mellin transforms for circular domains Transform techniques for boundary value problems   Professor Crowdy discussed applications of these techniques to aerodynamics, fluid flow and elasticity.  In addition to Professor Crowdy's lectures, 4 additional lectures were delivered by experts in areas related to Professor Crowdy's work:  Edge dyanmics of a quantized vortex patch by Professor Paul Weigmann (University of Chicago) Som numerical methods for conformal mapping of multiply connected domains by Professor Tom Delillo (Wichita State) Complex analysis methods in fracture problems with surface elasticity by Professor Anna Zemlyanova A computational theory for Riemann-Hilbert problems by Professor Thomas Trogdon (University of California, Irvine)   A tutorial was given by Dr. Rhodri Nelson (Impearial College London) on how to use software developed by Professor Crowdy and his research team.  The conference also featured a poster session that allowed early-career reasearchers to convey their ideas to a broader, international community.  This fostered collaborations.
