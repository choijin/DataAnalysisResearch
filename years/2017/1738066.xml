<AbstractNarration>The National Academies' Board on Mathematical Sciences and Analytics (BMSA) provides a broad interface between the research enterprise and federal agencies that rely on the mathematical sciences. The Board provides objective and authoritative advice on how best to apply the tools of mathematics, statistics, operations research, financial engineering, simulation science, analytics, risk analysis, systems engineering, and decision analysis to practical problems of national importance. Over its nearly 33 years of existence, the BMSA has produced 81 reports. Through its work, the Board strengthens the policymaking process; increases the visibility of, and appreciation for, the mathematical sciences; and identifies growth areas for the discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Board provides objective and authoritative advice on how best to apply the tools of mathematics, statistics, operations research, financial engineering, simulation science, analytics, risk analysis, systems engineering, and decision analysis to practical problems of national importance. It consists of pro bono experts from a broad range of quantitative fields with experience in academia, industry, government, and national laboratories. Board members carry out their work by identifying important steps of value to federal agencies and the mathematical sciences, and then recruiting leading mathematical scientists to participate in workshops, studies, and other activities focused on the technical challenges of federal decision-makers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report for the General Public   Award #1738066 SUPPORT FOR THE  BOARD ON MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES AND ANALYTICS  Period of Performance: 09/1/2017&ndash;08/31/2018     The Board on Mathematical Sciences and Analytics (BMSA) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine provides expert advice relating to mathematical sciences to federal agencies. That advice helps to guide federal investments and to incorporate mathematical insight into public policy. BMSA also informs the greater mathematical sciences communities of emerging national challenges.  The subject award supported one in-person meeting and three virtual meetings of BMSA as well as preparations for these meetings and follow-through from these and previous meetings. BMSA?s meetings provide opportunities to build interfaces between the mathematical sciences communities and a wide variety of federal agencies, some of which have little involvement with the mathematical sciences communities and may not recognize the mathematical nature of their problems. This award also provided support for the continuity and "presence" of BMSA within the science policy community and the National Academies, resulting in more mathematical scientists getting involved in the science policy activities of the National Academies. Also, this award supported BMSA?s monthly "Mathematical Frontiers" webinar series.  During this performance period, BMSA initiated the following activities, both of which were funded separately:  A study on forecasting costs for preserving, archiving, and promoting access to biomedical data; and A workshop on the frontiers of mechanistic data-driven modeling for additive manufacturing.      BMSA also oversaw the following activities, all of which were funded separately:  BMSA?s standing Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics, A roundtable on data science postsecondary education, A study on envisioning data science undergraduate education, and A workshop on big data, modeling, and simulation in community sustainability.      The study on data science education resulted in 2 published reports and 11 public webinars, and each roundtable meeting is recorded, publicly webcast, and documented in a brief roundtable highlights.
