<AbstractNarration>Larger and more complex data sets are becoming more and more commonplace.  It is thus both advantageous and necessary to use statistical methods that are very flexible, and which allow the data to "speak for itself," rather than having researchers make strong unjustifiable prior assumptions about the data.  Flexible methods are thus necessary in the modern landscape, but they have the difficulty that the practitioner generally must "tune" the methods in order to get reliable results.  This introduces an ad-hoc element to data analysis, leads to a lack of replicability in results, and means (incorrectly tuned) statistical procedures may return incorrect results.  The unifying theme of this project is the development of statistical methods that are both very flexible and also fully automated, meaning they do not depending on user-chosen tuning parameters.  The application areas motivating this project are varied, and include the analysis of vaccine trials, the study of economic data, and the problem of outlier detection (used widely in financial services).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very flexible nonparametric statistical methods have become necessary tools to handle the complex nature of large data sets.  One difficulty with using nonparametric tools in practice is their general dependence on (potentially many) tuning parameters which must be chosen well to ensure reliable performance.  The focus of this proposal is on developing methods which can be implemented and lead to reliable results without requiring any ad-hoc steps by the end user.  Three main problems will be studied: (a) model selection for shape-constrained estimators, (b) likelihood ratio type tests for shape-constrained estimators, and (c) estimation and inference for complex features of multivariate densities.  In (a) and (b) the focus is on using so-called shape-constrained estimators, which have the benefit of simultaneously being nonparametric but also of automatically selecting optimal tuning parameters.  Furthermore, they arise out of natural or axiomatic prior information (e.g., economic theory or laws of physics) in many settings, and in such cases one should certainly use that information. In (c), the focus is on estimation of complex features of densities (such as level set manifolds, motivated by outlier detection problems).  Both shape-constrained methods and alternative methods will be considered, when shape constraints are not applicable.  There are few or no effective procedures available in many of the problems under consideration, because of the nonstandard nature of the problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project had three main lines of research related to nonparametric estimation and inference.  In one line of research we studied inference in nonparametric problems in which inference is generally very challenging.  By focusing attention on certain so-called shape constrained models (based around convexity constraints), we were able to develop inferential procedures that had several nice properties, including being tuning parameter free.  This led to 3 papers (2 in Annals of Statistics, 1 in Electronic Journal of Statistics).     In another line of research, we focused on studying theoretical properties of a variety of nonparametric estimators (such as their rates of convergence).  This led to 3 accepted papers and 1 under-revision paper (1 in each of Bernoulli, Electronic Journal of Statistics, and the Journal of Approximation Theory, and 1 under revision for resubmission to the Journal of Machine Learning Research) as well as 2 papers nearing submission.   In the third line of research, we studied multivariate (nonparametric) level set estimation.  Level sets are useful for capturing complex data set features, especially in multiple dimensions. In a paper (Electronic Journal of Statistics) we developed a principled method for doing estimation of level sets (using kernel density estimators, with a method for selecting the bandwidth matrix).  This opens the door for many further projects, such as level set estimation based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sequences, often used in Bayesian analysis to estimate the posterior distribution, which often leads to complicated multivariate features.   In total 7 papers were published, 3 have been submitted (2 of which are under revision at Journal of Machine Learning Research and JASA), and 4 others are nearing submission.     The research results from this project developed confidence intervals or hypothesis tests in challenging nonparametric setups which are useful on their own and as a demonstration of a powerful approach for nonparametric inference that will be applicable in many further convexity-based problems; developed theoretical foundations that will allow future study and development of several shape-constrained estimators; and enabled a principled method for estimation of complex features in multivariate datasets via level sets.   In addition to the publications, the research findings have been disseminated through giving talks at several major statistics conferences and departments.  The PI has also mentored students, including 1 PhD student graduating Fall 2020, and 5 master's students.  Through the support of the grant, the PI also helped organize (in summer 2019 and summer 2020) a Machine Learning for High School Students summer camp, which had two week-long sessions, one for only girls and one for all genders.  Research shows that some girls learn STEM fields better in all-girls environments.  The PI is also a mentor for underrepresented students through the Math Alliance, and is chairing a committee on recruiting, retaining, and supporting underrepresented students in the graduate programs at his home department.
