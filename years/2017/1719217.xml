<AbstractNarration>This project will support the participation of early career scientists and PhD students from US universities in the "Householder Symposium XX on Numerical Linear Algebra," to be held at The Inn at Virginia Tech, June 18-23, 2017, in Blacksburg, Virginia, http://www.math.vt.edu/HHXX/. The Householder symposium is the premier meeting in the field of numerical linear algebra and participation in this symposium is by application and invitation only. The symposium places a strong emphasis on supporting early-career scientists and the intermingling of such scientists with the leading experts in the field. The support of young researchers will  enhance the continued leadership of the US in this crucial discipline and its application to technologies that greatly benefit society. Advances and applications of numerical linear algebra are fundamental for handling large data sets with applications crossing web searches, medical imaging, scientific simulations, all high performance computing applications, and the design of both materials and structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Google's PageRank algorithm is a smart combination of methods from two numerical linear algebra fields, Perron-Frobenius theory/Markov chains and eigenvalue solvers. Similarly, deriving crucial information from today's giant data sets, which dwarf anything encountered before, whether from business, government, or the sensors in new medical imaging equipment, relies on substantial innovations to a core numerical linear algebra method, the singular value decomposition. Finally, ensuring efficient simulations on the next generation of supercomputers to assess the continued safety of the nation's nuclear weapons requires drastic changes to linear solvers, another ubiquitous numerical linear algebra method. Participation in the Householder Symposium, which includes discussions of hot new research topics and emerging areas will allow young researchers to  be exposed to problems of significant societal importance.</AbstractNarration>

This is the preeminent meeting in the field, and participation is by invitation only. Numerical Linear Algebra plays a key role in science and engineering and in important emerging technologies, such as data analytics, machine learning, web search and network analysis, data intensive applications in biology and chemistry, medical imaging, and geophysical exploration. Advances in numerical linear algebra also play a fundamental role in large-scale simulation, optimization, and design in science and engineering.

In total, approximately 160 scientists from all over the world participated in the conference. Two of the supported early career scientists gave plenary presentations, all others presented papers or posters at the meeting. A key feature of the Householder Symposium is the awarding of the Householder Prize for the best Ph.D. thesis published in the past three years.

Since the early 70's the meetings have been held every three years, alternatingly in the US and in Europe. From the start, the Householder Symposia have had a profound influence on research in numerical linear algebra. The original meetings were deliberately held in the&nbsp;&nbsp;remote mountain location of Gatlinburg to create the atmosphere of a working conference in contrast to the somewhat impersonal style of larger conferences. They were&nbsp;&nbsp;attended by the most influential members of the numerical analysis community as well as by many young researchers and Ph.D. students, who gained&nbsp;&nbsp;immeasurable benefit from close interaction with the giants of the field. Many of these students later became internationally known in their own right. The current meeting continued that tradition and the funds from the NSF provided essential support for young scientists to participate in this meeting and interact with leaders in the field.</div> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/10/2018<br>      Modified by: Eric&nbsp;De Sturler</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1719217/1719217_10468627_1538425894740_GroupPicture_Raw-3b--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1719217/1719217_10468627_1538425894740_GroupPicture_Raw-3b--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Group_Picture_Householder-XX"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1719217/1719217_10468627_1538425894740_GroupPicture_Raw-3b--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Group_Picture_Householder-XX"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Group picture of the participants of the Householder Symposium XX, 2017</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alexander Grimm</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Eric&nbsp;De Sturler</div> <div class="imageTitle">Group_Picture_Householder-XX</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1719217/1719217_10468627_1538425553140_EricCarson_Plenary-2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1719217/1719217_10468627_1538425553140_EricCarson_Plenary-2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Eric_Carson_Plenary_Presentation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1719217/1719217_10468627_1538425553140_EricCarson_Plenary-2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Eric_Carson_Plenary_Presentation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Eric Carson, a Courant Instructor/Assistant Professor at New York University, during her plenary presentation</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alexander Grimm</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Eric&nbsp;De Sturler</div> <div class="imageTitle">Eric_Carson_Plenary_Presentation</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1719217/1719217_10468627_1538367989443_KathrynLund-discussing-JosefSifuentes--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1719217/1719217_10468627_1538367989443_KathrynLund-discussing-JosefSifuentes--rgov-800width.jpg" title="KathrynLund_discussing_JosefSifuentes"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1719217/1719217_10468627_1538367989443_KathrynLund-discussing-JosefSifuentes--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="KathrynLund_discussing_JosefSifuentes"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Kathryn Lund, a graduate student from Temple University, is discussing her research with Josef Sifuentes, assistant professr at the University of Texas at Rio Grande Valley.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alexander Grimm</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Eric&nbsp;De Sturler</div> <div class="imageTitle">KathrynLund_discussing_JosefSifuentes</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1719217/1719217_10468627_1538427761935_Erin-Carson_Plenary--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1719217/1719217_10468627_1538427761935_Erin-Carson_Plenary--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Erin-Carson_Plenary_Audience"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1719217/1719217_10468627_1538427761935_Erin-Carson_Plenary--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Erin-Carson_Plenary_Audience"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The audience during Erin Carson's plenary presentation</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alexander Grimm</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use -
