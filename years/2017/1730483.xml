<AbstractNarration>This award funds research in economic theory that considers how to use information disclosures in order to persuade individuals to coordinate actions to benefit everyone. For example, suppose a bank faces a potential bank run and depositor insurance is not available. In this case, a government policy disclosing information about the bank's full portfolio of loans and excellent long-run profitability could convince depositors to stay with the bank. The research team wants to understand the best ways to disclose information under two different circumstances; first, when all individuals see the disclosures and second, when disclosures can be made to some people but not to others. The project is relevant to many applications in banking and finance and could help to improve policies designed to promote financial stability such as so-called 'stress-tests'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project studies persuasion in markets in which a large number of agents must choose whether to coordinate on a socially-desirable action or else take action against the status quo. Agents are endowed with heterogeneous private information about the underlying economic fundamentals. The analysis focuses on properties of optimal information disclosures, both in the case in which the mechanism designer must disclose the same information to all participants as well as the case of private disclosures. The project combines ideas from separate areas of economic theory: robust mechanism design, persuasion games, and coordination games. The team will also extend their analysis to consider the design of disclosure policies in settings in which the policy maker is uncertain about the initial distribution of beliefs among market participants. They will also consider the possibility of repeated attacks and the characterization of optimal policies in markets in which the designer must solicit information from the entity under scrutiny prior to communicating with the market.</AbstractNarration>

Think of a major financial institution trying to convince its investors to pledge, despite rumors about the institution’s non-performing loans. In such situations, a cash-constrained government’s instrument of last resort often takes the form of interventions aimed at influencing market beliefs, for example through the design of stress tests, or other information disclosures.   The research conducted under this grant addresses the following questions: (a) What disclosures minimize the risk of coordination failures? (b) When do optimal stress test take a simple pass/fail form? (c) Are there benefits to non-monotone rules, passing institutions with moderate fundamentals but failing some of institutions with stronger fundamentals? (d) What are the effects of an increase in market uncertainty on the structure of the optimal tests, and how do they depend on the banks’ recapitalization strategies? (e) How should optimal policies respond to the policy maker’s uncertainty about market beliefs, as well as to her uncertainty about the possibility for market participants to collect additional information after hearing the policy maker’s announcements?   The research led to the following two articles:    "Persuasion in Global Games with Application to Stress Testing," (with Nicolas Inostroza).  This paper studies robust/adversarial information design in markets with a large number of heterogeneously informed Receivers. In case multiple responses to the information disclosed are possible, the designer expects the Receivers to coordinate on the course of action that is least favorable to her. The main results are the following:  1.  Under the optimal policy, each Receiver is able to predict the response by any other Receiver, but not the beliefs that rationalize such response. Preserving heterogeneity in posterior beliefs is essential to the minimization of default risk. At the same time, there is no value in creating ambiguity about the response of the market to the information disclosed.  2.  When market beliefs co-move with the fundamentals in the sense of the monotone-likelihood ratio property, the optimal policy takes the form of a simple "pass/fail" test. When such a condition is violated, the optimal policy typically involves the disclosure of information in addition to whether or not the bank passed the test.   3. Monotone rules are typically suboptimal, but sharp conditions are also identified under which optimal rules are monotone. When such conditions are not met, the structure of the optimal rule is provided for the case in which market beliefs are sufficiently precise.  4. An increase in market uncertainty leads to a reduction in the toughness of optimal stress tests when banks fund themselves with equity but to an increase in toughness when they finance themselves with debt.   5. When discriminatory disclosures are possible, the analysis identifies conditions under which such disclosures may improve upon their non-discriminatory counterparts and shows how the optimality of discriminatory disclosures depends on the sensitivity of the agents’ payoffs to the underlying fundamentals.   "Preparing for the Worst but Hoping for the Best: (Robust) Bayesian Persuasion," (with Piotr Dworczak).    This paper proposes a novel solution concept for Bayesian persuasion that accounts for the Sender’s ambiguity over (i) the Receivers’ prior beliefs and the exogenous sources of information the Receivers may learn from, and (ii) the way the Receivers play given the information disclosed. The Sender proceeds in two steps. First, she identifies all information structures that yield the largest payoff in the "worst-case scenario," i.e., when Nature provides information and coordinates the Receivers’ play to minimize the Sender’s payoff. Second, the Sender picks an information structure that, in case Nature and the Receivers play favorably to her, maximizes her expected payoff over all information structures that are "worst-case optimal."   The paper (1) characterizes properties of robust solutions, (2) identifies conditions under which robustness requires separation of certain states, and (3) qualifies in what sense robustness calls for more information disclosure than standard Bayesian persuasion.   The analysis also shows that robust solutions can be characterized by an optimization program analogous to the one identifying Bayesian solutions but with a novel "state-separation" condition added as an additional constraint. The problem of finding a robust solution is then shown to be equivalent to the problem of finding a Bayesian solution with a modified objective function. Robust solutions thus inherit many of the structural properties of Bayesian solutions (e.g., the sufficiency of using as many signal realizations as there are states) while calling for more state separation in the induced posteriors.   Finally, the paper illustrates the effects of robustness by revisiting some of the most celebrated applications considered in the literature. It identifies instances in which (a) Bayesian solutions are worst-case optimal, (b) the unique robust solution entails full disclosure, and (c) robustness calls for a novel structure that differs both from full disclosure and from the structure of standard Bayesian solutions.
