<AbstractNarration>Dr. Elizabeth C. Thompson has been granted an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out research and education plans at Northwestern University. The investigation will determine the pressure and temperature stability field for aluminum-bearing super hydrous magnesium silicates minerals. The results of this study will help constrain the quantity and location of water in the Earth's transition zone and mantle (410-660 Km depth), a region of the Earth ~100 times more massive than the Earth's crust. The education plan will focus on mentoring, developing teaching materials and lectures, and outreach. Dr. Thompson will also collaborate with scientists at Ehime University in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project evaluates aluminum substitution in high-pressure superhydrous phase B, using several complementary techniques, including: (1) first-principles calculations, (2)synchrotron-based infrared spectroscopy, (3) Raman spectroscopy and (4) single crystal diffraction. These findings will impact deep Earth geochemistry in a wide-ranging sense, as Al-rich superhydrous phase B either ushers hydrogen through the transition zone and into the lower mantle or decomposes, releasing H2O depending on its P-T stability. Fluxed melts resulting from the decomposition of superhydrous phase B would produce chemical heterogeneities in the mantle. Additionally, dehydration melts may potentially influence plate tectonics due to the effect of hydrogen on melting temperatures and viscosity. This study will also explore the effect of Al-substitution on pressure-induced hydrogen bond symmetrization in superhydrous phase B, a phenomenon previously reported to have a significant influence on a mineral's bulk material properties including bulk modulus and its pressure derivative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  An intrinsic connection between Earth’s internal water cycle and the water cycle of the hydrosphere is supported by the relative stability of ocean levels over the past 600 million years. If hydrous oceanic plates subducted without water being recycled back to the surface, Earth’s oceans would have been depleted within 1 to 2 billion years. Evidence of a wet inner Earth exists in the form of hydrous phases found in mantle xenoliths and the discovery of hydrogen-rich diamond inclusions. The interconnectedness of the water reservoirs at the Earth’s surface and the deep interior is bolstered by seismic tomography that shows subducting lithospheric slabs can pierce the transition zone, potentially ushering hydrous phases through the transition zone and into the lower mantle.  High-pressure, high-temperature experiments and calculations are necessary to identify geological materials that can persist at the extreme conditions of planetary interiors. In this project, the geophysical properties of hydrous phases were evaluated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Infrared spectroscopy enables the detection of hydrogen bonding, while single-crystal X-ray diffraction enables a precise determination of the atomic structure of crystalline substances. Complementary density functional theory calculations were performed to probe the stability, equations of state, and elasticity of these phases. This work helps us understand the transport and storage of hydrogen in the Earth’s transition zone and lower mantle by providing geophysical constraints for comparison against seismic observations.  Midway through her fellowship, the PI relocated to begin a tenure-track position at Sewanee: The University of the South. The PI currently works with undergraduate students while she develops her research program. Owing to the ongoing discovery of new high-pressure hydrous phases, there remain important outstanding research questions about hydrogen’s importance in the deep Earth. Moving forward, the PI plans to work with non-ideal, nonstoichiometric systems to explore hydrous phases in a more realistic approximation of the Earth’s interior.
