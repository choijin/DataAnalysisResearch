<AbstractNarration>Quality undergraduate STEM education is critical for national success, progress in science, the advancement of national health initiatives, and overall national prosperity in an increasingly technical economy.  However, retention in STEM fields is critically low, particularly for women and other underrepresented groups. Reforming STEM education has drawn national attention, but ineffective instructional practices continue to dominate. The goal of this project is to address the national call for improved learning environments for undergraduate students in STEM classes by implementing a new framework for instructional change at the University of Portland that will serve as a model for sustained instructional change. The University has faculty in the following STEM fields: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Environmental Science, Engineering, and Computer Science. Participating faculty will learn to incorporate research-informed educational practices that favor active learning. Ongoing support for sustaining these new instructional practices will be fostered within cohorts of faculty as they engage in a reflective process of regular peer observation. The resulting instructional changes will improve the retention and success of STEM students while shaping the institutional culture of teaching in a lasting way. In addition, this model for supporting instructional change through shared practice will inform institutional change at other regional, comprehensive universities where reflective instruction is paramount.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To foster systemic instructional change, the project will invite a total of 25 STEM faculty members at the University of Portland to participate in week-long summer workshops across two successive years. They will explore current research-supported instructional practices. Project leaders will assist participants in the development and implementation of evidence-based, student-centered curricular innovations and meet with participants throughout the implementation period. In order to ensure that instructional change is sustained by participants, project leaders will also foster the development of communities of practice, wherein cohorts of participants will observe one another and engage in structured, reflective conversation about teaching and learning. Participants will be trained in formative assessment and in process-oriented protocols for evaluating teaching. Project leaders will host a local symposium at the end of the project to disseminate results and strategies to other regional universities that could similarly benefit from systemic change efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of the proposed project, Redesigning Education For Learning through Evidence and Collaborative Teaching (REFLECT), was to increase significantly the use of highly effective, evidence-based STEM teaching methods at the University of Portland using peer observation. The proposal team from science, engineering, mathematics, and education planned to create and test an innovative method of teacher change based on faculty peer observation that led to reflective teaching. The REFLECT framework was designed for small teaching-focused universities where the incentive structure for faculty is often based on teaching success rather than research output. The REFLECT framework was organized to support adopters by providing an alternative form of assessing teaching through peer evaluation and reflection, going beyond student evaluations. The REFLECT team developed and facilitated training workshops to expose faculty to highly effective evidence-based teaching methods and assist faculty in implementing them. The professional development (PD) was be designed to foster support within a cohort of faculty using evidence-based methods and our new protocols for peer observation. The workshop and PD also provided training on faculty peer observation and the process of reflective teaching. Over time, this peer observation and reflection process has provided a support network that helps STEM faculty to continue to implement evidence-based teaching methods, ensuring sustainability of the REFLECT program. The project structure aligned with the incentive system for teaching-focused universities, where teaching performance is highly valued and may not be well characterized in student evaluations. The REFLECT project supported the NSF-IUSE goal of improving STEM learning environments by fostering the wider use of evidence-based resources and pedagogies at the University of Portland. The REFLECT project created a new framework for institutional change, piloted the implementation of the framework, and developed innovative tools and materials that support the framework.
