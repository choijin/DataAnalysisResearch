<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Northeastern Analysis Meeting" that will be held October 13-15, 2017 at the State University of New York-Albany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of partial differential equations, harmonic analysis,  and operator theory. A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NEAM 2017, the Second Northeastern Analysis Meeting, was an Analysis conference held in the Fall of 2017 at the University at Albany SUNY, which drew a large audience of 106 participants. Thanks to the 13 plenary talks, all attendees were exposed to interesting concepts and methods from other fields of Mathematics, inspiring them in their own research and giving rise to cross-disciplinary collaborations. In addition, the 47 parallel session talks gave participants the occasion to more thoroughly immerse themselves into their own fields of study. Junior mathematicians constituted 71% of the participants and gave 60% of the conference talks. Thanks to the substantial presence of senior faculty, junior participants had an opportunity to interact with world-renowned experts in various branches of Analysis and to approach them in person, so as to benefit from their presence and from their guidance. Many participants came from smaller regional institutions from the northeastern United States. Due to its accessibility, NEAM was the first large conference of its kind that they attended. Being scheduled in the fall, NEAM is especially helpful to participants who are currently on the job market, who can take advantage of this opportunity to polish the presentation of their results and popularize their research findings. Albany graduate and undergraduate students took advantage of this unique opportunity to learn about the broad mathematical topics discussed at the conference. Some faculty members from other fields also attended. There were over 20 local participants. Several doctoral and masters students volunteered to help, thus gaining an opportunity to fully immerse themselves in a mathematical environment and to make contacts that may help them in their future careers. The conference reached a wide variety of target audience groups, spanning from undergraduate, masters, and doctoral students, to postdocs, adjoint faculty, and assistant professors, to 29 tenured faculty members, and even some retired mathematicians. This Albany edition of NEAM led to sustained discussions among all participants and gave mathematicians from disparate branches of Analysis an occasion to get together and exchange ideas. Already, from its second edition, the conference is meeting its goal of bringing together all researchers interested in Mathematical Analysis, from the Northeastern US and beyond, and serving their professional and scientific needs.
