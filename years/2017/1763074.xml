<AbstractNarration>One of the models the PI is proposing to investigate is the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation.  This equation was derived more that a hundred years ago to explain the behavior of long waves in channels of shallow water.  In the 1960s, researchers at Princeton's Plasma Physics Laboratory demonstrated that this equation exhibits a wealth of novel features, which have sparked the interest of mathematicians and physicists alike.  However, despite all the attention it has received over the years, existence of solutions under minimal assumptions has been proved only recently by the PI and her collaborators.  One ingredient in their work is the recent discovery of new conservation laws.  This project outlines several additional problems that can now be attacked using this discovery.  Another major impetus behind this project is to prove that complicated transient dynamics resolve into simple dynamics in the distant future.  The physical significance of this phenomenon relies on its stability under perturbations.  While in the past, the PI has investigated deterministic perturbations to the equations, the current project takes this theme in a new direction by considering stability in the presence of (random) noise.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on several problems that lie at the intersection of nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations, completely integrable systems, and stochastic partial differential equations.  The PI's discovery of new microscopic conservation laws for KdV has opened the door to treating three seemingly unrelated problems of long-standing interest regarding KdV on the line: optimal regularity well-posedness, symplectic non-squeezing, and invariance of white noise.  In addition, the PI is proposing a coherent plan for establishing invariance of the Gibbs measure for the Landau-Lifshitz model and invariance of white noise for the focusing cubic Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NLS).  This program involves establishing the analogous statements for the physical atomic models associated with these problems (which the PI has successfully completed) and then taking the continuum limit for the corresponding rough data.  This should reveal the physical renormalizations for the Landau-Lifshitz and the cubic NLS models that would ensure well-posedness for such data.  As the Gibbs measure for the Landau-Lifshitz model corresponds to Brownian motion on the sphere, this problem is also interesting from a purely probabilistic point of view as yielding a Hamiltonian measure-preserving flow on such paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
