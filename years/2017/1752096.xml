<AbstractNarration>Undergraduates in science, technology, engineering, and math not only need to enter the workforce with strong technical skills, but also with strong professional skills such as writing, presenting, and working in teams. Unfortunately, many leaders in industry report that the professional skills of these students are not strong enough. Therefore, colleges and universities are looking for new ways to strengthen these skills. Adding additional course content to existing courses or creating new courses to teach this content is often not feasible due to already crowded curricula. Outside of courses, one opportunity for undergraduates in technical fields to learn professional skills is through outreach activities. In these activities, undergraduates reach out to younger students in elementary, middle, and high schools and communicate what occurs in their respective fields. For example, outreach could include hosting a summer camp for middle school students on robotics or visiting a high school to give an electrical engineering demonstration. Not only do undergraduates receive training for these outreach activities, but they have the opportunity to practice what was learned multiple times. Recently, one outreach program, the Engineering Ambassadors Network, discovered that one of their particular training-and-practice sequences led the participating undergraduates to dramatically improve their presentation skills. Because scores of outreach programs exist around the country, the question arises: Do other outreach programs have training-and-practice sequences that lead undergraduates to greatly improve other professional skills?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to determine which outreach programs in the United States provide the most transformative professional development of the participating undergraduates from engineering. To accomplish this goal, we have identified four tasks: (i) perform a systematic review of existing outreach programs involving engineering undergraduates; (ii) convene a workshop with outreach advisors to establish a network and thematic strands of common practices; (iii) synthesize the data obtained from the workshops to identify transformative practices of professional development; and (iv) convene two national training workshops to disseminate the practices to engineering undergraduates who perform outreach. An advisory board, composed of a number of stakeholders, provides guidance for this project. To disseminate the project's results, we are using a number of venues and a range of communication methods.  In particular, we are targeting the many programs that conduct organized outreach performed by engineering undergraduates.  Specifically, dissemination is occurring through the two national workshops mentioned above, academic papers, an online report targeting a wide audience, and online tutorials for the transformative practices of professional development.</AbstractNarration>

To attract talented and diverse talent, many engineering colleges have created outreach programs to K-12 schools, and many such programs use undergraduate engineers to speak as near-peer mentors to the K-12 students. The literature has shown that engineering undergraduates benefit greatly, particularly in their communication skills, from the outreach training and presentation practice. One prominent example occurs in the Engineering Ambassadors Network (Image 1) in which undergraduate ambassadors learn advanced presentation techniques and then apply those techniques in outreach presentations to K-12 students. Our project focused on understanding the transformative learning that has occurred with engineering undergraduates in such experiences and on scaling and disseminating that transformative learning to other undergraduates in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).</p> <p>Communication skills are particularly important to disseminate because numerous studies have indicated that although STEM employers have for years ranked strong communication skills as critical, many STEM graduates still are not prepared to communicate their work. In this project, we discovered that the sequencing of teaching communication skills does not match up with when STEM undergraduates need to communicate as engineers. For example, although engineering undergraduates often formally learn to write and speak as engineers during their junior or senior year when they take a technical communication course, these undergraduates are often called upon to write and speak as engineers in laboratory courses, design courses, and summer internships. In other words, engineering students are asked to write and present as engineers before they have been taught how to do so. Such occasions are pain points for engineering students and often result in bad experiences causing undergraduates to assume that they are inherently weak at communicating as an engineer.</p> <p>To address this problem, our project took lessons learned from teaching undergraduate engineers in the Engineering Ambassadors Network how to give outreach presentations and applied those to teaching STEM undergraduates how to write and present as engineers and scientists. The result has been several series of short online films (such as the one in image 2) that provide coaching of STEM students whenever the students need it. Series topics include writing a technical report, writing a cover letter, writing a research paper, making an outreach presentation, and making a technical or scientific presentation. Treating this collection of about 100 films as an innovation, we have applied the NSF I-Corps for Learning process to scale and sustain the collection. In each of the first three years of the project, the collection drew about 40,000 film views with a total viewing time of no more than 90 days. After applying the NSF I-Corps for Learning process, the final year of the project received more than 80,000 film views with a total viewing time of more than 200 days.
