<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore the commercial potential of an educational innovation that can transform aspects of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and arts education in both formal and informal settings through the construction, analysis, and performance upon a set of custom musical instruments.  By coupling rigorous STEM learning with musical concepts, the technology can engage a diverse group of students in STEM who may otherwise not express an interest.  The technology may be commercialized in a variety of ways, ranging from kits for the home market to complete curricula for school programs.  Commercialization of the technology has significant potential to improve educational outcomes in these important STEM areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project builds upon a technology base of custom acoustical and electronic musical instruments that was initially developed for an educational program that has been attended by over 2,000 people in 10 states at schools, museums, and performing arts centers.  The intellectual merit of the work derives from the close coupling between musical content and state K-12 standards in mathematics, science, and engineering.  A pilot 6-week after school program for third grade students used the technology to draw connections between music and fractions, geometry, the physics of sound, engineering materials, and engineering design, which are all topics in the educational standards for that grade level.  Prototype instruments for higher grade levels illustrate concepts in algebra, pre-calculus, electronics, and computer programming.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this project was to determine the market viability of an educational technology that integrates STEM and music learning, in both formal and informal settings.  Using a business model canvas approach, supported by the LaunchPad Central platform, we conducted nearly 200 interviews with a variety of stakeholders including potential customers and partners.  These included administrators and teachers in public and private schools, leaders of homeschool groups, leaders of programs at the regional and national levels that offer informal STEM learning programs including the Boy &amp; Girls Clubs and Girl Scouts, and leaders of educational outreach programs at museums, science centers, and symphony orchestras.  Through this analysis, we determined that there is a substantial business opportunity, and began the processes of forming a new venture, called "Making Waves" as a new business unit within an existing local manufacturing company, South Bend Woodworks of South Bend, IN.  With the use of some prototypings funds made available through the I-Corps grant, along with separate funding obtained through an Indiana Department of Education School Improvement Grant and 21st Century Community Learning Center Grant, we we were able to pilot the technology with over 300 3rd-4th grade students in Elkhart and South Bend, IN and 25 8th grade students in Elkhart, IN.  Trials were also conducted with a summer program for middle school girls sponsored by GE.  The grade 3-4 curriculum emphasizes STEM topics including fractions, rhythm, measurement, sound waves, inequalities, solving problems with constraints that have more than one solution, and comparing alternative solutions.  The grade 8 curriculum is considerably more complex than that for grades 3-4, with a 60-hour pilot is being taught by I-Corps PI/Technical Lead with assistance from an undergraduate music education student and two middle school math teachers to a combined class of 25 honors and special needs students. It covers a wide variety of STEM topics including motion, force, and energy in sound production, proportional relationships and equations of lines, and the scientific method and iterative, hierarchical design processes in relation to both instrument design and music composition.  Results were assessed (under the companion Department of Education grants) by the Center for Research and Evaluation Lifelong Learning Group at the Center of Science and Industry (COSI) of Columbus, OH. Results showed improved fluency in the STEM and music content areas, as well as an improved ability to make connections between STEM and music concepts as well as positive social interactions.    The technology was demonstrated at the Accelerate Innovation and Creativity Festival at the Smithsonian Museum of American History in October, 2017. Development partner Third Coast Percussion, who won a Grammy in 2018, has used prototype instruments in their touring WAVES performance that educates the public about connections between STEM and music to a combined audience of over 5000 people across the U.S.  The intellectual merit of this work includes the knowledge gained of the business opportunity through the rigorous business model canvas approach to formulating and assessing a value proposition for a commercial venture based upon the integrated STEM+Music technology.  It also includes knowledge gained towards developing a minimum viable product through prototyping activities.  The broader impact of this includes the beginnings of an effective tech transfer of university research to a new business venture.  Beyond that are the impacts of the technology itself on the community, which promises to reach a new group of students in STEM learning that have not been engaged through prior approaches.
