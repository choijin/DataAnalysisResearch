<AbstractNarration>The University of Washington, as the lead organization of the Research + Practice Collaboratory, will run three workshops to provide technical support for constructing the kinds of research-practice partnerships (RPPs) that are required by the new CSforAll Solicitation (NSF 17-525).  The hands-on workshops, modeled on a shorter version held in September of 2016, are designed to&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Generate interest in the value of RPPs in supporting new efforts in sustainable, equity-oriented CS education, &lt;br/&gt;2. Advance understanding on the formation and maintenance of robust RPPs, and &lt;br/&gt;3. Support teams in the development of appropriate RPP research questions and project designs that could result in benefits to both practice and theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops will be held in January 2017 in three cities: Atlanta, Los Angeles, and Chicago.  Prospective PIs will apply in teams of 3-4 people.  Teams should include a K-12 educator with responsibility for curriculum and instruction, professional development/certification, or assessment, a K-12 educator who will be responsible for implementing changes at the building or classroom level, and, if relevant,  a community stakeholder that is an effective advocate for equity at the state or district level.  If the team has already identified an education researcher, that researcher should attend as well. Additional education researchers will be invited to work with the teams.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A brief report will be generated summarizing the areas of interest, possible tensions, and newly identified opportunities with respect to creating stronger connections between researchers and practitioners that can advance the equity-oriented CSforAll effort.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Research+Practice Collaboratory is exploring new models for connecting research and practice to improve K-12 STEM education.  One of these models is a research approach called research-practice partnerships (RPPs).  To support leaders in the Computer Science for All (CS for All) movement to form RPPs in response to a new NSF solicitation to fund CS for All RPPs, in January 2017 the Collaboratory hosted 3 RPP Design Workshops for teams of computer scientists, learning scientists/educational researchers, and K-12 leaders and educators.    INTELLECTUAL MERIT.  RPPs are long-term, mutually beneficial partnerships that are centered on educational problems of practice (and not on a research agenda per se). Together, educational leaders, practitioners, and educational researchers identify pressing problems of practice, articulate what forms of data could inform practice, design research approaches to collect data in a timely way, and interpret the meaning and implications of the data together.  Researchers and practitioners may play distinct roles in this process (e.g., researchers may collect the data, practitioners may implement curriculum), but the design of the studies and the meaning-making of the data are collaborative. Ownership of both research and implementation is thus shared.  It is conjectured that the results of RPPs are therefore more relevant, salient, and sustainable in practice.  BROADER IMPACTS.  RPPs can ensure that improvement projects build on the evidence-base, use evidence in an ongoing and timely way way to inform their implementation, and contribute to the evidence-base&mdash;building knowledge that can inform other K-12 improvement efforts.  PROJECT ACTIVITIES.  Teams applied to attend the workshops.  Working with our partners who were hosting the workshops at Spelman College, DePaul University, and UCLA, we accepted a total of 92 teams, consisting of 328 participants.  The RPP Design workshops, held in Atlanta, Chicago, and Los Angeles, were highly interactive, focusing on: (1) Developing teams' understanding of what RPPs are; (2) Articulating each team's equity goals, visions, and definitions for their local projects; (3) Identifying key problems of practice related to each team's shared vision of equity in K-12 CS education; and (4) Developing each team's project goals, objectives, and research questions.  Leading scholars and practitioners presented keynotes talks, served on panels, and led break out sessions focused on research and data collection methodologies appropriate to RPPs.  The Collaboratory's external evaluator found high levels of satisfaction with the workshops. Survey respondents reported that they shared resources and insights with others who did not attend the workshops.  They indicated interest in receiving more support as their projects developed. 19 of the 21 awarded CS for All RPP projects had attended the Research+Practice Collaboratory workshops, suggesting that the workshops had productive results for participating teams.  Lessons learned included: There is a need to develop more researchers with capacity and understanding of how to work in RPPs.  There is interest in the CS for All community to not only "build on" but to "build up" the evidence base on effective implementation efforts in K-12 computer science education.
