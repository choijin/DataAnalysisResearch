<AbstractNarration>Cities and communities face growing challenges as population size and demographics change, infrastructure ages, and economic and environmental pressures increase. Collaborations among cities and communities, universities, and industry have the potential to address these challenges -- providing opportunities for information and communication technology innovations, research capacity building, and workforce growth. This project includes a two-part workshop to be hosted at Boston University in July 2017 and in Washington, D.C. in November 2017. The goal of the workshop series is to identify and propose effective models of city-university-industry collaboration that help bridge the gap between fundamental research on problems inspired by communities, aiming to provide deployable solutions and sustainable services that improve the quality of life in various smart-and-connected community settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The anticipated outcome of the workshops is to generate a report that puts forth best practices and models of collaboration, with a particular emphasis on actionable opportunities that will enhance the impact of cross-sector smart-and-connected communities research. Specifically, this project seeks to understand and elucidate resources and processes, which yield robust, mutually beneficial, enduring relationships between cities, universities, and industries; translate fundamental, sociotechnical research into applications that have a meaningful impact within the community; and create foundations necessary for applications to be sustained over time. In addition, identifying improved processes and incentive-compatible collaboration models has the potential to catalyze a number of broader impacts, including: enhancing student engagement and experiential learning through translational research; ensuring sustainability of established relationships and of developed solutions; developing a diverse human capital by engaging underrepresented minorities and early career researchers in workshop planning and activities; and advancing technology commercialization and business development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2017, the Boston University Hariri Institute for Computing and the Initiative on Cities co-hosted two workshops on "Effective Community-University-Industry Collaboration Models for Smart and Connected Communities Research." with the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF). These efforts brought together over one hundred principal investigators and research directors from universities across the country, as well as city officials, community partners, NSF program managers, MetroLab Network representatives and industry experts.  The focus of these workshops was on transdisciplinary "smart city" projects that bring technical fields such as engineering and computer science together with social scientists and community stakeholders to tackle community-sourced problems. Presentations, panel discussions, working sessions and participant white papers surfaced operational models as well as barriers and levers to enabling effective research partnerships. To capture the perspectives and beliefs of all participants, in addition to the presenters, attendees were asked to synthesize lessons on each panel topic.  The context for the two workshops underscored the following realizations, which informed the development of the agenda.   All collaboration is hard. Collaboration requiring partnerships that draw experts from diverse institutions to tackle urban challenges is no exception. When partnerships underlying smart and connected community projects succeed they can have a tremendous impact both on societal well-being and professional fulfillment of all researchers and practitioners involved in the project.  Demand for deeper partnership is coming both from within and outside the academy and engages constituents well beyond basic research, in particular as it relates to student experiential learning opportunities.  While intention and demand may exist, hurdles to operationalize these relationships abound.  To succeed, all parties must focus on the whole relationship not just one project.    Drawing on the collective wisdom of the assembled participants and the authors, findings from these two workshops were summarized in a report that presented the opportunities and recommendations that emerged from these sessions, providing guidance to cities and researchers interested in engaging in these types of partnerships as well as universities and funders that endeavor to nurture them.  Specifically, the report offers guidance on a number of questions that were deemed relevant to advancing socio-technical, smart &amp; connected community research projects. These questions are elements of the answers detailed in the report follow.   How do academic researchers and city practitioners initiate and invest in productive working relationships with one another?  Leverage existing ties to community to initiate relationships Develop cultural awareness by learning the other's "business" Foster multiple connections within the university and the city Conduct multiple small, quick turn projects and share results Hold routine face-to-face meetings Use multiple communication channels Embed students in City Hall Host transdisciplinary events and seminars Develop fluency in and appreciation for a range of research methods Be kind, humble and curious    How do universities help motivate and contribute to the formation of multi-disciplinary faculty and student networks?  Invest in cross-discipline research centers Create formal programs to match existing skills to specific internal needs Curate shared physical spaces Create a dedicated seed grant fund Facilitate co-teaching Reward interdisciplinary work through tenure or promotion process   How do cities identify and prioritize their operational and community challenges, and enlist appropriate partners to help tackle them?  Create a dedicated cross-cutting innovation team in City Hall Signal research city priorities via a Research Agenda, RFIs and RFPs Create opportunities for embedded full-time innovators Formally enlist community partners as advisors Use the city as a test bed or living lab for research    How can industry position itself to serve as an open and engaged research partner?  Create visible, externally engaged staff positions who are not salespeople Develop and offer intentional student engagement strategies   How do relationships and projects transition to formalized, sustainable partnerships that simultaneously advance science and societal well-being?  Ask integrative questions Routinize and professionalize community engagement Invest in community capacity Develop an annual collaboration plan collaboratively Consider an MOU or contract Create a third party that brings together government, business, community and universities   How can findings and knowledge be disseminated more broadly, beyond the project team and geography?     Produce non-technical presentations and white papers Work together to develop a media strategy Leverage multiple communication channels Select the best messenger for each channel             Last Modified: 12/20/2018       Submitted by: Azer Bestavros]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
