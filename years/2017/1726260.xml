<AbstractNarration>This project will replace Calvin College's aging computational cluster with a newer, more flexible cluster for multidisciplinary research. The new cluster is designed to facilitate six research projects, as well as research training activities at Calvin, including a nascent Data Science program.  The resource will also offer the flexibility to support research activities beyond the local campus, specifically at Macalester, St. Olaf, and Wheaton Colleges.  By enabling new, as well as enhancing existing research and research training activities at Calvin, the cluster is expected to improve the technological capabilities of the United States cyber-workforce by equipping hundreds of students each year with domain-specific high-performance computing skills in computer science, data science, mathematics, statistics, and the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the cluster will enable research in: a thread safe graphics library (TSGL), used to create real-time visualizations of parallel algorithms; an agent-based economic model to evaluate the effects of different policies during transitions from non-renewable to renewable energy sources; new computational chemistry models used to explore the photophysical properties of common coumarins; accuracies of various economic models; 3D routing systems for first-responders and improved 3D sniper-line-of-sight models used by homeland security personnel in emergency situations; and enhancing Sivvu.org, a new web service for ERFA (Equilibrium Restricted Factor Analysis), a popular computational chemistry technique.  In addition, faculty and student research projects at Calvin, Macalester, St Olaf, and Wheaton colleges will also use the new cluster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore the cluster will enable new degree programs in Data Science and Statistics at Calvin. Students in these programs will use the new cluster to store and process large data sets.   Additionally, the cluster will enhance existing courses, such as CS 374, a course in High Performance Computing (HPC) where students will use the cluster to learn to program with MPI, OpenMP, CUDA, and similar HPC tools.</AbstractNarration>

A 100 Gbps Omnipath network is used for internal data communication between the cluster's nodes; a 40/10 Gbps Ethernet network is used for administrative communication within the cluster and for communication with the outside world.  To support high-speed communication between Borg and remote users, Calvin's Information Technology (CIT) department upgraded Calvin's network infrastructure between Borg and other campus hubs (including the campus gateway) to 40/10 Gbps Ethernet. Calvin also upgraded the electrical and climate control systems in the room housing Borg, and purchased a new uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system to power Borg.  Researchers from Calvin and other universities are using Borg to accelerate their research projects, including:   Researchers with traditional distributed-memory parallel research applications (e.g., MPI applications) use Borg's head node and compute nodes.  Researchers with traditional shared-memory parallel research applications (e.g., OpenMP applications) that are memory- and CPU-intensive use Borg's high-memory CPU node.  Researchers who need to process large data sets (e.g., using CUDA) and/or train machine-learning systems (e.g., using TensorFlow) use Borg's high-memory GPU node.  Researchers needing to run web services that utilize any of these subsystems run those services in virtual machines that run on Borg's virtualization node.  Researchers who need a place to store and quickly access large data sets use Borg's tiered storage system.   Software packages that researchers use on the cluster include:   Amber: a suite of tools for biomolecular simulation CUDA: Nvidia?s framework for GPU computing eQueue: a web-interface for running particular kinds of jobs on Borg Gaussian: a software suite for computational chemistry, and WebMO: a web-interface for Gaussian The GNU software suite: gcc, g++, and so on. Intel's software suite for cluster computing: Intel Parallel Studio, Intel C, C++, and Fortran compilers, etc. Message Passing Interface (MPI) implementations: OpenMPI, MPICH, and Intel MPI OpenMP for implicit multithreading in C, C++, or Fortran Python for general purpose scripting, used for custom astronomy simulations, TensorFlow applications, etc. R for statistical computations and R Studio, a web-interface for R Sivu: a custom-written service for modeling spectroscopic titration data  SLURM: a scheduler for reserving particular nodes and running software applications on them Societies: a custom-written agent-based economics model Tensor-flow for computations involving machine learning    Borg is thus being used to accelerate the research projects of faculty and undergraduate students in the areas of artificial intelligence (machine learning), astronomy, computational chemistry, computer science, economics, geographical information systems (GIS), and statistics.  While primarily devoted to research uses, Borg is also being used for workforce development, specifically:   to train undergraduate computer science and data science students in high performance computing methods. to train undergraduate chemistry students in inorganic computational chemistry methods. to store the large datasets by which GIS students are trained (remotely) in the use of GIS software. to host the development of a free, interactive, parallel computing textbook by the team at CSinParallel.org.   Borg is maintained by Calvin CS sysadmin Chris Wieringa, whose help has been invaluable throughout this project.          Last Modified: 12/31/2020       Submitted by: Joel C Adams]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
