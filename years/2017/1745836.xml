<AbstractNarration>Many states across the developing world lack the capacity to provide their citizens with basic human welfare needs, a trend linked to internationalized violence, illegal economic activity, and other deleterious dynamics. Yet welfare outcomes often starkly diverge within these country cases. Moreover, differences often manifest between cities or villages with similar ethnoreligious demographics and official political party representation. This project draws upon local-level data on social service provision, qualitative interviews, and an original survey to understand this variation in the context of contemporary Lebanon. Of particular interest to the researcher is why some Lebanese cities enjoy access to local "public" goods, such as waste management and consistent street lighting, while in others attempts to provide such services stall or are actively blocked. The author argues that local relationships between elite family networks play a crucial role in shaping how people access services. Specifically, in areas where one elite family or an alliance of families monopolizes political power, such public services are an effective way to ensure the support of local constituents. In areas with higher levels of competition between families, however, more individualized attempts at vote-buying predominate. The project disaggregates and thus provides a more micro-level understanding of so-called "weak states," where policymakers have recently begun to investigate the conditions under which non-state governance succeeds or fails.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many lower and middle-income countries, the central government fails to provide even basic social services, yet welfare outcomes drastically diverge at the sub-national level. In the case of Lebanon, explanations focusing on the role of national electoral institutions, official parties, or religious categories fail to explain important micro-level variation in distributive politics. This project uses a multi-method research design to explain why local political elites extend a variety of critical quasi-public (club) goods in certain Lebanese municipalities, while resorting to more transactional vote-buying in others. Drawing upon fifteen months of fieldwork across numerous Lebanon cities, over a hundred interviews, quantitative spatial analysis, and an original survey, the author argues that the relationships between local kinship networks - nested within political factions and religious communities - shape opportunities for elite collective action. Specifically, areas where one elite family or a familial coalition has excluded rivals from political power consistently provide more local public services, though usually via informal means that allow elites to secure private economic benefits. In areas with consistent inter-familial competition, highly individualized exchanges occur, while local infrastructure and communal goods are neglected. These findings suggest that formalized local institutions intended by the state to promote order, such as municipal councils and associated elections, are often co-opted and supplanted by informal social networks, producing counterintuitive outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Under what conditions do governments decentralize political authority, and to what end? Social scientists often frame local governments as the closest layer of the state to citizens. In some cases, they can facilitate social service delivery and enhance elite accountability.1 Yet decentralization of control to sub-national authorities can also be engineered by non-democratic regimes seeking to entrench their power, rather than to improve governance.2 The processes by which this occurs and its distributive consequences remain empirically under-examined in many contexts.        Survey Methodology  I developed the survey instrument, funded in part by the King Center on Global Development, at the conclusion of my fieldwork in Lebanon, integrating insights from interviews and fieldnotes in over a dozen municipalities. The survey mainly focuses on public perceptions of local governance and electoral behavior at both the national and municipal levels. It also includes two modules on aspects of social and political behavior that have not previously been assessed using quantitative survey data in Lebanon. One module focuses on financial assistance shared within extended family networks, while the other assesses membership and support for organizations that participated in the Lebanese civil war. Given the sensitivity of both topics, the survey was developed following extensive consultation with Lebanese partners and pilot testing.  The sampling strategy I developed for the survey also promises to generate new insights into governance and political behavior in a relatively data-poor context. The survey combines a nationally-representative respondent pool with extreme oversampling of two key city-level field sites (N=approximately 2,200 total). Analysis produced from the survey will thus allow for national-level characterizations while investigating inter- and intra-city variation previously overlooked using standard sampling techniques.     Research findings and future plans  I intend for the data collected from the survey to inform several new research publications. I will illustrate the relationship between political behavior at the local and national levels. Though my dissertation project establishes the existence of linkages between electoral partisanship in the municipal and Parliamentary spheres, the exact nature of these ties is difficult to ascertain without individual-level survey data that deliberately assesses both. The data I collect have generated generate novel insights into center-periphery relations in Lebanon by showing that partisan identity is critically informed by both local and national dynamics.
