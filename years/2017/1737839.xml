<AbstractNarration>In the past decade, graph theory has undertaken a remarkable shift --- a profound transformation. Graph theory is no longer limited to a few vertices and edges (as in the famous riddle of "The Seven Bridges of Konigsberg"). Today, graph theory is often about understanding our ever-more connected world, which may contain millions and billions of nodes. Such a change is in large part due to the humongous amount of information present in today's society. For example, successful Web search algorithms are based on WWW graphs, which contain all web pages as vertices and hyperlinks as edges. In other cases, such as social networks, the sheer number of users contribute to the huge size of the graphs representing a particular social medium. In response to challenges set forth in the ATD announcement, this work seeks to develop a framework using advanced tools from random and spectral graph theory to carry out quantitative analyses of the structure and dynamics of large graphs or networks.  Here, the focus is on finding patterns that may be hidden in them that could potentially be indicative of emerging threats of various kinds (internets, critical infrastructure networks, financial networks, social networks, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research plans to use tools from random graph theory, differential geometry, and information theory to carry out analytic computations of observable network structures and capture the most relevant and refined quantities of real-world networks. The approach is based on the Szemeredi regularity lemma, which provides regular partitions of a given graph.  If these can be found efficiently, then rapid (and often parallel- and distributed- among partitions) methods to compute a myriad of graph properties of interest, including graph merging and subgraph detection, will be achieved. Unfortunately, the regularity Lemma is only an existence proof; however, it is here, using ideas from spectral graph theory, where computationally efficient and scalable methods to approximate these partitions will be developed.  Moreover, to further achieve efficiency, a new model will be developed (based on a stochastic block model) representing information on graphs. The motivation behind this approach is two-fold. First, the most meaningful types of graph operations (graph merging, etc.) tend to preserve such partitions. Second, these blocks (or communities) can further reduce the complexity of finding a particular subgraph (often indicative of emerging threats) in a given graph.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Spectral properties of networks (or graphs that represent them) are of fundamental  importance and would be of great help  in anomaly detection.  Most computation we do with networks (or matrices that represent them) use linear algebraic tools. Furthermore, the existence of  groups formed unnaturally may change the regular spectral pattern of the network, causing strange signals in the spectrum.        Researchers have been investigating spectral properties of real-life networks for many years, and, based on numerical data,      have raised a number of questions about the distribution of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.         Subgraphs (clusters) are also important objects in social networks.  A group of people with more frequent interaction forms a denser graph than a group of random people. Abnormal subgraphs in real life graphs may reveal abnormal or even subspicuous  activites. Thus, the detection of such subgraphs may play an important role in threat discovery.      Mathematically, there is a deep and interesting link between subgraphs of a large graph with its eigenvalues. However, for most real life graphs, we do not understand the distribution of these eigenvalues (spectral distribution).  This understanding is one of the main goal of this project.      About 20 years ago, it  has been observed (by Barabasi and many others), that many real life graphs are scale-free. The best mathematical model for scale-free graph is the so-called preferential attachment model, proposed by Barabasi et al., Bollobas et al., and many other groups of researchers. The precise description of the spectral distribution of this graph was not known. As a key achievment to the project, the  PI solved this problem, by computing all fixed moments of the distribution in question.   Another imporant achievment is a theoretical, rigorious proof for a wel known observation (made by various groups of researchers) that the leading eigenvectors of the preferential attachment graphs are strongly localized.
