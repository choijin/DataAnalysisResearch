<AbstractNarration>Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are a near future reality and the implications of AVs on city development and urban form, while potentially widespread and dramatic, are not well understood.  Projected changes to the ease and cost of transportation, the role and future of transit, parking use, and right-of-way needs will have dramatic secondary effects on street design, development densities, land use, and urban sprawl.  These changes will have profound implications on our nation. While there has been a deluge of research on technological aspects of AVs, there has been a dearth of systematic exploration of their secondary effects on city development, form, and design or potential opportunities and unintended consequences on quality of life, including significant equity and labor market impacts.  The disruption to urban development and related economic, social, and environmental issues caused by the introduction of AVs has the potential to be on par with the disruptions caused by the introduction of automobiles a century ago.  This Urbanism Next Planning Grant will leverage a multidisciplinary collection of national experts in the academic, public, and private sectors to define and understand how the rise of AVs will broadly impact cities beyond just technological needs or primary transportation implications. This Planning Grant will bring together collaborators from engineering, urban design, urban planning, economics, real estate, labor economics, and architecture to promote our understanding of impacts of AVs on society and advance the national health, prosperity and well-being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the course of the grant, the research team will engage a broad national community of scholars from a range of disciplines, as well as a diverse, multi-sector group of practitioners in the Portland, Oregon region.  Planning activities include monthly web-based meetings; creation of a targeted blog and web-based clearinghouse; and a two-day workshop with collaborators and stakeholders from across the country. The goal is to understand, conduct research, and then plan for: 1) the immediacy of the technology; 2) the scale of impact from these technological innovations; 3) identification of how a diverse range of issues are connected and impacted; and 4) to delineate the important policy and research questions we need to be asking related to city design and municipal administration to maximize the benefits of this new technology while minimizing the negative externalities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Early indicators suggest the deployment of autonomous vehicle technology and the rise of new mobility services will have a cascading set of impacts on cities, well beyond transportation.  While there is ample research underway on these technologies and the services themselves, much more research is needed on the impacts these technological advances will have on things such as land use, neighborhood design, and land values, and the related quality of life implications. The goal of this Planning Grant was to develop a framework for understanding these cascading impacts and to develop a set of research questions that can be used to guide investigations into the future.   Starting with an extensive literature review, the project team developed and refined a framework that documented the current state of knowledge and organized the various impacts of these technologies and models into broad categories of Land Use, Urban Design, Transportation and Real Estate, and related these to implications for Equity, Health, Environment, Economy and Governance.  An image of the framework is attached.   The project team organized a series of meetings between more than thirty public, private and academic sector experts to review and develop the thinking represented in the framework.  This included working groups focused on Land Use, Urban Design, Transportation (Vehicles and Parking), Transportation (Transit, Bicycling and Walking) and Real Estate.  Through online meetings, the working groups each developed outlines on the various topics reflected under their category in the framework.  These focused on the drivers of change, potential impacts, current state of knowledge, and topic interactions.  All of the working groups convened for a two-day, in-person workshop in Portland, Oregon in July of 2019 where the groups refined the outlines, evaluated cross-working group interactions, further developed how these categories might impact community goals, and developed relevant research agendas.   This work led to a refinement of the overall framework and each of the outlines was developed into a report summarizing the literature, outlining each topic, and articulating key research questions.  The background research, topic areas, and research questions are being articulated into an online tool called the NEXUS which will provide information for various audiences.  The framework and the thinking developed through this project has been presented at various academic- and professionally-focused conferences in the US and in Europe and has led to presentations on Capitol Hill and to DG Move Directorate of the European Commission.  This work has also shaped research projects with various cities throughout the US and Canada on the impacts of emerging technologies.
