<AbstractNarration>Currently radio spectrum is partitioned into fixed bands that are available only to licensed users.  The low utilization of these bands, coupled with exponentially increasing demand, has led to the problem of spectrum scarcity for wireless access.  Work on this award is expected to yield paradigm-shifting innovations that will achieve significantly higher spectrum utilization by facilitating dynamic sharing of spectrum among different wireless networks and users. The research will inform public policy on spectrum allocation, lead to better quality of service and faster Internet access for wireless users, and enable new multimedia applications.  Students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, will acquire hands-on experience with cutting edge wireless technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work on this award has two unique research directions that are expected to have significant impact. First, a systems and optimal control approach to collaborative spectrum sharing will be developed. This approach relies on cooperative decision making among all components of the solution (e.g., spectrum sensing, communication, reasoning, and control); all decisions made within the system are mindful of the overall system objective. In order to achieve broadly cooperative decision making, new ideas from event-triggered and self-triggered control will be used. Rather than periodically updating control signals, these control frameworks introduce decision making when signals should be updated and when new information should be obtained, respectively. Second, the use of trust establishment schemes will be investigated, with the explicit goal of incentivizing collaboration among networks. As part of this research task, a trust, or reputation, metric will developed, along with tunable algorithms that maximize the balanced score between internal network performance and global network performance.  The proposed research on spectrally efficient communications and radio environment understanding will also be critically important for enabling collaboration in the spectrum domain.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project was inspired by the DARPA Spectrum Collaboration Challenge, which sought to advance the implementation of dynamic spectrum sharing technologies on state-of-the-art software-programmable radios.  The traditional approach of dividing spectrum into frequency bands licensed to government and commercial entities has resulted in a significant amount of wasted spectrum.  Cognitive radio is an emerging technology that has the potential to reclaim unused spectrum without causing harm to legacy devices, which allows spectrum to be accessed and shared dynamically according to actual spectrum usage patterns. In this research project, methodologies were developed that enable cognitive radios to efficiently and accurately detect and predict the presence of unused spectrum existing in time, frequency, and space.  The basic approach involves identifying primary user channels within the spectrum band and monitoring these channels to determine the best spectrum access opportunities for the secondary, unlicensed users.  An important feature of the approach is the application of a method to efficiently identify the best spectrum access opportunities among a number of channels.  In our approach, the cognitive radio budgets time among the set of primary user channels to learn their characteristics.  A related aspect of this research involves the application of novel techniques for processing radio signals to improve the fidelity of spectrum sensing, particularly for weak signals in the presence of noise. Another outcome of the project is a framework for dynamically allocating the unused spectrum ?harvested? via spectrum sensing to allow cognitive radios to communicate cooperatively as a network.  The proposed spectrum sensing methodologies and spectrum allocation schemes were validated through computer simulations, as well as implementations on software radio platforms.  The results of this research will contribute to alleviating the growing issue of spectrum scarcity and help to promote more dynamic, fair, and efficient use of the radio spectrum. As part of the educational component of the project a new graduate-level course on software-defined radio was developed, which includes a laboratory component to provide hands-on experience in programming software radios.  Software-defined radios have been steadily gaining traction in the telecommunications industry in recent years.   In contrast to legacy wireless devices, software radios can be easily modified through software programming, making them attractive for rapid prototyping and technology transfer.  A drawback of software radios is slower processing speeds, but this can be offset by offloading some of the computationally intensive processing to a hardware-programmable part of the software radio platform known as a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and a fast processing unit called a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).  Undergraduate and graduate students were involved in enhancing the performance of software radios by programming the FPGA and GPU on a software radio platform.   Software-defined radio platforms were found to be a very useful educational tool to teach wireless systems concepts to a new generation of communications engineers.
