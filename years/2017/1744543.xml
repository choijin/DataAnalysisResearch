<AbstractNarration>This project, an NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilot, managed by the University of Nevada, Reno, addresses the grand challenge of increasing underrepresentation regionally in the advanced manufacturing sector.  Using the state's Learn and Earn Program Advanced Career Pathway (LEAP) as the foundation, science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) activities will support and prepare Hispanic students for the region's workforce in advanced manufacturing which includes partnerships with Truckee Meadows Community College (TMCC), the state's Governor's Office of Economic Development, Charles River Laboratories, Nevada Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (Nevada EPSCoR) and the K-12 community.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected outcomes from the project will inform the feasibility, expandability and transferability of the LEAP framework in diversifying the state's workforce locally and the STEM workforce nationally.  Formative and summative evaluation will be conducted with a well-matched comparison group.  Dissemination of project results will be disseminated through the Association for Public Land-Grant Universities (APLU), STEM conferences and scholarly journals.</AbstractNarration>

The major goal of this project was to identify societal, academic, and workplace barriers to the participation of members from underrepresented minority communities (URM) in the LEAP framework. Below we list the specific aims we pursed to achieve this goal and the subsequent outcomes that resulted: &nbsp;</p> <p>Objective&nbsp;1:&nbsp;Develop&nbsp;and&nbsp;assess&nbsp;the&nbsp;academic&nbsp;and&nbsp;career&nbsp;support&nbsp;systems&nbsp;for Hispanic/Latino&nbsp;participants&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;LEAP&nbsp;workforce&nbsp;development&nbsp;pipeline.</p> <p>Outcomes: Regarding academic supports, we were reassured that existing academic support systems (i.e. academic advising, tutoring, counseling, financial aid) at the community college and university were sufficient to address LEAP student needs. &nbsp;However, we also found that it was important that additional support was available through our program coordinator to provide &ldquo;identity group&rdquo; support. Many of the students needed a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; person with who to discuss personal and family issues. We found that while the LEAP students knew about institutional student support systems, they were often reluctant to utilize them. In which case, the program coordinator would need to &nbsp;intervene. Regarding workplace support, students did not express many concerns and found individuals in the workplace who served as mentors. One concern that emerged from this experience was that corporate and academic policies regarding student and human resources privacy and confidentiality, sometimes made timely communications and interventions difficult.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Objective&nbsp;2:&nbsp;Conduct&nbsp;STEM&nbsp;employee&nbsp;surveys&nbsp;to&nbsp;gain&nbsp;an&nbsp;understanding&nbsp;of the&nbsp;perceived&nbsp;and&nbsp;real&nbsp;barriers&nbsp;to&nbsp;Hispanic&nbsp;/Latino&nbsp;entry,&nbsp;retention&nbsp;and&nbsp;career advancement&nbsp;in&nbsp;regional&nbsp;STEM&nbsp;companies.</p> <p>Outcomes: Our research also showed that URM individuals employed in STEM industries felt that advanced educational opportunities were important to their career advancement. All felt that the availability of company supported tuition reimbursement benefits, were major incentivizers to pursuing continued education. These individuals also identified inflexible work schedules and family obligations as the major barriers to advanced degree attainment. These URM STEM workers strongly voiced the need for increased availability of online or alternatively scheduled college courses, including required laboratory courses. They also felt that childcare resources and access to remote or onsite academic supports (i.e. tutoring or advising) would facilitate their ability to pursue educational opportunities.</p> <p>Objective&nbsp;3:&nbsp;Expand&nbsp;the&nbsp;number&nbsp;of&nbsp;STEM&nbsp;company&nbsp;adopters&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;LEAP&nbsp;Life&nbsp;Sciences framework.</p> <p>Outcomes: With our governmental partners, the Nevada Governor&rsquo;s Office for Economic Development (GOED), we held several focus group meetings with STEM companies to gauge their enthusiasm for the LEAP framework. From these meetings, we found that all saw the value of LEAP and at least two companies were willing to participate in our program. We were also able to obtain additional funding for the program through a &ldquo;New Skills for Youth&rdquo; grant awarded to the Nevada Department of Education.

Parents voiced a desire to engage with schools and colleges regarding STEM careers earlier in their children&rsquo;s K12 education. Our outreach with the URM high school students, revealed that their enthusiasm towards STEM and STEM careers was damped in part due to their unfamiliarity with opportunities in STEM and the lack of parental/peer encouragement. Unfortunately, even though the high school students&rsquo; affinity to STEM increased after being informed about opportunities in the field, most felt that it was too late for them to pursue post-secondary STEM programs.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Learn and Earn Advanced Career Pathway (LEAP) was designed to provide individuals access to opportunities for continuous academic and career advancement in science, technology, engineering and mathematic (STEM) related workplaces. The major goal of this project was to identify societal, academic, and workplace barriers to the participation of members from underrepresented minority communities (URM) in the LEAP framework. Below we list the specific aims we pursed to achieve this goal and the subsequent outcomes that resulted:    Objective 1: Develop and assess the academic and career support systems for Hispanic/Latino participants in the LEAP workforce development pipeline.  Outcomes: Regarding academic supports, we were reassured that existing academic support systems (i.e. academic advising, tutoring, counseling, financial aid) at the community college and university were sufficient to address LEAP student needs.  However, we also found that it was important that additional support was available through our program coordinator to provide "identity group" support. Many of the students needed a "safe" person with who to discuss personal and family issues. We found that while the LEAP students knew about institutional student support systems, they were often reluctant to utilize them. In which case, the program coordinator would need to  intervene. Regarding workplace support, students did not express many concerns and found individuals in the workplace who served as mentors. One concern that emerged from this experience was that corporate and academic policies regarding student and human resources privacy and confidentiality, sometimes made timely communications and interventions difficult.     Objective 2: Conduct STEM employee surveys to gain an understanding of the perceived and real barriers to Hispanic /Latino entry, retention and career advancement in regional STEM companies.  Outcomes: Our research also showed that URM individuals employed in STEM industries felt that advanced educational opportunities were important to their career advancement. All felt that the availability of company supported tuition reimbursement benefits, were major incentivizers to pursuing continued education. These individuals also identified inflexible work schedules and family obligations as the major barriers to advanced degree attainment. These URM STEM workers strongly voiced the need for increased availability of online or alternatively scheduled college courses, including required laboratory courses. They also felt that childcare resources and access to remote or onsite academic supports (i.e. tutoring or advising) would facilitate their ability to pursue educational opportunities.  Objective 3: Expand the number of STEM company adopters of the LEAP Life Sciences framework.  Outcomes: With our governmental partners, the Nevada Governor’s Office for Economic Development (GOED), we held several focus group meetings with STEM companies to gauge their enthusiasm for the LEAP framework. From these meetings, we found that all saw the value of LEAP and at least two companies were willing to participate in our program. We were also able to obtain additional funding for the program through a "New Skills for Youth" grant awarded to the Nevada Department of Education. These funds were used to expand our ability to provide student tuition support, develop marketing materials (two-videos and a website) and provide needed salary support for the program coordinator.     Objective 4: Assess the enthusiasm of the Hispanic/Latino communities for opportunities made available through the LEAP Life Sciences framework.  Outcomes: We found that many parents from URM communities lacked an understanding of local STEM career opportunities and how to help their children access these opportunities. These parents felt that cultural and language differences were major barriers to meaningful communication and engagement with school and college officials. Parents voiced a desire to engage with schools and colleges regarding STEM careers earlier in their children’s K12 education.
