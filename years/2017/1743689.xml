<AbstractNarration>This proposal supports student travel to attend the 2017 Formal Methods in Computer Aided Design (FMCAD) to be held in Vienna, Austria in October 2017. FMCAD 2017 is one of the leading conferences on theory and applications of formal methods in hardware and system verification. It provides a forum to researchers in academia and industry for presenting ground-breaking methods, technologies, theoretical results, and tools for reasoning formally about computing systems. This travel grant will enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate students. Attending conferences is an important component of graduate school education for our society's future computer security researchers. Students have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class computer security researchers, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The FMCAD 2017 Student Forum provides a platform for graduate studentsat any career stage to introduce their research to the wider FormalMethods community, solicit feedback, and network.  The student forum ispart of the FMCAD 2017, the seventeenth in a series of conferences onthe theory and applications of formal methods in hardware and systemverification.  FMCAD stands out due to its interaction between industryand academia.  The conference covers formal aspects of computer-aidedsystem design including verification, specification, synthesis, andtesting.   The Student Forum call for contributions was published in severalinternational emailing lists, including dmanet, Concurrency, NWPT, andFMCADs own emailing lists, hoping to reach a large number of alsosmall institutions covered by these mailing lists.  We also separatelyapproached USA and Canada based FMCAD PC members directly to solicitmore submissions, hoping to especially receive submissions fromunderrepresented groups, such as female students.  We received onesubmission from USA with female student as the main author,unfortunately she was not able to attend the conference due topotential Visa issues in returning to USA, so the talk was given byanother PhD student of the group.  On the European funding side, weoffered funding to two female PhD students, out of which one couldattend and presented her work excellently.  The focus on improvingfemale attendance has been high on the agenda of the Student Forumorganization.  The FMCAD 2017 Student Forum comprised the following major activities:   Students were asked to submit short reports describing their researchideas  or ongoing work, and submissions were selected based on theabstracts  received.   The students were invited to attend the conference and present theirwork.    Participants with accepted short reports got the opportunity togive a 4-minute talk on their work.   All participants also presented aposter illustrating their work during the  conference poster sessions.  A "best contribution" was chosen (based on the quality of the talk andthe submitted report) by the committee chair, and the recipient wasawarded a trophy and a certificate at the conference banquet (whichall students were invited to attend)  The FMCAD 2017 Student Forum was organized to educate the nextgeneration of verification engineers and formal methodsspecialists. Formal methods ensure the correct operation of integratedcircuits and electronics, which are widely used in safety-critical aswell as every-day applications.  The Student Forum ignited the transfer and dissemination of knowledgeat an early stage, leading to more significant research results andbetter educated specialists, eventually resulting in superiortechnology.
