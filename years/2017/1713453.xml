<AbstractNarration>This research is focused on evaluating the Dweck Mindset Instrument. Mindset involves how one views the idea of intelligence, namely whether one views intelligence as something that can grow or if one views intelligence as something more unchanging. Mindset has been linked to academic achievement and while much of the research involving mindset and achievement is very promising the most popular measurement tool for mindset, the Dweck Mindset Instrument, is lacking in some areas in showing that it is a valid and reliable instrument to use. One area in particular is if this measurement can work across cultures. This project will work on collecting and evaluating data from the Dweck Mindset Instrument and related constructs in both American and Japanese students in order to better evaluate if this measure is valid. The researcher will be working with Dr. Ayumi Tanaka who has been studying mindset theories at Doshisha University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One specific psychometric evaluation will determine if the scale has measurement invariance, which gives support to it measuring the same construct in both cultures. If the scale is not measurement invariant it cannot be used to compared scores across cultures. Additionally many researchers using this scale have been modifying the scale, using only one subscale, and even scoring the measure differently. This project will determine if these different ways to interpret the scale will have a sizeable impact on the results of the statistical tests used. Since some researchers have been modifying the Dweck Mindset Instrument to focus on certain attitudes, this project will evaluate if that modifications can be valid using a mathematically focused mindset scale. Additionally, a focus on mathematical issues is of interest due to both a mediocre math performance in United States students as compared to other countries and an increase in need for STEM educated citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).</AbstractNarration>
