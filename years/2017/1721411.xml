<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase-I project employs the development of intelligent and sustainable coating technology to present a game changing option to the corrosion protection coating industry. The annual global cost of corrosion is estimated to be US$2.5 trillion while USA alone has to lose more than $1 trillion. The global anticorrosion coating market has been valued for more than US$14 billion in 2015 and is expected to reach beyond US$26 billion in 2022. Apart from inferior performance, currently available corrosion prevention coatings pose significant threat to the environment and human health. It is very hard for the poor and developing countries to bear the related costs. Development of this multifunctional coating will afford them a safer alternative for protecting their assets. In preliminary experiments, this coating innovation has shown significant potential in preventing corrosion and biofouling activity on the treated surface. The thermal analysis and nanomechanical analysis have indicated that these coatings have exceptionally high thermal and mechanical stability approaching that of ceramic materials. Based on the preliminary data, it is safe to state that these coatings present a breakthrough in the area of surface protection through barrier coatings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project includes the development of user friendly multifunctional coating for wide variety of substrates. Historically, chromate conversion coatings (CCC) have been extensively used in preventing metals from corroding. However, there are serious concerns over the use of CCC as it poses human health risks. Carcinogenic hexavalent chromium ions used in coating technology for the corrosion protection of metals are being phased out by Environmental Protection Agency in USA and Registration Evaluation Authorization and Restrictions of Chemicals regulation in Europe. The key innovation of this project is the development of a liquid precursor to a transparent strong ceramic-like coating that can protect substrates from harsh environmental conditions. This ready to use thin coating, suitable for application in the automobile and aerospace industries, adheres strongly to most substrates, adds minimal weight and can be transparent or pigmented. Besides corrosion protection, the coating can also provide scratch resistance, oleophobicity, and possibly anti-microbial properties to numerous surfaces.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This NSF SBIR Phase-I project titled "<em>Transparent Flexible Quasi-Ceramic Intelligent Multifunctional Coatings for Corrosion and Biofouling Protection</em>" demonstrated the development of new environmental friendly high-performance coating technology called Floryl Intelligent Coatings (FLIC). The invented product is a transparent single component, ready to use coating. Coating can be applied on wide variety of surfaces such as metals, plastics, rubbers, ceramics, concrete, wood, textiles etc. Coating can be applied without specialized equipment or a rigorous application training either by dipping, spraying, rolling, brushing or even through wiping with a cloth wet with coating. This coating contains volatile organic component (VOC) exempted solvents and free of toxic chemical ingredients. The coating hardens rapidly in an ambient condition without using any external heating equipment. Coating deemed to find several applications in aerospace, automotive, marine, home appliances, healthcare etc.</p> <p>The two compositions of this FLIC were developed and tested to meet the industry standards. The composition FLIC-1 was designed to accept the adherence of commercial topcoats (like paints) while composition FLIC-2 was designed in a manner so that foreign entities could not adhere to the surface. As this project was focused on the corrosion and biofouling protection through this coating, the two compositions were therefore tested to meet the requirements of anticorrosion coating industry.</p> <p>It was demonstrated that both FLIC-1 and FLIC-2 can easily pass the corrosion protection requirement as a standalone coating. The FLIC-1 can be top-coated with commercial paints and can meet the corrosion performance standard requirement. The corrosion testing as per American Standards Test Method (ASTM B117 needed for aerospace sector), Cyclic Corrosion Test standards (as per GM 9540P needed for automotive sector), outdoor exposure in natural corrosive environment proved that corrosion protection through FLIC meets and exceeds the requirement of the coating industry. The FLIC-2 showed good biofouling characteristics in the tested time- period. Both, FLIC-1 and FLIC-2 showed significantly high thermal stability and mechanical stability compared to the existing commercial products.</p> <p>The FLIC-1 can be used as undercoat, standalone or top-coat product while FLIC-2 can be used as standalone or top-coat product. Both FLIC-1 and FLIC-2 can impart scratch protection to the coated surfaces thereby enhancing the service life span of the materiel.</p> <p>The estimated annual global loss due to corrosion is US$2.5 trillion which is equivalent to 3.4% of global GDP while USA alone has to infuse more than $1 trillion annually which is 6% of gross domestic product. Such economic losses are hard for poor and developing countries. The direct beneficiaries of our coating technology are those who would like to protect their asset from environmental damages.
