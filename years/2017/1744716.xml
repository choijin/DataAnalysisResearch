<AbstractNarration>The 2017 Midwest Conference on Representation Theory will be held October 20- 22, 2017, on the campus of Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN. The conference will gather established experts, recent Ph.D.s, and graduate students for the purpose of discussing and disseminating new results in the broad area of Representation Theory, a fundamental mathematical subject with applications to many other areas within mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nine speakers have been invited to this year's conference, including several early-career researchers. The conference will also feature talks by established researchers whose specialties include automorphic forms, and representation theory.
