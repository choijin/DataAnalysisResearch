<AbstractNarration>This research will experimentally manipulate gene expression to understand how elongate fishes, such as pipefish, get their shape. Fishes, like other vertebrates, share a conserved set of genes that regulate development. Yet from this conserved set, fishes come in an amazing diversity of shapes. Pipefish are part of a group of nearly 300 species that also includes seahorses, pipehorses, and seadragons, that have remarkably diverse traits such as long snouts, tube-like bodies, and males that become pregnant. These fishes provide a unique opportunity to study trait evolution because of the breadth of characters absent in other fish lineages and the existence of powerful experimental tools based on the pipefish genomic. This project will involve the research training of an undergraduate from groups underrepresented in science. It will also contribute to public outreach in collaboration with The Museum of Natural and Cultural History at the University of Oregon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will connect observed genetic and genomic changes with the morphological changes to the body plan in the Gulf pipefish (Syngnathus scovelli). This research focuses on a small subset of Hox transcription factors and their surrounding genomic content that are important in early cranial and axial skeleton development. Based on analysis of the Gulf pipefish genome, a few key Hox genes and nearby regulatory elements have been lost through the course of evolution in the Gulf pipefish lineage. Using advanced genomic and gene editing techniques, the researchers will perform functional tests in related teleost fish, the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio), to examine the morphological impact of the loss of genes and genomic content on the fish body plan. Possible effects of these losses on the evolution of the syngnathid body plan will be determined by creating mutations in these orthologous genes using the CRISPR technique in zebrafish and threespine stickleback fish models. This work will advance our understanding of how novel characters evolve in the context of the deeply conserved developmental toolkit.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>An amazing diversity of body sizes and shape have evolved across multicellular organisms, but biologists are still largely unclear as to how highly novel traits such as these arise at the genetic level.

Despite this diversity in body size and shape, research dating to just the 1980&rsquo;s has now clearly shown that all vertebrates share a common core of genes and genetic pathways important for developmental processes that occur throughout development from egg to adult. A fundamental gap in our knowledge is how such diverse phenotypes&mdash;and particularly highly derived novelties&mdash;evolve using this conserved genetic toolkit. This project supported dissertation research examining the functional basis of some genetic changes behind a set of derived vertebrate morphological characters present in syngnathid fish &ndash; members of a family comprising seahorses, seadragons and pipefish. Syngnathid fish provide a unique opportunity to study the evolution of novelties because they provide both a breadth of characters that are either absent of highly derived as compared to all other teleost lineages. In addition, this family of fish has newly developed genomic tools such as whole genome sequences. A key goal of this project was to add a critical new approach, the functional testing of observed genetic changes through the use of gene editing technologies. Specifically, this project identified changes in the coding and noncoding regions in candidate genetic pathways of&nbsp;<em>Hox</em>&nbsp;genes and connected these observed genetic and genomic changes with the phenotypic changes to the body plan axis in the Gulf pipefish using functional genomic tests in related teleost of species of threespine stickleback. These goals were achieved by using CRISPR genome editing to recreate a small subset of&nbsp;<em>Hox&nbsp;</em>gene and&nbsp;<em>Hox&nbsp;</em>cluster content changes that were observed as lost through the course of evolution in the Gulf pipefish. Specifically, mutants were created in stickleback using CRISPR in both&nbsp;<em>eve1</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>hox7</em>, and analyses of changes in body shape and structure due to these mutations were performed. More detailed phenotypic analyses are continuing, and these mutants will provide an invaluable resource for subsequent studies for many years. In addition, gene expression studies of&nbsp;<em>hoxa2b&nbsp;</em>connected it to changes in head and jaw formation of syngnathids, and possibly changes in behavior. In addition to the scientific contributions of this project, the research experiences helped advance the careers of one Ph.D. student and one undergraduate student.

Many syngnathid species are listed in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This research contributed to the general understanding the family Syngnathidae and the annotation and the continued refinement of the Gulf pipefish genome that will be useful for conservation genetic projects.
