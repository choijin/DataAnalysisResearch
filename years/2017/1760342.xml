<AbstractNarration>This award will support US based participants and speakers at Tropical Geometry and Moduli Spaces, a satellite conference of the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM), to be held August 13-17 in Cabo Frio, Brazil.  This event will leverage the assembly of a vast number of mathematicians at the ICM in Rio de Janeiro as an opportunity to bring together a global community of leading experts and early career researchers in an especially active and rapidly developing field. This conference will be the largest ever in tropical geometry with over 80 participants anticipated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific focus of the conference will be broadly centered on connections to moduli spaces, including interactions logarithmic structures, Berkovich spaces, and enumerative geometry.  In just the past few years, there have been a number of significant advances in building explicit links among these different geometric theories, especially for curves and abelian varieties, using skeletons of nonarchimedean analytic spaces as a shared common tool. These links explain many older correspondence theorems, from the beginnings of tropical enumerative geometry, and are being used to establish new correspondences and to prove new enumerative results of classical flavor, e.g. for counting curves with fixed invariants, and to prove degeneration formulas for logarithmic Gromov-Witten invariants as part of a broader program linking tropical geometry to mirror symmetry. At the same time, new algebraic foundations are emerging for scheme-theoretic tropical geometry, built out of idempotent semirings, which will also be featured at the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

This timely conference leveraged the presenve of a broad international community of researchers at the ICM in Brazil to gather leading experts and young researchers in this rapidly developing research field, building on techniques from tropical and nonarchimedean geometry, with important applications to algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.  Research talks included presentations on recent breakthroughs related to algebraic geometry, such as Pacini's presentation on tropical geometry and Esteves' compactifications of universal Jacobians and Shaw's talk on bounding Betti numbers of patchworked hypersurfaces using tropical Hodge numbers.  Other research talks highlighted developments closer to combinatorics, such as Rinc&oacute;n's work on CSM classes of matroids, and pure tropical geometry, such as the talks of Giansiracusa and Maclagan on tropical scheme theory.  In addition to these high-level research talks, the conference provided important opportunities for graduate students and postdocs, including mini-courses by Abramovich and Cavalieri, both of whom are known for their expository skill as well as their research experties, on logarithmic geometry and moduli, and Fock spaces in curve counting, respectively.  These mini-courses were a valuable opportunity for young mathematicians to get up-to-speed on important techniques that are central to current and future research in tropical geometry, especially as it relates to moduli spaces, curve counting, and applications to Gromov-Witten theory and its variants.  The lectures also prepared graduate students and postdocs to understand follow sophisticated research talks later in the week, such as G&ouml;ttsche's research lecture on tropical geometry and refined curve counting.  Young researchers were also invited to give mini-talks on the first afternoon, as a way of introducing themselves and their research interests to the broader community, fostering valuable interactions throughout the week.
