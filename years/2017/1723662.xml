<AbstractNarration>This is an NSF support for increasing the diversity of speakers and enhancing student participation at&lt;br/&gt;the 75th Device Research Conference (DRC). The DRC has a University setting (this year at the&lt;br/&gt;University of Notre Dame), and a strong tradition of involvement from researchers around the world. Yet,&lt;br/&gt;the DRC and the device research community as a whole stands to benefit from an increase in the invited&lt;br/&gt;speakers at the conference that are underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;The DRC, now celebrating its 75th anniversary year, is the preeminent forum for new and emerging&lt;br/&gt;device technologies. The DRC has a tradition of participation from researchers from throughout the&lt;br/&gt;world in addition to strong graduate student participation. To continue this trend, speakers are invited&lt;br/&gt;from various research fields and ethnic/cultural backgrounds in an effort to improve the diversity of&lt;br/&gt;conference. Further, DRC offers student travel support and as a particular highlight, the Best Student&lt;br/&gt;Paper and Poster Awards for attracting more student involvement. The funds will enable the organizers to &lt;br/&gt;offer travel support for invited speakers who are underrepresented minorities in the device&lt;br/&gt;research community. Additionally, will offer the opportunity to discount student registration to increase&lt;br/&gt;student participation. The technical program will provide student participants with the opportunity to&lt;br/&gt;gain exposure to new materials and devices, their basic physics, and their engineering applications.</AbstractNarration>
