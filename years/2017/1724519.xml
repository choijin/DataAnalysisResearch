<AbstractNarration>Nanocrystalline metals and alloys (polycrystals with grain sizes less than ~100 nm) offer a suite of appealing mechanical properties for structural applications, including high strength and hardness, enhanced fatigue resistance, and tribological robustness. These virtues derive from the large fraction of material that resides at the interfaces between neighboring crystals, known as grain boundaries. For these materials, this high fraction of interfacial volume can cause deleterious effects such as thermal instability and relatively poor damage tolerance.  Many present and future applications of nanocrystalline metals such as robust coatings, electrical interconnects, micro- and nano-electro-mechanical systems, and soft magnets subject these materials to extreme mechanical duress, which can activate microstructural transformation and alter the beneficial materials properties. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award supports research centered on the concept that control of grain boundary chemistry in nanocrystalline alloys can be used to tailor the thermal and mechanical stability of nanocrystalline materials against grain boundary migration in extreme service environments. Control over this behavior can allow for unprecedented control of damage tolerance, thus enabling a novel and inexpensive structural materials design strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research program, the investigators aim to control grain boundary chemistry in nanocrystalline alloys as a means to encode the onset of thermally- and mechanically-driven grain boundary migration under service conditions. In cases where extreme mechanical environments are encountered (e.g. at stress concentrations such as crack tips), stress-driven grain boundary migration can be triggered to respond to damage, endowing the material with damage tolerance. This dynamic material response is predicated on local stress triggers that drive microstructure transition and dissipate energy to mitigate catastrophic failure, allowing for both strength and toughness. The research will be accomplished via the following scientific and technical goals: (a) identify and characterize the mechanisms that lead to mechanically-induced grain boundary migration and grain growth, (b) identify and characterize the manner in which these mechanisms are influenced by grain boundary chemistry, (c) identify elements that will segregate to grain boundary and modulate thermal and stress-driven grain boundary migration, (d) synthesize nanocrystalline alloys with tailored grain boundary chemistry, and (e) perform material characterization and quantitative in situ mechanical testing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Key outcomes for the EAGER project are summarized below.   Nanoindentation measurements indicate that sub-ablation-threshold fs-laser treatments cause a significant decrease in hardness in nanocrystalline alloys. These hardness changes are dramatic (up to 80% reduction) in the nanocrystalline alloys (Al-4.8 at%O, Q- and SC-CuZr) with very fine grain size (&lt;50 nm), yet are negligible in the larger grain nanocrystalline sample (Al-0.8 at%O).  This strongly suggests that the laser deposits its energy preferentially at disordered grain boundary regions, while having minimal to no impact within the crystalline cores. Our results and analyses show that the induced softening can be ascribed to the fs-laser interaction with grain boundary regions, due to structural and chemical heterogeneities, and cannot be understood through traditional coarsening, porosity, or segregation effects. The magnitude of softening caused by the fs-laser is dependent upon the initial energetic state of the material ? samples with higher energy had a smaller magnitude softening prior to ablation, whereas samples near equilibrium had large tunability in hardness. The softening induced by the fs-laser is fully recoverable upon annealing at low temperatures, suggesting that atomic motion at grain boundary regions (operative at such low temperatures) is responsible for both the softening and relaxation. This study suggests that the similarities between nanocrystalline metals and amorphous alloys are vast, and that our understanding of mechanical behavior of nanocrystalline metals may be greatly informed by the metallic glass community. The application of processing strategies across disciplines, such as fs-laser processing, and material classes can be useful in broadening the tunability and functionality of nanocrystalline materials.
