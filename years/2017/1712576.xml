<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project encompasses the area of personalized medicine and forensics. It will have an impact on medicine by leading to new diagnostic applications. The technology being developed here facilitates accurate determination of the mitochondrial genome. Degeneration of mitochondrial function has been implicated in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and several other neurological disorders.  In forensics, the technology could allow for identification of individuals based on mitochondrial variants derived from hair samples. Pharmaceutical R&amp;D could use the technique to study the effects of their drugs to measure mitochondrial toxicity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project further develops a novel method that enzymatically purifies Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by depleting linear nuclear DNA, enabling inexpensive sequencing of mtDNA. A major benefit of this method is the ability to identify heteroplasmy, which is the existence of different mitochondrial genomes in the same individual. Every person has some level of heteroplasmy, and measuring this accurately is the key to identifying risk of diseases.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The I-corps award allowed us to explore the market for Mseek, our technology for purifying and sequencing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). We determined that there is a dearth of offerings to accurately determine heteroplasmy and the clinical space for diagnostics is underserved. In addition we determined that there is no service to interpret the data, even if it were to be generated today, since there does not exists a database of "normal" variants/heteroplasmy that could be used to rule out certain mtDNA variants as disease-causing. The interviews with potential customers enabled us to define the market to be served (clinical diagnostics) and the need for the service. We also identified collaborators with clinical samples that will form the foundation of our database. The interviews also allowed us to understand the failings of other offerings in the space and clearly defined for us the benefits of our technology. The result of the I-corps program was a decision to proceed with the commercialization of the Mseek technology. We are currently in the process of applying for SBIR phase I support and are also exploring various investment opportunities. In addition, we have started preliminary negotiations with commercial providers of clinical diagnostic services to offer our services to them either through referrals or as a fee for service model.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Ravi&nbsp;Sachidanandam</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
