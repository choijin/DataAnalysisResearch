<AbstractNarration>This proposal supports 12 students for their travel to attend the 16th Workshop on the Economics of Information Security (WEIS) held at the University of California San Diego, on June 26-27, 2017. WEIS is an annual event that serves as a leading forum for interdisciplinary scholarship on information security, combining expertise from the fields of computer science and electrical engineering, economics, social science, business, law, and policy. Student participation in WEIS is a critical part of the educational experiences of students with interdisciplinary interests related to security and privacy. WEIS provides them an opportunity to interact with senior researchers and to be exposed to leading work in the field. As such, it fits closely with the goals of NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which include socio-economic approaches to information security.</AbstractNarration>
