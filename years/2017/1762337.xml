<AbstractNarration>Kenneth Jordan of the University of Pittsburgh is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division to develop theoretical methods for describing the interaction of excess electrons with molecules and molecular clusters.  Processes involving electron capture and transfer are involved in photosynthesis, the operation of batteries, in radiation damage, and in the operation of some laser systems.  The research of the Jordan group is relevant to understanding how these processes occur at a molecular level.  Professor Jordan is actively engaged in organizing scientific workshops that bring together researchers from different disciplines as well as summer schools where students learn about state-of-the-art methods in computer simulation of molecular systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Jordan is developing methods for modeling non-valence correlation-bound and temporary anion states.  Both classes of anions are particularly challenging to describe theoretically.  These studies address how non-valence correlation-bound anions evolve into image potential states with increasing system size.  The research of the Jordan group also elucidates the role of charge-transfer polarizability in describing the net polarizability of molecules and molecular clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The fact that molecules can also possess non-valence anions is not mentioned in chemistry courses. Yet, non-valence anions are important in a wide range of chemical processes.  Over the past three years of NSF support we have made major progress in the elucidation of the properties of non-valence anions, in particular, those for which electron correlation effects are essential for the existence of the anion. We demonstrated the existence of metastable non-valence anions of non-polar molecular clusters.  These anions are metastable because they are unstable to electron loss. Much or our work on non-valence anions was carried out with computationally demanding methods that treat all electrons explicitly.  In parallel, we have developed models of non-valence anions in which only a single electron is treated explicitly, enabling the characterization of such anions for much larger molecules.  In addition to our work on non-valence anions, we also introduced an approach that provides insight into the lifetimes of valence temporary anions.  We have also made contributions to three widely used, open-source, computational chemistry software packages.  Two students working on these projected completed their PhDs and are now in postdoctoral positions at Argonne National Laboratory and Columbia University.
