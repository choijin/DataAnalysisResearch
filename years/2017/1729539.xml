<AbstractNarration>In the last 20 years, transitional justice measures have been adopted around the world to address the suffering of victims of human rights violations after civil conflict. Economic compensation is one within a range of options available under transitional justice to acknowledge the suffering of victims of massive violence. However, the implementation of compensation plans takes different forms at the national level. Across countries, we find that the compensation of suffering can involve different monetary values, justifications, and institutional practices, leaving open the question of how states arrive at specific monetary values for suffering caused by civil conflict? This dissertation project will answer this question by focusing on two contemporary examples of compensation schemes created to address suffering related to human rights violations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research plan involves textual analysis of newspaper reports, official documents, and legal documents. In addition, CO-PI will conduct 30 semi-structured interviews with experts, state officials, and victim advocates. By considering how states monetarily value suffering, this project speaks to current worldwide debates on peace and post-conflict negotiations, and the corresponding discourses on victim reparation and reconciliation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this project, I examined how countries determined reparation sums and policies for victims of human rights violations related with armed conflict. More specifically, I developed a comparative analysis of Colombia and Peru as two countries with histories of armed conflict and similar state capacity but where economic reparations followed different patterns. I also explored how the fact that Colombia adopted compensations during conflict affected the implementation of reparations in comparison with Peru, where economic reparations started after the cessation of violence. I interviewed those in charge of formulating and implementing reparation plans in each country and victims who were compensated. I complemented the interviews with extensive archival research of official documents and newspaper articles covering the debates leading to the adoption of economic compensation and its implementation.

I explain this paradox by focusing on the different ways in which these two societies relate to their histories of armed conflict and how they explain the suffering of victims. I highlight how economic reparations not only require a repentant state and visible victims, but also the political will of those in the legislature and the state to allocate fiscal and institutional resources. Political support from elected politicians and members of the government is tightly connected to public perceptions of civil conflict and memories around past violence. In Colombia, even while serious political divisions over the peace accords with the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) and the paramilitary persist, citizens and politicians engage in active debate over the armed conflict and its consequences. The past two presidential administrations held different positions towards victims and perpetrators, but both made the armed conflict a priority. Economic reparations became for the Colombian government a way to develop a relationship with victims and to foster an institutional expansion. When Peru adopted reparations in 2006, in contrast, the state was not fighting illegal armed groups, but was in a process of transition to peace and democracy. Rather than being a priority, the years of wartime violence are a shameful memory that the last three governments have tried to silence. So, for the Peruvian government addressing the issue of reparations means going back to a contentious past in a country which continues to debate who deserves to be called a victim or a terrorist.
