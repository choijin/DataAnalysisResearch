<AbstractNarration>Many important processes in nature and in engineering applications take place along surfaces. Examples include interaction of lipid and protein molecules in cell membranes or the action of a chemical dispersant on the oil-water interface, while helping to clean-up an oil spill. These and other processes are described mathematically with the help of differential equations posed on surfaces. Numerical methods for solving these equations provide tools for scientists to understand better surface phenomena by doing in silico experiments. The present project aims to develop such accurate and reliable numerical methods for the benefit of academic and engineering community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project develops new higher order unfitted finite element methods for partial differential equations (PDEs) posed on evolving   surfaces. The developed numerical approach uses time-independent background meshes. In a weak formulation of a PDE, the method employs traces of standard finite element spaces on reconstructed evolving physical domains.   The resulting methods will be optimally accurate, handle implicitly defined surfaces, allow a surface to undergo topological changes, and extend to surface-bulk coupled problems. The project goals will be met  by constructing a higher order space-time unfitted finite element method and performing a full convergence analysis, extending the method and analysis to coupled surface-bulk transport-diffusion problems, developing a new hybrid method for PDEs on evolving surfaces that uses finite difference approximations of time derivatives, extending the new approach to fluid equations posed on manifolds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Unfitted Finite Element Methods for Partial Differential Equations on Evolving Surfaces and Coupled Surface-Bulk Problems  The project focused on mathematical models involving partial differential equations posed on deforming surfaces. Understanding such models and their computational properties is important in an effort to describe and predict with the help of modern mathematical and computational tools many natural phenomena including transport of  surfactants along interfaces in multiphase fluids, diffusion-induced grain boundary motion, or lipid interactions in moving cell membranes. These phenomena are ubiquitous in  engineering and bioscience applications (such as spreading thin liquid films, coatings or cell motility and chemotaxis) as well as in human physiology (functioning of lungs alveoli).    The major progress has been obtained in the following directions of research:  1)     A computational method was developed and analyzed for the partial differential equation describing the transport and diffusion of an agent concentration along a deforming surface, which may represent a water&mdash;gas interphase. Numerical analysis of the model shows how accurate are predictions obtained by computing with the model.         2)    The computational methodology was extended to simulate the interaction of processes happening on the interface and in the ambient medium, the bulk. As an example, we studied mathematically and numerically the transport of a contaminant in a net of fractures and surround porous medium.   3)     Analysis and numerical methodology were also suggested for basic mathematical models describing lateral fluidity of surfaces. The example of materials exhibiting lateral fluidity  is plasma membranes, which can be mathematically represented  as surfaces.  Results of the project have been disseminated in 12 peer-reviewed papers and a large number of invited seminars, colloquia, lectures, and presentations at national and international conferences. Two graduate students substantially participated in the project and received training in scientific computing and applied mathematics.
