<AbstractNarration>The Internet's size and complexity make it difficult to understand what happens to network packets as they travel from source to destination. Internet service providers and governments sometimes interfere with users' online activities, further complicating this task. This project advances the scientific understanding of network interference detection by developing new methods to remotely measure the manipulation of Internet traffic, such as attempts to censor, tamper with, and monitor users' online activities. The newly proposed techniques can achieve an unprecedented level of detail about network manipulation around the world. Network interference and censorship harms U.S. economic interests, national security, and the human rights of citizens in censored countries. By working towards a better scientific understanding of the techniques used for detecting and monitoring such interference, this project can defend Internet users from unwarranted network manipulation. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Past research has used resources such as PlanetLab, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and end-user machines to measure network disruptions. These vantage points scale poorly and have limited geographical coverage. They are difficult to deploy in practice and are unable to continuously collect data. In contrast, systems such as Spooky, Augur, and Iris (developed in the principal investigator's preliminary work) allow measurement systems to infer whether a remote system has network connectivity to another remote system without needing control of either. To do this, these systems exploit features in existing Internet protocols and infrastructure to interact with remote systems, and learn from their responses whether or not they were able to interact with other targeted hosts. These techniques overcome the problems of vantage point location and of recruiting participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project advanced the scientific understanding of network disruption by developing new remote techniques to collect, detect, quantify, and interpret relevant data. We built and deployed multiple remote measurement systems, Quack and HyperQuack, that reliably detect application-layer disruptions, such as keyword- and URL-based blocking, over time and space. We applied these systems to provide deeper insight into the state of Internet censorship worldwide.    The efforts supported a wide range of research projects leading to the publication of  4 papers. These included:    Built Quack, a scalable, remote measurement system that can efficiently detect application-layer interference using Echo servers. We show that Quack can effectively detect application-layer blocking triggered on HTTP and TLS headers, and it is flexible enough to support many other diverse protocols.     Used Quack on a corpus of 100,000 keywords from vantage points in 40 countries to produce detailed national blocklists. We observed elevated rates of interference for specific domains in 7 countries. These experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of this technique for gaining a fine-grained view of application-level blocking policy across time, space, and content.   Built HyperQuack that is an upgrade to Quack where we use non-end-user-owned HTTP(S) web servers (in place of Echo servers) as vantage points and send genuine HTTP(S) requests with a variety of domain names exposed in the Host header or SNI extension.    Built FilterMap, a novel framework that can scalably monitor content filtering technologies worldwide.  FilterMap compiles data from Quack and Hyperquack (as well as OONI) data to gather blockpages from filter deployments. It then clusters the observed blockpages generating signatures for longitudinal tracking. In our recent study, FilterMap was able to identify censorship filter deployments associated with 90 vendors and actors and observe filtering in 103 countries. We detected the use of commercial filtering technologies for censorship in 36 out of 48 countries labeled as ‘Not Free’ or ‘Partly Free’ by the Freedom House '’Freedom on the Net’’ report. The unrestricted transfer of content filtering technologies have led to high availability, low cost, and highly effective filtering techniques becoming easier to deploy and harder to circumvent.     Performed an in-depth investigation of the mechanisms underlying decentralized information control in Russia. We showed that such large-scale censorship can be achieved in decentralized networks through inexpensive commodity equipment.
