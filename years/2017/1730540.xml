<AbstractNarration>Wireless communication has become ubiquitous over the last decade. This project's intent is to help create a new kind of scientific laboratory that will allow researchers to study a wide range of future wireless communications and networking problems. The laboratory is designed to let anyone with a new idea try it out quickly, see how well it works, and share it with others at an early stage, before moving on to much more expensive, complicated, and time-consuming later-stage experiments. Working with others across the wireless research and development communities, the project team aims to develop detailed plans for the laboratory, share those plans with potential users, collect feedback, and refine a larger community infrastructure proposal for building the laboratory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will take four key steps towards developing a full plan for the laboratory: (a) definition and specification of key hardware and software modules; (b) development of practices and processes to facilitate required FCC licensing; (c) identification and qualification of initial deployment sites; (d) community engagement and outreach activities. For each step, the team will produce relevant outputs, to include reports, design documents, information packets, and similar artifacts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The effort reported here was a planning activity for the proposers' vision of The Advanced National Wireless Ecosystem Testbed, a project with the driving goal to help society meet an extraordinary wireless communication challenge.  The same forces that make wireless communication technologies - WiFi, 5G, and new forms not yet invented - so valuable have  created an explosion in demand that we do not know how to meet. Today,  there are about 10 billion connected wireless devices in the world. In  20 years, informed estimates imagine at least 1,500 billion, with many  needing higher performance - faster, more reliable, longer battery life -  than is possible today.  We aimed to help the research community meet this challenge by creating a new kind of scientific laboratory that will let the nation's researchers study a wide range of tomorrow's wireless communications and networking problems today. The thing that sets our idea apart from others is that it's intended to be very big and very shared. Our original vision, and long-term goal, is to build a research laboratory spread through 200 or more of the nation's universities, and which would be available to every interested CS and EE research student in the country.  In this first planning effort towards that goal we developed a series of design requirements, design proposals, and plans needed to create six key parts of the laboratory. Four of these components are primarily technical, and two are primarily procedural.  A critical technical component of our vision for ANWET is the software-defined radio device that would allow researchers at every ANWET site to carry out experiments in wireless systems, with the help and support of their colleagues at other sites and in the industry.  Our planning work helped us understand, adapt, and bulid on recent dramatic advances in this area that make the ANWET vision possible for the first time.  "Software-defined" means that the radio device isn't just one type, like WiFi or BlueTooth. Instead, it can be almost anything - changing its shape to try new ideas and implement new technical functions that current radios simply cannot do. This flexibility is the key to ANWET's ability to support unique forward looking research.  The plan we developed for this component builds on three key observations:  Next-generation SDR radios offer dramatically greater capabilities than do current designs. This allows us to create new experimental platforms that can equally support important commercially focused "standards-oriented" research and radically different concepts of spectrum usage; Advances in high-level system definition tools experimenters with many different backgrounds, research interests, and skill sets access these capabilities with relative ease.  Bringing together the complementary perspectives of two technical communities - computer systems architects and radio engineers - can produce a radio system with the technical characteristics we need to realize our vision.   Beyond this key system element, we developed plans for three additional technical components of an ANWET system:  Fixed campus infrastructure provides site management and monitoring capabilities required to ensure that experiments are operating safely and consistently with FCC rules and local public safety requirements. A passive and active measurement subsystem integrated with the experimental radio devices and campus infrastructure to collect important experimental data. A unifying "back end" infrastructure provides experiment management, shared data curation, and discovery functions.   A further outcome of our work was planning for two key human functions needed to realize ANWET's goals. These are:  A specially trained licensing tiger team that works with campus CIOs, local safety officials and the FCC, to make it possible to qualify and license of individual campuses as experimental research zones; and A sharing platform and ecosystem for researchers to draw on, so that new ideas and results can be quickly shared and built on by others.   Taken together, the impact of the ANWET facility, if our vision is fully realized, will be to create a new nation-wide laboratory for next generation wireless research, that serves students, faculty, and industrial partners throughout the country. This laboratory, with its unique capabilities and distributed nature, offers the potential to foster extraordinary new innovation in wireless technologies, services, and products, at a time when wireless data communications is increasingly central to the national economy and all of modern life.
