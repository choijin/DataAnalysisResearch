<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students successfully completing high quality&lt;br/&gt;degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)disciplines. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experiences in support of groups&lt;br/&gt;historically under-represented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity provides support for postbaccalaureate&lt;br/&gt;studies in STEM programs leading to the STEM doctoral degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Connecticut (UConn) is the host site for the 2017-2019 Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) program for the Northeast Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (NELSAMP) under the leadership of this institution. This is the third post-baccalaureate program at the institution that supports a graduate student cohort of underrepresented minority (URM) STEM Ph.D. students from LSAMP campuses across the nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BD Activity provides extensive training in specific STEM disciplines as well as professional development and guidance that promote peer mentoring and leadership in the scientific community. Students receive rigorous academic and research training experiences that support completion of the Ph.D. and the transition to a competitive career in academia and industry. Over the duration of the project and beyond, the BD program at UConn serves to increase the number and quality of students from underrepresented groups completing STEM&lt;br/&gt;Ph.D. degrees and entering the STEM workforce. Formative and summative evaluation will occur with the summative evaluation including a comparison group to assess impact of the program interventions on student outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term impact of the BD activity is reflected in America's STEM workforce, both academia and in industrial research and development. By nurturing future STEM leaders, the value added is seen in the visibility of underrepresented minorities in&lt;br/&gt;science and engineering, increasing representation and providing role models and motivation for the next generation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcome Report for Award # 1702132  UCONN NSF Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity     The University of Connecticut (UConn), a senior representative of the Northeast Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (NELSAMP), was awarded $1,071,484 through the Bridge to the Doctorate Activity (BD Activity) to support 12 graduate students from African American, Hispanic and/or Native American populations during the first two years of their studies in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects at UConn.  The BD funding enables UConn to expand and concentrate the NELSAMP’s continuing efforts to increase the number of qualified students pursuing and completing advanced degrees in STEM areas.  The premise for BD funding is that the diversity of perspectives, backgrounds and experiences of the BD Fellows affords new avenues for resolving social, economic and technological challenges that currently limit the U.S.  This proactive, intensive, results-oriented campaign to recruit, prepare, mentor, train and support doctoral candidates from traditionally underrepresented populations in the STEM fields is specifically tailored to help foster major breakthroughs in meeting some of society’s challenges.     The suite of activities offered through the BD Activity include cohort meetings among BD Program participants, focused plans of study and detailed roadmaps of academic milestones, K-12 mentoring/outreach opportunities, career preparation, and professional development instruction in teaching, communication and research ethics.  The BD Activity also supports the development of a dedicated Husky STEM BD website containing informative material describing the BD Activity, FAQs, a schedule of planned activities, and short summaries of prospective BD research projects and faculty advisors.     BD Faculty Advisors are required not only to advise the BD Fellows but also to serve as engaged, hands-on mentors.  BD Advisors commit to fostering their Fellow’s participation in skills-building workshops and training courses, as well as to provide financial support beyond the two-year BD funding period.     The BD program officially began in the fall of 2017 with six Fellows enrolled.  Five of the Fellows were new entrants into the BD program, while one student started during the spring semester of 2017.  Over the next two years ten more students were enrolled into the BD program, bringing the total number of participants to 16.  Two students graduated with their master’s degree in 2018, and two students ended up leaving UConn &ndash; one of whom continued their PhD at another university.  The remaining 12 students remained in the program during the initial years of their PhD program.      The 2017-2020 BD program served 13 males and three females, seven blacks and nine Hispanics.  As underrepresented minority students in STEM fields, many BD Fellows are the first in the family to pursue graduate degrees and sometimes even undergraduate degrees.     NSF Bridge to the Doctorate funding has supported three cohorts of underrepresented minority graduate students at UConn to date.
