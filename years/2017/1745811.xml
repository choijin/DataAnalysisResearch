<AbstractNarration>Santa Fe College proposes a workshop to bring the voices and perspectives of Community Colleges into the national conversation about broadening participation and education in computing (BPC). As a first Community College-driven BPC education event, it will bring together theoretical and practitioner perspectives to listen to each other and use an inclusive, more holistic perspective to drive next steps for engaging the Community College community in the BPC movement effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Community Colleges (CC) serve a more diverse population than 4-year institutions, so they are a natural but often overlooked venue for increasing diversity. This workshop -- led by a multi-institutional leadership committee with representatives from three community colleges, one research university, and two education research organizations, all of whom are active in CS BP research and interventions --  will develop a conceptual model for increasing the participation of CC in BPC initiatives that leverages existing CC collaborations and investments, including the National Center for Women and Information Technology's (NCWIT) Community College Outreach group, and attendees of the 2017 CISE BP Community Meeting. What is missing from most current BPC CC-focused research or interventions is an understanding of what CC themselves want to know and how they would like to be involved in research and intervention projects. The conversational prompts for this meeting will include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The current state of knowledge on issues that relate to equity and inclusion in computing disciplines at CCs. Some examples of known issues are faculty shortages, professional development, lack of consistent articulation/transfer guidelines, lack of student supports (e.g., financial, remediation) and unclear or disconnected curricular pathways.&lt;br/&gt;2. Identification of opportunities to enable CCs to more fully engage in the national movement to broaden participation in computing. This will include organizational constructs that need to be in place (e.g., administrative buy-in), effective interventions (e.g., culturally responsive and gender equitable teaching practices), relevant partners (e.g., university, industry, K-12) across geographies; and incentives to spur action.&lt;br/&gt;3. Next steps for CC engagement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The "Authentic Inclusion of Community Colleges in Broadening Participation in Computing" workshop brought together 49 participants and organizers from community colleges, universities, and national organizations from January 30 through February 1, 2018.  The purpose of this workshop was to have an in-depth conversation on how community colleges, with their diverse populations of students, can more actively participate in the national conversation about broadening participation in computing initiatives.    Specifically, the goals were to:   Discuss the current state of knowledge on issues that relate to broadening participation in computing disciplines at community colleges.   Identify opportunities to enable community colleges to engage more fully in the national broadening participation in computing movement.  Determine next steps of a conceptual model for authentic inclusion of community colleges in broadening participation in computing initiatives.    Intellectual Merit: Attendees collectively brainstormed next steps for authentic inclusion of community colleges in BPC initiatives.  After small group and large group discussions, attendees made four specific recommendations:  development of a perceptions campaign to improve the image and understanding of community college computing programs; development of a CS Principles course specifically designed for the community college;  development of computing pathways that represent a truly connected continuum of education with multiple entry and exit points; development of a community college alliance focusing on broadening participation in computing that leverages existing national models;.  In addition, attendees emphasized that community colleges serve local communities; thus, all initiatives moving forward should be mindful of and include the needs of the local communities. A workshop report was produced that provides more detailed description of each of these recommendations.    Broader Impacts: The workshop was designed to provide a forum for sharing experiences, to empower community colleges to be an increasingly integral part of the Broadening Participation in Computing conversation and build on efforts already underway to learn about the state of Computer Science and Information Technology at community colleges around the nation. Given that community colleges enroll minorities and women in larger numbers than four-year institutions, it is imperative for both community colleges and four-year institutions to engage in collaborative efforts to broaden the participation of diverse peoples into computing and facilitate unobstructed pathways from the two-year to four-year institutions. The complexities of the community college landscape require that experts from various backgrounds come together to share knowledge and experiences to contribute to a better understanding of the role community colleges can play with four-year institutions in BPC efforts.
