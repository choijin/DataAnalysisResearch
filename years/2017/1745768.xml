<AbstractNarration>Separation of a complex chemical mixture into its molecular components requires energy, and it is estimated that 10 to 15% of the world?s energy goes into the separation of chemical products and precursors, including gasoline, polymer precursors, drinking water, and pharmaceuticals.  A number of new separation processes, based on molecular-level interactions and molecular sieving effects, are being developed to reduce this parasitic energy consumption of purification.  Membranes are an emerging technology that generally use significantly less energy than traditional separation processes, as they do not require a phase change (such as boiling) to separate the constituents on a molecular basis.  Rather, the membranes serves as a selective boundary that allows a molecule of one type to pass while retaining other molecules. Due in part to the reduced energy consumption, nearly 8% growth is expected in the membrane markets for gas and liquid separations through 2019, and student involvement and engagement is essential to support growth of this community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Congress on Membranes and Membrane Processes meeting is one of the preeminent global membrane meetings, and is held every three years. It is a cooperative meeting between three international societies, including the North America Membrane Society of the US. The latest developments in the membrane field from leading academic, governmental, and industrial laboratories are presented for the first time for evaluation by the membrane community. Enabling Membrane Technology is the theme of the 2017 meeting, as adoption of energy-efficient membrane technology has been hindered by the risks associated with replacing traditional separation technology on a large scale.  This project supports graduate student participation in the 11th meeting of this group, which will be held July 29 - August 4, 2017 in San Francisco, CA at the Hilton San Francisco Union Square. Up to 150 students will be selected from US Universities to receive $100 per person to offset registration fees. Travel supplements offered by the North America Membrane Society will be used synergistically to support student travel. Travel to this conference will enable students to network with their peers and understand their work in the context of the larger field. The feedback the students receive from senior members of the community can help direct their career.</AbstractNarration>
