<AbstractNarration>Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) refers to a set of changes to the photosynthetic pathway that allows plants to grow more efficiently under conditions of drought, high temperatures, and/or low atmospheric CO2.  It is biochemically similar to another modification, C4 photosynthesis, but requires fewer structural changes to leaf tissue. We know a great deal about the evolutionary history of the C4 syndrome, and this knowledge has informed efforts to genetically engineer this photosynthetic improvement into crops such as rice. We know virtually nothing about CAM evolution- its genetic underpinnings, its relationship to other plant traits, and whether it is equally likely to evolve in all plant lineages. Here the PI proposes to significantly increase our understanding of how CAM evolves, utilizing a comparative approach and focusing on one horticulturally important plant lineage known for drought tolerance, which includes the cacti. The project involves extensive genetic and ecological analyses, and will also develop a new metric to efficiently screen species for low level CAM activity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because this is a CAREER award, all research goals of the project are tightly interwoven into an innovative education program involving undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers at Brown University, and graduate students from Peru. In addition to the basic scientific understanding that will be gained, this project should yield valuable insight into the use of CAM photosynthesis for engineering more drought-resistant crops. Moreover it will build a foundational bridge of scientific collaboration between the United States and Peru, and contribute significantly to capacity building and scientific training in a developing nation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This CAREER award focused on the evolution of Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis, a specialized form of photosynthesis that greatly increases plant drought tolerance, and is commonly found in succulent plants of arid regions. Because it is so often co-occurs with a succulent life form, a reasonable hypothesis is that there may be a mechanistic link between succulence (and more specifically, the cellular properties that go along with succulence) and the ability to perform CAM. We tested this and other hypotheses about CAM evolution in the Portulacineae (Caryophyllales), a lineage of &gt; 2,000 species that have radiated in many of the world&rsquo;s desert regions and have evolved CAM photosynthesis multiple times. We developed a new hypothesis for species relationships within the group using novel phylogenomic approaches, developed a new conceptualization of the different types of CAM photosynthesis, performed drought experiments on dozens of new species to better understand the distribution of CAM across the entire lineage, and developed a new anatomical database to correlate the occurrence of CAM with particular anatomical properties. These activities led us to develop a new hypothesis about the CAM evolutionary trajectory: many plants can exhibit small degrees of CAM activity with relatively little anatomical specialization; however the adoption of CAM as a primary mode of photosynthesis requires significant changes to cellular and tissue-level structural properties.
