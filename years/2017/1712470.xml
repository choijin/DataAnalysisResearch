<AbstractNarration>This project weaves together several threads in the disparate areas of topology, arithmetic, and algebra.  Questions in arithmetic - such as determining the symmetries of a number system - can be difficult to resolve directly, but are sometimes easier to address in a probabilistic or statistical sense.  One main goal of this project is to use tools in topology (and specifically the geometry of configuration spaces of points in the plane) to resolve geometric analogues of these statistical questions in arithmetic.  Along the way, the Principal Investigator will develop tools to study the structure of algebraic objects governing these questions; these tools will be strongly informed by the geometric setting of these configuration spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator will particularly aim to establish and refine conjectures of Malle, Delaunay, and others in the function field setting.  The methods involve a new tool for the computation of the homology of braid groups using the homological algebra of braided Hopf algebras. As part of this work, the Principal Investigator will develop a structure theory for braided Hopf algebras, and use this to better understand their homological algebra.  Finally, the Principal Investigator will reverse the roles of the subjects involved, and  use arithmetic tools to address questions in chromatic homotopy theory, particularly surrounding the chromatic splitting and redshift conjectures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project pursued a web of connections between several strands of mathematics: topology, number theory, and abstract algebra.    Various enumerative problems in number theory can be rephrased in terms of the geometry of certain very high dimensional objects called moduli spaces.  By studying intrinsic geometric properties of these spaces (their topology), we can shed light on the original enumerative problems.  The geometry of these moduli spaces is quite forbidding, so we must approach these questions indirectly.  Quite surprisingly, however, these topological questions can also be translated into questions in pure algebra, regarding properties of certain classes of algebraic systems called braided Hopf algebras.  These systems are quite poorly understood, and one of the goals of this project was to deepen our understanding of their structure using tools from topology.    In this, the project was quite successful.  In particular, we developed a new structure theory for braided Hopf algebras which should deepen our understanding of their algebraic properties.  Our expectation is that this will pay dividends in the original number-theoretic problems in future research.  Indeed, we have already developed several purely number-theoretic conjectures based upon this work.  This project involved six PhD students and one postdoc, providing training and further development to a new generation of the mathematical community.  Further, by its very nature, it is interdisciplinary, weaving together ideas from the three mathematical strands indicated above.  It is our belief that these connections will lead to further interactions between these disparate mathematical communities.
