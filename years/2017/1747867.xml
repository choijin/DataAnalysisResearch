<AbstractNarration>The workshop, "Modeling, Analysis, and Numerics for Nonlocal Applications", will take  11-15 December 2017 in Sante Fe, New Mexico; information is at the website: sites.google.com/site/manna2017abq. The focus of this workshop is on non-local mathematical models, a topic of increasing interest in several diverse scientific and engineering applications related to, as an example, material science, biology, and environmental studies. Non-local calculus and the corresponding models have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling multi-scale phenomena, including overlapping microscopic and macroscopic scales.  In the computational mathematics community, two relatively separate groups of researchers (i.e., the "fractional derivatives" and the "non-local operators" communities) are concurrently working on the analysis and simulation of these relevant problems. One of the main goals of this workshop is to unite these separate communities providing significant benefit from their interaction and opportunity to exchange their recent progress and results on the topic. Central to the workshop is also the involvement of students or young researches, not necessarily already engaged in non-local research, who will have the opportunity to interact and learn from worldwide experts. The main topics that will be addressed are the analysis and improvement of such non-local models and their efficient simulation by means of cutting-edge algorithms on the newest computer architectures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-local operators provide a new framework to overcome limitations that are present in classical PDE-based models. This workshop is designed to facilitate the exchange of information between the (tempered) fractional calculus and non-local vector calculus and the establishment of connections between them; this will lead to the design of new improved non-local models and will facilitate their analysis and simulation. As a result, the workshop will lead to new research in applications of national interest such as subsurface flow simulations, energy storage systems, contaminant transport, polymer and complex fluid flow, material failure and damage, or any applications in complex systems and disordered media that exhibit anomalous transport and diffusion. The goals and objectives of the workshop include establishing synergies between participants working on fractional PDEs with those working on general non-local integral models; maximizing both the breadth and depth of the information imparted to and exchanged among participants; providing researchers at all career stages with the opportunity to present their state-of-the-art results or to learn from experts in the field; and identifying the most important needs and most potentially fruitful avenues for future non-local related research and related applications. This will be facilitated by the discussion session at the end of each day that will focus on a review of the recent past and near-future directions of research in each area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective the workshop MANNA was to unite the separate communities of fractional calculus and nonlocal calculus, allowing the participants to explore differences and similarities between them. A central goal was to gather together both senior and junior researchers conducting leading research on nonlocal models to exchange their recent progress and results and to propose future research guidelines.  Specifically, the main objectives were to 1) establish synergies between participants working on fractional PDEs with those working on general nonlocal integral models; 2) identify the most important needs and most potentially fruitful avenues for future nonlocal research; 3) provide researchers at all career stages with the opportunity to present their state-of-the-art results.  MANNA was very successful in establishing connections between the two communities. We are in fact aware of new collaborations and follow-up interactions between participants. As an example, one of the organizers visited three of the invited speakers and was invited to give a talk on fractional models at a mini-symposium organized by one of the lecturers. She also started a collaboration on nonlocal vector calculus with one of the workshop speakers.  The discussion session held on Thursday, December 14th was incredibly well-attended and constructive. Both students and senior researchers contributed. The main focus was on open problems (e.g. discretization of nonlocal models, nonlocal boundary conditions, etc.) and on research opportunities and research guidelines for young researchers. Several students had the opportunity to present their work to senior people, including researchers working in US national laboratories; these interactions are very likely to lead to summer/year-round internships.  The course was also very useful for researchers not familiar with all the aspects of nonlocal research. Experts in fractional calculus could benefit from the lectures on more general nonlocal models and vice versa.  Finally, the website MANNA2017 is public and the link was sent, through mailing lists, to the entire community. There, one can find all the presentations (approved by the speakers) together with the list of participants, their affiliations, and contacts.
