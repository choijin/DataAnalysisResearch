<AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program grant will advance the understanding of the unique behavior of tidal current foundations and improve science and engineering education at the elementary and high school levels, while promoting increased diversity in the field of geotechnical engineering. The research will investigate efficient and reliable foundation systems for undersea tidal current turbines. The foundations must be designed to resist high lateral loads as well as vertical and horizontal cyclic loading from the oscillating turbine blades, allowing the turbines to effectively absorb and harness the tidal energy while attached to the seafloor. Decreasing the cost of the foundation system can be an important part of making tidal power a viable and economical source of electricity. The research tasks will be used to produce educational products such as learning modules, demonstrations, animations and videos that will be implemented in the courses taught by the researcher and in K-12 outreach programs. A renewable energy lesson will be created for the 4th grade students at Booker T. Washington STEM Academy and the Girls Adventures in Mathematics, Engineering, and Science (G.A.M.E.S) camp for high school girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this project is to evaluate suction caisson foundation systems for tidal current turbines by examining the foundation performance using both 1g bench-scale (in transparent soil and Kaolin) and centrifuge testing under combined cyclic loading. This research focuses on the cyclic nature of the vertical, horizontal and moment loading due to waves, the rotation of the tidal current turbine blades and the change in direction of the horizontal loading due to ebb and flow tides. Although there have been many studies on the use of suction caissons as anchors with diameters less than 10m (Length/Diameter = 3-5), few researchers have investigated using suction caissons as foundation elements in soft clays with intermediate aspect ratios of L/D = 1-3. In addition, the unique vertical cycling and semidiurnal or diurnal (12 or 24 hr) tidal cycling of the horizontal load has not been accounted for in previous designs of suction caisson foundations. The focus of the experimental testing is to investigate the foundation performance, failure modes, load-displacement response, yielding behavior, and cumulative displacements under cyclic loading. The research effort will result in: (i) high quality laboratory data; (ii) load-displacement curves, and (iii) failure envelopes/interactions diagrams, that will allow for the continued study of the utilization of tidal current turbines as a renewable energy source.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Harvesting renewable energy sources such as wind, wave, and tidal currents have received great interest from researchers, the energy industry and government agencies around the world. Effective and economical foundations are a critical need for the installation of offshore power generation systems.      The main goal of the research was to investigate efficient and reliable foundation systems for a new generation of offshore renewable energy devices, particularly with respect to: (i) foundation stability and dynamic response for installations in differing geologic conditions; and (ii) developing new foundation design methodologies to account for the effects of cyclic loading from wave, storm and tidal action. The research objective of this proposal, namely to evaluate suction caisson foundation systems for tidal current turbines by examining the foundation performance using both 1g bench-scale (conducted in transparent soil and Kaolin) and centrifuge testing under horizontal and vertical cyclic loading. The research focused on the cyclic nature of the vertical, horizontal and moment loading due to waves, the rotation of the tidal current turbine blades and the change in direction of the horizontal loading due to ebb and flow tides. Based on the summary and synthesis of the results, design recommendations were developed regarding suction caisson foundations for tidal energy applications.   The research findings advanced the understanding of the unique behavior of tidal current foundations and improved engineering education at the elementary and high school levels while promoting increased diversity in the field of geotechnical engineering. The broader impact of this research was to reduce the cost barriers to ocean renewable energy development that are related to foundation design. The primary outreach activities included wide dissemination of the research findings to offshore renewable energy and foundation design communities through conferences and journal publications. The educational plan included the development of learning modules for elementary and high school students. The educational and outreach plan addressed diversity by promoting pedagogies, such as hand-on activities, increased interaction and integration of research and education, which research has shown to be effective in the retention of underrepresented ethnic groups and women in engineering.  The PI and graduate students conducted outreach towards minority groups within engineering through The Girls Adventures in Mathematics, Engineering, and Science (G.A.M.E.S) Camp: Environmental Engineering and Sustainability Track outreach program focused on high school female students. The PI also developed curriculum for 2nd grade and 4th grade students at Booker T. Washington STEM Academy. The PI also implemented offshore foundations design into the graduate course Advanced Foundation Design. Three models on offshore pile driving, offshore suction caissons and modeling of offshore foundations was created. Key learning objectives included: (1) Describe the difference between offshore and onshore geotechnical engineering; (2) Describe offshore foundation types; (3) Describe the design process for suction caissons.
