<AbstractNarration>This award supports a doctoral dissertation research project that undertakes a detailed study of precision agriculture, a digitally mediated approach to farming. That approach is of rapidly growing social and environmental concern; it promises to shape conversations around climate change, food security, and the political and cultural effects of digital technology and big data in years to come. Precision agriculture has the potential to mitigate the environmental effects of farming while helping to increase food production for a growing world population. However, it will likely accelerate the processes of farm consolidation and automation, raising serious concerns regarding labor and economic inequality. Existing scholarly work on precision agriculture tends to focus on technical problems to the exclusion of the socio-cultural and environmental issues this study focuses on. The proposed research therefore creates and advances knowledge regarding the social, cultural, political, and environmental corollaries of this transformation, knowledge that helps shape and highlight the possibilities and consequences of precision agriculture. It will contribute new data and perspectives of relevance to both the scientific and humanities communities while participating in larger conversations about technology, culture, and the environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of this project is to advance understanding of precision agriculture, an approach to farming leveraging the power of digital sensing and big data analytics to evaluate and customize crop management, livestock, and farm operations in extreme detail. It seeks to determine how and why precision agriculture developed, and what consequences is it likely to have. The overarching goal is to produce an empirically grounded history of precision agriculture that pairs discursive and historical analysis with ethnographic fieldwork in two distinct agricultural regions of the United States, Indiana and New York. The researcher will use multiple methods including participant observation, interviews, archival research and discourse analysis. Research data will be gathered at farms, businesses, universities and trade organizations invested in this approach. He will generate a granular and critically-informed account of precision agriculture that shows how precision agriculture is being designed, used, and understood; the account will, in turn, serve to advance understanding of the drivers and consequences of digital technology in food and farming systems. The research will contribute to broader social goals by folding its findings into larger design, policy, and cultural discussions regarding digital technology, food systems, automation, and ecology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ I. NATURE  This project was designed to advance understanding of and generate new knowledge about the social, political, cultural, and historical aspects of precision agriculture. It was conceived to address a dearth of critical social science and humanities scholarship about precision agriculture, that in turn has meant a lack of knowledge about those dimensions of precision agriculture necessary to more accurately understand its potential benefits and harms.  Through this project the co-PI sought to advance understanding about 1.) the historical roots and drivers of precision agriculture’s development, and 2.) what social, political, cultural, and environmental consequences is it likely to have. Its immediate purpose was to collect the information necessary to produce an empirically grounded, detailed account of how precision agriculture is being designed, used, understood, and discussed by farmers, researchers, businesses, government officials, and the general public. Its goals were to contribute to the advancement of a PhD dissertation, to contribute new data and critical scholarship about precision agriculture to the scientific and social science/humanities communities, and participate in broader conversations about digital technology, food politics, automation, environmental media, and the ecological consequences of capitalism.     The major activities of this project included:  1.)   Conducting recorded and transcribed in-person and phone interviews with farmers in Ohio, Kansas, and New York, as well as researchers in Indiana, New York, and North Dakota.  Additionally, it involved several dozen annotated, unrecorded conversations/interviews with farmers and farm workers in New York, Indiana, Quebec and Ontario, US Department of Agriculture staff, USDA Extension agents, graduate student researchers, faculty researchers, conference attendees, businesspeople/industry representatives, and community members in southern Indiana and upstate New York     2.)   Conducting participant observations at sites including farms in New York and Ohio, national and international agricultural, agribusiness, and precision/digital agriculture conferences, and several local food &amp; farming and precision agriculture related public meetings or assemblies     3.)   Collection and research of primary and secondary materials related to the project’s topic and goals, such as historical and discursive analysis of precision agriculture rhetoric and technology, including but not limited to archival materials, historical and contemporary journalism, public relations materials, and scholarly publications     II. OUTCOMES  The project successfully generated significant new primary data on the uses and history of precision agriculture. The information gleaned from these data sheds light on the theories, research, development, and real-world uses of precision agriculture, both as a way of viewing, speaking about, and approaching farming, as well as an inter-related system of social, political, and technical elements.  Relatedly, access to key primary and secondary materials made possible by the project have allowed the co-PI to develop a richer, more wholistic picture of the history of precision agriculture than is currently available, which will in turn be developed in the co-PI’s dissertation and through future publications.  The project thus achieved its key goals of advancing critical scholarly understanding of the history of precision agriculture, as both a concept and a suite of technologies, and by collecting primary data about precision agriculture from real-world users, designers, regulators, and affected communities.  In so doing, the project promotes the well-being of individuals in society by contributing to the production of critical social, cultural, and political benefits and harms of precision agriculture. Research findings of this project have been shared with the broader academic community through conference presentations and the publication of a peer-reviewed journal article drawing directly on materials generated by the project. These findings have also helped catalyze organizational efforts among scholars of media, seeking to promote studying the central role media technologies play in precision agriculture more carefully and thoroughly.  Finally, these results have contributed to the advancement of the co-PI’s PhD dissertation, the training a doctoral student in research methodology, project management, and cultivation of their field of expertise, and have supported future pedagogical and scholarly contributions through the development of courses, conference presentations, publication of scholarly articles drawn from the project and its findings.
