<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to understand how history and institutions may affect the understanding of appropriate forms of therapy in specific times and places. By examining the historical, political, and cultural processes that give rise to particular therapies, the research will advance social scientific understanding of the historical production of therapeutics, particularly for addictive behaviors. The research is focused on the rise and spread of the therapeutic community movement. Therapeutic communities are mutual-aid communities where substance users and the homeless are sent to rehabilitate each other. No longer common in the United States, where bio-medical and pharmaceutical approaches are more common, therapeutic communities continue to spread in other parts of the world. The researcher asks why this is the case and what the effects are for caregivers, care receivers, and other stakeholders.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out in Puerto Rico by Columbia University anthropology doctoral researcher, Caroline Parker, supervised by Dr. Jennifer Hirsch. In Puerto Rico, which is both home to many therapeutic communities and a key source of their spread to other countries, this form of care comprises a crucial safety net for some of the island's most vulnerable populations. Puerto Rican therapeutic communities are usually peer-operated: program graduates perform essential caregiving duties as therapists, treatment leaders, and directors. The researcher will undertake archival research and oral history interviews to  trace the historical growth of Puerto Rico's therapeutic communities from a single state-run program founded in the early 1960s to a decentralized network of over 150 mutual-aid collectives operating across the island. In addition to the historical component, she will conduct twelve months of ethnographic fieldwork in two of the communities, collecting data through long-term participant observation and in-depth interviews. Finally, she will combine legal-policy research and key informant interviews to examine the specific institutions, state practices and laws that produce and sustain these forms of care.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This dissertation project, "An Ethnographic and Historical Study of Therapeutic Communities," examined Puerto Rican therapeutic communities &ndash; resource-poor mutual-aid collectives that have flourished over the past five decades, despite being heavily criticized by human rights groups for using unwaged labour as a method to treat addiction. The persistence of these communities, which are spreading rapidly across Latin America, is widely interpreted as indentured labour and ascribed in international media to state neglect.  The co-PI conducted a year of ethnographic research in Puerto Rico to understand why labor therapies thrive. Fieldwork entailed a combination of in-depth interviews, participant observation, and archival research.  The main finding was to challenge the argument that labor therapies are the result of the state failing to provide alternatives. The research identifies a collection of historically grounded institutional factors that prop up this therapeutic regime. These include faltering employment and corrections systems, overwhelmed kinship networks, drug violence, and political patronage.  A second finding relates to understandings of informal work. This research showed that therapeutic labor is often unproductive and sometimes explicitly useless. These practices, then, are not simply poverty survival strategies, but reflect a philosophy of endurance through which unemployed men create meaningful alternative livelihoods.  From this research, the co-PI has submitted two single-authored manuscripts to academic journals, both of which are under review.
