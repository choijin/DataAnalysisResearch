<AbstractNarration>This dissertation project is a biocultural investigation of iron deficiency and its connection to negative physiological outcomes in children living in multi-generational households where individuals experience both under- and overnutrition. Investigators will examine biological and ecological factors that influence child iron status, providing practical knowledge on determinants of iron deficiency and addressing the theory that low iron may be partially protective against infection. The research objectives and methods of this project will advance knowledge about human life history, and contribute to the discussion about why policies that aim to reduce iron deficiency and anemia are not always successful. This project will contribute to the education of a graduate student as well as provide training opportunities in anthropological and health sciences to a female community health worker. Investigators will distribute the results of this project through community workshops, meetings with local and national health agencies, and a series of peer-reviewed publications and presentations at anthropological, public health, and medical conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While low levels of iron are associated with negative health outcomes, iron withholding is an important component in immune defense against infectious disease. The Optimal Iron Hypothesis (OIH) states that an individual's optimal iron status is contingent on their particular disease ecology.  This project will test a new application of OIH in an area that suffers from the dual burden of over- and undernutrition. Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, researchers will investigate the relationship between iron, infection, and malnutrition as well as examine household-level and biological predictors of current iron status. Investigators will employ interviews and observations to establish participant health histories, diet quality, and disease exposure in households. Researchers will also measure height and weight to establish nutrition status as well as gather data on iron status and infection through the collection and analysis of blood samples.</AbstractNarration>
