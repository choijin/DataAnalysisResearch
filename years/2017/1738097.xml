<AbstractNarration>The radio spectrum that is usable for wireless communications is a reusable but finite resource. Exponentially growing demand by phones, computers, and the internet of things drives a need for significantly improved dynamic spectrum sharing and allocation. Spectrum allocation is slowly moving towards automated management, with improved efficiency and new wireless services enabled at each step. New spectrum systems still require controlled management of the spectrum. By comparison, this project investigates ways to completely automate the management of spectrum, leaving it to individual devices to learn how to collaboratively share spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team is an interdisciplinary research group that brings together the disciplines of "Big Data", machine learning (ML), telecommunications, and signal processing. Efficient opportunistic radio spectrum allocation requires intelligent dynamic agents that can make real-time decisions at the time scale of tens of milliseconds, and can only be achieved using sophisticated machine learning algorithms. A key ingredient for making informed spectrum allocation decisions is the accurate identification of radio signals such as radio and TV broadcasting, local and wide area data networks, cell phones, analog and digital voice, radar, etc., which have been contaminated by noise, fading effects, timing errors, and transmission channel distortion.  The project focus is on the development and implementation of ML strategies for classification, strategies for wireless network configuration and multi-network collaboration. Building upon successful strategies that have been used for image and voice recognition, this project adapts deep learning (DL) algorithms such as convolutional neural networks, deep neural networks, and reinforcement learning networks for the classification of communication signals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The original goal of this grant was to form a team to compete in the DARPA spectrum collaboration challenge and involve faculty in Computer Science, Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering and Telecommunications in building a team focused on the use of AI and spectrum collaboration.  Although our team was eventually unsuccessful in the DARPA SCC challenge, the team-building and inter-disciplinary learning that occured around the SCC competition has inculcated the methods of AI-driven collaboration in wireless networks and trained a cohort of students versed in the importance of this area, the technology needed to innovate and the possible impact of their work.  Some of the faculty involved in this proposal (Ha, Grunwald) worked with the students training during the competition to explore how machine learning can be used to estimate link utilization in the absence of centralized information sources; this work was published in the Mobisys conference in 2019 and 2020. In addition, students training during the competition contributed to the identification to a security exploit in emergency alert messages and the faculty are now working with DHC, FEMA and FCC to identify and validate solutions to that exploit.  Other faculty and students have continued the initial use of deep-learning in signal intelligence following the DARPA SCC program as part of a collaboration with the Institute for Telecommunications Sciences, a joint NTIA/NIST facility located in Boulder. The methods used in the DARPA SCC program are being applied to identify interference in the Citizens Broadband Radio Spectrum (CBRS) and has resulting in publications in Dyspan 2019.  In addition, the faculty have established a 4G/5G research group based on the technology and the learning from the EAGER funded program.
