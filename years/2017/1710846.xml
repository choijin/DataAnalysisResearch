<AbstractNarration>Award: DMS 1710846, Principal Investigator: Andre Neves&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of shapes that are in an equilibrium position was started by Lagrange 300 year ago. These special shapes are called minimal surfaces and they are ubiquitous in Science, serving to model soap films, black holes in General Relativity, or tensile structures in architecture.  Moreover, they come in two types: those which are stable, i.e., if perturbed they return to their original equilibrium position and those which are unstable, i.e., if perturbed they move away from their original position.  The first type has been extensively studied in Mathematics over the last 40 years and they have been used to solve many long standing open questions in Geometry and Mathematical Relativity. The second type started being studied more systematically some years ago by Marques and the PI and they were used to solve some open problems such as the Willmore Conjecture or the problem of finding infinitely many unstable minimal surfaces. The project presented plans to continue the study of unstable minimal surfaces. Its goals are twofold: On one hand to develop the theory that governs their existence and on the other hand to study their properties as the degrees of instability become quite large because this is expected to uncover new relations across Geometry, Topology, and Analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More precisely, the objectives of the project are to further develop the Almgren-Pitts Min-max Theory and to study the properties of minimal surfaces when seen as nonlinear eigenvalues to the volume spectrum. For the first part we aim to investigate how to bound from below the index of min-max minimal surfaces by the number of parameters and to relate that problem with the multiplicity one conjecture. An application of that result would be to solve a stronger version of a conjecture of Yau. The second objective is motivated by the recent Weyl Law for the volume spectrum that the PI proved with Marques and Liokumovich. This property suggests a stronger analogy between eigenfunctions for the Laplacian spectrum and minimal surfaces that we intend to explore and the possibility to prove Weyl Laws for many other nonlinear problems. The techniques involved combine ideas from Spectral Geometry, Morse Theory, and Minimal Surface theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Minimal surfaces are shapes in space that are in an equilibrium position. They are abstract mathematical objects but find natural applications in science, serving to model black holes or tensile structures.    The PI has showed, with his co-authors, that generically any space contains an abundance of minimal surfaces with as many degrees of instability as desired.    More precisely, with Irie and Marques, the PI showed that generically any closed manifold of dimension between 3 and 7 admits infinitely many distinct embedded minimal surfaces and they are dense.   With Marques and Song, the PI has showed that showed that generically any closed manifold of dimension between 3 and 7  has infinitely many minimal embedded surfaces that become equidistributed in space.   With Marques, the PI showed that under the multiplicity one conjecture, the Morse index of the minimal surfaces is identical to the number of parameters that are used in the min-max method. When combined with the recent solution due to Zhou of the multiplicity one conjecture, this result implies that for every integer k there is a minimal surface with exactly k degrees of instability.     Finally, the techniques and ideas used in this project have energized the field of minimal surfaces and have been used to solve many other open problems.
