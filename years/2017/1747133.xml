<AbstractNarration>TheÂ broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the innovation of diamond technologies that will enhance the efficiency and reliability of electric vehicles, thus supporting the development of green technology and reduction of CO2 emissions. Specifically, diamond diodes will reduce powertrain losses by about a third and thus directly translate into a 10% increase in electric power vehicle (EPV) range. While the impact of diamond diodes is significant, the development of this technology is also intended to advance diamond power devices. Additional diamond components - such as insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) - will increase the efficiency and reliability of electric vehicles even further. Moreover, the successful commercialization of diamond will ultimately affect many power markets in addition to EPVs: including converters and inverters in geothermal drilling, aerospace, and power grids; high-frequency applications such as radar and communication systems; and extreme environment electronics relevant to the nuclear industry and space exploration, such as the exploration of Venus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project expects the fabrication of diamond freewheeling Schottky-PIN diodes for EPVs. These devices will utilize lab-grown diamond to produce and test PIN diodes. While growth techniques have recently been developed to enable to the fabrication of such structures, much innovation is still needed to facilitate scalability and commercialization of diamond devices. Therefore, in Phase I, the scope of research will consist of the following activities to make diamond diodes for powertrain converters and inverters in EPVs: (a) demonstrate the expected performance of diamond freewheeling diodes using simulations, (b) control the doping concentrations and thickness of single-crystal diamond layers, (c) develop scalable fabrication and patterning processes for diamond devices, (e) determine electrical characteristics of diamond PIN diodes, and (f) investigate the reliability and possible failure mechanisms of packaged diamond PIN diodes. A significant challenge for diamond devices for power applications will be the achievement of cost parity. Considering the relatively high cost of diamond substrates, an innovative commercialization strategy will be adapted to keep initial costs low, allowing diamond devices to achieve cost parity faster.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Summary:The purpose of this research was to demonstrate a prototype of freewheeling diodes for power management applications, and demonstrate that said diodes could perform at high temperatures (up to 300 ?C). Advent Diamond has a proprietary Phosphorus doped diamond deposition technique which enables a unique Schottky PIN diode design.  This design consists of boron-doped (p-type), single-crystal intrinsic, and phosphorus-doped (n-type) diamond layers, and a Schottky metal contact. In Phase I, fabrication of Schottky PIN diodes showing state of the art performance characteristics was successfully demonstrated.  In addition to showing the technical feasibility of these diodes for the commercial applications targeted, Phase I research successfully demonstrated that diodes can be fabricated on diamond substrates with an orientation of (100), which are lower cost substrates than other orientations. This result is significant, since the growth of a phosphorous-doped, single-crystal diamond layer on (100) diamond has challenged other groups.  The important conclusions from Phase I studies are:  The diamond diodes fabricated and tested in Phase I show state of the art electrical properties (e.g. high temperature operation, packaged and reliable diamond Schottky PIN diode). Diamond diode design parameters can be tuned to address a range of applications.  The computational models established in Phase I support specific device engineering. Advent Diamond proprietary diamond deposition technology enables the fabrication of diamond Schottky power diodes on (100) substrates which are preferred for manufacturing.  Various spin-off products are made possible from this research and development ? details will be discussed in Phase II proposal.  A beginning to end fabrication process for diamond electronics has been demonstrated. This includes, relationships with key suppliers for device packaging and testing, in house knowledge of processing and testing, and contacts in the industry for distributing packaged prototypes for real-world testing.   Advent Diamond has developed relationships with potential customers and provided devices for testing.  Conclusion:In Phase I, Advent Diamond has demonstrated diamond Schottky PIN diodes tested up to 300 ?C, 2 A forward current at forward voltage drop of 4.5 V, blocking voltage of 400 V, package compatible up to 300 ?C, electrical results repeatability with testing of packaged diodes from RT to 150 ?C with multiple measurements of current vs voltage. The study included the challenges and methods of resolution to increase repeatability of deposited diamond layers, to increase blocking voltage, higher forward current measurements and higher temperature measurements of packaged didoes. The conclusions support the theoretical electrical characteristics of diamond devices, based on material properties, potential to perform at high temperatures, low voltage drop and high blocking voltage. The methods of resolution discussed above will be elaborated and implemented in Phase II to make first diamond PIN Schottky diode available commercially. In addition, Advent Diamond has developed relationships with vendors, resulting in packaged prototypes, which have been shared with potential customers.
