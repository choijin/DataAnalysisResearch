<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-corps project can affect many industries and applications where lightweight structures and materials are advantageous. Cellular materials, such as honeycombs, foams, and lattice materials, are some of the lightest, stiffest, and strongest available at moderate to low density. There is an ever present demand for lighter, stiffer and stronger materials in industries such as aerospace, automotive, defense, civil engineering, sports equipment. Lighter materials are demanded by users to experience enhanced performance, and they are sought by producers to gain a competitive edge. This project aims to find commercial applications for an ultra-lightweight cellular materials geometry-a type of 3D honeycomb-that achieves theoretical upper limits for structural efficiency and stiffness. This unique geometry is the first of its kind, and can facilitate structures with extreme stiffness, high strength, and maximum lightweight performance. The main focus is to identify opportunities in unmanned aerial vehicles for defense and commercial use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project assesses the commercial viability of a 3D honeycomb-like material geometry, and the Intellectual Merit encompasses establishing the commercial utility of the accompanying design, analysis and experimental scheme, which enables the creation of lightweight optimized structures with maximum stiffness and very high strength. This design is composed of two highly anisotropic subgeometries whose contributions can be tailored locally, through simple design parameters, to produce functionally graded and highly optimized structures. The symmetries and alignments of material are unique in 3D space. The relatively simple geometry can be fabricated through origami like sheet folding, allowing access to a multitude of material systems and very low density structures. This design was generated using a semi-automated finite element modeling algorithm, which allowed for a wide variety of designs to be considered.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The entrepreneurial lead, Dr. Jonathan Berger, the PI, Robert McMeeking and the business mentor, Mr. Michael Meyers, interviewed over 100 individuals to explore the commercial viability of the periodic closed cell lightweight material, known as Isomax, invented by Dr. Berger and developed by him and the PI. While much enthusiasm was identified in the interviews in regard to the outstanding mechanical properties of Isomax, the message that was received is that the big challenge is getting a material certified or accepted by designers for a structural design application.  For example, in the case of aerospace applications, in the military and space sphere, the designer is only willing to explore a new material system when a design is otherwise impossible, or the new material offers orders of magnitude improvement in a critical performance metric. In the commercial sphere, the cost and time to get a new material certified by the FAA is prohibitive that the companies will only contemplate a new material if it offers orders of magnitude improvement in fuel consumption or a large increase in the permitted payload. While Isomax is significantly better than competing lightweight materials, its handicap is that this improvement is not by orders of magnitude.  The intellectual merit of the outcomes of the project is that an innovative design for a material was assessed in regard to its possible applications in aerospace, biomedical, automotive and sporting equipment applications. The broader impact of the project is that possible commercialization opportunities were identified and a long-term plan of development was assembled that will be pursued to make such applications feasible and viable.
