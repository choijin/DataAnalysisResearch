<AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical:&lt;br/&gt;The flow of heat and electric charge are coupled together, and these thermoelectric effects underpin diverse critical technologies, including thermostats, electrically driven refrigerators, and photodetectors.  Thermoelectric properties can be engineered by structuring materials on the nanoscale.  Using a scanning laser as a moveable heat source, the PI's group has revealed unexpected thermoelectric effects even in nominally simple metal structures.  Specifically, grain boundaries and surface chemistry can modify thermoelectric response, and greatly enhanced photo-voltages are possible in structures where electrons have to "tunnel" across a nanoscale gap between metal electrodes. This project will confirm the mechanisms behind these surprising features, and build upon this knowledge to create and characterize prototypes of new photodetectors based on metal optical antennas.  While not as sensitive as semiconductor-based photodetectors, metal optical antenna systems are geometrically tunable, have different noise processes, and can be simpler to fabricate.  Results will be disseminated via publications, presentations at conferences, and popular writings by the PI on his blog.  This project will provide training and professional development to graduate students and undergraduate researchers, aiding in the creation of the next generation of a technologically skilled and innovative workforce.   The PI will also work with K12 teachers and undergraduates from other institutions through ongoing Rice programs.  Through his blog and writings in collaboration with the Houston Chronicle, the PI will continue to popularize nanoscale science and engineering in general, and this project's research outcomes in particular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;Nanostructured thermoelectric devices have enormous potential as technologies and as tools to acquire the basic scientific and engineering knowledge necessary to control and optimize the flow of energy at the nanoscale.  By coupling electronic transport measurements and illumination via a scanning laser microscope, the PI's group has found unexpected photothermoelectric effects in nominally simple metal nanostructures.  Metal nanowires demonstrate previously unreported inhomogeneities in Seebeck response, indicating that grain boundaries and surface chemistry can be tools for engineering thermoelectric response.  Nanoscale tunneling gaps between metallic electrodes show greatly enhanced photovoltages compared to nontunneling structures, with material and polarization dependences that are consistent with plasmon-enhanced hot electron tunneling as the mechanism.   The intellectual merit of this project lies in its three specific research goals:  quantifying and engineering photothermoelectric effects in metal nanostructures through control of surface conditions (via self-assembled monolayers) and grain structure; understanding and optimizing greatly enhanced thermoelectric effects in nanogaps; and demonstrating photodetectors based on these enhanced photothermoelectric effects, looking at sensitivity and noise properties.  The PI's team of graduate and undergraduate students will collaborate with theorists in modeling the optoelectronic and thermal transport processes at work in these structures, providing critical feedback for optimization of response.  Results will be disseminated broadly through publications, presentations at conferences, and when appropriate the PI's blog.  This project will provide training and professional development to graduate students and undergraduate researchers, aiding in the creation of the next generation of a technologically skilled and innovative workforce.   The PI will also work with K12 teachers and undergraduates from other institutions through ongoing Rice programs.  Through his blog and writings in collaboration with the Houston Chronicle, the PI will continue to popularize nanoscale science and engineering in general, and this project's research outcomes in particular.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award was focused on the basic understanding of photothermoelectric (PTE) and hot electron photovoltage effects in metal nanostructures and the development of photodetection technologies based on these.  In terms of intellectual merit, this award led to several important advances in understanding.  Experiments can be divided into two broad categories, those that examined the PTE response in metal wires, and those that probed large open-circuit photovoltages in metal tunneling structures.   In the former, an unusual PTE response was found in gold nanowires that indicated the presence and photodecomposition of metastable gold oxide on the device surface.  In parallel with this, we performed experiments using single-crystal and bi-crystal gold nanowires provided by collaborators from Stanford University to examine the origin of the surprising spatial variation in PTE response seen in polycrystalline wires.  This research established that the PTE response in metals is not dominated by grain boundaries, but instead is sensitive to local strain and structural distortions.  Further studies of these crystalline wires showed that the PTE technique can detect trace Pt impurity gradients in gold at levels below what can be found by conventional methods.  Understanding the factors that influence PTE response in metal film structures, we constructed and measured PTE-based plasmonic photodetectors from asymmetric structures that exhibited polarization-sensitive response of opposite signs at two design wavelengths.      In nanogap tunnel junctions, experiments further confirmed that plasmon-generated hot electron photocurrents are responsible for the large open-circuit photovoltages in such structures.  Remote excitation of propagating plasmons showed that the local plasmon modes at the nanogap determine the direction of hot electron current.  Finite-element modeling of the plasmonic properties of nanogaps helped establish the mechanism responsible for the remarkable above-threshold electroluminescence observed in biased nanogap structures.  Most recently, the direction of hot electron current and thus sign of open-circuit photovoltage can be engineered by the design of bimetallic Au/Pt junctions.   The award resulted in six peer-reviewed publications in high impact journals, one conference proceeding, and one manuscript in progress.  In terms of broader impacts, this award partially supported the research of three doctoral students (one in materials science, one in physics, and one in electrical and computer engineering), all three of whom have completed and defended their PhDs as of this writing.  Two of these three students are women.  The results have been presented at national APS meetings by the students, as well as at ACS and SPIE by the PI.  The materials science and electrical engineering students have gone on to industry jobs, while the physicist is a staff scientist at Sandia National Laboratory.  The PI?s lab hosted a teacher as part of a summer research experience for teachers during this award.  The PI has also continued blogging about nanoscience and condensed matter physics for a general readership throughout this award, including the development of an aggregated primer about science concepts for use by professional science writers.
