<AbstractNarration>This NSF award provides support for graduate students, early-career researchers and members of underrepresented groups to participate in the Shanks Workshop on Homotopy Theory at Vanderbilt University on March 25-26, 2017.  The workshop will foster collaboration and exchange of ideas among researchers throughout the field of algebraic topology, a branch of mathematics that stands at the intersection of several fundamental areas of research. This workshop's invited speakers reflect the diversity of current work in the area and include researchers at a variety of career stages in order to best capture a cross-section of the field today.  The workshop will help establish ties between the growing community of topologists in the south, including Kentucky, Georgia and at Vanderbilt, with the long-standing community of researchers in the Midwest.  These types of research connections are the building blocks for progress in mathematical research. Participants with established or emerging research programs will have a forum to publicize their work and more junior participants will have the opportunity to integrate into the wider topology community. The schedule of the conference is designed with breaks to encourage collaborations and informal mathematical interactions among the participants.  Such opportunities are especially important for mathematicians early in their career.  Incorporating young mathematicians and members of underrepresented groups into the scientific discourse is key to building a truly representative community of mathematicians. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference speakers represent a range of research in the field, from computations via chromatic homotopy theory to foundational development to algebraic and topological K-theory.  Bringing together mathematicians from these areas will facilitate collaborations between Midwestern and Southern algebraic topologists working across the spectrum of homotopy theory today.  Additionally, the speakers' research includes several areas of homotopy theory that have fruitful connections to other areas of pure mathematics, such as geometric group theory and dynamics. This workshop will serve to publicize these connections to researchers in Tennessee and surrounding states, where there has historically been little homotopy theory.  Thus, a conference at Vanderbilt showcasing the range of present homotopical research will allow the establishment of mathematical ties both within the discipline and to other fields.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The sole purpose of this award was to fund participation in two research conferences in mathematics, the Shanks Workshops in Homotopy Theory, which took place at Vanderbilt University in March 2017 and in April 2019.  These conferences brought together researchers in algebraic topology and related fields to discuss their current research.  Each conference had approximately 30-35 participants, consisting primarily of researchers from the south and midwest regions of the country.  Funding from this grant provided full or partial support travel and local epxpenses support for the participation of 33 researchers across both conferences, primarily consisting of graduate student and early-career researchers.    The workshops' speakers and participants reflect the diversity of mathematical research in algebraic topology today.  Speakers shared new research on topics with connections to fields such as number theory and physics, as well as research at the cutting edge of new work in algebraic topology and homotopy theory.  There were twelve research talks between both conferences, and topics discussed included connections between algebraic topology and geometric group theory, mathematical physics, abstract homotopy theory, K-theory, and chromatic homotopy theory.  At least one new research collaboration, resulting in a sequence of papers, grew directly out of connections made at this conference.  The main impetuses for organizing these conferences was to showcase the wide range of new work in algebraic topology and adjacent fields and to bring together researchers from the midwest and south so as to solidify ties between the growing community of researchers in homotopy theory in the south and southeast region and the well-established community in the midwest.     Conferences are an essential part of furthering research in mathematics.  They provide researchers the opportunity to share their work with mathematicians outside their home institution and lay the foundation for collaborations and subsequent work.    These connections provide an essential foundation for young mathematicians as they move forward in their careers.  The size and schedule of these conferences were planned to provide ample opportunity for the informal discussion and networking in order to encourage these connections.  Integrating early career researchers and members of underrepresented groups into the mathematical community via conferences and workshops is an essential part of fostering a broad, intellectually robust community of researchers for decades to come.
