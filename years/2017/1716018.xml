<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project may be characterized by major advances in analysis of injection-molded parts, providing notable societal benefits through innovative new uses of these materials.  Of particular note in this regard is the automotive industry.  Despite the long held promise of composite materials in automotive applications, the industry has been slow to adopt widespread use of composites due to uncertainties in performance under challenging loading conditions. A successful rollout of the envisioned software will bring transformational change to this industry, leading to notable long-term societal benefits related to energy efficiency and safety.  Beyond the automotive industry, chopped fiber structural components are ubiquitous in consumer products, aerospace components, and electronics.  The company's goal is to provide accurate solutions involving complex material behavior, producing parts designed for maximum efficiency and achieved at initial fabrication rather than after multiple production iterations.  The result is a disruptive technology that will dramatically lower the cost of production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the immense technical challenge associated with nonlinear material modeling to failure of structural components made using chopped fiber composite materials.  The fiber volume fractions and orientations of a chopped fiber composite material produce wild microstructural configurations that may vary throughout the structure.  The problem is significantly amplified by the complex deformation mechanisms occurring in typical polymer matrix materials.  Moreover, polymer behavior is dramatically influenced by environmental and loading conditions.  Existing software solutions for the engineering analysis of chopped fiber structural components are either inadequate due to gross oversimplifications or, at the other extreme, overly complex to implement, thereby rendering them useless to the typical design engineer.  Lack of an adequate software solution results in expensive over-design and dramatically longer cycles to market. The company's goal is to provide accurate solutions involving complex material behavior, producing parts designed for maximum efficiency and achieved at initial fabrication rather than after multiple production iterations.   A hallmark of the company's software is an emphasis on simplicity while still producing high fidelity stress analyses simulating complex nonlinear material behaviors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  This project addresses the technical challenge of predicting structural performance of as manufactured fiber-reinforced 3D printed parts, also known as Additive Manufacturing. While Additive Manufacturing has been around for decades in numerous forms, the technology is undergoing a renaissance attributed to a marked transition from prototyping to manufacturing.  This transition is being fueled by relentless advances in material performance and hardware development, producing higher quality parts at faster speeds.  Although 3D printing is entering the mainstream of manufacturing technology, a glaring gap in advancing the industry faster and further is the simulation of the performance of an as manufactured part.  A common question surrounding 3D printing today is: ?How do I know if my part will perform as envisioned?? The research conducted lays a foundation for a software simulation aimed at answering this very question, enabling engineers to validate part performance prior to attempting a build.  Speed and simplicity are hallmarks of the simulation, empowering product/design engineers to optimize their designs to achieve the best possible 3D print solutions.  Advancing the adoption of 3D printing for manufacturing has enormous societal benefits.  Chief among these benefits is the notion of distributed manufacturing, where structural parts may be manufactured onsite, meeting on-demand needs while eliminating transportation costs and inventory storage.  Unique, one-off prints, such as may often occur in the medical industry are another virtue of 3D print technology. In brief, this software solution will accelerate a disruptive manufacturing technology in virtually every major manufacturing sector of American industry.     Significant Results  The software under development focuses on challenging simulations that involve deformation and failure mechanisms captured over 5 geometric scales. This pentascale analysis begins with a part designed in the CAD environment by a product/design engineer.  Although this structural scale (i) is the only one visible to the user, additional scales of analysis include the (ii) infill lattice, (iii) lattice walls where voids will occur between print beads, (iv) a short-fiber material model for polymer composite materials, and (v) a decomposition to the stress state at the fiber and matrix levels using multicontinuum technology (MCT)-an industry leading approach to failure analysis of composite materials.  The various scales captured in  a simulation are shown in Figure 1 including: (a) structural, (b) lattice infill, (c) a single triangular lattice, (d) a void within a lattice wall, and (e) particulate reinforcement within a matrix material of a composite.  Multiscale analysis is generally viewed as the gold standard for simulation of heterogeneous materials, as it captures deformation mechanisms occurring at the microscale.  However, a fundamental obstacle haunting advances in multiscale software development is computational speed.  In the simulation scheme developed, we lay out a clear path to achieve unmatched solution speeds while producing high fidelity results.  The current project addressed two key technical challenges needed to derisk the technology and provide a software solution accessible by a product engineer developing a 3D printed part. The first challenge addressed was developing an innovative technology to predict nonlinear composite material performance with run times expected to be on the order of seconds as opposed to hours. The analysis is based on a unique mathematical description of the short fiber microstructure that models the material behavior by combining microstructural models for: i) a continuous fiber unidirectional composite, and ii) a particulate reinforced composite.  A second upscaling process required for securing a swift structural solution for a 3D print is to develop a homogenized material model for the infill geometry of a printed part. The homogenized properties of the infill are then used in a structural analysis, leading to a relatively small structural models with extremely fast solution times.  Results of the project demonstrated the ability to upscale results from fiber and matrix properties to the infill geometry and upscale again from the infill lattice to the structural level-all occurring at solution speeds enabling iterative design. Finally, simplicity of analysis in a computationally scalable environment is an essential attribute of reaching the growing number of production engineers involved in AM design. Cloud-based solutions are ideal for meeting these objectives. Combining the features of a simple multiscale analysis executed at high speed in a user-friendly cloud application opens a gateway to an industry leading simulation for structural integrity of 3D printed composite parts.
