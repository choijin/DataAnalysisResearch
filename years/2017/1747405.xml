<AbstractNarration>This project considers the phenomenon of counterrevolution, examining how counterrevolutionary challenges typically emerge and when they are most likely to succeed in toppling a new revolutionary regime. Counterrevolutions represent tremendously consequential political events; yet, as scholars are increasingly recognizing, they have seldom been considered systematically in rigorous social scientific accounts. This project therefore stands to make a substantial contribution by developing and testing a theory of counterrevolution. It will draw on cross-national data from the full universe of revolutions in the 20th and 21st centuries, as well as interview and protest data from the case of Egypt, which experienced a political revolution in 2011 and a counterrevolution in 2013. Moreover, the project will generate several broader impacts. First, it will build practical and actionable knowledge to help policymakers in supporting peaceful transitions to democracy following revolutions and preventing nascent democratic projects from being cut short by counterrevolutions. Second, it will develop new resources and capacity for quantitative empirical research on the Arab World, including by training two Arab research assistants in rigorous data collection methods and by building a dataset of contentious events in Egypt. Third, it will facilitate dialogue between Egypt's polarized political factions, helping to build a foundation on which political reconciliation and a more stable and inclusive governance system in Egypt might be achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address two questions: Under what conditions do revolutionary regimes come to be challenged by counterrevolutions? And when do such counterrevolutionary challenges succeed?  A counterrevolution is defined as an effort in the aftermath of a successful revolution to restore a version of the pre-revolutionary political regime. Contrary to existing accounts of counterrevolution, which focus on the unilateral actions of elites from the old regime, this dissertation proposes that overthrowing revolution requires a popular base. Specifically, it is argued that successful counterrevolutions are brought about by a coalition of coercive forces from the old regime and disaffected reformists in the revolutionary coalition itself, with the support of broad segments of society whose members grow weary of revolutionary change. The research leverages quantitative and qualitative research strategies at both the cross-national and sub-national level. It first considers the case of Egypt, which experienced a political revolution in 2011 and a counterrevolution in 2013. Using qualitative process tracing of interview data and quantitative analysis of protest events in the year preceding the counterrevolution, it examines the processes and mechanisms that brought about counterrevolution in this paradigmatic case. The case-specific research will be complemented with analysis of a quantitative dataset that documents which successful revolutions through the 20th and 21st centuries were challenged and overthrown by counterrevolutions. Finally, several shadow cases of successful and unsuccessful counterrevolution will be examined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This research project is an investigation of counterrevolution, a phenomenon that we know very little about, either empirically or theoretically, despite its tremendous importance in many countries and periods of global history. The study explains why some regimes recently established through revolution come to be challenged by counterrevolutions, and why some of those counterrevolutions succeed.

These findings are surprising because we often think of revolutionaries as plucky upstarts, and counterrevolutionaries as their shadowy but powerful foes. But I argue in the project that the process of revolution inverts this balance of power, such that when a revolution ends revolutionaries typically enjoy a power <em>advantage</em> over old regime remnants. Indeed, this insight is born out by research on both revolutions and democratization, which finds that revolutionary regimes tend to be stronger and more durable than their peers. Of course, many revolutions leave part of the old regime intact, and when these forces maintain some of their resources, like guns and foreign allies, they may try to return to power. But I find that even counterrevolutionaries with considerable means at their disposal struggle to overturn revolutionary regimes, which can drawn on their own guns and allies and, even more crucially, their support in society to defend themselves from attacks. It is only when revolutionaries, through their own actions and decisions, squander some of their hard-won power that a successful counterrevolution becomes likely.</p> <p>To develop and test this theory I used a variety of qualitative and quantitative data, collected with the support of this NSF grant. I began by conducting a detailed case analysis of Egypt?s 2011 revolution and 2013 counterrevolution. The case study was based, first, on 93 interviews that I conducted over two and a half years with Egyptian activists and politicians who were centrally involved in Egypt?s post-revolution transition. I used these interviews to trace the processes and mechanisms that created the conditions for Egypt?s counterrevolution. The second set of evidence for the Egypt case-study was a dataset of approximately 7,500 protests and other contentious events from the eighteen month period preceding the counterrevolution. These data, which I collected from an Egyptian newspaper with a team of research assistants, allowed me to examine the nature of popular support for the counterrevolution, including how a wave of diffuse labor and social protests after the revolution came to be channeled into a focused counterrevolutionary movement. Finally, I conducted a cross-national analysis of counterrevolutionary emergence and success across the full universe of revolutions in the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries ? a total of 123. I analyzed and studied each of these revolutions, coding the counterrevolutionary outcome for each case (i.e., no counterrevolution, failed counterrevolution, successful counterrevolution) and writing a short vignette about each case?s post-revolutionary trajectory. This dataset allowed me to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate my theory and explore patterns in counterrevolution across a broad range of eras and geographies.</p><br> <p>            Last
