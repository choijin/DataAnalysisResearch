<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the development of a biofungicide for application on organic farms as well as conventional farms and home and lawn care as an alternative to chemical fungicides. More than 70% of all major crop diseases are caused by fungi. Despite intensive disease control practices, these pathogens are still causing crop losses averaging 13% with economic losses up to $100 billion annually. The proposed research will address the need for sustainable food production by development of methods/technologies to reduce or eliminate the usage of chemical pesticides. It will reduce the impact of plant pathogens, insect pests, and abiotic stresses on crop plants by inducing systemic resistance in crops. Unlike chemical fungicides, it will be eco-friendly and will prevent development of anti-fungal resistance in plant pathogens. Furthermore, reduction in chemical fungicide usage (produced using fossil fuels) will reduce US dependence on fossil fuels and promote environmental sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel, broad spectrum, biofungicide for crop protection as an alternative to chemical fungicides. The novel broad spectrum fungicide is based on a fermentative strategy utilizing non-pathogenic microorganisms and low-cost carbon substrates. Antifungal activity testing in in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated broad spectrum fungicidal activity against multiple fungal pathogens that cause diseases in cereals, fruit, and vegetable crops. The use of chemical fungicides produced from fossil fuels has been shown to have adverse environmental effects on non-target organisms, and mammals. In addition, combinations of chemical fungicides are required to attain crop protection, yet fungal pathogens quickly become resistant to chemical fungicides. The proposed broad spectrum biofungicide has no mammalian toxicity, and has been shown to be safe for non-target anthropods like honey bees. It also has been shown to not inhibit the growth of beneficial fungi. As part of the Phase I research plan, the aims are to scale up production and test the biofungicide under development in small plot trials.</AbstractNarration>

Chemical fungicides in corn and soybean and also in tomatoes and peppers are applied pre-emptively once and further applications are warranted only under significant disease pressure. The small plot trias for corn and soybean conducted in Farmer City, Illinois tested our fungicide against broad spectrum chemical fungicide Headline wherein it showed an increase in yield and better efficacy than Headline under low disease pressure. Similarly, in tomatoes and peppers trial conducted in Yuma AZ, our product was tested against a combination of chemical fungicides Ridomel and Quadris under medium disease pressure in which it&nbsp; performed&nbsp; better than the synthetic chemical fungicides while also increasing yield. In grape wine trials conducted in Davis, CA, our product was tested under significant disease pressure from powdery mildew. This trial included many of the copper based fungicide products that are on the market and are the mainstay of organic grape wine farming. Our biofungicide reduced disease severity to minimal levels compared to the untreated control and performed significantly better than all copper based fungicides approved for organic farming. This increased efficacy is even more remarkable in light of the fact that application of our fungicide was on a 14 day interval and at 250 ppm only comapred to 7 day interval and much higher application rate necessitated for copper. Our Phase I results are very promising in establishing the field scale efficacy of our product as a broad spectrum biofungicide for both organic and conventional agriculture.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/11/2018<br>      Modified by: Nadia&nbsp;Adam</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
