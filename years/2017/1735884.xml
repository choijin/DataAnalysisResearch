<AbstractNarration>Traditionally, scientists and water mangers have thought of the water system as a part of nature that humans act upon.  However, as the hydrological system becomes more variable and human demands on this system grow, a more integrated understanding is needed.   Human choices and institutions can fundamentally alter the natural water system.  In turn, water systems shape regional economic activity and the institutional systems that we devise to manage that water. To better manage the relationship of societies to their water resources, we must be able to conceptualize and model these interactions, both on the short and long run, and from the local to the global scale.  The broader impact of this workshop is to progress in our scientific understanding of interactions between human social systems and the physical systems, and support national security by ensuring that our water resources are managed in a way that is secure, resilient, and robust to the social and environmental changes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary workshop integrates research in the physical hydrology of water with research on the social, economic, and political management of water. Participants analyze how current research and methods used in the field can be extended to include dynamic feedbacks between the sociology and hydrology of water use and management. This workshop is organized around an innovative concept of research jams, in which small groups of participants brainstorm on how to extend and enrich concrete research projects.  The challenges and opportunities that participants identify in these focused "research jams" then inform the debates and conversations participants have in plenary sessions. Plenary sessions aim to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different theoretical frameworks and empirical methods, as well as identify some of the most critical questions for the field as a whole. This workshop will inspire new interdisciplinary projects within a rigorous theoretical framework of social and hydrological systems, provide participants ample time for rigorous discussion on their early stage research and contextualize this research within the broader goals of the field and offer the public a synthesis of the state-of-the-art and of the most exciting directions for the future of water-society interactions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[In this workshop, we brought together academic researchers from engineering, hydrology, economics, political science, hydrology, anthropology, history, and climate science.  These scholars included Ph.D. students, postdocs, junior and senior researchers, professors and scientists.  They came from universities around the world and the US National Laboratory system.  The goal of this workshop was to develop better strategies for understanding two way interactions between groups of people and water systems, ultimately improving our long term ability to understand and respond to water challenges.  People can profoundly influence the behavior of hydrological systems through land use change, irrigation, groundwater pumping, agriculture and forestry activities.  People are also very dependent on water, and so water availability, reliability, quality influence both individual behavior, and social structures.   Water systems are complex.  The physical aspects of water systems like surface water flow, groundwater, rainfall, runoff and flooding are usually studied by hydrologists.  Engineers design and study the pipes and levees that we use to move water around.  The more social aspects of water systems, like legal systems and consumption patterns are studied by economists, political scientists, anthropologists and historians.  In this workshop, we wanted to share perspectives on all of the water system, and that is why we invited researchers from so many different fields.  The need to manage water has played a fundamental role in organizing human societies, because water is a resource which can only be managed in a collective manner.  The physical infrastructure required to address problems of both water scarcity or water excess are all significantly larger than that which can be managed by a single person or household:  coordinated action is required.  From early agricultural use in Mesopotamia in the 4th millennium BC, irrigation canals on the Ganges river in the 4th century BCE, Bali water temples, Hohokam irrigation canals, and the dikes and levee systems to manage flooding in the Netherlands in the 8th century AD, the need to collectively manage water problems has driven innovation within human societies for millennia.  Modern-day water challenges such as the climate change exacerbated drought Cape Town, groundwater overdraft in India, and land use change driven flooding such as in Ellicott City MD, show that the need for innovation in water management institutions is still fully present today. Water challenges, both modern and historical show consistent characteristics.  Some water problems are centered around issues of water scarcity, such as groundwater overdraft, urban drought, and conflict over tradeoffs between environmental and economic water use.   Other characteristics problems are centered around the challenges that result from too much water, such as flood losses, and landslides, and finally, there are sets of problems around the quality of the water itself ? temperature, pollution, and mineral content.  We believe that that there are consistent theoretical strategies and empirical techniques for understanding the human/hydrological coupling in these different regimes of water-related challenges, centered around the characteristic problems that water management engenders rather than the different scientific domains which have historically studied individual aspects of these systems.  This leads to a focus on the adaptive capacity of a system, rather than a pure prediction of system dynamics.   Research in coupled social and hydrological systems can support better &amp; more sustainable water management.       Last Modified: 11/08/2018       Submitted by: Christa Brelsford]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
