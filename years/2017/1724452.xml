<AbstractNarration>Highly stretchable heat exchangers could dramatically improve current thermoregulatory garments used in emergency and medical applications, such as firefighting, hazardous material cleanup, and medically required thermoregulation.  These types of heat exchangers also would be the future basis for the thermal management of soft and wearable electronic technologies.  In many such applications, active liquid cooling would be needed to dissipate combined heat from the electronics and the user's body.  The fabrication of a stretchable, liquid cooled pad that could dissipate thermal loads only recently became possible due to the development of new classes of materials, such as hyperelastic liquid metal and elastomer composites.  An added benefit of stretchable heat exchangers is that stretching the material could remove fouling deposits that deteriorate the performance of such devices in many industrial settings, which would provide a cost-effective, environmentally friendly alternative to currently utilized chemical and scrubbing cleaning methods.  This research project aims to demonstrate a novel concept of soft heat exchangers that undergo shape change during operation and to develop a theoretical framework for prediction of their thermal performance. As part of this research project, semester-long "soft heat exchanger design challenge" class projects are being developed and assigned, which will increase the number of students involved in this research and accelerate the design and generation of soft, liquid cooled, wearable technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stretching will violate most assumptions used in design of conventional heat exchangers (e.g. constant areas and cross sections, heat transfer coefficients, and flow rates). Consequently, the design of soft heat exchangers requires development of new theoretical approaches for predicting their thermal performance. The primary hypothesis of this proposal is that quasi-static shape model can predict the thermal transport processes occurring within the device if its shape change occurs on a much longer time scale than the slowest heat transfer process (i.e., the device operates in the "gradual shape modulation regime"). Time scaling and the quasi-static shape models for single stream and concentric tube heat exchangers undergoing axial stretching and compression are being developed and tested experimentally. If the hypothesis is validated, then the quasi-static models can be used as a predictive tool to design devices operating in the gradual shape modulation regime. In case where the device operates in the "rapid shape modulation regime," in which time scales for the shape change are shorter or comparable to at least one heat transfer process, transient governing equations with moving boundary conditions are being solved. This research project serves as motivation for the development of theories for devices operating in this regime and provides preliminary experimental data for their validation.</AbstractNarration>
