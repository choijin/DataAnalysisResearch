<AbstractNarration>The 2018 CCES is a collaboration of over 50 different university research teams throughout the United States.   Collectively this group designs and fields a large sample survey of at least 50,000 American adults. The survey measures demographics, opinions, and attitudes.  The very large sample size allows researchers to have sufficient data to study states as well as the entire nation. The CCES, which started in 2006, makes available at very low cost a survey platform that is open to all.   Since its inception, the project has involved more than 100 different research teams and hundreds of faculty and student researchers, and it has conducted interviews with over 250,000 American adults. The data from this project are used widely by researchers, journalists, and members of the public to understand public opinion. Few, if any, data infrastructure ventures in the discipline can boast participation from as many institutions and scholars as CCES has facilitated. The survey helps to create and sustain a network of researchers interested in survey design and public opinion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2018 CSES is developed by a consortium of research teams.   Each research team that wishes to be involved in the project purchases a 1,000-person sample survey from the same firm.   Each individual team determines half of the questions on its survey. The other half of the content (Common Content) is created by a design committee, drawn from the participating teams.  Common Content consists of questions that every team would like to measure or questions that are of broad interest and require a very large sample.  The project, thus, fields as many surveys as there are teams and also produces a single large sample survey that consists of the Common Content.   The Common Content is designed by a committee in consultation with all teams involved in the survey.  The survey will be fielded over the Internet, with samples constructed to be nationally representative.  Each team will receive the data from its own 1,000-person survey and a dataset consisting of the 50,000+ observations from the Common Content survey.  Survey data are validated using comparisons of state level election results to the survey results from the subsamples for each state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The central goal of the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) is to create a survey-research infrastructure that is open to and facilitates the research of a large number of faculty and students from a wide range of academic institutions.  The CCES has helped universities and colleges that normally would not have been able to afford their own survey research programs to conduct original survey research and to be part of the infrastructure of this large-scale NSF-sponsored survey research project.  The 2018 CCES sought to conduct a massive survey project in order to measure public opinion in the United States on important issues, attitudes about political institutions, and electoral preferences and behaviors.   The project implemented (1) a 60,000-person sample Common Content survey -- the largest academic survey of the Americans' opinions and political behaviors -- and (2) Team Content surveys designed by each of 55 research teams involving from 60 different universities and research organizations.  The project involved a very wide range of universities across the United States, from Florida to Oregon (the University of Florida to Reed College), from Minnesota (University of Minnesota at Duluth) to Mississippi (University of Mississippi), and nearly every state in between.  The project produced the Common Content survey and 55 Team Content surveys, which are publicly available at the Harvard Dataverse.   As of May, 2021, there have been 21,268 downloads of the Common Content Survey.  The surveys were widely featured in media coverage of the election, and are a staple of academic research in Political Science.
