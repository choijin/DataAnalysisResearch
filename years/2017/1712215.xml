<AbstractNarration>The economic prosperity of the United States relies on progress in science, the advancement of national health initiatives, and overall national prosperity in an increasingly technical economy. This prosperity relies on a talented workforce with the ability to nimbly address new challenges and develop innovative technologies. The Common Problem Pedagogy project seeks to improve STEM teaching and learning through the integration of cross-disciplinary experiences and applied learning opportunities in ways that will strengthen STEM workforce preparation and produce a more STEM-literate public.  STEM faculty will partner with one or more colleagues from the arts and humanities to identify a community partner with a significant problem or issue relevant to their disciplines. Each faculty member will incorporate problem-based learning activities in their courses to address the problem. Interdisciplinary teams of students from their classes will work together, applying the perspectives and tools of inquiry from their respective disciplines, to develop potential solutions that will be presented to the community partner at the end of the semester.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be implemented on four SUNY Campuses: Cortland, Oneonta, Oswego, and Plattsburgh. The goals of the project are to demonstrate the effectiveness of Common Problem Pedagogy on student learning within STEM disciplines, to increase the number of STEM instructors proficient in this pedagogy, and to identify strategies for scaling up this methodology for large-scale adoption across the SUNY system and beyond. Thirty-two faculty members from the four campuses will participate in professional development opportunities to learn about the new pedagogy, implement it in their classes, and then evaluate the impact of this approach on the achievement of student learning outcomes related to problem-solving using interdisciplinary approaches. A train-the-trainer model will be adopted, whereby participating faculty members recruit additional faculty members to participate in future semesters. The principal investigators will gather data from participating faculty and community partners to identify challenges associated with implementing this method, and to evaluate students' success in working with community partners in cross-disciplinary teams to address meaningful, real-world problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  Collaborative Research: The Common Problem Pedagogy Project  Patricia Clark and Robert Card     Introduction     Common problem pedagogy (CP2) is a hands-on approach to learning that is multidisciplinary, exposes students to an ill-defined problem, and encourages them to envision and implement a solution to the issue. This grant set out to determine if students in STEM-related disciplines benefit from exposure to a variety of multidisciplinary experiences in a problem-based-learning project. These took various forms, including a shared assignment project&mdash;one that possessed a common element which could be approached from courses within different disciplines&mdash;as well as a research project and the more traditional team-taught course. The faculty involved in the overall project were members of diverse academic departments including Physics, Computer Science, Atmospheric and Geological Sciences, Sociology, Communication Studies, the Institute for Global Engagement, Modern Languages and Literature, and History.     Methodology     In order to examine the hypothesis that the critical thinking skills of students exposed to common problem pedagogy will improve by exposure to multidisciplinary inquiry and different modes of interpretation, students who participated in a project completed individual pre-and post-test essays. Students were asked in the pre-test to examine a complex problem and to provide the steps they would use to address the issue and decide upon the best possible solution. In the post-test, students are given the essay they wrote earlier in the semester and asked to reflect upon how their approach to problems and the process of solving problems has changed.     To maximize the gathering of meaningful comparative data, the measure of Organization was used to assess the structure of the organization of the approach in the pre-test and the articulation of the process of problem-solving when the student revisits the issue in the post-test. The attribute of Reflectivity refers to the depth of reflection on the outcome in the pre-test and to identification of valuable points of development in understanding in the post-test. The measure of Self-evaluation refers to the degree of self-awareness and ability to be critical of the strengths and weaknesses in the process of problem-solving in the pre- and post-test. The scores for each attribute were totaled within course sections, for each of the three different types of CP2 activities, and across all three types of projects. Scores for students who did not take both the pre-test and the post-test were not used.     Results     The first round of CP2 projects consisted of all three types of projects: team-taught course, research, and shared assignment. The findings from combining the results of all three types of projects in this round were the following:     Organization: Overall, 7% of students showed improvement in Organization.     Reflectivity: Overall, 47% of students showed improvement in Reflectivity.     Self-evaluation: Overall, 36% of students showed improvement in Self-evaluation.     The second round of projects involved only students in the shared assignment version and was truncated due to COVID-19 crisis. This data revealed the following findings:     Organization: Overall, 27% of students showed improvement in Organization.     Reflectivity: Overall, 68% of students showed improvement in Reflectivity.     Self-evaluation: Overall, 84% of students showed improvement in Self-evaluation.      The data gathered during the grant period suggests that organization is the most difficult measure for students to improve with a single exposure to a problem-based/ CP2 methodology. These results provide some support for the claim that the CP2 model strengthens students’ abilities to reflect on the issues at stake in a problem with appropriate depth (reflectivity) and to identify evolutions in their own thinking (self-evaluation)&mdash;two of the most important elements of critical thinking. It is not possible to state definitively that the CP2 pedagogical method is responsible for these observed changes, though this data does offer some support for the claim that this pedagogy enhances key aspects of critical thinking.
