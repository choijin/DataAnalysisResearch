<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Huichun J. Zhang of Temple University to examine the nitrogen-oxygen single bond (N-O) as a reducible functional group toward reductive transformations under environmental conditions.   The introduction of N-O containing contaminants (NOCs) into aquatic environments is an important emerging water issue.  This project aims to develop accurate environmental risk assessment of NOCs and to develop advanced technologies to effectively treat NOCs contaminated water and sites.  The findings are expected to help guide the chemical industry to design more environmentally-friendly chemical products.  The project is expected to broaden participation from underrepresented minorities and women in environmental chemistry/engineering and to provide training for future scientists and engineers in this cross-disciplinary area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on examining reduction kinetics and mechanisms of a diverse range of NOCs by soluble Fe(II) species through a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches.  Advanced experimental approaches, including kinetic, electrochemical cell, isotopic, spectroscopic and chromatographic approaches, are to be conducted to elucidate key elementary steps in NOC reductions, such as protonation, complexation, electron transfer and N-O bond cleavage.  The most likely rate-limiting step of each subset of NOCs is to be identified by characterizing all of the stationary points in the relevant elementary steps along the reaction pathway.  Molecular descriptors are being computed to develop quantitative structure-activity relationships so as to provide the community with quantifiable and experimentally grounded numbers that pertain to the susceptibility of N-O bonds to reductive cleavage in the environment.</AbstractNarration>

The nitrogen-oxygen single bond is found in a variety of chemical products including human and animal pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and explosives. For example, carbadox is a common feed additive for farm animals. The introduction of these chemicals into the environment is an important emerging water issue. One potential consequence is the wide-spread development of antibacterial resistance, which may soon leave us defenseless against many dangerous bacterial infections. Currently, these contaminants are not regulated mainly because there is a lack of knowledge of their potential risks.  Accurate risk assessment requires a good understanding of how persistent these contaminants are once they have been released to the environment because more persistent contaminants pose more threats.  Intellectual Merit  As the first comprehensive study to examine the nitrogen-oxygen single bond as a reducible functional group towards reductive transformation under environmental conditions, this project relied on a new combination of experimental (kinetics, electrochemical cell, isotope, spectroscopy and chromatography), quantum chemical and machine learning approaches. We obtained the reduction kinetics and byproducts of a diverse range of chemicals by soluble Fe(II) species as a representative environmental reductant, examined the reaction mechanisms, computed molecular descriptors that are indicative of the chemical reactivity, and developed quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) that will allow us to predict the reactivity of a much wider range of chemicals.  Our major findings include: i) several types of complexation between contaminants and the Fe(II) reductant can increase the reaction rates to different extents, with stronger complexation yielding much faster reductive reactivity, ii) the first electron transfer from the reductant to a contaminant is often limiting the overall reduction rate, iii) major reduction products form after the cleavage of the nitrogen-oxygen bond, and iv) the obtained QSARs capture variations in both chemical structures and reaction conditions such that we can predict the reductive reactivity of all possibly reducible chemicals under relevant environmental conditions.  Broader Impacts  The systematic examination of reduction of nitrogen-oxygen containing chemicals has created new information regarding the fate of these emerging contaminants in environmental systems, and thus moved a major step forward in incorporating redox transformation into environmental fate models. As a result, more realistic risk assessments can be conducted for many legacy and emerging contaminants. Results of this project have also advanced technologies to effectively treat contaminated water, soil and sediments.
