<AbstractNarration>The Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR) at the University of Colorado, Boulder, in collaboration with EcoArts Connections and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), is conducting an initial planning workshop and related activities which will be the first of three stepwise convenings over the next two or three years to gather experts from the fields of natural and social sciences, arts, energy/water conservation, and related disciplines. The initiative will work to establish an operational strategy for knowledge sharing across collaborating entities, networks, and associations.  The major goal is to strengthen collaboration of professionals nationally to better conceive, conduct, and evaluate projects for the public that work at the intersection of science, arts, and sustainability (environmental, social and economic). Many communities around the country have been seeking to address increasingly pressing problems about their ability to sustain the vitality, health and resilience of their regions and the lives of their residents.  Bringing inter-disciplinary knowledge and skills to bear on these issues is considered to be critical. Between 24 - 32 professionals will be involved. The workshop will be conducted simultaneously in Boulder, CO and at Princeton University, with communication between the two sites. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intended outcomes from this first workshop include: 1) identification and preliminary mapping of successful evidence-based best practices in science-arts-sustainability collaborations 2) a strategic vision for interdisciplinary collaboration across networks; and 3) an initial framework for the dissemination of findings that can reach across disciplines. Outputs include 1) preparation of a pre-workshop briefing booklet based in part on interviews of professionals in the various disciplines; 2) a post-workshop white paper; 3) a network of experts from the participating disciplinary fields; and 4) an agenda for the second (larger) convening. The trans-disciplinary strategy promises to more efficiently and effectively bring STEM disciplines to a wider public in collaboration with the arts through sustainability topics that are place-based, targeted to, and meaningful for specific audiences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="vert-spacing">The Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research in collaboration with EcoArts Connections and the National Center for Atmospheric Research brought together 39 natural and social scientists, artists, urban planners, ?sustainablists? (e.g. sustainability professionals working in a variety of fields), Indigenous Knowledge holders, and others in a planning workshop convening February 21-23, 2018 held simultaneously in two locations: at the University of Colorado in Boulder and at Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey. The convening was facilitated in each location by Johnny Fraser and Nezam Ardalan of NewKnowledge Organization for the first two days and by Alexis Frasz of Helicon the third day, and connected virtually.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The A2A Planning Workshop outlined an operational strategy for knowledge sharing to strengthen communities of practice nationally and to better conceive, conduct, and evaluate public projects working at the intersection of science, art, and sustainability. During the workshop, participants defined a shared vision for collaboration organized within three ?legs? or spheres of interest and action as follows.</p> <ol> <li><strong>Establishment      and Enhancement</strong> <strong>of      Networks </strong>including a support network and repository that can serve as      an information sharing system, communication forum, and community      organizing backbone for A2A.</li> <li><strong>Forging      Pathways</strong>, a strategy of identifying and exploring      gaps, challenging pedagogies, and identifying opportunities to engage with      groups, communities or problem conditions that could be engaged in the      community.</li> <li><strong>Think/Do      Labs</strong>, a participatory action series of place-based convenings      that bring network resources into areas seeking behavior change and      infrastructural shifts that enhance sustainability.</li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The workshop broke important ground by establishing a trans-sectoral convening that goes beyond a dyadic science-art dialogue to a triadic science-art-<em>sustainability</em> dialogue. A wealth of ideas and concepts emerged during the workshop itself, as part of a ?homework assignment? submitted by participants immediately after the workshop, and through activities following the workshop during a no-cost extension.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Project outputs included</strong> 1) a briefing booklet; 2) a white paper; 3) an informal network of experts; 4) a second convening, (the week-long Creative Climate Leadership program held at Biosphere 2 in Arizona, co-presented with EcoArts Connections, the University of Arizona-Tucson, and the Colorado European Center of Excellence, and led by Julie?s Bicycle); and 5) plans for a third convening in Boulder in 2021/22, preceded by a series of trans-sectoral challenge-centric online discussions. A2A also spawned an additional 7 workshops, panel discussions, poster sessions, and talks at local, state, national, and international science, arts, and science/arts conferences and meetings reaching in-person an additional 1,100+ scientists, artists, sustainablists, administrators, educators, communications specialists,&nbsp; funders, policy makers, and others.</p> <p>Moving toward environmental sustainability ? from personal behaviors and practices to much larger infrastructure and systems challenges that societies face ? is a global imperative.&nbsp; It is also the fundamental concept at the root of this project.&nbsp; Achieving a more sustainable world demands commitment and action from multiple players.&nbsp; Taking trans-sectoral and trans-disciplinary approaches to sustainability challenges can accelerate movement toward sustainability in ways that weave together diverse players and stakeholders ? especially unlikely partners ? to more quickly and easily build shared solutions.</p> <p>The A2A workshop was an extraordinary launching pad for new thinking and initiatives, some of which have been accomplished, with others yet to come. The project has highlighted both the barriers and benefits of this project?s goals. Directly following the workshop, for example, A2A participants enthusiastically listed more than 80 concrete ideas of where and how to take the work further. Feedback ranged from anticipated personal behavior changes to live more sustainably, to increased appreciation (especially by scientists and sustainablists) of the power of the arts as an allied force in climate change mitigation efforts., to artists understanding for the first time the importance of evaluating the impact of their work in relation to attitude and behavior change (not just whether the work was artistically ?good? or raised awareness).&nbsp;</p> <p>The workshop also led to a series of critical process impacts toward &nbsp;exploring network weaving methodology; the importance of social marketing and Indigenous worldviews to inspire paradigm shifts and systems change; and the specific work of conceptualizing a trans-sector challenge-centric online template and ?translation tool.? &nbsp;This tool, once fully realized, may have the potential to fundamentally change the efficacy, efficiency, and speed of successful trans-sectoral collaborations and problem solving, which are aimed at mitigating and/or adapting to climate change, among other sustainability challenges.</p> <p>A2A impacts have tremendous potential for reaching far beyond science and technology, in part because 1) disciplines and sectors well outside of science and technology were woven into the project as ?equally honored? collaborators looking for systemic change; 2) A2A participants and others recognize that the ?information deficit model? (that we just need to know more about climate change) is not enough; and 3) because A2A is premised on the widely-acknowledged need to bring together affect and cognition in order to accomplish the critical shift from awareness to action.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/27/2020<br>      Modified by: Marda&nbsp;W&nbsp;Kirn</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1746106/1746106_10510586_1606523832524_A2ABriefingBookletCover--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1746106/1746106_10510586_1606523832524_A2ABriefingBookletCover--rgov-800width.jpg" title="A2A Workshop Briefing Booklet"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1746106/1746106_10510586_1606523832524_A2ABriefingBookletCover--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="A2A Workshop Briefing Booklet"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The 36-page A2A Planning Workshop Briefing Booklet was created collaboratively by A2A workshop facilitators and organizers in advance of the February 2018 convening and was available to participants to contextualize the upcoming discussions and provide logistical information for the convening.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ardalan, N., Kirn, M., Wall, B.

Establishment      and Enhancement of      Networks including a support network and repository that can serve as      an information sharing system, communication forum, and community      organizing backbone for A2A. Forging      Pathways, a strategy of identifying and exploring      gaps, challenging pedagogies, and identifying opportunities to engage with      groups, communities or problem conditions that could be engaged in the      community. Think/Do      Labs, a participatory action series of place-based convenings      that bring network resources into areas seeking behavior change and      infrastructural shifts that enhance sustainability.               The workshop broke important ground by establishing a trans-sectoral convening that goes beyond a dyadic science-art dialogue to a triadic science-art-sustainability dialogue. A wealth of ideas and concepts emerged during the workshop itself, as part of a ?homework assignment? submitted by participants immediately after the workshop, and through activities following the workshop during a no-cost extension.

Moving toward environmental sustainability ? from personal behaviors and practices to much larger infrastructure and systems challenges that societies face ? is a global imperative.  It is also the fundamental concept at the root of this project.  Achieving a more sustainable world demands commitment and action from multiple players.  Taking trans-sectoral and trans-disciplinary approaches to sustainability challenges can accelerate movement toward sustainability in ways that weave together diverse players and stakeholders ? especially unlikely partners ? to more quickly and easily build shared solutions.  The A2A workshop was an extraordinary launching pad for new thinking and initiatives, some of which have been accomplished, with others yet to come.
