<AbstractNarration>EAGER: MOCVD Growth of a new wide-bandgap oxide semiconductor for Transistor Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical: Ga2O3 is a new wide-bandgap oxide semiconductor material which is anticipated to allow a 10 to 100x improvement in transistor power density over current high performance silicon carbide transistors.  The development of Ga2O3 for transistor applications will allow an unprecedented level of performance in applications that require high total continuous-wave power and efficiency. Solidstate lighting and solar energy harvesting are two areas that will directly benefit from the development of this technology.  High power density transistors are used to efficiently convert the direct current (DC) voltage generated by solar panels into alternating current (AC) power that can be feed into the existing grid.  Similarly, high power density transistors are used to control the DC current used to drive the light emitting diodes using in solid state lighting.  There are also applications for very these high power density transistors in the direct current (DC) power transmission lines that join different electrical grids across the globe.   In order to achieve these results the proposed fundamental study of (Al,In,Ga)2O3 materials for transistor applications is highly needed.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: The objective of this proposal is to study the metal organic chemical vapor deposition growth of â-Ga2O3 and related compounds such as â-(AlxGa1-x)2O3, â-(InxGa1-x)2O3, and â-(AlxInyGa1-x-y)2O3. This group has extensive experience in the growth of III-Nitrides'a similar wide bandgap material system and has recently shown promising results by applying that experience to the growth of Ga2O3.  We are proposing to undertake a 2 year comprehensive study of the material growth.  In addition to this fundamental study we will also apply the material improvements to the development of transistors based on this material system. The core elements of this project are: (1) development of a fundamental understanding of the metal organic chemical vapor deposition growth of â-(Al,In,Gay)2O3; (2) Demonstrating effective doping of this wide bandgap material; (3) Demonstration of the ability to realize high quality hetero-interfaces; (4) Using the doping and hetero-interface engineering to realize high mobility layers; and, (5) using all of that to demonstrate high performance transistors.  The principal investigator's background is extremely well matched to the proposed research, and all the required resources and expertise are available.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to study the MOCVD growth of Ga2O3 and related compounds.  This was accomplished by first developing a fundamental understanding of the metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) growth of Ga2O3 materials and then demonstrating effective p-type and n-type doping of this material.  These layers were then used to realize semiconductor devices such as transistors and metal-semiconductor-metal phot detectors.  One of the key technical outcomes of this project was the demonstration of amphoteric doping in Ga2O3. We developed a novel way to vary the MOCVD growth conditions to control whether silicon substitutes for the Group-III or Group-VI atom, thus allowing for silicon to amphotericly act as either act as a n-type, or p-type dopant, respectively.  The development of a means to effectively dope Ga2O3, let alone to achieve both p-type and n-type with the same dopant has the potential to be a transformative breakthrough for this developing material system and will facilitate numerous applications in the future as this material matures.  Prior to this there were few if any methods of effectively achieving p-type Ga2O3.   A second key technical outcome was the demonstration of Ga2O3-based solar-blind photodetectors. We were able to use Ga2O3 layers to create metal-semicondcutor-metal (MSM) photodetectors with a peak responsivity at 261 nm with a maximum EQE of 41.7% for a -2.5 V bias. I/V curves, both with and without xenon back-illumination, revealed a photocurrent about 3 orders of magnitude higher than the dark current at -5 V.  These Ga2O3 photodetector were well-suited for solar blind detection with almost no solar or visible response.  A final key technical outcome was the demonstration of Ga2O3-based transistors n-type and p-type layers were fabricated into various metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFET).  The fabricated transistors were then tested and achieved complete pinch off with very high breakdown voltages, low gate leakage currents.  In addition to the key technical outcomes above, this work has supported the education and mentorship of four undergraduate students, one graduate student, and two post-doctoral scholars.  They gained valuable experience as part of  the mentorship program developed as part of this grant.  They also were co-authors on seven peer-reviewed journal articles which made significant contributions to the body of scholarly work       Last Modified: 12/07/2019       Submitted by: Manijeh Razeghi]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
