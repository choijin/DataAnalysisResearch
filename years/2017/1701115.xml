<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the Wi-Rhythm, a suite of WiFi algorithms for wireless local area networks that uses distributed scheduling to avoid interference between users in dense deployments. It fills the need for higher performing wireless networks in residences, enterprises, and industries relying on internet-of-things (IoT) technologies. The Wi-Rhythm suite of algorithms is important because WiFi routers enabled with them will better serve environments with high-density deployments such as those expected with IoT (e.g. factories), mixed-use networks where high-priority traffic needs to be protected from low-priority traffic (e.g. homes), and public environments where there is likely to be a high-degree of WiFi heterogeneity (e.g. office buildings).   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in software and hardware for Wi-Rhythm enabled wireless routers, software and hardware for Wi-Rhythm enabled clients, performance measurements for Wi-Rhythm operating in different environments, cost analysis, and a list of compatible devices on which Wi-Rhythm could be deployed. The Wi-Rhythm suite of algorithms will allow WiFi networks to operate in a scheduled fashion and tackle a variety of practical challenges including the presence of non-backlogged nodes, partial connectivity, backward compatibility, power-saving related sleeping, and schedule changes. These capabilities provide the following advantages: higher throughput performance, more precision in service, better energy efficiency, and the deployment of arbitrary scheduling algorithms on the fly, when compared to the leading competing solutions such as those offered by Cisco, Juniper, Brocade, and Huawei in this market space.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: design and proof of concept for how Wi-Rhythm can be deployed on off-the-shelf WiFi devices including wireless routers and client devices, and how Wi-Rhythm can be deployed in scenarios with different degrees of adaptability. Specifically, the research will explore and address issues pertaining to design, performance, scalability, cost, presence of legacy nodes, compatibility, and generality. Possible issues with time synchronization, register settings, computational constraints, and memory usage will be addressed. Fine-tuning of the Wi-Rhythm algorithm parameters will be performed, and a hierarchical system architecture to address scalability problems will be developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, personnel involved in this project, including doctoral and master's students, will receive innovation and entrepreneurship experiences through both Georgia Tech classes and the Georgia Tech Venture Lab commercialization process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages the Georgia Tech Venture Lab to help in the process of accelerating the technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Market related commercialization efforts:     Target market identification: Through market research and customer discovery, this project has identified the industrial internet of things (IIoT) domain as the target market because of its unique attributes in terms of density and need for performance including throughput, delay, quality of service, and energy consumption.     Market sizing: The IIoT domain itself is quite large reaching approximately $1T by the year 2025. Thus, it is critical that a smaller segment within the IIoT domain be identified as the ini- tial beachhead market. We have identified the total addressable market (TAM), the serviceable addressable market (SAM), the serviceable obtainable market (SOM), and a further beachhead within the SOM. Specifically, the beachhead we have identified is the logistics industry and specifically asset tracking for the logistics industry.     Business thesis and business model canvas: In order to flesh out aspects of the business model, the project has completed the business model canvas. Starting with a simple business thesis, the project evolves it to complete the business model canvas.     Competitive analysis: Finally, the project has researched the competitive landscape and identify key competitors and competitive products for Wi-Rhythm. It is shown as to why Wi-Rhythm has a distinct advantage over the competitive products.           Product/Technology related commercialization efforts:   COTS platform identification: The project identifies OpenWrt as the target COTS platform for implementation of the Wi-Rhythm solution. Through an extensive analysis of the Open-Wrt software stack, the project outcomes include the design of the architecture for how Wi-Rhythm can be implemented on OpenWrt.   Proof of concept on COTS hardware: The project implements a proof of concept implemen- tation on OpenWrt to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing Wi-Rhythm on COTS hardware. It specifically narrows down the contention window manipulation as the core build-ing block that is critical for the implementation of Wi-Rhythm and use it for the proof of concept.   Verification of COTS implementation: Finally, the project verifies the COTS implementation by measuring performance metrics in an experimental set up and show that the implementation achieves the desired results.
