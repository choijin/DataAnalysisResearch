<AbstractNarration>An award is made to Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois to provide instrument-based research training and hands-on classroom experimentation for undergraduate students through the acquisition of a Scanning Electron Microscope with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy. The new instrument will help to prepare students in Environmental Studies, Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Neuroscience for more advanced science degrees and research careers. The instrument will also be available for use by local community college students and faculty for additional scientific training and data acquisition. In addition, the new instrument will be used for outreach into local K-12 classrooms via remote image access as well as through Knox's yearly summer youth program, College 4 Kids. Through these outreach activities, the project will increase area students' interest and confidence in studying the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research uses of the instrument will be many and will vary across disciplines, with researchers from multiple departments at Knox and Monmouth Colleges making use of new capabilities including digital image capture, higher-resolution imaging, automated stage rotation, and elemental analysis. Research uses will include imaging newly-created hydrogels for characterization, examining fern gametophyte development and glial cell morphology, performing elemental analysis of archaeological ceramics and wetland rocks for the purposes of sourcing and interpreting environments of deposition, capturing images for 3D-printing of fish jaws, as well as digital imaging of microscopic invertebrates from soils and other environments. Researchers will be able to accurately image, measure and share data from a variety of microscopic samples, vastly increasing data accessibility as well as our understanding of small-scale processes across the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

Co-PI Penick has conducted preliminary investigations of glial cells using the SEM, involving one student researcher; Monmouth College Senior Personnel Engstrom was trained on the instrument but has not had the chance to begin a research program due to pandemic-related visitor restrictions at Knox College. A total of 9 individual students have had hands-on access to the instrument as part of these research initiatives; 4 of these research students have graduated from Knox College. Of these graduates, 3 have gone on to graduate programs and one is applying to medical school. Additionally, results from these research initiatives were presented at several scientific meetings; these projects resulted in 4 student presentations and 1 faculty presentation at regional and national conferences. A number of students have utilized the SEM as part of hands-on laboratory activities over the grant period through curricular offerings in Biology and Environmental Studies, with a combined enrollment of 173 student seats over four academic trimesters.
