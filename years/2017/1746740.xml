<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the first time commercial development of a copper cable which can transmit and store energy. Currently, copper cables are used for transmitting electricity. Adding energy storage capability to these cables is transformative and has the potential to be employed in a myriad of electrical and electronic applications. Making these cables into spools of wires and custom sliced into a certain length to achieve a required capacitance will be very attractive to commercial applications. The proposed study enables to understand how energy transmission and storage can be simultaneously performed without mutual interference. These cables can find niche applications in the automotive, energy, defense, and IT industries. Moreover, when made into thin wires, it can be weaved into a matrix which can be used to charge wearable devices. For example, currently, a soldier carries about 30-40 pounds of battery for a three-day mission. However, if energy storage devices like the one proposed here can be made into an advanced textile form and can be worn as a uniform, the weight currently carried by the soldiers can be considerably reduced. A cable energy storage device developed can also be beneficial for storing energy for clean-energy technologies such as wind and solar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project fills the gap of a cable-type capacitor which saves space and fits well with electrical and electronic devices. The objective of this proposal is to use nanotechnology-based fabrication techniques to grow nanowhiskers with a high surface area on a copper cable to make cable-type capacitors. These nanostructures considerably enhance the surface area necessary for the storage of electrical charges. Since nanostructures are developed only on the outside of the electrical cable to store energy, the inner part of the cable can still be used for electrical transmission. The focus of the proposed research is to develop the processes which can be used to make these nanostructured electrodes into a cable capacitor. The fabrication techniques for growing nanostructures will be so designed that making long lengths of the cables are feasible. The performance of the cable-based capacitors will be tested in terms of capacitance, cycle life, voltage output, etc. In addition, the flexibility of the cable will be tested at different bend-angles to evaluate its applications in flexible energy storage applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes  This project's focus was to develop a commercially viable wire-shaped energy storage device with the performance of a supercapacitor. The project was a success in terms of meeting the goals of the project, completing initial commercialization of the technology including initial sales, and established Capacitech Energy as a viable startup in the Central Florida region.   This working and viable technology has helped Capacitech attract early adopting customers to generate initial revenue in 2019, investors to continue the commercialization process, and was able to win several competitions since this project started.  Achievements include:   Being named a top 30 energy storage startup in the world  Generating initial revenue in 2019 Securing strong letters of support from Mouser Electronics, UMA Solar, and MTG Electronics  A manufacturing design for the product, with a prototype production line using table top tools, capable of producing 50 units per day  Attracting major investors in New World Angels to lead a round closing in Jan. 2020 for &gt;$250k Acceptance to New York University Endless Frontiers Program  Multiple third party evaluations of the CBC including one by NXP Semiconductor and Pecan Street Testing    The ultimate result of this project, despite being awarded only a phase I grant, is the initial commercialization of a wire-shaped supercapacitor to the point of initial revenue. Larger orders are being prepared for in 2020.      Impact  The wire-shaped energy storage device represents a major innovation in an industry that has focused on marginally reducing the size and cost of their products by focusing on the form factor of the capacitor rather than the sole focus on the materials inside the capacitor.   The wire-shaped form factor enables this energy storage device to be integrated into the wiring infrastructure of the world providing brownout / blackout protection for connected equipment, improving their performance, and in some cases reducing the size and/or cost of the system by 33%.   The wire-shaped energy storage device resulting from this project will initially be used in residential solar power systems to provide backup energy when clouds pass overhead the solar panels and to provide additional power when the load demands it. This will complement the power electronics, maximum power point tracking devices, and batteries.   Future applications for the wire-shaped energy storage device includes integration with other systems that require batteries or capacitors such as drones, information technology power systems such as Power Over Ethernet, electric vehicles, and other opportunities in the coming technology revolutions.
