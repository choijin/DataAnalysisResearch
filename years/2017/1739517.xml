<AbstractNarration>In Cyberphysical Systems (CPS) such as large scale infrastructure systems, individual users are shifting from being passive consumers of services to active participants. This shift promises societal, economic, and environmental benefits. For example, turning consumers into "prosumers" through distributed renewable energy integration can improve sustainability, and turning users into sources of data about traffic and road conditions can help alleviate congestion. However, an explosion of decision makers also leads to heterogeneity in concerns, aims, and quality of decision making. Participants will optimize their decisions on data collection, data sharing, and actuation based on their own self-interest. In an interconnected system, these decisions will affect the system state, and hence, the utilities other participants derive from the system. In extreme cases, undesirable and unintended consequences such as instability can also ensue from actions of a few decision makers. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand and modulate decision making by various participants so that they internalize the impact on system performance and utilities of the other participants that their decisions produce; the proposed research solves basic problems in this domain. The proposed research has potentially substantial social and economic impact. The general trend in CPS systems, such as infrastructure systems, is to allow users to become active participants. However, this will challenge the traditional algorithms and organization for such systems. Since most CPS systems provide basic services to the population, designs that guarantee reliable operation in spite of strategic behavior of self-interested participants are needed. The research is coupled with an education plan that includes integration of research and education, curriculum design, student advising and training, as well as outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing approaches such as cooperative control or competitive game theory in which participants are price takers are insufficient to consider strategic behavior by participants. Motivated by this observation, this proposal will advance the science of CPS by (i) abstracting this problem into one of designing contracts by which the decisions of strategic users, who may anticipate the effect of their actions and misreport any information, can be aligned to obtain desired system performance, (ii) presenting new mechanisms for this model under several assumptions inspired by large scale CPS such as smart infrastructure systems, and (iii) demonstrating the efficacy of this framework by applying it to several CPS case studies. The proposed approach couples optimization and systems theory with economics and mechanism design as well as models and constraints from specific infrastructure systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project seeks to design incentives to induce desirable behavior by  participants in a class of large-scale, distributed cyber physical systems (CPS). Specifically, this project (i) uses a contract design framework to model the interaction among strategic decision makers, who may anticipate the effect of their actions and may misreport any information to optimize their own utility functions, in cyber physical systems with the goal of aligning their decisions to obtain desired system performance, (ii) develops new solutions under this framework for several assumptions about possible information asymmetries inspired by smart infrastructure systems, and (iii) demonstrates the efficacy of this framework by applying it to several case studies from large-scale CPS systems. This framework  applies to a variety of CPS systems and for different concerns such as efficiency and security.  The main outcomes of this project are described as follows.  The majority of our work has been on contract design formulated as a principal-agent problem, focusing on (1) alleviating moral hazard, and (2) dealing with risk dependencies.  The problem is primarily set in the context of contracts designed to transfer risks from the agent to the principal, with a goal to mitigate moral hazard.  Moreover, the problem is set in the context of cybersecurity risk, so the risks different agents are exposed to are inherently interconnected and interdependent, which adds a twist to standard principal-agent formulations.  The fundamental question is how to design these contracts to take into account risk dependency, and more specifically, how to use the contracts as an instrument to incentivize the agents to exert desirable levels of effort that affect everyone else, in addition to being an instrument of risk transfer.  To mitigate moral hazard, a widely employed concept is premium discrimination, i.e., an agent/insured who exerts higher effort pays less premium. This, however, relies on the insurer's ability to assess the effort exerted by the insured. Two methods of premium discrimination that rely on two different types of assessment are pre-screening and post-screening. Pre-screening occurs before the insured enters into a contract and can be done at the beginning of each contract period; the result of this process gives the insurer an estimated risk on the insured, which then determines the contract terms. The post-screening mechanism involves at least two contract periods whereby the second-period premium is increased if a loss event occurs during the first period.   The main conclusions from our study are: (1) Pre-screening of existing effort levels of the agents and their assessed risks (even if the assessment is noisy) can help mitigate the issue of moral hazard, (2) the risk dependency offers a "profit opportunity" for the principal to simultaneously incentivize higher levels of effort from the agents and to extract higher profit by joining design these contracts; as a direct consequence of this, the overall level of effort is higher under this type of contract design, and (3) while both post-screening and pre-screening are generally effective in mitigating moral hazard, their differences are more nuanced when loss events are rare.  Specifically, post-screening is not effective at all with rare losses, while pre-screening can be an effective method when the agent perceives them as rarer than the insurer does; in this case pre-screening improves both the agent's effort level and the insurer's profit.  In a related effort on incentivizing efforts from distributed but interdependent agents, we examined the impact of allowing agents to "pool" their resources, i.e., allowing them to not only exert effort for themselves but to exert effort (invest in) on behalf of other agents in the system, and showed that the resulting strategic interactions lead to higher effort and utility for each agent as well as the social welfare.  This project develops core mathematical foundations, theory and algorithms at the intersection of game theory, control and optimization, engineering design, and economics. The problem considered is a prototypical example that arises in a  variety of contexts such as cyber-security, smart grid, and crowdsensing.  Our work on contract design with dependent risks has the potential to transform the practice in cyber risk management, particularly in the form of using cyber insurance as a way to transfer, control, and mitigate significant organizational risks.
