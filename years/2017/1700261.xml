<AbstractNarration>The term, "Integrable Systems," usually refers to mathematical objects, most often differential equations, with special symmetry properties that allow them to be studied in a very detailed way and sometimes even to solve them in a closed form.  The class of integrable systems includes several fundamental equations of nature and the mathematical foundations of integrable systems go back to classical works of Liouville, Gauss, and Poincare.  Currently, the theory of integrable systems has become an expanding area which plays an increasingly important role as one of the principal sources of new analytical and algebraic ideas for many branches of modern mathematics and theoretical physics.  Simultaneously, it provides an efficient analytical tool for the study of some of the fundamental  mathematical models arising in modern nonlinear science and technology.  In addition to the traditional domain of differential equations, integrable techniques are becoming common in  such diverse fields as orthogonal polynomials, string theory, enumerative topology, statistical mechanics, random processes, quantum informatics, and number theory.  Many of the problems considered in the project have direct connections with these disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project continuous the principal investigator's long term research efforts in the theory of integrable systems. The principal goal of the project is to address the following two directions which have emerged from  recent developments in random matrix theory and in the theory of exactly solvable quantum models: (a) The study of  the isomonodromic tau functions, their asymptotics, Fredholm determinant representations and their relations to the conformal  field theory; (b) The asymptotic analysis of Toeplitz, Hankel, and Fredholm determinants arising in the study of critical phenomena in random matrices and statistical mechanics.  Each of these directions is represented by a collection of concrete problems, and they will be investigated within the same analytical framework, viz., the Riemann-Hilbert method.  The main focus of the first direction is on the long standing question of evaluation the asymptotic connection formulae, including the constant pre-factors,  for the generic families of Painleve tau functions. The principal concern  of the second direction is various types of double scaling and transitional limits - topics which are among the principal questions in both the theory of random matrices and in  statistical mechanics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    INTELECTUAL MERIT  The proposed project is a continuation of the PI's long term research efforts in the theory of integrable systems and their numerous applications.   The term ``Integrable Systems''  usually refers to mathematical objects,  most often differential equations, with  special  symmetry properties   which allow to study  them in a very detailed way and sometimes even  to solve them  in a closed form. The class of integrable systems includes   several fundamental equations of nature, and the mathematical foundations  of integrable systems go back to classical works of Liouville, Gauss, and  Poincare. The methods of the theory of integrable systems  are used now in  such diverse fields  as orthogonal polynomials,  string theory,  enumerative topology, statistical mechanics, random processes,   quantum informatics,  and number theory. Many of the  problems which  was considered in the project   have direct connections  with these disciplines.    The project  was devoted to the investigation of  the  various  new  analytical questions  of the theory of integrable systems which have  emerged from  recent developments in random matrix theory and in  the theory of exactly solvable quantum models. The main focus of the  project was on the new problems related to the Toeplitz, Hankel,  and Fredholm determinants and to the new problems associated with  the  special class of functions known as Painlev\'e transcendents.   Toeplitz, Hankel and Fredholm determinants  form a traditional  analytical apparatus  of the statistical and quantum mechanics.  Painlev\'e  functions were introduced in mathematical  analysis at  the turn  of  the last century and, starting from the middle  of the century, have gradually became one of the  the principal analytical tools  of mathematical physics.  Indeed, the Painleve functions are dubbed as  the ``special functions of the XXIst century''.  Here are the  main achievements  of this three year research  program.  (a) The  complete solution of the connection problem for the  general families of the Painlev\'e VI and Painlev\'e II tau functions was obtained (together with O. Lisovyy and A. Prokhorov). Also, a very interesting   relation between the tau function  and the classical  Hamiltonian action  for all six Painlev\'e equations was established (together with A. Prokhorov).   The essence of this relation is that the differential forms corresponding to the classical action and tau function differ by a total differential. This  remarkable  fact allows one to simplify dramatically the evaluation of  a number of important  physical characteristics in many  statistical and quantum models which are described by the Painlev\'e  transcendents.  (b) The asymptotic analysis of Toelitz + Hankel determinants arising in  several physical applications   has been reduced to a model 4x4   Riemann-Hilbert problem on the unit circle  (jointly with R. Gharakhloo).   A few important particular cases,  when an explicit solution of this   Riemann-Hilbert  is possible, have been identified. For these cases,   the  asymptotic description of the associated Toepitz + Hankle  determinants is available in closed form up to some technical issues  that remain to be resolved.    (c) The classical Strong Szego theorem in the theory of Toeplitz  determinants has been extended (jointly with E. Basor, R. Gharakhloo,  and T. Ehrhardt)  to the so-called bordered  Toeplitz determinants.   The latter object is a certain generalization of the  Toeplitz determinants   which appear  in the theory of Ising model. The result has been applied to  rigorous evaluation of the long distance behavior of the next-to-diagonal   two point correlation function in the model.    BROADER IMPACT    The results concerning the new Hamiltonian properties of the   isomonodromic tau functions are expected to make strong impact into   the development of the general theory of ``nonlinear''  special functions   and in the establishin the connection of the monodromy theory of   linear differential  systems to the exactly solvable quantum and   conformal field theories.  This connection might  be  relevant   to the so-called ODE/IM correspondence  or even to   geometric   Langlands  correspondence - one of the most  fascinating questions of modern math.  The results of the PI and his collaborators concerning  the asymptotic  analysis of Toeplitz and Hankel determinants contribute to the study   of critical phenomena  in statistical mechanics - an enduring, fundamental  problem in the field. Specifically, the analog of the  Strong Szego Theorem  for bordered Toeplitz determinants obtained by the PI and  his collaborators   is expected to give a new powerful analytical  tool in the theory of  Ising model arguably the  most celebrated exactly solvable model of  statistical mechanics.    During the entire period of the award, the  PI has been engaged in many educational activities: he has given two mini-courses  - one in Japan and another one in France, has   supervised  two graduate students   (both successfully defended their PhDs in 2019 and are now postdoctoral  fellows). During the same period, the PI has given in total 16 other  invited  presentation and published   9   research papers  in the major  refereed  journal. Also, the PI  has been serving (and is continuing to serve)  as  a co-organizer of important international scientific events.   More activities had been planned for the Spring-Summer of 2020 but  cancelled  because of the COVID-19 outbreak.
