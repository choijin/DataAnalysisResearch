<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel and lodging support for participants in a Workshop on Schubert Calculus, to take place May 9-12, 2018, at the Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.  The topic of the conference has its origins in 19th century enumerative geometry, when mathematicians computed numbers of geometric figures satisfying various conditions.  The subject grew into a testing ground for Intersection Theory, which is now a cornerstone of modern mathematics.  This workshop will bring together researchers and students coming from different backgrounds, to present various points of view on the subject of Schubert Calculus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large part of Schubert Calculus concerns the cohomology rings of Grassmannians and flag manifolds, as well as their generalizations. The subject has deep connections to combinatorics, representation theory, and algebraic geometry, and the last 15 years have seen remarkable developments in the techniques of Schubert Calculus.  A guiding problem is to find combinatorial formulas for the multiplication of Schubert classes in flag varieties; several new cases of this problem were solved.  New research has extended our understanding of Schubert calculus to the infinite-dimensional affine (and Kac-Moody) flag varieties, simultaneously deepening the connection with representation theory.  Major goals of this conference include sharing new results and introducing a new generation of students to the techniques, applications, and open problems in the field. More details about the workshop are available at https://people.math.osu.edu/anderson.2804/schub2018.html.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Schubert calculus concerns the cohomology rings of Grassmannians and flag manifolds, as well as their generalizations.  The subject dates back to the 19th-century work of H. Schubert in enumerative geometry --- whose aim is to count special configurations of points, lines, and other geometric figures.  It has since found deep connections to combinatorics, representation theory, and algebraic geometry.  Approximately 65 researchers and students gathered for 4 days for this Midwest Workshop on Schubert Calculus in Columbus, Ohio.  NSF funds provided travel and lodging support to participants, with priority given to junior reserachers and students.  The last 15 years have seen remarkable developments in the techniques of Schubert calculus, many of which were showcased at this event.  The intellectual merit was in evidence not only in the research presented by speakers --- who discussed new progress in Schubert polynomials, combinatorics of symmetric functions, K-theory of flag varieties and degeneracy loci, among other topics --- but also in the discussions between talks.  At least two problems posed in talks were solved by researchers attending the conference.  A key goal of this workshop was to introduce students and younger researchers to the tools of Schubert calculus, and their many applications.  To this end, the workshop began with a day of expository lectures, which introduced core ideas of Schubert calculus.  This component broadened the event's impact by introducing junior participants to an active research area with numerous open problems.   The workshop helped foster a vibrant research community in Schubert calculus.   Participants came primarily from the Midwest and Northeast, with a few from the Pacific Northwest.  The conference featured breaks for informal collaboration and individual mentoring activities.  Over 30% of the invited participants were women, ranging from graduate students to leading researchers.  The list of speakers was chosen with a view toward diversity of both gender and career status.       Last Modified: 03/01/2019       Submitted by: David E Anderson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
