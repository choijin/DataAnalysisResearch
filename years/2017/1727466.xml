<AbstractNarration>The proposed project will support students and teachers, as well as Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and Native Alaskan college students (at both undergraduate and graduate levels) to participate in challenging and inspiring conference activities taking place at the 2017 International Microwave Symposium (IMS), which will be held in Hawaii Convention Center, Honolulu, HI, June 4-9, 2017. Support will be provided for an educational program called IMS Connect which was initiated at the 2014 IMS Symposium held in Tampa, FL, continued to be offered in follow-up events and will be expanded further this year. The proposed work will focus on exposing middle and high-school students and their teachers, as well as college students through the STEM Experiences for Students and Teachers Project, to exciting opportunities related to broad technology areas such as electronics and communications.  The students will learn about the science and engineering aspects related to the RF and Microwave field, including various aspects related to components, circuits, electromagnetic approaches, and novel concepts in high frequency techniques from microwaves to millimeter-waves and Terahertz. The project will assist in enhancing the recruitment and retention within STEM disciplines such as Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), with broader impacts on improving the engineering workforce base, with commensurate economic benefits to the country.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[         IMS Connects is an innovative STEM conference model that expands the impact of a traditional conference experience by providing encounters between a young, diverse pool of students, STEM teachers, STEM professionals, processes, and products in an international forum. In 2017, the IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society (MTT-S) International Microwave Symposium (IMS) was held in Honolulu, Hawai?i from June 4-9, 2017. IMS Connects consisted of two educational components: the one-day IMS2017 STEM Experience for Students and Teachers (IMS2017 STEM S&amp;T) and the four-day IMS2017 Project Connect.              IMS2017 STEM S&amp;T's overarching goal was to introduce a diverse and highly motivated group of middle and high school teachers and students to the world of microwave engineering by means of a carefully structured range of intensive STEM experiences. It was the program intention for this immersion to fuel the curiosity, inspiration, and commitment needed to give next-generation STEM professionals the best opportunities for success. Objectives of IMS2017 STEM S&amp;T were as follows:  Introduce middle and high school students and teachers to microwave engineering and technology through a STEM-focused "day at a conference" experience. Create student and teacher experiences that demonstrate how science and engineering can help address major technological and social challenges confronting our society. Provide engaging experiences, such as a tour of the exhibition floor (including high school and middle school participant exhibits), hands-on activities, and impactful interactions with the technical speakers and professionals that have come together for IMS2017. Help teachers understand the applications, skill sets, and personal traits needed to empower their current and future students to succeed as future members of an advanced STEM workforce.       IMS2017 STEM S&amp;T hosted 111 students and teacher participants, including 102 students and teachers from Hawai?i middle and high schools on the islands of O?ahu, Moloka?i, Hawai?i, and Maui, and seven out-of-state students from Arizona-USA, Maryland-USA, Pennsylvania-USA, Texas-USA, Canada, Germany, and Italy. Of the 79 students attending, 42 (53%) were girls and 37 (47%) were boys.   IMS2017 STEM S&amp;T included unique socio-cultural aspects of Hawaiian history and tradition. The event opened with a special Hawaiian oli (chant) presented by haumana (students) and a kumu (teacher from the ?O Hina I ka Malama, Moloka?i Middle School?s Hawaiian Language Immersion Program), respectfully welcoming all participants and wishing them a fruitful learning experience.      Project Connect is an educational outreach program that was first demonstrated during IMS2014 in Tampa, Florida, with partial support from NSF. The program has continued at every IMS since then. The primary objective of Project Connect is to increase the participation of college-level students from underrepresented minorities in IMS, and better prepare them for careers in science and engineering, particularly those overlapping the fields of interest of IMS. The program structure is developed to lead to increased involvement in undergraduate research, interest in graduate school, improve career participation in electrical engineering and/or microwave engineering, and enhance long-term professional success.      IMS2017 Project Connect accepted and invited 10 students out of 24 applications. There were 5 undergraduate students (50% of the total, of whom 4 were female and 1 was male), and 5 graduate students (50% of the total, of whom 3 were female and 2 were male). Thus, 70% of the participants were female, and the remaining 30% were ethnically diverse males. The females were African American (1), Hispanic (1), and Caucasian (5). The males were Hispanic (3).      IMS2017 Project Connect students had the opportunity to engage in activities involving Hawaiian culture through a M?lama H?loa, where they were able to experience and learn about kalo (taro) and other traditional Native Hawaiian sustainability practices.
