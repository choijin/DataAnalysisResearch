<AbstractNarration>Ribosomes are one of the largest molecular structures present in every cell of life and their size is highly correlated with organism complexity. Composed of both ribosomal protein and ribosomal RNA, ribosomes are the molecular machines that translate information encoded on messenger RNAs into functional proteins that perform processes essential to life. The unique ribosomal sequences, structures, and interactions of all of life?s organisms has made it a major focal point for antimicrobials. The known 3-dimensional structures of many ribosomes from across the tree of life will be used in this project to document the atomic characteristics of hundreds of thousands of atoms that comprise the ribosome to understand why the size of the ribosome is so highly correlated to species complexity and how their differences can be used to design new antimicrobials. This project will be conducted at the National Taiwan University under the guidance of Assistant Professor Dr. Chiaolong Hsiao who did his PhD thesis under the guidance of Professor Dr. Loren Williams who is currently the PhD advisor for the researcher of the proposed project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The peptidyl-transferase and decoding centers of the ribosome are the catalytic components of the ribosome responsible for the formation of peptide bonds and reading mRNA, respectively. These catalytic centers are composed of the most evolutionary ancient components of the ribosome; all other ribosomal components accreted onto their surface as the ribosome and life evolved. The evolutionary process of the ribosome can be seen in the structures of extant species; multi-cellular eukaryotes have the largest ribosomes, within their structure is the ribosome of single-cellular eukaryotes, which contains the structure of the smallest ribosome belonging to prokaryotes. The projects database will consist of sequence, structure, and molecular interactions of ribosomal proteins which the researcher will then use to analyze how the ribosome evolved. The database will also serve as a foundation for observing differences in ribosome structures that could be exploited for the development of new antimicrobials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan.</AbstractNarration>

In the last two decades, structures of complete ribosomal particles have been determined from organisms from across the tree of life. The ribosomal structures have revealed that all organisms contain a common core of ribosomal RNA and protein in the interior that is near identical in structure in every organism observed. The peripheries of the ribosome differ between organisms. The size of the ribosome within organisms follows the progression from smallest to largest: prokaryote &lt; unicellular eukaryote &lt; multicellular eukaryote &lt; mammalian and has led to the model that the evolution of life mirrored the evolution of the ribosome; as the ribosome grew in complexity over evolutionary time, so did the complexity of the organisms.</p> <p>This study analyzes the molecular interactions of the structure&nbsp;of ribosomes belonging to organisms across the tree of life to reveal similarities and differences that will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of protein evolution. Within the common core of the ribosome, most ribosomal proteins do not form any interactions with other ribosomal proteins and those that do have very small interfaces. In portions of the ribosome found only in prokaryotes, each ribosomal protein contacts on average 1 other ribosomal protein and the interface between the two is larger than those found in the common core. In portions of the ribosome found only in unicellular eukaryotes, ribosomal proteins form on average more than 2 interactions with other ribosomal proteins to form interaction networks.
