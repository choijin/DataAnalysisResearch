<AbstractNarration>In this project the PI will perform research in algorithm design and analysis of high order accurate and efficient numerical methods for solving partial differential equations. These algorithms are used to solve scientific and engineering problems arising from diverse application fields such as aerospace engineering, semi-conductor device design, astrophysics, and biological problems.  Even with today's fast computers, it is still essential to design efficient and reliable algorithms which can be used to obtain accurate solutions to these application problems.  The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity will be a suite of powerful computational tools, suitable for various applications mentioned above.  These tools are expected to make positive contributions to computer simulations of the complicated solution structure in these applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The algorithms the PI plans to investigate include the finite difference and finite volume weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes and discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods, for solving hyperbolic and other convection dominated partial differential equations (PDEs). While the emphasis of this project is on algorithm design and analysis, close attention will be paid to applications. Topics of proposed investigations will include the study on an inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure for high order numerical boundary conditions for finite difference schemes on Cartesian meshes solving problems in general geometry, Lagrangian type finite volume schemes for multi-material flows, a simple weighted essentially non-oscillatory limiter for discontinuous Galerkin methods with strong shocks, high order stable conservative methods on arbitrary point clouds, discontinuous Galerkin methods for weakly coupled hyperbolic multi-domain and network problems, efficient time-stepping techniques for discontinuous Galerkin schemes, high order accurate bound-preserving schemes and applications, bound-preserving high order discontinuous Galerkin schemes for radiative transfer equations, energy-conserving DG methods for Maxwell's equations in Drude metamaterials, efficient discontinuous Galerkin method for front propagation problems with obstacles, superconvergence analysis of discontinuous Galerkin methods and its applications, multi-scale methods based on the discontinuous Galerkin framework, and applications in areas including traffic and pedestrian flow models and aggregation, coordinated movement and cell proliferation in computational biology.  Problems in applications will motivate the design of new algorithms or new features in existing algorithms; mathematics tools are used to analyze these algorithms to give guidelines for their applicability and limitations; practical considerations including parallel implementation issues are addressed to make the algorithms competitive in large scale calculations; and collaborations with engineers and other applied scientists enable the efficient application of these new algorithms or new features in existing algorithms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of this project are to perform research in algorithm development, analysis and application of high order numerical methods, including discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods and finite difference and finite volume weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes, for solving linear and nonlinear wave equations.  The emphasis of this project is on algorithm development and analysis, however suitable attention is paid to applications.  We have obtained significant results in the following topics:  (1) We have developed a new type of high-order finite difference and finite volume multiresolution weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes for solving hyperbolic conservation laws.  These equations arise from computational fluid dynamics and other physical and engineering applications, and our new methods are demonstrated to be more efficient and robust than previous WENO schemes, both for steady state computation and for time dependent simulations.  (2) Efficient high order accurate discontinuous Galerkin methods have been designed and analyzed for approximating nonlinear parabolic equations and gradient flow problems with interaction potentials, including those with cross-diffusions.  Entropy stability and positivity-preserving properties are obtained.  These equations arise from many physical applications.  (3) For compressible magneto-hydrodynamics equations (MHD), we have designed high order accurate discontinuous Galerkin methods which satisfy entropy conditions as well as maintaining positivity of density and internal energy numerically.  These results have also be extended to relativistic MHD equations.  (4) For bound-preserving high order schemes, we have developed a class of modified exponential Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin methods, a class of second and third order positivity-preserving time discretizations for production-destruction equations, and a modified finite element space for dealing with radiative transfer equations.  The bound-preserving schemes thus obtained are more efficient in applications.  (5) The implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta or multi-step time discretizations are particularly attractive to solve problems with two different scales, one stiff and the other relatively non-stiff.  Study on IMEX schemes with the presence of  boundary conditions, and design of explicit-implicit-null (IMEX-null)  schemes for problems with nonlinear stiff parts,have been carried out.   The resulting schemes are efficient in solving convection-diffusion and  convection-dispersion equations arising from various applications.  (6) We have developed and analyzed high order discontinuous Galerkin methods for solving Maxwell's equations in Drude metamaterials on unstructured meshes. The Drude metamaterials have nice properties for waves and are important in applications.  (7)  For traffic flow modeling and simulation, we have modeled and simulated the dispersion of vehicle exhaust in a hypothetical city with a single central business district (CBD) in a complete day, deriving an average pollutant concentration in a day, then use the distribution of wind direction in a year, to compute the distribution of average pollutant concentration in the city.  (8) Optimally convergent energy-conserving discontinuous Galerkin methods for linear symmetric hyperbolic systems have been designed and analyzed.  (9) Stability analysis and error estimates of arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian discontinuous Galerkin method coupled with Runge-Kutta time-marching for linear conservation laws have been obtained.  (10) We have presented a framework on analyzing the strong stability of explicit Runge-Kutta (RK) time discretizations for semi-negative autonomous linear systems.  (11)  A high order arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian finite difference WENO scheme for Hamilton-Jacobi equations has been designed.  Equipped with this scheme, we have studied efficient and high order accurate numerical methods for solving Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations with initial conditions defined in the whole domain.  (12) We have proposed, analyzed, and implemented a new reduced basis method (RBM) tailored for the linear (ordinary and partial) differential equations driven by arbitrary (i.e. not necessarily Gaussian) types of noise.  (13)  Bounded and compact weighted essentially nonoscillatory limiters for discontinuous Galerkin schemes have been designed on structured and unstructured meshes.  (14)  We have developed and analyzed a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method to approximate stochastic conservation laws, which arise often in applications.  (15)  We have developed a new discontinuous Galerkin method for solving several types of partial differential equations (PDEs) with high order spatial derivatives, which has improved efficiency and stability over previous discontinuous Galerkin methods for the same equations.  (16) We have addressed the issue of conservation of the total mass for finite difference WENO schemes solving hyperbolic conservation laws on a Cartesian mesh using the  inverse Lax-Wendroff (ILW) boundary treatments in arbitrary physical domains whose boundaries do not coincide with grid lines.  This allows us to compute problem in complex geometry using rectangular Cartesian meshes while still guaranteeing conservation.  (17) We have enforced strong stability of explicit time stepping by modifying the method with superviscosity.  (18)  We have constructed high order energy dissipative and conservative local discontinuous Galerkin methods for the Fornberg-Whitham type equations.  70 refereed journal papers have been published or are accepted for publication which cited partial support by this NSF grant.  The grant partially supported one Ph.D. student, and helped other students and postdocs of the PI through group discussions.
