<AbstractNarration>To reach its full potential in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), the United States must continue to recruit, prepare and maintain a diverse STEM workforce. Much work has been done in this regard. Yet, underrepresentation in STEM fields persists and is especially pronounced for Hispanic STEM professionals. The Hispanic community is the youngest and fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the United States but comprises only seven percent of the STEM workforce. More evidence-based solutions and innovative approaches are required. This project endeavors to address the challenges of underrepresentation in STEM, especially among individuals of Hispanic descent, through an innovative approach. The University of San Diego will design, develop, implement, and test a multilayered STEM learning approach specific to STEM learning and workforce development in STEM fields targeting Hispanic youth. The STEM World of Work project will explore youth STEM identity through three mechanisms: (1) an assessment of their individual interests, strengths, and values, (2) exposure to an array of viable STEM careers, and (3) engagement in rigorous hands-on STEM activities. The project centers on a youth summer STEM enrichment program and a series of follow-up booster sessions delivered during the academic year in informal contexts to promote family engagement. Paramount to this work is the core focus on San Diego's Five Priority Workforce Sectors: Advanced Manufacturing, Information and Communications Technology, Clean Energy, Healthcare, and Biotech. Few, if any, existing projects in the Advancing Informal STEM learning portfolio have explored the potential connections between these five priority workforce sectors, informal STEM learning, and identity among predominately Hispanic youth and families engaged in a year-long, culturally responsive STEM learning and workforce focused program. If successful, the model could provide a template for the facilitation of similar efforts in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The STEM World of Work project will use a mixed-methods, exploratory research design to better understand the variables influencing STEM learning and academic and career choices within the proposed context. The research questions will explore: (1) the impacts of the project on students' engagement, STEM identity, STEM motivation, and academic outcomes, (2) factors that moderate these outcomes, and (3) the impact the model has on influencing youths' personal goals and career choices. Data will be garnered through cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys and reflective focus groups with the students and their parents/guardians. Multivariate analysis of variance, longitudinal modeling, and qualitative analysis will be conducted to analyze and report the data. The findings will be disseminated using a variety of methods and platforms. The broader impacts of the findings and work are expected to extend well beyond the project team, graduate student mentors, project partners, and the estimated 120 middle school students and their families from the predominately Hispanic Chula Vista Community of San Diego who will be directly impacted by the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory pathways project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.</AbstractNarration>

STEM interest development through informal learning experiences. It involved the design, development, implementation, and testing of a multilayered, year-long, culturally responsive experience centered on a youth summer STEM enrichment program and monthly follow-up ?booster? sessions to promote family engagement. STEMWoW provided opportunities for students to explore their interests, competencies, and values; to investigate career pathways; and to engage in rigorous, hands-on STEM activities.</p> <p><strong>STEMWoW Intellectual Merit: </strong>Project results and experiences were shared through several conference papers, presentations and publications, including at the Association of African American Educators 28th Annual Conference, STEM For All Video Showcase, the Western Campus Compact Continuums of Service Conference, the Latina Success Conference, the San Diego County Office of Education STEMPower Conference, the Video Showcase: Innovations in STEM Education, the Western Region Campus Compact Continuums of Service Conference, the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in the Sciences (SACNAS), the American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) and the Diversity, Inclusion and Social Justice Excellence Showcase and more publications are currently under review. Results suggested that the introduction of and exploration of the concept of "productive struggle" and some autonomy in the selection of activities to engage in productive struggle, resulted in gains in students' and near-peer mentors' perceived joy, comptency and autonomy in informal learning activites that integrate rigorous STEM activities, exploration of self, and exposure of STEM careers.</p> <p><strong>STEMWoW Broader Impacts: </strong>The project resulted in a culturally-sensitive, assets-based STEM and career-exploration curriculum and an enrichment facilitator and near-peer mentor preparation program. During its two planned years, STEMWoW engaged 129 middle school students (98% from underrepresented groups) and their families, and 42 pod leaders (19 undergraduates, 5 graduate students, 5 teachers/counselors, 2 STEM professionals, and 12 high school students (87.5% from underrepresented groups), some for both years. Additionally, during summer 2020, during a one-year no-cost extension, we worked with 46 middle school students and 27 high school students and their families, 8 college students, 7 graduate students/scientists/teachers, and 17 community leaders/teachers, and each student created a square to be displayed as part of a virtual Community Action Quilt (<a href="https://usdsteam.wixsite.com/steam-conference2020/steamcommunityactionquilt">https://usdsteam.wixsite.com/steam-conference2020/steamcommunityactionquilt</a>). Each year, the STEAM Youth and Community Conference had 26-40 workshops and a diverse group of &nbsp;over 325 students, family members, teachers, leaders, professionals, STEAM organization representatives and other community members. We also engaged community members and made connections between STEM professionals, organizations and the community through various other STEM workshops and events and contributed to the San Diego STEM Ecosystem and the development of the 52 Weeks of Science efforts that highlight the science happening all around us. Project STEMWoW also inspired the creation of Project VisMO: Fostering Elementary School Students? Visuospatial Skills and Mathematics, a three-year Collaborative Research NSF initiative that investigates the causal link between children?s visuospatial skills development and their longitudinal gains (NSF#1920821).
