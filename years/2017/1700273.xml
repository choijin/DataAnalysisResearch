<AbstractNarration>The 2017 "Houston Summer School on Dynamical Systems" will take place May 17-25, 2017 at the University of Houston, in Houston, Texas. This event will introduce graduate students to recent progress and novel techniques in dynamical systems and ergodic theory. Particular emphasis will be paid to statistical properties of systems with some hyperbolicity, and on connections between dynamics and number theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of the school will consist of five lecture series covering topics in: hyperbolic and partially hyperbolic dynamics, symbolic dynamics, Diophantine approximation, dynamics of group actions on homogeneous spaces, and linearly recurrent systems. These lectures will be given by internationally recognized researchers in dynamical systems and its applications. In addition to the formal lectures there will be informal review sessions, problem sessions, and project sessions, with the goals of maximizing interactions between students and lecturers and allowing plenty of opportunity for discussion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer school URL is: http://www.math.uh.edu/~climenha/2017-school.html</AbstractNarration>

These questions are well studied in the scientific literature, but many of the key ideas for understading modern developments are not readily available in the literature in a form that is accessible to graduate students; this was one motivation for the school.

In a survey given at the end of the school, student feedback was very positive, with 94% of respondents indicating that they would recommend the summer school to other students interested in dynamical systems.  A similar event was run in May 2016, for which videos of the lectures are available at https://www.math.uh.edu/dynamics/school/index2016.php -- the organizers are planning another such event in May 2018.
