<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "The Twenty-First Riviere Fabes Symposium" that will be held at the University of Minnesota from April 27-29, 2018.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of partial differential equations, applied analysis, harmonic analysis, and geometric measure theory.   A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.   The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.   More information will be made available at: https://math.umn.edu/riviere-fabes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The titles and abstracts of the lectures are below, more materials (including slides from some of the talks) are available at https://math.umn.edu/past-riviere-fabes-symposia/riviere-fabes-2018. There were over 30 supported participants, mostly graduate students and postdoctoral associates from outside universities.  The intellectual merit of the conference lied  mainly in having provided a platform for  interactions between junior participants and some leading experts in Analysis and PDEs.  The broader impact of the conference is in the dissemination and promotion of mathematical discovery and understanding, and broadening participation of under-represented groups.      Ciprian Demeter Decouplings and Applications Abstract: In the first lecture I will introduce a Fourier analytic tool called decoupling, and will present a few applications to PDEs and number theory. In the second lecture, I will attempt to sketch the proof of the main theorem in the simplest possible case.   Charles Epstein The Amazing Kimura Operator Abstract:  The Kimura Operator is a second order operator defined on the simplex in any dimension. It is the basic building block of diffusion models used in Population Genetics. This operator is, in many sense, the Laplace operator of the simplex. In this talk we will introduce diffusion models in population genetics and explore some remarkable features of the Kimura operator itself. Analytic Foundations for Diffusion Models in Population Genetics Abstract:   Diffusion models in Population Genetics are usually described in terms of second order PDEs defined on manifolds-with-corners. We call these generalized Kimura operators. The principal symbol of these operators degenerate in a very particular way along the boundary of this space, rendering them beyond standard elliptic/parabolic theory, even for previous analyzed classes of degenerate operators.  In this talk I describe recent analytic work (joint with Rafe Mazzeo and Camelia Pop) establishing existence, uniqueness and regularity of solutions to the elliptic and parabolic problems defined by generalized Kimura operators. I will also describe properties of the stochastic processes they define.      Joachim Krieger Dynamics of Critical Geometric Wave Equations Abstract: I will discuss some recent developments in the theory of energy-critical nonlinear wave equations of geometric character, such as the Wave Maps, Maxwell-Klein-Gordon, and Yang-Mills equation. In particular, large data dynamics of soliton type which figure in the so-called soliton resolution conjecture will be discussed, as well as cases where all solutions eventually scatter.       Tatiana Toro Elliptic measure and rectifiability I &amp; II Abstract:  In these talks we will describe some recent results concerning the relationship between the behavior of the elliptic measure for certain divergence form elliptic operators and the geometry of the boundary of the domain where the operators are defined. The results bear a strong resemblance to those obtained for the harmonic measure. One of the main difference between these two cases is the use of compactness techniques, which play a central role. These will be presented in some detail. This is joint work with S. Hofmann, J.M. Martell, S. Mayboroda and Z. Zhao.
