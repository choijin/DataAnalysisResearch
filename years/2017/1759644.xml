<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to decrease health care costs for sleep apnea monitoring and diagnosis. It is estimated that a large proportion of potential sleed apnea patients are undiagnosed. Sleep apnea is a potentially remedial risk factor for hypertension, type II diabetes, stroke, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. Sleep apnea also causes learning disability among children. The proposed sleep apnea screening tool is accurate and easy to use. It can potentially be broadly employed in clinics and homes, and reduce the need for both overnight laboratory-based polysomnograms and home sleep studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project targets to provide an easy-to-use screening tool for sleep apnea that combines mobile technology, internet of things (IoT) technology, and machine learning technology into one system.  The core technology of this screening tool is the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with IoT sensors. The solution is expected to deliver a high accuracy and sensitivity sleep apnea screening methodology using deep learning methods. Preliminary results are consistent with six types of apnea-hypopnea index threshold.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;Healthcare for chronic conditions must be re-oriented around the patient and caregivers.However, to date there is no I-UCRC center in U.S. to accelerate development of ?in-place? technology to facilitate management of chronic disease in-place as an alternative to repeated hospitalization. To address this gap, we&nbsp; proposed Center to Stream HealthCare In place or C2SHIP. C2SHIP led by Dr. Janet Roveda at the University of Arizona (UA) and Dr. Bijan Najafi at the Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) will be committed to research &amp; development in three pillars&nbsp; of contemporary human health and development: growing-up-in-place, healthy aging-in-place, and precision environmental health. To plan the C2SHIP, we have performed and successfully achieved the following milestones:&nbsp;1)<span> </span>BootCamp Workshop: We attended a one day Boot Camp workshop organized by NSF in January 2018 to gain skills to design strategies for building membership through customer discovery and corporate engagement. Before attending this meeting we interviewed 5 industries to gain insights about interest of potential members to our center mission.2)<span> </span>Building mission statement and value proposition documents. In this phase with collaboration of key investigators from both universities as well as through coaching from VentureWell (consultants supported via NSF), we fined tuned our mission statement and value propositions. We had also regular teleconference with VentureWell Consultants as well as NSF program director to successfully achieve the milestone for the customer discovery phase and critically evaluate our center value proposition.3)<span> </span>Interviewing potential members: For the purpose of costumer discovery and validated our value proposition hypotheses, we discovered and interviewed key members of relevant industries. Through this process we have successfully interviewed 31 industries including interviewing leaders (e.g. CEO. CTO, CFO, program director, etct) from top 100 fortunes companies including Medline, Stryker, Medtronic, IBM, Phillips, Texas Instruments, etc.&nbsp;4)<span> </span>Finalizing Business Model Canvas. Through the process of customer interview process and with support of consultants from VentureWell, we have finalized our ?Business model Canvas? for our C2SHIP center (see attached).5)<span> </span>Site visits and engaging industrial members: Through our customer interview process, we identified potential industrial members who are willing to support the mission of our center and agree to sign our center agreement. Through this process, we organized site visit for 8 potential industrial members and organized tour to our facilities as well as meeting with key faculties of our institutions. This process led to identifying promising industrial members and invite them to attend our planning workshop.6)<span> </span>Discovery additional academic sites: In parallel to industrial member discovery, we communicated with senior scientists in other academic sites who could share the same interest with our C2SHIP while adding complementary expertise/resources to our C2SHIP. Our efforts led to engagement of 4 new academic members including U of Missouri, U of Southern California,&nbsp; and Caltech.&nbsp;7)<span> </span>Organizing planning workshop: With collaboration of our academic members (UA, USC, UM, and Caltech), we planned and successfully organized our first planning workshop in Houston. In this planning workshop, the center directors, faculties, students, and administration representatives from 7 academic institutes as well as 20+ potential industrial members attended in two days workshops (6 and 7 November, 2018). During this planning workshop, 11 podium project presentations and 29 project posters were presented. All project presentations were graded by the invited industrial members.&nbsp;8)<span> </span>Executing agreement and collecting formal signatures from industrial members. After successful organizing the planning workshop, we focused our efforts to execute agreements with industrial members. We are happy to report that 4 industrial members including WeHealth by Servier, Medline, Circulation Concepts, and MedoPad signed our agreements. Thanks to executing 4 members agreement, we are now a qualified academic site for the center grant Phase I. Our other collaborative universities also have engaged more than three industrial members for the Phase I grant submission. This includes University of Arizona and University of Missouri.&nbsp; 9)<span> </span>Submission of the Phase I grant: with collaboration of our academic sites and support from our industrial members we have worked to finalize the Phase I proposal and is anticipated to submit with April Cycle.
