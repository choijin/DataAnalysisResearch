<AbstractNarration>This project will integrate the capabilities of deep learning networks into a biologically inspired architecture for sensorimotor control that can be used to design more robust platforms for complex engineered systems. Studies of the flexibility and contextual aspects of sensorimotor planning and control will extend existing paradigms for human-robot interactions and serve as the foundation for creating personal assistants that are able to operate in natural settings. Growing understanding of how these layered architectures are organized in the brain to produce highly robust, flexible, and efficient behavior will have many applications to rapidly evolving technologies in complex environments, including the Internet of Things, autonomous transportation, and sustainable energy networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nervous system is a layered architecture, seamlessly integrating high-level planning with fast lower level sensing, reflex, and action in a way that this project aims to both understand more deeply and mimic in advanced technology. The central goal is to develop a theoretical framework for layered architectures that takes into account both system level functional requirements and hardware constraints. There are both striking commonalities and significant differences between biology and technology in using layered architectures for active feedback control. The most salient and universal hardware constraints are tradeoffs between speed, accuracy, and costs (to build, operate, and maintain), and successful architectures cleverly combine diverse components to create systems that are both fast and accurate, despite being built from parts that are not.   Recent progress has made it possible to integrate realistic features and constraints for sensorimotor coordination in a coherent and rigorous way using worst-case L-infinity bounded uncertainty models from robust control, but much remains to explore to realize its potential in neuroscience and neuro-inspired engineering. Another application of this framework will be to software defined networking, which explicitly separates data forwarding and data control, and provides an interface through which network applications (such as traffic engineering, congestion control and caching) can programmatically control the network.  This makes it a potential "killer app" for a theory of integrated planning/reflex layering; research collaborators will be eager to deploy new protocols on testbeds and at scale.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project is to develop an integrated theoretical foundation for understanding planning and sensorimotor control in humans that furthers our scientific understanding and can be used to design more robust platforms for complex engineered systems. We developed an immersive environment for testing the flexibility and contextual aspects of sensorimotor planning and control to compare with theory.  Nervous systems control (sensing, communications, computing, and actuation) movement with a system that sparse, localized, saturating, delayed, noisy, quantized, and distributed (SLSDNQD) using distributed components with severe speed and accuracy trade-offs (SATs).  Nevertheless, the resulting system level control can achieve remarkably fast, accurate, and robust performance due to a highly effective layered control architecture.  However, this architecture had received little attention, in part because of the lack of theory that connects speed-accuracy trade-offs (SATs) in the components neurophysiology with system-level sensorimotor control. In this project, we developed a theoretical framework that provides a synthetic perspective of both levels and layers.  Here the 2 levels focused on are primarily the system level made up of the brain and other CNS regions, and their implementation at the component level in spiking neurons. Additional levels below neurons would include cellular subsystems and molecules, which we are not focusing on in this program, and have received much greater attention in the neuroscience literature. Layers refer to higher layer functions of goals, planning, and tracking, which are at least partially conscious and deliberate, and lower layer reflexes which are automatic and unconscious.  Existing theory has poorly addressed both layers and levels, and our results dramatically change this.  Mountain biking down a twisting bumpy trail is an illustrative neuro/physiology problem that humans excel at with intuitively accessible questions and new answers.  Advanced warning via vision is used to plan and track the trail with a small error if there is enough advanced warning relative to speed.  While high-layer goals can be conscious, most planning/tracking is automatic and unconscious.  And the bumps in the trail are handled by a reflex layer that is entirely unconscious with unavoidably delayed reactions, such that even small disturbances can easily result in catastrophically large errors and crashes. These reflexes must deal with the dynamics of the bumps, the bike, and the rider’s body and are in addition to the VOR (vestibular ocular reflex) which is stabilizing vision despite the bumps.  With enough advanced warning, proper equipment, and skill matched to speed and terrain, we can be almost perfectly robust, but with anything less, catastrophically fragile.  Our nervous system architecture allows us to typically exploit the former and avoid the latter. Good athletes also multiplex these tasks extremely well with modest training (much less than the legendary 10K hours), as it exploits capabilities, including learning, that humans have evolved to become top predators.  (Adding texting would be catastrophic as we are not evolved to multiplex this.)  Our layered architecture enables goals/plans using highly virtualized and stable, predictable models despite the lower layer physics being wildly unstable and unpredictable.  Good reflexive bump control makes goals/plans/tracking easier and vice versa.  These extreme diversities in function, behavior, and performance are matched by equally extreme diversity in nerve size (thus cost to build and maintain) and composition (e.g. axon size and numbers, and thus latency and quantization), muscle composition (slow to fast twitch), and in brain components engaged in such a task. While fragments of this challenge can be explained with existing control theory, there was not anything previously that directly addresses the layered architecture, the speed/cost/accuracy tradeoffs in the performance versus the hardware, or the combination of SLSDNQD.  Also, all of these issues extend down to the cellular level in biology and outward to our most advanced network technologies from SDN to smart grid to IOT.  Our research fundamentally advanced the theoretical foundations for the layering and levels involved in sensorimotor control as motivated by the trails and bumps of the mountain biking example, and we have validated this theory on an open source experimental platform that is both inexpensive to deploy and easy to use.  We have had an important impact on education and diversity.  Control and Dynamical Systems (CDS) at Caltech, started in 1994, has had a huge impact despite its tiny size. CDS and the new CMS department are recognized world leaders in the development of theory for analysis and design of complex networked control systems and applications to engineering and science. The top THE (London Times) world universities have &gt;25 professors who are former Doyle advisees (mostly PhDs, a few postdocs). CDS has also promoted diversity, with 5 women (1 URM) out of 7 of the latest Doyle group alumni professors in the "THE top".  Doyle’s current research group is &gt;2/3 female in a field with otherwise very poor gender balance. The rest of CDS has comparable diversity, particularly placing female professors.
