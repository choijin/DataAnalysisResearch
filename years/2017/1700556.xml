<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on Ph.D. matriculation and completion. BD programs implemented in the nation's institutions of higher education contribute to addressing one of the objectives in NSF's 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, namely to "integrate education and research to support development of a diverse STEM workforce with cutting-edge capabilities." For the U.S. to remain competitive globally, it must provide exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The performance site for this LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate Activity is California State University, Los Angeles, one of the 23 California State University campuses included in the California State University-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (CSU-LSAMP). The project provides a Master's level "bridge" to doctoral-level study for a cohort of 12 graduates of LSAMP undergraduate programs.  The Master's-level experience is designed to increase participant persistence and competencies in STEM and their advancement to Ph.D. programs following completion of the Master's degree.  In addition to providing substantial financial support to enable students to focus full time on a two-year program of Master's-level course work and research, the project provides an integrated set of activities designed to advance BD students toward completion of doctoral level studies.  Activities include: (1) monthly and semester meetings with the BD Project Director to monitor student progress and provide comprehensive advisement; (2) a workshop series focused on information/tools needed for adjustment to and success in graduate school; (3) writing support; (4) weekly professional seminars; (5) community building activities; (6) "connecting" Fellows to doctoral programs through collaborations with faculty and programs at Ph.D. institutions; and (7) assistance with applications to Ph.D. programs, financial aid and fellowship programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Bridge to the Doctorate at California State University, Los Angeles: CSU-LSAMP-BD Cohort 14  Project Description: This project (HRD-1700556) was an NSF-LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate Activity (BD) associated with the California State University-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (CSU-LSAMP).  California State University, Los Angeles, one of the 23 California State University campuses in CSU-LSAMP served as the graduate institutional site for this BD Activity.  The project?s goal was to bring the talent of a cohort of 12 graduates of LSAMP undergraduate programs to academe and research at the frontiers of science and engineering. The project aimed to expand the number of students from underrepresented minority groups in doctoral programs at highly competitive research universities by providing a Master?s level bridge to doctoral-level study for students who would be unlikely to apply or be admitted directly to doctoral level study upon completion of the baccalaureate. As in past CSU-LSAMP-BD projects, the Master?s-level experience was designed to increase participant persistence and competencies in STEM and their advancement to and success in Ph.D. programs following completion of the Master?s degree.

Additionally, 3-5 students who do not continue on to Ph.D. programs will minimally have completed the MS degree and have entered the STEM workforce.  Project Activities: The project was designed to provide students, who for financial, academic or personal reasons may be hesitant or not sufficiently prepared to apply directly to a Ph.D. program at a research-intensive university, the opportunity to develop the confidence and competencies needed for admission to and success in a highly competitive Ph.D. program. In addition to providing financial support to enable students to focus full time on a two-year program of rigorous graduate-level course work and research culminating in an MS degree, the project included an integrated set of activities designed to support and advance BD students toward completion of doctoral studies in STEM.

Outcomes: CSU-LSAMP continues to find that the BD model it has developed is an effective strategy for advancing the goal of broadening participation in STEM doctoral-level study.  This model, which provides financial, academic and professional development support at the Masters level, has proven successful in recruiting, retaining, and advancing talented minority students who, otherwise, would be unlikely to pursue doctoral level study.    The project was successful in attracting a full cohort of twelve (12) talented graduates of LSAMP undergraduate programs to the CSU-LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate Activity at Cal State LA. Unfortunately, one member of the cohort was dismissed at the end of the first year and we were unable to replace him.
