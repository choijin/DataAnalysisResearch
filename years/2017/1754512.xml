<AbstractNarration>Microorganisms encompass most of the diversity on Earth, and are responsible for maintaining the function of various ecosystems, such as in the guts of animals, in soil, and in water. This research is focused on understanding processes that control where microbes live and how they respond to changes in local conditions. A tree exists in a given location if it can survive both the environmental conditions and interactions with its neighbors at that location, and its seedlings may disperse to new locations with new environmental conditions. Unlike trees, microbes frequently migrate as whole communities and in tandem with their environment, often merging with other microbial communities along with their respective environments. For instance, wind movement of soil particles across the landscape or human handshakes result in novel contact of previously separated microbial communities. This process is termed community coalescence. The confluence of two water bodies is a clear example of community coalescence, resulting in a new, united environment with novel interactions among the previously separate microbial communities. This research will experimentally identify how aquatic microbial communities interact and respond to the merger under different environmental conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to understand how microbial communities from distinct habitats interact under community coalescence, with the following specific objectives: (1) Characterize the membership of microbial communities in the field and their activity at three distinct aquatic environments where coalescence occurs. (2) In the laboratory, track microbial community membership and activity in response to experimentally-imposed coalescence. (3) Analyze experimental data in the context of the patterns observed in the field. Unraveling mechanisms that determine community membership following a coalescence event is difficult, since the abiotic and biotic factors are intertwined. In order to understand the true community ecology of microbes, it is necessary to separate the environmental and biological factors that ultimately determine which organisms persist and which do not. To address these fundamental ecological questions, the research team developed a new approach to directly measure the effects of environmental factors and biotic interactions, independently and in combination, on coalesced communities. This project addresses fundamental concepts in community ecology, dispersal of a massive number of microorganisms in the context of aquatic systems, and directly disentangles biotic and abiotic factors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the biggest challenges in microbial ecology is determining how responsive microbial communities are to altered environments. Most studies examine microbial communities as constrained only by the habitat conditions, but are not simultaneously examining the impacts of environment and newly introduced microbial communities. The intermingling of previously distinct communities, along with their respective local environments, termed ‘community coalescence’, occurs frequently with microbes. For instance, falling leaves, human handshakes, and mixing of waterbodies all result in novel contact of previously separated microbial communities, yet little is known about how these communities interact and respond to the merge. This project used a novel experimental approach to examine the question of what occurs when microbial communities collide.    We first examined the outcomef of salt-water microbes and environments mixing with fresh-water microbes and environments - a collision that is occuring with greater frequency as seawater intrudes into freshwater ecosystems.  We found three key results.  First, in mixed environments, microbes from the marine environment tended to outperform microbes from the freshwater environment.  Secondly, these patterns were driven both by the differences in the habitat and by interactions between the members of the two communities.  Third, and most striking, in the novel environments, we observed the emergence of a large number of microbes that we didn't observe in the original environments.  These high levels of "dark diversity" suggest that extremely rare microbes have the potential to buffer microbial communities from changes in the environment.  We followed this experiment up with a much broader look at the outcomes of community coalesence by comparing the results from our marine and freshwater collision with two other aquatic environement where microbial communities frequently collide: the confluence of a stream draining a heavily mined area with a pristine stream, and the confluence of a spring-fed stream with a black-water stream.  In all three cases, in the mixed environment, the community from the environment with higher ionic strength (a measure of stress for microbes) dominated the community from the lower ionic strength environment.  We also found the repeated emergence of large numbers of previously extremely rare taxa when microbial communities were exposed to novel environments.  These findings suggest that these patterns may represent a general trend when microbial communities collide.       Last Modified: 07/01/2021       Submitted by: Justin P Wright]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
