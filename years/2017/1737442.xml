<AbstractNarration>The Supporting Computational Algorithmic Thinking (SCAT) project at Spelman College includes activities that develop computational thinking and encourage middle school, African-American girls to consider careers in computer science.  Over a three-year period, the girls attend summer camp sessions of two weeks where they learn to design interactive games.  They participate in workshops, field trips, and game-design competitions. Experts in Computational Algorithmic Thinking as well as undergraduate, computer science majors at Spelman College guide the middle-school students in their design of games and exploration of related STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on the development of Computational Algorithmic Thinking is an integral part of the project.  The researcher is investigating how middle-school girls develop computational thinking and problem solving skills.  Game design has been shown to be an area that is attractive to adolescents and it requires extensive problem solving and computational algorithmic thinking. Within the context of designing games individually and within groups, the researcher is assessing how the girls develop computational algorithmic thinking, and what difficulties they  experience.  Researchers are also assessing how the project experiences influence the students' self-perceptions of themselves as problem solvers.  At the same time, the girls engaged in educational experiences where they are expected to gain knowledge in mathematics, programming, and reasoning, as well as game design.  Research data consists of artifacts that the students have created, observations, participant journals, and interviews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computational Algorithmic Thinking is an essential skill for most STEM careers.  African-American women are underrepresented in many STEM fields and especially in computer science.  The goals of the project are to prepare girls with these essential skills and to increase their confidence in participating in STEM education.  The project is also exposing participating girls to a wide variety of STEM careers.  In addition, the materials, lesson plans, and activities generated in the project are available to be used, without charge, by other groups interested in designing similar programs.</AbstractNarration>

Further, there is a paucity of research in CS education that focuses specifically on the development of complex cognitive capabilities in Black girls and women, who are marginalized within Computer Science.  The research supported by this award was designed to explore how CAT capability develops over time (6 years) in Black middle and high school girls (called SCAT Scholars) in the context of game design for social change.   Computational algorithmic thinking (CAT) is the ability to design, implement, and assess the implementation of algorithms to solve a range of problems.  It involves identifying and understanding a problem, articulating an algorithm or set of algorithms in the form of a solution to the problem, implementing that solution in such a way that it solves the problem, and evaluating the solution based on some set of criteria.  CAT makes explicit a critical aspect of computational thinking through its focus of understanding how learners identify and understand a problem, articulate an algorithm or set of algorithms in the form of a solution to the problem, and evaluate the solution based on some set of criteria.  CAT is focused on the algorithms designed, adapted, implemented, and discarded by the human (as computing agent) on the journey toward choosing the ?right? abstractions. CAT is an important scaffolded on-ramp as students develop more advanced computational thinking capabilities and apply computational thinking to solve problems that are more constrained and require greater and greater expertise.  The results of the project gave us a number of new insights into not only the difficulties that Black girls experience as they enact CAT over time, but also how they address those difficulties in the context of the learning environment?s scaffolds (facilitator, undergraduate assistants, and Design Notebook), with their peers, and how difficulties shifted over time as their CAT capabilities became more developed.
