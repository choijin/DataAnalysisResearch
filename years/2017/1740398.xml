<AbstractNarration>The Computing Systems Research (CSR) program of the NSF funds a wide&lt;br/&gt;range of systems research including (but not limited to) systems for&lt;br/&gt;Internet-of-Things (which makes our homes and city smarter), systems to&lt;br/&gt;make more affordable and energy-efficient our Supercomputers (which&lt;br/&gt;furthers medical research, our understanding of the universe, and&lt;br/&gt;warns the population of tornadoes and hurricanes, to name a few),&lt;br/&gt;systems to improve the usefulness, security, and reliability of our&lt;br/&gt;smartphones, and systems to secure and scale the cloud (which has&lt;br/&gt;expanded the capabilities of IT systems while dramatically decreasing&lt;br/&gt;the associated costs). The project organizes and funds a community&lt;br/&gt;event for all the PIs of awards from the CSR program. At this event,&lt;br/&gt;the researchers funded by the CSR program will have the opportunity to&lt;br/&gt;meet at-large and share and discuss their research and ideas for the&lt;br/&gt;future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project organizes a PI meeting that includes mostly three types of&lt;br/&gt;activities. Plenary presentations will give a forum for the most&lt;br/&gt;remarkable research in the field to be presented and diffused to a&lt;br/&gt;large audience. These presentations are also useful to set the tone&lt;br/&gt;and quality of expected research for the PIs of more recent&lt;br/&gt;awards. Poster presentations of ongoing award enable casual scientific&lt;br/&gt;conversation and person-to-person research diffusion; they are&lt;br/&gt;expected to strengthen the social interaction between CSR researchers&lt;br/&gt;and to lead to new collaborations and synergy in the field. Breakout&lt;br/&gt;sessions will focus on subfield of systems research to summarize&lt;br/&gt;recent successful methodology and identify problems and opportunities&lt;br/&gt;for future work. The project provides a forum for systems researchers to meet and to&lt;br/&gt;form new collaborations, to discuss and to disseminate successful&lt;br/&gt;efforts, to identify the problems and opportunities of the future, and&lt;br/&gt;to maximize the impact of subsequent systems research efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A Principal Investigator meeting of the Computer System Research community was organized in Orlando, Fl on Friday June 2nd 2017. Over 90 Principal Investigator attended the meeting to present results and discuss the direction of the field.  The event enables the presentation of a variety of work by PI funded by the NSF Computer System Research cluster. These presentations contributed to the wide diffusion of recent, cutting-edge techniques to the broad CSR community. Also PI to PI discussion were enabled by a wide forum supported by poster.  This event enabled the scientific community to interact with NSF program manager in two-way discussion. The view of the priorities and organization of the NSF was expressed to the community through this forum. Also the community was able to provide feedback to the NSF through discussions of subgroup of PIs that were lead and summarized by prominent figures in the field. The feedback goes from the identification of new areas of research, to logistical issues that could be solved by means available to the NSF.  The meeting was colocated with the IEEE IPDPS conference, a well established conference in parallel and distributed computing, one of the area of the Computer System Research community. This enabled the interaction between many Computer System Research PIs and the broader parallel and distributed computing community.
