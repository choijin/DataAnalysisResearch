<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry supports an international meeting as part of the Chemical Sciences and Society Symposia (CS3). The CS3 convenes eminent high-level researchers from the US, UK, Japan, China and Germany to explore frontier chemistry research on diverse topics. The CS3 meeting in Dalian, China, September 4-7, 2017 will be on the topic "Solar Energy and Photonics". Previous meetings have been developed multilaterally through discussions of the chemical societies in each participating country (specifically with the American Chemical Society in the US). This series is intended to be of valuable to the global chemistry enterprise internationally as it attempts to foster work in trans-national teams, across scientific disciplines, and beyond institutional boundaries. The workshop proceedings are promoted and distributed to the global science and technology community and the general public through reports on the web. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this workshop focuses on chemistry and its application for solar energy and photonics. Four subtopics are included 1) Photocatalysis for water splitting. 2) Photovoltaic materials with abundant elements. 3) Artificial photosynthesis for carbon dioxide reduction. 4) Photonic materials and photo-up conversion.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2017 Chemical Sciences &amp; Society (CS3) Summit in Dalian, China brought together over thirty eminent chemists &amp; chemical engineers in solar energy &amp; photonics to discuss the future of this exciting science. In collaboration with the the chemical societies and funding agencies of China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom, the U.S. delegation was able to lead in identifying the challenges and opportunities of powering the world through our most abundant and renewable resource: solar energy.   The summit's key goal was to breakdown four areas of this topic which require additional attention: photovoltaics, photonic materials, artificial photosynthesis and CO2 reduction and ways to approach these with measures and standards. The delegations discussed these topics at length during and following the summit and produced a white paper for the public,  Solar Energy &amp; Photonics for a Sustainable Future. That paper was released and made publicly available in March 2018.   In September 2018, leaders of the U.S. delegation led a panel discussion on the future of SolarEnergy in the United States and abroad and highlighted the challenges CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere poses to the United States. The panel, Understanding the Potential of Solar Energy: Tackling Energy Challenges of Tomorrow was a publicly available event on Capitol Hill which encouraged the public and policymakers to learn more about this critical topic.   The white paper for this and past CS3 publications is available at www.acs.org/cs3        Last Modified: 12/11/2018       Submitted by: Christopher Laprade]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
