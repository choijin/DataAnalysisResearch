<AbstractNarration>The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant is the NSF's most prestigious award bestowed on outstanding tenure-track faculty members to support their exceptional research and educational activities. Junior faculty who are just starting their careers often have limited experience with proposal writing and evaluation. They also have little or no interaction with the program directors at NSF. The goal of this workshop is to allow junior faculty to obtain first-hand experiences through the combination of presentations and interactive activities with recent CISE CAREER awardees and NSF program directors. The CISE CAREER Workshop has happened over the past 6 years, and has been successful in disseminating knowledge of the CAREER program requirements within CISE to the community of early-career CISE researchers in academia. This workshop aims to continue this proven and successful format to benefit the emerging community of early-career researchers in CISE-related disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will consist of the presentations on CISE CAREER solicitation, talks given by recent CAREER awardees, mock panels, as well as program-specific discussions with NSF program managers. The workshop is tentatively scheduled to be held on Monday March 20th, 2017 in the Hilton Arlington hotel in Arlington, Virginia. This location is easily accessible through the Metro and within short distance from three major airports in the Washington DC metropolitan area. The workshop organizers, in conjunction with NSF program directors, will also facilitate one-on-one meetings with individual program officers from the CISE directorate on the day following the workshop for those attendees who are interested in learning more about the specific program and obtaining feedback on their ideas for a CAREER submission.</AbstractNarration>
