<AbstractNarration>The CombinaTexas 2018 conference will be held at Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, Texas, on February 10-11, 2018. The conference will take place on Saturday and Sunday to make it easy for researchers to attend, and will feature six fifty-minute plenary lectures and a number of contributed talks, each of twenty minutes long. The aim of the CombinaTexas conference series is to enhance the educational and research atmosphere of combinatorialists in Texas and the surrounding states, increase communication between mathematicians of the region, and provide a forum for presentation and discussion of the most recent developments in the field of Combinatorics. Ever since Texas A&amp;M University hosted the first conference in 2000, it has been held almost every year at different institutions in the South Central United States. CombinaTexas 2018 is the seventeenth conference in this series. About 50 participants are anticipated in 2018, with about 20 contributed talks in parallel sessions. The conference will be publicized using distribution lists and on related conference websites (a conference website is at http://www.math.tamu.edu/conferences/combinatexas/,  including titles and abstracts of the speakers).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature a broad selection of combinatorial research. Researchers will present their new results and there will be time for open discussions to explore unsolved problem in the field. The confirmed plenary speakers are Professor Matthias Beck (San Francisco State University), Professor  Matthew Kahle (Ohio State University), Professor Caroline Klivans (Brown University), Professor Kyungyong Lee (University of Nebraska-Lincoln),  Professor Isabella Novik (University of Washington), and Professor Pavlo Pylyavskyy (University of Minnesota).</AbstractNarration>

Participants had the opportunity to learn cutting edge developments from the distinguished invited researchers and disseminated their own work through contributed talk sessions.  Broader Impacts.  More than 70% of the participants were early career mathematicians (including 4 undergraduate and 25 graduate students). The major goal of this conference series is to encourage beginning combinatorialists by providing a forum for interaction and collaboration with other members of the community, as well as an opportunity to disseminate their research.
