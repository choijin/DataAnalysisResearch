<AbstractNarration>Subduction zones are critical interfaces in Earth where the convergence of tectonic plates gives rise to earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunami, and other natural hazards. Subduction zones are studied using a variety of methods, including seismic, geodetic, and satellite observation, numerical modeling, and laboratory experimentation.  For this conference we are bringing together a community of scientists who use laboratory approaches to reproduce the pressures, temperatures, stresses, and chemical environments inside Earth to investigate the processes that control the behavior of subduction zones. This conference is connected to the Subduction Zones in 4 Dimensions (SZ4D) initiative, a multi-disciplinary effort linking observation, modeling, experiments, and theory, to better understand the time and spatially-dependent evolution of subduction zones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this conference is to discuss infrastructural needs of the experimental groups who study subduction processes. Experimental science directly informs diverse subduction research into earthquake timing and location, magma transport, and volcanic eruptions, through the study of material properties: viscosity, friction, dynamic rupture, poroelasticity, electrical conductivity, phase equilibria, melting, geothermobarometry, permeability, reaction kinetics, and diffusion. Participants for the conference will be drawn from the experimental rock mechanics, experimental petrology/volcanology, and mineral physics communities. Topics to be discussed include community organization and coordination, data and methodological standardization, and technical issues related to experimental studies on subduction zone materials.  Participants will discuss solutions to persistent challenges, identify stakeholders, and seek leaders to coordinate future initiatives.</AbstractNarration>
