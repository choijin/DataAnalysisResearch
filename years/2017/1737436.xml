<AbstractNarration>This 9th U.S.-Japan Joint Seminar on Nanoscale Transport Phenomena, to take place in Tokyo, Japan, is a premier meeting in thermal transport now in its 9th version, providind a specialized international forum for exchange of new interdisciplinary ideas in nanoscale transport phenomena. The focused characteristic of this is an additional attractive point, especially to young researchers interested in nanoscale thermal transport processes. A broad range of participants are expected to attend the meeting, including scientists from academia, national laboratories and industry. Graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and young faculty, with special consideration given to minorities and women, who are engaged in research efforts in nanoscale thermal transport will be invited to attend the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics covered in the meeting are related to nanoscale thermophysics and energy conversion, including thermal transport in emergent energy applications, thermal transport in novel material systems, advanced instrumentation for probing thermal transport at small time or size scales, first principles calculations of thermal transport properties, radiative heat transport at the nanoscale, and phase-change heat transfer. Technical information presented at the meeting will be disseminated broadly, not only through the publication of selected papers in top-quality journals, but also through the recording of the talks to be made publicly available in audio and/or video format via the internet.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The 9th U.S. -Japan Joint Seminar on Nanoscale Transport Phenomena successfully catalyzed discussion and interactions from two distant communities working on similar challenges.  This was a three day conference, held July 2-5 in Tokyo Japan, with approximately 100 attendees ranging from senior faculty to PhD students.  NSF funds were used to support travel of 13 attendees with an emphasis on junior faculty, women, and underrepresented minorities.  The results will be disseminated to the greater thermal sciences community through articles in the international archival journal Nanoscale and Microscale Thermophysical Engineering that summarize the proceedings and offer perspectives on promising emergent research directions.   These articles are either under review or still in preparation but the topic and corresponding author are listed below:  1. Thermoelectric transport in graphene and 2D layered Materials, Mona Zebarjadi (University of Virginia)  2. Thermal Transport in Disordered Materials, Asegun Henry (Georgia Tech)  3. Heat Generation and Thermal Transport in Lithium-Ion Batteries: A Scale-Bridging Perspective, Amy Marconnet (Purdue)  4. Machine Learning Approaches to Nanoscale Thermal Transport, Junichiro Shiomi (University of Tokyo)  5. Spin Thermoelectrics, Jos Heremans (Ohio State University)        In light of her death on February 20, 2017, a session in memorium of Mildred Dresselhaus was held on July 3, 2017.  During this session Arun Majumdar (Stanford), Gang Chen (MIT), Shigeo Maruyama (University of Tokyo), and Joseph Heremans (The Ohio State) gave their personal perspectives on how she made an impact on science and their careers.
