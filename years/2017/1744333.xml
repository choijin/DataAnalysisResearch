<AbstractNarration>Intelligent, interactive, and highly networked machines -- with which people increasingly share their autonomy and agency -- are a growing part of the landscape, particularly in regard to work.  As automation today moves from the factory floor to knowledge and service occupations, insight and action are needed to reap the benefits in increased productivity and increased job opportunities, and to mitigate social costs. Such innovations also have significant implications and potential value for lifelong learning, skills assessments, and job training/retraining in an environment in which workforce demands are changing rapidly. The workshop supported by this award will promote the convergence of cognitive psychology, learning sciences, data science, computer science, and engineering disciplines to define key challenges and research imperatives of the nexus of humans, technology, and work with focus on human affect, motivation, metacognition, and cognition during learning and problem solving.  Convergence is the deep integration of knowledge, theories, methods, and data from multiple fields to form new and expanded frameworks for addressing scientific and societal challenges and opportunities. This convergence workshop addresses the future of work at the human-technology frontier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific focus of this multi-phased workshop approach is to advance fundamental understanding of how to collect and analyze multimodal, multichannel sensor on human affect, motivation, metacognition, and cognition during learning and problem solving, and effectively integrate this data into actionable educational interventions in advanced learning technology environments (e.g., intelligent tutoring systems). The impacts of this research extend to a diverse range of learning environments, and job training and retraining opportunities. A multi-phased workshop approach will be used to explore the implications in multiple job sectors, and the outcomes will be broadly disseminated across geographic and disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ubiquity of vast amounts of time-synchronized multimodal multichannel data has empowered humans to make strategic decisions regarding their health and well-being, economic prosperity, security, and travel. In contrast, scientific use of big data to enhance educational outcomes with advanced learning technologies (ALTs; e.g., intelligent tutoring systems) still lags due tothe complex nature of human learning and the difficulties in identifying, collecting, and analyzing relevant data. Recent advances in the psychological, computing, engineering, mathematical, and statistical sciences have unleashed unprecedented capabilities for decision making using new types of evidence(e.g., multimodal multichannel data from humans) and computational techniques (e.g., deep learning).However, while data science is well established in science, engineering, and business, developing effective solutions to support education still needs substantial research. Beyond the potential to enhancestudent outcomes through just-in-time diagnostic data that are formative for learning and instruction,educational practice could substantially evolve by developing theory-based data-intensive research, thus aiding educators in developing a high quality STEM workforce crucial for our nation to achieve andmaintain its leadership in science, technology, engineering, math, and medicine.     To address these issues, we conducted two workshops that included the following:  assembled the top interdisciplinary      researchers working in the area of multimodal multichannel data under the      same venue, and had these researchers present and      discuss the major advances and significant challenges in their respective      fields related to multimodal multichannel data. engaged the workshop attendees in critical      assessing and discussing conceptual, theoretical,  methodological, analytical, and      educational/training issues related to multimodal multichannel data made recommendations for how current and      future challenges in the area of multimodal multichannel data can and      should be addressed (e.g., new collaborations, international handbook,      special issue of interdisciplinary research, influence federal funding      agencies such as NSF to propose new programs, etc.).   At the two workshops, we had a number of presentations that inluded: (1)  the conceptual and theoretical issues related to self-regulated learning and multimodal SRL data (Winne and Hadwin); (2) measurement issues related to SRL and multimodal data with an emphasis on statistical assumptions that are inherently violated when one collects and analyzes multimodal data (Greene and Jang); (3) using trace methodologies to analyze cognitive and metacognitive processes in computerized tutoring systems (Graesser); (4) emotional and motivational processes including their measurement, analytical, and instructional issues (D'Mello and Linnenbrink-Garcia); (5) data science, data analytics, machine learning, data visualizations, advanced learning technologies and multimodal SRL data (Aleven); (6) linking theory to practice by comparing six contemporary models of self-regulated learning  (Panadero); (7) measurement issues related to emotional and motivational processes that focused on the advanced statistical techniques to measure and analyze complex SRL trace data  (Cromley) and a critical approach to re-conceptualizing the measurement of motivational beliefs as potential trace data that map onto motivational processes (Harackiewicz); (8) fusing multimodal multichannel SRL data using several data mining techniques and how our community can use machine learning to make advanced learning technologies intelligent. (Rowe); and (9) data repositories, data analytics and machine learning methods for analysis of SRL tprocesses across various advanced learning technologies. This included coherence analysis and sequence mining methods (Biswas).   There was also a presentation from NSF fellow, Meghan Houghton, who proceeded to share, disseminate, and discuss several NSF priorities related to our workshop and new funding opportunities that we could target in the coming months and years.   The findings from our workshop are summarized in our final report, and will generate the following outcomes:  A state-of-the-art synthesis article on multimodal multichannel SRL data to be submitted to a major top-tiered interdisciplinary journal; A co-edited an international handbook of multimodal multichannel SRL data;  Continue to collaborate with workshop participants to      conduct workshops and tutorials at leading national and international      conferences such as Cognitive Science, Artificial Intelligence in      Education (AIEd), Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), European Association      for Research on Learning and Instruction (EARLI), and Learning Analytics      and Knowledge (LAK).
