<AbstractNarration>This research will be conducted in collaboration with two Japanese experts in the field of exoplanetary science, Professor Motohide Tamura and Assistant Professor Norio Narita.  Both are scientists at the University of Tokyo, Department of Astronomy. Professor Narita and this project's principal investigator (PI) are members of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Science Team. TESS is a NASA mission that will launch in March 2018 to search most of the sky for relatively nearby transiting exoplanets. With near-term technology, mankind's best chance of finding exoplanets that could host life lies in examining the atmospheres of super-Earth planets transiting relatively cool, low-mass M-dwarf host stars within their habitable zones (Charbonneau &amp; Deming, 2007). Simulations predict that TESS will detect about 1,700 exoplanets over its two-year primary mission, and that one-third of those planets will have radii less than twice that of Earth, with three-quarters of these super-Earths orbiting M-dwarfs (Sullivan et al., 2015). However, simulations also show that TESS will detect over 1,000 astrophysical false positives. Thus, TESS discoveries must be validated as originating from real exoplanets using additional instruments and/or techniques. The Japanese have proposed that their recently-developed Multicolor Simultaneous Camera for Studying Atmospheres of Transiting Exoplanets (MuSCAT) at Okayama Observatory be used as a tool to distinguish TESS-discovered exoplanets from false positives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this research project is to simulate follow-up observations of TESS detections using MuSCAT, thereby revealing which planet candidates can be efficiently validated using MUSCAT, and which must be validated using other techniques. This understanding will allow astronomers to better prioritize and optimize follow-up validations of TESS detections, which in turn will lead to optimal use of valuable space assets, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Transiting exoplanets can be distinguished from astrophysical false positives by determining the wavelength/color-dependence of the amount of stellar light received transiting exoplanets are largely achromatic when observed in different bandpasses. Thus, TESS discoveries can be validated as true transiting exoplanets by determining the wavelength/color-dependence of the amount of stellar light detected on Earth. The PI will simulate MuSCAT observations of TESS detections by developing a software code that models the performance of the MuSCAT instrument (Narita et al., 2015) and accounts for all significant noise sources, such as photon noise, sky background noise, and scintillation noise. TESS planet candidates will vary tremendously in terms of parameters such as the temperature and brightness of the host star, or size and orbital distance of the planet. To provide a realistic estimate of likely candidate planets, the PI will use the database of simulated TESS-detected exoplanets published by Sullivan et al. (2015), as well as simulated false positives detected by TESS (available to the TESS Science team).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is currently scheduled to launch in April 2018, beginning a 2-year wide-field survey of most of the sky, searching for transiting exoplanets orbiting bright, nearby stars.  During its mission, TESS is predicted to discover over a thousand exoplanets smaller than Neptune in size, but it will also discover many astrophysical false positives.  Japan?s recently-developed Multicolor Simultaneous Camera for Studying Atmospheres of Transiting Exoplanets (MuSCAT) at Okayama Observatory may be used as a tool to distinguish TESS-discovered exoplanets from false positives. During this project, a simulation code was developed to predict the capability of MuSCAT to distinguish between astrophysical false positives and actual exoplanets.  The Principal Investigator (PI) for MuSCAT serves on the TESS Follow-Up Program (TFOP) Sub-Group 1 (SG1), and the simulations will prove helpful as the TESS team begins to validate TESS discoveries circa August 2018.  In addition, a paper regarding this project should be published by December 2018.  The East Asia and Pacific Summer Institute (EAPSI) program has given the graduate student PI for this project the invaluable opportunity to build international contacts within the Japanese astronomical community.  The MuSCAT PI has become a member of her dissertation committee, and the MuSCAT simulation project is an important component of her dissertation project.  The EAPSI program has enabled future international collaborations with Japan as she completes her PhD and continues her career as a professional astronomer.
