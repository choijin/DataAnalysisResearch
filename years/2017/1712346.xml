<AbstractNarration>1712346 - Law &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Princeton Summer School is to provide the next generation of combustion researchers and practicing engineers with comprehensive knowledge in the areas of combustion chemistry, theory, experiment, computation, and application. For the past seven years, the summer school session has offered daily morning and afternoon lectures taught at an accelerated pace over five days. The program typically consists of the foundational courses of combustion chemistry and combustion theory, as well as enrichment courses on practical combustion systems and laser diagnostics. The feedback from past participants has been uniformly enthusiastic for the learning and networking experience. The proposed support for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers is to partially offset part of the costs for travel and lodging (on Princeton's campus) at the 2016 Princeton-CEFRC-CI Summer School on Combustion. The camp-like environment provides ample opportunities for students to interact intimately with established researchers as well as among themselves. Such a learning opportunity is usually not offered on a university campus and should help develop the next-generation leader in combustion research and industry for the nation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Objective  The Princeton-CEFRC Summer School on Combustion has been a part of the outreach program of the Combustion Energy Frontier Research Center (CEFRC), which was one of the 46 Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs) established by DOE in 2009. The goal of the Center is to develop a validated, predictive, multi-scale, combustion modeling capability to optimize the design and operation of evolving fuels, especially biofuels, in advanced engines for transportation applications.  The Summer School program was conceived by recognizing that while combustion is an interdisciplinary subject, due to limitations at individual institutions the training received by most combustion researchers has not been sufficiently comprehensive to equip them to make breakthrough discoveries. The Summer School therefore aims to offer advanced graduate level courses to remedy this deficiency.  The 2017 session of this annual summer school was substantially supported by a substantial grant from the Combustion Institute (CI), with additional grants from NSF, ARO, KAUST and Princeton University. The title of this session was thus modified to 2017 Princeton-Combustion Institute Summer School on Combustion to reflect this substantial support.  Approach  The 2017 session was held from June 25 through June 30. There were 181 participants coming from 12 countries and 28 US states, representing 61 US and non-US universities, 4 U.S. government labs and corporations. 151 of the participants were graduate students and 30 were professionals.   For the academic program, the foundational courses of Combustion Theory and Combustion Chemistry were offered again, as in previous years. This year, Combustion Theory was taught by Professor Moshe Matalon from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, and Combustion and Fuels Chemistry and Kinetics was taught by Professor William H. Green of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Three enrichment courses were also offered: Advanced Laser Diagnostics in Turbulent Combustion was taught by Professor Andreas Dreizler of Technische Universitat Darmstadt, Germany; Advanced Combustion Chemistry was co-taught by Dr. Stephen J. Klippenstein of  Argonne National Laboratory and Professor Tianfeng Lu of University of Connecticut; and Frontiers in Combustion Technologies was co-taught by Professor Yiguang Ju of Princeton University and Dr. George A. Richards of National Energy Technology Laboratory.  Detailed lecture notes were prepared and distributed to the participants in advance of the session and all lectures were professionally taped and made freely available to the general public through the Princeton University web site.  Participants lived in an air-conditioned dormitory setting and had meals together in the student cafeteria, hence facilitating networking. Room and board expenses for all U.S. students were covered by the summer school.      Relevance to NSF  Many participants were involved in research projects supported by NSF. The enrichment of their knowledge in combustion will benefit the progress of these research projects. Furthermore, it is anticipated that many of the graduate students will become active researchers in combustion and propulsion in the future, some assuming leadership positions. This Summer School experience will undoubtedly prove useful as they carry out their responsibilities.  Accomplishments for Reporting Period  181 participants coming from 12 countries and 28 US states, representing 61 US and non-US universities, 4 U.S. government labs and corporations attended the 2017 summer school. 151 of the participants were graduate students and 30 were professionals. Participants were highly satisfied with the experience, with many laudatory feedback comments. All lectures were professional taped and are freely available to the general public through the Princeton University web-site and YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/user/PrincetonCEFRC/playlists?sort=dd&amp;shelf_id=14&amp;view=50   Detailed lecture notes are freely available to the general public through Princeton University?s web-site at https://cefrc.princeton.edu/combustion-summer-school/archived-programs/2017-session/lecture-notes          Last Modified: 03/01/2018       Submitted by: Chung K Law]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
