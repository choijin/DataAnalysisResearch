<AbstractNarration>The "Blazing the Trail for STEM Teachers: A Noyce Capacity Building Project" aims to address the demand for qualified STEM teachers in the high-need school district of Manchester, New Hampshire. The long-term goal of the project team is to create a comprehensive program at Saint Anselm College (SAC) that will recruit, prepare, and support an increased number of STEM majors skilled at teaching in high-needs urban schools. This goal is relevant to resolving the critical shortage of qualified secondary STEM teachers in Manchester and across New Hampshire. In this project, the PI and Co-PI will work with other members of the SAC community to determine whether an innovative semester-long after-school teaching experience is effective for recruiting SAC STEM majors to pursue a joint degree in education. This project will lay the foundation for a future Noyce Teacher Scholarships and Stipends (Track 1) proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three primary goals: (1) gauge the interest of STEM majors in STEM teaching as a profession; (2) improve the perception of STEM students and faculty regarding a teaching career; and (3) increase the number of STEM students pursuing a joint education degree and a degree in a STEM discipline. The project will be driven by two interrelated objectives: (1) determine whether a semester-long after-school teaching experience can attract STEM majors to consider a career in teaching; and (2) identify the root cause(s) of the current low interest in STEM education, so that interventions can be designed. Research approaches include assessment of STEM major interest via the STEM Career Interest Survey (STEM-CIS) taken by all first year SAC STEM majors. Attitudes about urban schools and students will be measured with a pre-/post-questionnaire and an exit interview. The interest in STEM education across campus will be measured with a survey developed by the project team, the "STEM Faculty Attitudes about Teaching as a Career Survey." This project will expand the Noyce portfolio by adding the perspective of a small, urban, liberal-arts college and by impacting Manchester, NH, a community with a large refugee population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>There are dire shortages of teachers in physics, chemistry, and mathematics. In order to explore why STEM-interested students do not often pursue secondary education careers at Saint Anselm College, the Noyce Capacity Building Project had two main objectives:</p> <p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify the root causes of low numbers of STEM (science, technology, education, and math) students in the secondary education (grades 7-12) program at Saint Anselm College.</p> <p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Determine whether a semester-long after-school teaching experience is effective to attract STEM majors to high school teaching.</p> <p>For the first objective, we created a working group of faculty from several STEM departments and the Education Department at Saint Anselm College to discuss potential causes of low enrollment numbers in STEM secondary education at our institution. This group created two surveys. The student survey was administered to the rising sophomores at the end of their freshman year and to the new freshmen arriving in the fall. Results from 39 respondents show that almost a third of these students would be interested in exploring teaching as an option, a higher percentage than is usually engaged in the teaching program. However, these students have not had any teaching experiences, and they wanted to see if they&rsquo;d like it. The second survey asked STEM faculty members about the importance of encouraging students to pursue a career in secondary education. These responses show that half of respondents would advise the double major in Secondary Education for a STEM student interested in secondary education. These results indicate that the culture of the college is generally supportive for STEM students who show an interest in teaching. However, they also suggest that students need to be exposed to early teaching experiences. This has the potential of increasing the number of undergraduate students who are both educated and talented in STEM and well-trained in teaching methods to work in secondary education.</p> <p>For the second objective, we recruited seven faculty members to develop four new STEM courses for Access Academy, an after-school program run through Saint Anselm&rsquo;s Meelia Center for Community Engagement. These courses were: Science in Books and Movies, Q is for Quantum, Radios for Jupiter, and Remote Sensing. We recruited eight undergraduate STEM majors as instructors to further develop and teach these courses to immigrant, refugee, and underrepresented high school students from the Manchester, New Hampshire, school district. They worked with four other undergraduate instructors who were already double majors in a STEM field and in Secondary Education, bringing the total number of undergraduates supported to twelve. These courses engaged approximately 40 high school students, with class sizes ranging from eight to sixteen. The lesson plans for all four new STEM courses have been archived at the Meelia Center and are available for future Access Academy instructors to use and adapt. Most of the undergraduate instructors recruited for Access Academy by this project who did not graduate after the conclusion of this funding continued to work as instructors at Access Academy the following year.</p> <p>Seven of the eight recruited instructors were interviewed about their experiences at the end of the year, and all reported positive experiences. One instructor, a graduating senior, declared an interest in pursuing teaching after graduation. Five instructors never considered teaching but now may consider it in the future, and one instructor still does not consider teaching a career choice, largely due to financial concerns. In addition, we interviewed an eighth undergraduate student not supported by the grant who was a graduating senior STEM major and who volunteered with Access Academy in their last semester. This experience led them to apply for and accept a position as a high school teacher upon graduation. The strong interest in teaching as a career among graduating seniors was striking, and providing undergraduates with teaching experiences during their freshman and sophomore years could allow them to add a secondary education major. This would ensure that these students are well prepared upon entering the middle or high school classroom. Full analysis of the interviews and surveys is being completed for publication in a science education journal. A preprint of these results will be made publicly available through arXiv.org.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/10/2021<br>      Modified by: Kelly&nbsp;Demers</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1758227/1758227_10534881_1628530433503_20190219_161001--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1758227/1758227_10534881_1628530433503_20190219_161001--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Access Academy"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1758227/1758227_10534881_1628530433503_20190219_161001--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Access Academy"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Undergraduate instructors working with high school students in Access Academy</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nicole Gugliucci</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nicole&nbsp;Gugliucci</div> <div class="imageTitle">Access Academy</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1758227/1758227_10534881_1628530502001_20190312_163056--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1758227/1758227_10534881_1628530502001_20190312_163056--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Hands-on learning"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1758227/1758227_10534881_1628530502001_20190312_163056--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Hands-on learning"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">High school students working with science equipment under the guidance of undergraduate instructors in Access Academy.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nicole Gugliucci</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nicole&nbsp;Gugliucci</div> <div class="imageTitle">Hands-on learning</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1758227/1758227_10534881_1628530576573_20190410_172358--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1758227/1758227_10534881_1628530576573_20190410_172358--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student presentations"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1758227/1758227_10534881_1628530576573_20190410_172358--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student presentations"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">High school students present their results at Access Academy's conclusion</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nicole Gugliucci</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nicole&nbsp;Gugliucci</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student presentations</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
