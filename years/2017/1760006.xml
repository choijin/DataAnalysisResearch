<AbstractNarration>Hurricane Harvey made landfall Friday 25 August 2017 about 30 miles northeast of Corpus Christi, Texas as a Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 130 mph. This is the strongest hurricane to hit the middle Texas coast since Carla in 1961. After the wind storm and storm surge, coastal flooding occurred due to the storm lingering over Texas for four more days, dumping as much as 50 inches of rain near Houston. This will produce one of the largest floods ever to hit the Texas coast, and it is estimated that the flood will be a one in a thousand year event. The Texas coast is characterized by lagoons behind barrier islands, and their ecology and biogeochemistry are strongly influenced by coastal hydrology. Because this coastline is dominated by open water systems and productivity is driven by the amount of freshwater inflow, Hurricane Harvey represents a massive inflow event that will likely cause tremendous changes to the coastal environments. Therefore, questions arise regarding how biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nutrients, and oxygen will be altered, whether massive phytoplankton blooms will occur, whether estuarine species will die when these systems turn into lakes, and how long recovery will take? The investigators are uniquely situated to mount this study not only because of their location, just south of the path of the storm, but most importantly because the lead investigator has conducted sampling of these bays regularly for the past thirty years, providing a tremendous context in which to interpret the new data gathered. The knowledge gained from this study will provide a broader understanding of the effects of similar high intensity rainfall events, which are expected to increase in frequency and/or intensity in the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary research hypothesis is that: Increased inflows to estuaries will cause increased loads of inorganic and organic matter, which will in turn drive primary production and biological responses, and at the same time significantly enhance respiration of coastal blue carbon. A secondary hypothesis is that: The large change in salinity and dissolved oxygen deficits will kill or stress many estuarine and marine organisms. To test these hypotheses it is necessary to measure the temporal change in key indicators of biogeochemical processes, and biodiversity shifts. Thus, changes to the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen cycles, and the diversity of benthic organisms will be measured and compared to existing baselines. The PIs propose to sample the Lavaca-Colorado, Guadalupe, Nueces, and Laguna Madre estuaries as follows: 1) continuous sampling (via autonomous instruments) of salinity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and depth (i.e. tidal elevation); 2) bi-weekly to monthly sampling for dissolved and total organic carbon and organic nitrogen, carbonate system parameters, nutrients, and phytoplankton community composition; 3) quarterly measurements of sediment characteristics and benthic infauna. The project will support two graduate students. The PIs will communicate results to the public and to state agencies through existing collaborations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Hurricane Harvey made landfall Friday, 25 August 2017, at 22:00 Central Time about 30 miles northeast of Corpus Christi, Texas as a Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 130 mph.  This was the strongest hurricane to hit the middle Texas coast since Carla in 1961.  After the wind storm and storm surge, coastal flooding occurred due to the storm lingering over Texas for four more days, dumping as much as 50" of rain near Houston.  This produced one of the largest floods ever to hit the Texas coast, and it is estimated that the flood will be a 1:1000 year event.  Increased inflows to the estuaries caused increased loads of inorganic and organic matter, which in turn enhanced respiration of coastal "blue carbon" and dissolved oxygen dropped to near zero for 5 days.  The large input of riverine carbon and storm disturbance caused extensive estuarine "exhalation" in the Guadalupe Estuary (i.e., San Antonio Bay), with the one-month period following Harvey accounting for 35% of annual estuarine carbon dioxide release. In addition, the flood also caused a large change in salinity.  The climatic conditions in the Guadalupe Estuary prior to the storm were relatively average with salinity around 10 salinity units prior to the storm.  As the storm approached, storm surge pushed salinities over 30 with in-rushing sea water.  Salinities then dropped as the storm passed and the rain swollen rivers began to flow.  Salinity dropped to zero within 7 days of the storm and stayed at that level for over a week.  The combination of low oxygen and low salinity caused a massive die off of bottom living organisms.  Water column conditions returned to normal after about two weeks, but bottom dwelling organisms did not return to normal until 9 months later.  Working with other scientists who studied the storm effects, the information was communicated to State resource managers, industrial water users, and broad groups of concerned community members, because the information is important for understanding the effects of floods and large freshwater inflow events on bay and estuary health.  The information is being used by Stakeholder groups responsible for recommending inflow standards for bays and estuaries.  Many students were trained during project including four doctorate, two masters, undergraduate, and high school students.
