<AbstractNarration>Hyperbolic geometry is a non-Euclidean geometry that has applications in many areas in sciences and engineering. The geometry of the hyperbolic plane that is one of the counterexamples found in the nineteenth century to the classic Parallel Postulate inspires a similar construction performed over the complex numbers rather than the real numbers.  Discrete groups of rigid motions are harder to understand and to exhibit in the complex hyperbolic setting than in the more familiar real hyperbolic environment, and these projects aim to greatly expand the collection of known symmetry groups of this type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of discrete subgroups of Lie groups has some major general results or families of examples that remain without counterparts for lattices in the isometry group of complex hyperbolic n-space, especially results on (non)arithmetic subgroups.  These projects will study lattices generated by reflections in PU(n, 1) for n at least 2, geometric aspects of arithmetic lattices, and deformations of hyperbolic 3-manifold groups into PU(3, 1).  Goals include the production of infinitely many distinct commensurability classes of nonarithmetic lattices in PU(2, 1) and to obtain other infinite families of lattices generated by reflections, such as the Picard modular groups.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Broader Impacts:<br /><br />This award promoted the education and training of postdoctoral researchers, graduate, undergraduate and high school students as well as future high school Mathematics teachers. With the recent advances in both the theoretical understanding of these areas and the technological capability for visualizing/computing with the corresponding geometric objects, it is an excellent time to advertise to students and the general public that Geometry, and Mathematics in general, is a vibrant and exciting research area.<br /><br />The PI, his former postdoc mentee Alice Mark and his former students Joe Wells and David Polletta hosted sessions at the ASU Math Circle each semester, on topics related to the project - geometry, topology, tessellations, reflection groups, circle packings, billiards, etc... The ASU Math circle is a biweekly workshop for high-school students wishing to learn Mathematics at a higher level, or connected to a higher level, than what they learn in class. The PI also hosted a booth at the Math Fest at Fuller elementary school in Tempe AZ. These activities promote the understanding of advanced Math and Science to many students who wouldn't usually, or yet, have access to them. The PI also redesigned and taught the Introduction to Geometry class for future secondary-education Math teachers at ASU.<br /><br />More specifically, the PI and his collaborators, PhD students and postodtoral mentee made significant advances on the following projects, resulting in the publications listed above (and a pending publication with Alice Mark):<br /><br />(1) New non-arithmetic complex hyperbolic lattices, joint with Martin Deraux and John Parker,<br /><br />(2) Hybrid lattices, thisn subgroups and non-arithmetic hybrids, joint with the PI's former student Joseph Wells with further work by Wells,<br /><br />(3) Presentations for cusped arithmetic hyperbolic lattices, joint with (former postdoc mentee) Alice Mark, with further work by the PI's former student David Polletta,<br /><br />(4) Reflection groups, involution and commutator length for complex hyperbolic isometries, joint with Pierre Will.<br /><br />Projects (1) and (2) present two different approaches for constructing new non-arithmetic lattices in higher-dimensional complex hyperbolic spaces. In (1) the PI and collaborators have constructed new families of non-arithmetic lattices in dimension 2, greatly expanding the number of known examples and aiming to eventually construct infinitely many. In (2) the rough idea is to construct new non-arithmetic lattices by combining lower-dimensional arithmetic lattices. Wells' results prove that this construction works in dimension 2 and the next step is to push this to higher dimensions.<br /><br />Part (3) uses the geometry of the tessellation corresponding to an arithmetic lattice to obtain algebraic information about the group, namely a presentation, which is not accessible by other means. This has allowed us to produce explicit, computationally useful presentations which were previously out of reach.<br /><br />Part (4) includes concrete criteria to decide whether a given lattice is generated by reflections, which in turn provides us with geometric tools to better understand the lattice.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/24/2021<br>      Modified by: Julien&nbsp;Paupert</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1708463/1708463_10511827_1629851895264_d=7covering6--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1708463/1708463_10511827_1629851895264_d=7covering6--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Covering a 3-dimensional slice of complex hyperbolic space by horoballs"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1708463/1708463_10511827_1629851895264_d=7covering6--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Covering a 3-dimensional slice of complex hyperbolic space by horoballs"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">In our paper with Alice Mark, a key technical point is to determine the maximal height of a horoball H whose images cover the whole space.
