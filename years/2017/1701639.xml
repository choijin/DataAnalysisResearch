<AbstractNarration>This study will analyze class variation in the ways couples share their financial resources. The project will address theoretical debates about whether retaining autonomous control over earnings facilitates women?s ability to convert money into power within their relationships. Investigating how couples allocate money will help resolve the theoretical puzzle of why women's increased labor force participation has not been a sufficient condition to reducing gender inequality in the home. This research will add conceptual clarity to the ways gender and economic circumstances combine to structure family relations. Securing the welfare of all individuals within households is a matter of public concern and this study is expected to expand knowledge about women's economic position in society. How families share money influences relationship quality and the distribution of resources when relationships end, an event that often disproportionately disadvantages women economically. The research will contribute to our understanding of the stability of adult intimate relationships, a topic important to policy makers.&lt;br/&gt;Economic changes in society altered the dynamic of financial resources brought into relationships and family structures are increasingly diverse. Modern couples confront tensions between ideals of mutual family interests and values of individualism, a departure from fitting themselves into culturally expected family arrangements of the past. Interpretations of why individuals increasingly withhold money from a common family pot are inconsistent and sometimes contradictory, and has generated competing claims about what the trend symbolizes: a rise in the instability of families, a shift towards individualist interests within marriages, or evidence of movement towards an ethos of gender equality. Class disparities in the risk of financial hardship may also influence the goals and resources available to families. This project uses semi-structured interviews with couples to understand how couples' allocation of money mitigates or exacerbates gender equality within families and whether the strategies used to achieve couples' goals are conditional on class position. The interviews will focus on life transitions associated with changes in financial allocations approaches and addresses the paradoxes between the stated reasoning behind couples? allocation systems and the actual consequences of their organizational approaches.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary:  Existing research on the treatment of money in families  contains inconsistent and sometimes contradictory interpretations about the  meaning of couples' pooling and management of income. Increases in the number  of couples who keep some form of independent money system, where couples  maintain individual control of their earnings and keep their money separate,  may result from a variety of reasons, including non-commitment to the union, a  desire to create equal partnerships, or for logistical reasons such as  maintaining a personal checking account established prior to the relationship.  Disentangling the mechanisms of how money is treated in families is essential  to explaining persistently unequal division of household labor between men and  women and is essential to improving understanding of class variation in the  reasoning behind and consequences of couples' financial arrangements.  Using an original survey and semi-structured interviews,  this project collected demographic data and attitude and behavioral  information from 57 participants (28 couples) living in 14 states and the  District of Columbia. NSF funds were sought to offset costs associated with data  collection and analysis such as participant recruitment and materials to record  and transcribe the audio.  Intellectual merit:  Interview data collected will be used to help unravel the  theoretical puzzle of why increases in women's financial resources often fail  to reduce gender inequality in the home, providing essential data about  pathways to gender equality and stability for all families. The project also provides  the necessary data to make sense of class differences and similarities in how  couples negotiate togetherness and independence in their families. Ultimately,  the data collected will be used to improve researchers' measurement of the  ways couples integrate and manage financial resources and their interpretation  of these arrangements.  Broader Impacts:  Evidence increasingly suggests that inequality located in families  is the next barrier to achieving gender equality in society.
