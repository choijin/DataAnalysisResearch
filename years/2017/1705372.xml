<AbstractNarration>An air separation plant separates atmospheric air into its primary gas components: nitrogen, oxygen, argon and other less abundant gases.  Air separation plants are also primary source providers for a number of important industries, such as hospitals, steel mills, and chemical refineries.  A major issue that air separation plants face is the potential for disruption in the deliveries of their products due to equipment breakdown. The current state of the art for increasing reliability of these plants and other related chemical processes is to use simulation tools to assess different design alternatives in terms of equipment redundancy, additional inventory and preventive maintenance. Given the very large number of design alternatives, there is a clear need for developing systematic tools based on optimization that can address these problems. Furthermore, the study of interactions with other objectives, such as minimum cost, minimum environmental impact, and maximum safety, is essential if the ultimate goal is to design sustainable process systems. The proposed collaboration between an academic research group and an industrial partner, Praxair, aims to address the problem of how to incorporate reliability in the optimal design and operation of process systems, a problem that has received little attention in the literature. This research project will involve summer internships at Praxair for participating graduate students. The basic methodologies and findings from this project are being disseminated to petroleum, chemical and engineering/software companies through the website of the Center for Advanced Process Decision-making at Carnegie Mellon. Undergraduate students are involved in this research project, and the research team is pursuing engineering-based outreach activities targeted towards high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concept behind this research project is based on a general multi-objective optimization framework in which the minimization of cost and maximization of availability, defined as the percentage of plant uptime, are included as major objectives.  This research project focuses on mathematical modeling based on mixed-integer nonlinear programming for the maximization of the availability objective, since reliability is the major concern in this project. Models that rely on a probability based approach and are mostly aimed at determining the optimal level of redundancy of process equipment are being addressed first. These models are useful for the synthesis stage of a process system. Next, the development of models based on Markov processes are being considered. These models are more general and well suited for detailed designs and retrofits, because they handle time dependent probabilities and inventories and process flows (although they are computationally expensive, since they work explicitly with discrete states of the system). The extension of these models for maintenance scheduling and spare parts inventory is also considered, with objectives such as environmental impact, safety, flexibility and resiliency. The proposed multi-objective optimization framework will allow consideration of other objectives such as safety, environmental impact, flexibility and resiliency.</AbstractNarration>
