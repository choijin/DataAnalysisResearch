<AbstractNarration>A workshop "Height Zeta Functions" will take place April 28-30, 2017 at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The organizers of this workshop are Ramin Takloo-Bighash (University of Illinois at Chicago) and Yuri Tschinkel (NYU and Simons Foundation). The confirmed speakers are Margaret Bilu (Orsay), Tim Browning (Bristol), Alex Eskin (University of Chicago), Alex Gorodnik (Bristol), Brian Lehmann (Boston College), Daniel Loughran (Manchester), Lilian Matthiesen (KTH, Stockholm), Sho Tanimoto (Copenhagen), Yuri Tschinkel (NYU and Simons Foundation), Tony Varilly-Alvarado (Rice), and Takehiko Yasuda (Osaka). The website of the workshop is https://sites.google.com/site/rtakloo/2017-atkin-workshop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of the workshop is exploring the connections between the arithmetic and geometry of algebraic varieties in the context of Manin's conjectures on the distribution of rational points. We hope that bringing together experts working in the area would create an environment in which to exchange ideas and to start new projects.Funding from the National Science Foundation makes it possible for junior researchers, graduate students, and other mathematicians without travel funds to attend this exciting workshop. This is an excellent opportunity for them to interact with expert and be inspired for further work. The lectures by invited speakers will happen on April 29 and 30. Select lectures will be videotaped, and will be made available on a website to make the lectures available to the mathematical community. The slides of talks will be made available on the same website.</AbstractNarration>
