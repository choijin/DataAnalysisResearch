<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: &lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation grant co funded by ECCS and CMMI of the Engineering directorate awarded to the University of Washington at Bothell provides funding for the acquisition of a variable-pressure scanning electron microscope with an Energy Dispersive X-Ray analysis. This high resolution imaging microscope fosters innovative research and facilitates multidisciplinary research collaborations at UW Bothell, a primarily undergraduate institution, with a large pool of talented students who have been traditionally underrepresented in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). While the primary use of the SEM and EDX will be in support of research, it will also be integrated into research training and course curricula. The SEM will provide undergraduate students and graduate students with valuable hands-on experience in operating state-of-the-art instrumentation, an essential skill for students interested in future graduate studies and careers in STEM fields. Moreover, the instrument's impact on students with diverse background will be substantial, as forty nine percent of incoming first year students at UW Bothell are the first in their families to earn a four-year degree and seventy percent of first year students are from diverse backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: &lt;br/&gt;The enhanced nanometer scale imaging resolution and elemental analysis capabilities will significantly enhance a large number of ongoing projects in science and engineering, including: (1) Development of highly efficient light trapping structures for organic solar cells; (2) Investigation of neural probes for neurotransmitter sensing; (3) Examining the impact of mutualistic coevolution on microbial phenotypes; (4) Characterization of novel bearing surfaces for total joint replacements as well as for the microstructure of electrically conducting polymer hydrogels; and, (5) Investigation of failure in polyurethane transformer structures. In addition, the instrument provides other capabilities such as energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy microanalysis system, which can be used to determine the elemental composition of a specimen.</AbstractNarration>

Acquisition of the Hitachi SU5000 SEM/EDX system is transforming education at UWB by embedding research and research training within traditional lecture-based courses. More than 5 STEM courses are ready to utilize the proposed SEM/EDX in their courses, hence, better preparing UWB graduates for successful STEM careers. Because the UWB is the most diverse campus in the State of Washington (43% of the student body are students of color and 64% of the incoming first year class is comprised of students from diverse backgrounds) and 48% of incoming first-year students are first-generation college students, implementation of this project will provide access to the state-of-the-art research equipment to a population of those students that may not otherwise get this opportunity. The SEM/EDX will be a key instrument used for active student recruitment events targeting women and minorities as well as K-12 outreach activities. UWB will facilitate accesses from local companies and community colleges as well.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/20/2018<br>      Modified by: Seungkeun&nbsp;Choi</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1725588/1725588_10520721_1542703022760_SEM-Room--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1725588/1725588_10520721_1542703022760_SEM-Room--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SEM Room"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1725588/1725588_10520721_1542703022760_SEM-Room--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SEM Room"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Installed Hitach SU 5000 SEM and Oxford EDX system</div> <div class="imageCredit">Seungkeun Choi</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Seungkeun&nbsp;Choi</div> <div class="imageTitle">SEM Room</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1725588/1725588_10520721_1542703649801_NanoPDMS_No0007--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1725588/1725588_10520721_1542703649801_NanoPDMS_No0007--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Nano patterns on PDMS"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1725588/1725588_10520721_1542703649801_NanoPDMS_No0007--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Nano patterns on PDMS"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Nano patterns are copied from a silicon master structure into a PDMS mold.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Seungkeun Choi</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Seungkeun&nbsp;Choi</div> <div class="imageTitle">Nano patterns on PDMS</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1725588/1725588_10520721_1542703791300_SEM-sample1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1725588/1725588_10520721_1542703791300_SEM-sample1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Seramic nano particles"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1725588/1725588_10520721_1542703791300_SEM-sample1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Seramic nano particles"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Seramic nano particles</div> <div class="imageCredit">Seungkeun Choi</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Seungkeun&nbsp;Choi</div> <div class="imageTitle">Seramic nano particles</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
