<AbstractNarration>In this current era of nanotechnology, the science and engineering community need a more accurate way to describe and predict the motion and interaction of subatomic particles. The researcher has preliminary data showing that the result from a uniquely different quantum mechanical spin model tentatively agrees with the well-known standard model; however, it has the distinct advantage of potentially providing a better quantum spin interpretation. The project will continue using this highly complicated representation of quantum spin to model a realistic 3D object. The researcher will have access to a supercomputer at the Massey University in Auckland, New Zealand. More importantly, the researcher will be under the supervision of Dr. Joshua Bodyfelt who excels in highly complicated nonlinear computational models, which is crucial for the success of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a recent publication it was discussed that it may be possible to understand the quantum mechanical spin states in a similar method used in deterministic chaos, specifically in driven nonlinear dissipative systems. The project shows further insight regarding the process of the quantum mechanical collapse using this model, where preliminary data has reproduced the quantum spin statistics in a Stern-Gerlach device.  There will be a semi-classical interpretation of the torque due to the magnetic field to incorporate a two-sided torque function of the angle, Ã¨, that the magnetic moment makes with the magnetic field. Ultimately the complete semi-classical model simulation utilizes a highly complex nonlinear dynamics process, exhibiting quantum spin statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Royal Society of New Zealand.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An analytical solution to a complete 3D magnetic field from a Stern-Gerlach device, along with the curl and divergence in all of space, was calculated and represented.  Multiple 3D semi-classical torque models have been created and tested against the traditional quantum statistics.  This was done using distributed computing at the Centre for Theoretical Chemistry and Physics at Massey University thanks to the help and expertise of the host researcher, Dr. Joshua D. Bodyfelt.  Due to the inability to currently match quantum statistics, further torque models and equations of motion are being implemented and tested.  The preliminary results from the research in this project results in the potential to advance the understanding of quantum spin interpretation.  In general, a deeper understanding of quantum mechanics will have profound implications on all fields surrounding it. For example, as technology becomes more condensed physically, a more complete understanding is needed to help build and control devices in the quantum domain.  The preliminary data is suggesting a completely different way to analyze, represent, and understand quantum systems.  Since there exists multiple phenomena at the quantum level that have yet to be satisfyingly explained, this alternative understanding of a quantum spin can give further insight into reality.  The university attended by the proposer does not have a graduate program that specializes in computational physics and specifically nonlinear dynamics. The network and relationship between the host researcher and the proposer through this project will allow other students and faculty, who are also seeking further expertise in computational nonlinear dynamics, to benefit from this partnership.  As a result of this project, the host researcher is now currently an adjunct faculty member in the department of Physics and Astronomy for the university attended by the proposer.  As such, the host researcher can directly influence and help further students, faculty members, and expand the expertise of the department.  The conclusion of the research and data analysis of this proposal will be shared to the science field and the community in the form of a publication.  Society as a whole will profit as scientists, especially in the Nano-science community, incorporate the results of this research in their respective fields.
