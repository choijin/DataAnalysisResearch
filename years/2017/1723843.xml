<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of U.S. based early career scientists in the biennial Gordon Research Conference on Coastal Ocean Dynamics and its associated Gordon Research Seminar. This conference brings together a diverse group of academic, federal and international researchers to share the latest advances and identify new challenges in coastal ocean dynamics. The conference focuses on novel and recent developments in the application of observations, theory, and numerical modeling and simulation to furthering understanding of coastal ocean processes and our capabilities for their prediction. It is at the coast that human activities are most connected with ocean circulation, and ocean modeling offers great promise for connecting scientific research to societal needs through such efforts as forecasting for marine operations and maritime safety, monitoring and prediction of water quality and the transport and dispersal of water borne pathogens, mapping and characterizing the habitats of marine life, and downscaling global models of climate variability and climatic change to infer their impacts in the coastal zone. The most important broader impact of the conference is the establishment and nurturing of relationships between senior researchers, junior researchers and students. Nearly half of the conference time is allocated to informal interactions among participants, to provide numerous opportunities to build these relationships and exchange ideas among people in different age groups, different sub-disciplines of the field, or from different geographic regions. Funds will be used to expand the demographic, professional and geographic diversity of participants by supporting attendance by under-represented and under-resourced groups who stand to benefit from the intellectual environment and networking opportunities of the Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar formats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding for travel and registration support to U.S. based early-career professionals and students to attend the Gordon Research Conference on Coastal Ocean Dynamics which will be held at the University of New England in Biddeford, Maine, June 10-16, 2017. This conference, convened every two years now that the former GRC Coastal Ocean Circulation and Coastal Ocean Modeling have been combined, brings together a diverse group of academic, federal and international researchers to share the latest advances and identify new challenges in coastal ocean dynamics. Here the term "coastal" refers to estuarine, littoral zone, continental shelf, and shelf-break regions, including mesoscale exchange processes with the adjacent deep-ocean or marginal seas.  The topics covered will include: 1) High-Latitude Coastal Dynamics and Exchange Processes; 2) Coastal Modeling and Data Assimilation; 3) Recent Advances in Estuarine Dynamics; 4) Fluxes and Transformation across the Outer to Inner Shelves; 5) Coastal Sediment Transport Processes; 6) Challenges and Successes in Physical Oceanography for the Understanding of Fisheries and Other Ecosystems; 7) New Techniques in Satellite Assimilation and Remote Sensing; 8) Multi-Scale Interactions of Coastal Physics and Biogeochemistry; and 9) Recent Anomalous Ocean Conditions and the Coasts Where we Live. In 2017 the Coastal Ocean Dynamics GRC will be accompanied by a Gordon Research Seminar that specifically targets professional development of students and early career scientists, thereby greatly expanding the broader impact of the GRC itself. New in 2017 is a GRC Power Hour, created to support the professional growth of women in our scientific communities and to build on GRC's history of inclusion.</AbstractNarration>

The 2017 GRC on Coastal Ocean Dynamics was another successful meeting that presented cutting-edge science in a setting that allows open dialogue and informal opportunities to exchange information.
