<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was focused on the application of equivariant and homotopy-theoretic aspects of Floer homology to problems in three-dimensional topology.  One main product of this research was a proof that the homology cobordism group of integer homology spheres admits an infinite-rank summand, using the involutive Floer homology theory, inspired by equivariant monopole Floer homology.  A related extension of Hom's proof that there is an infinite-rank summand of the knot concordance group of topologically slice knots was developed as well.  In a similar direction, the subgroup of the homology cobordism group generated by almost-rational plumbed manifolds was studied, and a partial description of their involutive Floer homology was obtained.  Further products of this research were related to Khovanov homology.  Namely, a homotopy-theoretic refinement of odd Khovanov homology was developed, and an equivariant structure was put on the Khovanov spectra of knots with a symmetry.     In a more theoretical direction, this award also supported the construction of a spectrum underlying monopole Floer homology for many three-manifolds.  This spectrum conjecturally allows for very general gluing results of Bauer-Furuta invariants for four-manifolds with boundary.  This award also supported the proof of a surgery exact triangle in involutive Floer homology.  Involutive Floer homology, considered from the definition, is very difficult to compute, and computations directly from its formal properties are rare.  We showed that there is a formula for the involutive Floer homology of a knot surgery in terms of the involutive knot Floer homology of the starting knot.  This gives a path to some nontrivial computations in involutive Floer homology, and allows us to find many interesting elements in the homology cobordism group of integer homology spheres, and shows that the geography of involutive Floer homology on three-manifolds is considerable.  Talks about this work were given in many venues.          Last Modified: 08/23/2021       Submitted by: Matthew H Stoffregen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
