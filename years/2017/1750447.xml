<AbstractNarration>The overall objective of the project is to conduct experimental and modeling studies to achieve an improved understanding and quantitative description of the effects of the molecular structure of organic compounds on their atmospheric oxidation products and their tendency for the products to form aerosols. Atmospheric gaseous and particulate compounds can affect air quality, visibility, climate, and human and ecosystem health. This project will provide new data on organic oxidation products and mechanisms, which should be applicable to many other atmospheric reactions because of the similarities in basic reaction pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experiments will be conducted in large volume, inert Teflon environmental chambers under simulated atmospheric conditions. Chemical reaction products present in the gas and particle phases will be identified and quantified using real-time and offline methods that employ various combinations of appropriate analytical techniques such as chromatography, spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. Specific experiments are designed to quantify the effects of linear and branched molecular structures and oxygenated functional groups on chemical reaction pathways. Results will be incorporated into a detailed chemical reaction model, which will be evaluated and further improved by comparing simulations with measured gas- and particle-phase products formed from the oxidation of a set of atmospherically representative alkanes, alkenes, and oxygenated compounds, under both polluted and clean air conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The provision of support of a graduate student along with activities intended to contribute to public understanding of science of air quality and climate issues are mentioned project activities. The models that will be improved and evaluated as a result of this project are used in laboratory, regional, and global simulations, which are widely used to evaluate potential effects of gases and particles on visibility, human health, ecosystems, and climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
