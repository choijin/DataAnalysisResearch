<AbstractNarration>Upheavals of familiar technologies are expected in coming years due to the dramatically enhanced control of atomic, molecular and photonic systems. Among these anticipated revolutions is that in sensor technology, affecting a wide array of devices regularly used to detect and measure everything from electric currents, magnetic and gravitational fields, and light intensities, to name a few examples. The key element driving these developments is quantum entanglement, the strange correlations between observable properties of even widely-separated quantum systems. While entanglement is ubiquitous in quantum systems, it is also extremely delicate, and can be altered or spoiled by interactions of the quantum system with its environment. This delicacy is precisely what makes exquisitely controlled quantum systems the source of potentially revolutionary sensor technology. This project concerns simple sensors formed by entangled ultracold atoms confined in ring-shaped traps. The ring-shape allows for the interference of counter-propagating matter waves, forming a kind of interferometer which has exquisite sensitivity to interactions between the atoms. Additional applications of the results to quantum information processing and to new quantum materials will also be explored. The PI will actively train and involve numerous undergraduate students in physics research at a low cost university, and expand on success under prior grants to leverage this experience to channel students into STEM career paths, including many from under-represented demographics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project will conduct a comprehensive study of phenomena realizable with ultracold atoms trapped in lattices with a global topology that is multiply-connected, such as rings, cylinders or tori. The non-trivial topology naturally introduces periodic and twisted boundary conditions with the inclusion of effective flux via gauge fields or rotation, and reveals coherent and non-local features of quantum states. Within this general context, a broad range of topics will be examined. Models with ring-shaped geometry have played a crucial role in understanding the influences of topology and gauge freedoms in non-relativistic physics. This research will develop and extend those models for viable implementation with cold atoms to probe scenarios often inaccessible when such models were conceived. The phenomena to be so studied will include artificial gauge fields, quantum Hall effect, anyon physics, quantum pumps, Hofstadter model, and Aharonov-Bohm and geometric phase effects. Spin-squeezing, that can bypass uncertainty limits, and nonlinear dynamics will be examined in the novel context of counter-circulating collective modes of atoms sharing the same physical space. Where possible, the phenomena will be examined dynamically with evolution in time and space, noting that time can add or substitute for other degrees of freedom. Treating rings as artificial atoms, counterparts will be established in external degrees of freedom for phenomena usually associated with internal ones.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Confining ultracold atoms to ring-shaped traps with a periodic lattice along the azimuth brings together some of the most intriguing aspects of quantum mechanics. The closed loop structure helps make non-local features prominent, the lattice introduces band gaps that underlie electronics, rotation can mimic the effects of gauge fields, tight transverse confinement and multiple rings can access lower dimensionality.  With macroscopic number of atoms, these quantum effects appear at substantially larger and slower scales than is typical in nature, thereby allowing exquisite control of the system parameters.  These features clearly offer applications potential in quantum technologies. This research explored all of those aspects to demonstrate that such ring lattice systems can serve as a rich alternative platform for the study and applications of quantum phenomena.  A new principle for high precision sensing of rotation was developed in the context of such ring systems with two commensurate lattices of different periodicities. Generally, high precision sensors rely upon direct use of interferometry. But, here the operating principle is based on using a quantum localization transition whereby the variance of the quantum states in the ring becomes very sensitive even to tiny rotations. There is an intrinsic duality of the underlying mechanism that allows two complementary applications possibility:  External rotation of the system or frame as a whole, or relative rotation of system components each tied to one of the two lattices.  The same principle can be applied to coherent media with electric charge to serve as a precision sensor for magnetic fields. A patent application was filed within the aegis of this grant, which is currently pending.  The quantum behavior of electrons in a two-dimensional lattice in a magnetic field, associated with the seminal quantum Hall effect, can be mapped to a modulated periodic potential in one dimension in practical cases.  In this research it was shown conclusively, ultracold atoms in a lattice with dual periodic lattices can implement all the significant features of this model, including effects of having edges via localized barriers along the azimuth. This opens up the possibility of using cold atoms in ring lattices as a designer simulator, offering significant control, for the physics associated with the quantum Hall effect. By coupling multiple rings, two dimensional lattice structures can be generated with non-trivial topology, such as cylinder, cone or torus. Designs for such structures were considered for confining ultracold atoms, and the spectrum and dynamics were examined with rotation simulating magnetic fields.  The azimuthal lattice serves to couple the eigenmodes of a ring, very much the same way as a laser couples electronic states within an atom, creating a macroscopic simulator for much of quantum optical phenomena with a much broader set of possibilities through the use of strong nonlinearity and manipulation of lattice parameters. It was shown that two different kinds of dynamical behavior emerge where net momentum in the ring can oscillate or become self-trapped, depending on the lattice periodicity, and rotation can cause transition between them.  By varying the lattice structure on a ring in time through specific protocols, the confined coherent atoms can be made to evolve in a manner that realize features of gauge fields in the orbital or external quantum state of the atoms.  This will allow the investigation of such structures at much magnified scales than that which exist even in the synthetic versions that involve internal states of atoms.  An internal-states analog of this ring structure was also demonstrated as an alternate mechanism for creating artificial gauge fields with cold atoms.  The impact on the coherent dynamics due to time-varying potentials was separately examined towards creating pumping mechanisms via lattice motion for generating and sustaining superfluid flow in closed loop configurations.  Broader Impact:   The new patent-pending principle of high precision sensing discovered here has the potential to improve sensor capabilities not only for rotation sensing but also for sensing of magnetic fields. Coherent states of ultracold atoms in ring lattices can serve as a macroscopic simulator for a multitude of topological effects and for general quantum optical phenomena.  This project directly trained and involved eight undergraduate students, with several of them being accepted into excellent physics Ph.D. programs, and others working towards that.  Impact can be gauged from five student co-authors on peer-reviewed scientific papers published or under review, along with presentations at international conferences. Two high school students were mentored in research, leading to one wining top places at state and regional science competitions, and the other being enrolled in one of the best undergraduate programs in the world.  All are domestic students and many from rural or under-represented demographics as regards careers in scientific research.  The funding for this project has helped create an environment where more such students continue to be recruited and exposed to research and channeled into careers in science and engineering.
