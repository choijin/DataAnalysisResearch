<AbstractNarration>Northwestern University will host a summer workshop for women undergraduates in mathematics to motivate them to pursue graduate school and mathematics research careers. The project is the third workshop organized by the investigators to address barriers that impact the proportion of women transitioning from undergraduate to graduate school and the workforce. It is modeled as an intervention based on data about the progression of undergraduate women students in mathematics, documented barriers that women students face, and on practices proven effective for underrepresented minority students in STEM. The workshop will target students who express an intent to persist in the field and who have completed advanced core mathematics courses. The agenda includes speakers, panels, breakout sessions, and social networking.  The workshop will promote collaborations and establish relationships between student participants and mentors. It also will promote peer networks among institutions within the mathematics community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     This project aimed to understand the reasons behind the gender imbalances in mathematics and to encourage talgented women studying mathematics in the USA to contiune their mathematical education at the graduate level.  There are many programs across the United States that are intended to promote inclusion of women in mathematics, and we focused ona precise and vital group: the women who could be among the intellectual leaders of the profession in the next ten to fifteen years.   We ran annual conferences, titlted GROW (Graduate Research Opportunities for Women) at Northwestern University and at the University of Michigan, to address gender imbalances in mathematics.  The weekend long conferences included mentoring sessions, panels with information on graduate school and research in mathematics, research talks, and numerous opportuntiies for informal connections among the participants and the mentors.    After the conferences, we continue to be in contact with the GROW participants, offering mentoring and encouragement as they navigate applying to and enrolling in early years of graduate studies in the matheamtical sciences.  Many of the participants are currently enrolled in graduate studies and continue to benefit from the connections formed during the GROW workshops.    Following three years of successful conferences at Northwestern Univesrity and one year at the University of Michigan, GROW has now moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, with GROW 2019 scheduled for October.
