<AbstractNarration>The "Scalable Edge Architecture for Massive Location-Aware Heterogeneous IoT Systems" project&lt;br/&gt;addresses essential research problems for developing network design and Internet of Things (IoT)&lt;br/&gt;systems in both high bandwidth and low bandwidth environments. By defining an efficient security&lt;br/&gt;and scalability-enhancing edge architecture that moves data processing close to users, it minimizes&lt;br/&gt;data transfer latencies and overhead in the network. The fusion of sensor data from different sources&lt;br/&gt;can significantly improve the efficiency of many existing systems. In some areas, massive&lt;br/&gt;bandwidth is about to become available to cellular and WiFi networks in the millimeter wave bands.&lt;br/&gt;The Federal Government recently opened up 28 GHz at frequencies above 24&lt;br/&gt;GHz, which promises to revolutionize wireless systems and enable IoT applications never before&lt;br/&gt;conceived, particularly in dense urban areas. Smart traffic and connected (autonomous) cars are an&lt;br/&gt;example application area enabled by the new bandwidth, which requires combining these different&lt;br/&gt;approaches in the architectural design of large-scale IoT systems. Integrating IoT with edge/fog&lt;br/&gt;computing, millimeter wave (mmWave) technologies and distributed processing enables optimizing&lt;br/&gt;the system level performance considering system capacity, reduced network bandwidth for data and&lt;br/&gt;control traffic, increased system level programmability and automation, accurate location-awareness,&lt;br/&gt;virtualization, low latency, scalability, and enhanced security and privacy. One of the&lt;br/&gt;novel aspects of our proposed system is that it transitions seamlessly from an emulated and&lt;br/&gt;simulated environment to actual production deployment, and mixtures of these modes, facilitating&lt;br/&gt;robust and reliable IoT systems at scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides contributions in several essential areas of IoT network architectures and&lt;br/&gt;security: 1) minimizing the need of manual configuration in large-scale IoT networks; 2) scalable&lt;br/&gt;authentication and key management systems; 3) efficient distributed IoT architecture to perform&lt;br/&gt;complex and delay-sensitive tasks, with rapid deployment and prototyping; 4) secure&lt;br/&gt;interoperability between heterogeneous IoT devices; and 5) positioning and capacity optimization&lt;br/&gt;based on mmWave communications, considering especially smart traffic and vehicle-to-vehicle&lt;br/&gt;communications. The project proposes a multi-layered approach for scaling IoT systems in&lt;br/&gt;simulation and emulation, allowing to combine physical systems with emulated systems,&lt;br/&gt;incorporating new mmWave RF and network models, network emulation, virtual systems, models&lt;br/&gt;of the physical world and user interfaces. The emulation system allows the team to explore mobile&lt;br/&gt;edge and fog computing to enhance efficiency, reduce control-loop delays and assure privacy of&lt;br/&gt;sensitive data. A new authentication model and naming system allows scaling for deployment and&lt;br/&gt;programming. The prototype open-source IoT emulator, along with the mmWave channel models,&lt;br/&gt;developed in the project will allow industrial IoT system developers to more rapidly and reliably&lt;br/&gt;develop new IoT systems. The authentication and naming components will be submitted for&lt;br/&gt;possible standardization. The new channel models are likely to inform spectrum allocation&lt;br/&gt;decisions for mmWave bands by national regulators.</AbstractNarration>
