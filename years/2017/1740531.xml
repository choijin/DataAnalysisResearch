<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project stems from its data intelligence approach to empower electronic design automation. The semiconductor industry provides vital hardware backbone of the information technology age through an extremely wide range of integrated circuits (ICs) in computing devices and consumer electronics.  Modern IC development process is bottlenecked by growing chip design complexity, e.g. measured by large device count and functionality diversity, and ever-demanding requirements on computing performance and power/energy efficiency. Advanced IC manufacturing processes are costly, and yet have unavoidable process variations, making fabricated chips susceptible to failures. With its revenue reaching $7.8 billion in 2015, the electronic design automation (EDA) industry supplies indispensable tools and methodologies that make IC design possible. The potential market and societal impact of the proposed EDA innovation is substantial. This technology can help semiconductor and chip design companies develop integrated circuits of improved performance and robustness with a reduced time-to-market and development cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project demonstrates novel machine learning algorithms targeting electronic design automation. As the complexity of integrated circuits scales up rapidly, the need for smart design tools is prominent. The EDA industry is in the early phase of rapid integration of machine learning algorithms into commercial IC design flows. The learning methods focused in this project significantly improve the accuracy of statistical regression and classification over the current-state-of-the-art, and offer the much needed understanding of the underlying structure of the data. Built upon the focused machine learning algorithms, the targeted EDA technology can efficiently process simulation or measured performance data of existing chip designs, and intelligently learn the complex hidden relationships between performance specifications, design parameters, and manufacturing conditions. As a result, it offers a powerful data science solution to IC design optimization, verification, and debug.   Implemented as high-performance parallel software design tools, the technology will bring the power of machine learning to the field of electronic design.</AbstractNarration>

After we started out with this award, this I-Corps team explored a wider set of customer segments where machine learning may have an enabling role. Several customer segments including integrated circuit design and verification, oil &amp; gas, validation and test of data storage systems, and auto electronics were investigated, followed by pivoting.     Our main project activities were:  Assessed the readiness and marketability of our proposed machine learning technology via intensive customer interviews and discussions with practitioners across several major customer segments; In particular, we conducted a large number (more than 120) of customer interviews. A majority of such interviews were conducted face-to-face. Our I-Corps team had seven trips to tradeshows/technical conferences and company sites (e.g. the Silicon Valley), and engaged with professionals around Texas A&amp;M University.  We had also engaged with several founders of startup companies to get their experiences and inputs to our technology.  Based on the inputs received from the customer interviews, I-Corps training faculty, other I-Corps teams, and our own team?s analysis, we developed and refined our business model canvas.  In the late part of this award, we further refined our business model canvas to focus not only on the segment of block-level analog IC design, but also more specifically on the design and verification of analog/mixed-signal ICs in the field of auto electronics.  Performed the final assessment of the focused machine learning technology and its potential in the explored market segments, and determined an immediate post-award action, which was that we were not ready for immediate commercialization.           Our no-go decision was based upon the inputs we received from our interviewed customers who provided mixed levels of enthusiasm and the fact that the average feedback tended to be lukewarm coupled with a degree of skepticism particularly on immediate industrial adoption.  Our activities throughout this award suggested that we were not ready to launch a startup company.  Nevertheless, our I-Corps activities had confirmed that machine learning can be a new technological enabler, which has also been supported by recent industrial interest in machine learning based design methodologies. As such, further developing machine learning based EDA solutions can introduce new opportunities in transforming the industry and provide future commercialization prospects. This is our post-award vision.       Throughout this project, the I-Corps training program had provided excellent training opportunities to the entrepreneurial lead, Ya (Tong) Wang, a Ph.D. student of the PI, PI Peng Li, and Mentor Sam White.
