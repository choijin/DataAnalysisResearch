<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Programs. Professor Alison Keimowitz from Vassar College and colleagues are acquiring an ion chromatograph, inductively couple plasma mass spectrometer (IC-ICP-MS.) In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex matrices. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized and the ion masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows detection and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. The ionization using the inductively coupled plasma allows detection of metal ions and several non-metals present in very small concentrations. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the university and regional area since this technology is accessible to students, faculty and researchers in the Hudson Valley region of New York State including Marist College, the State University of New York New Paltz, the Cary Institute, and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mass spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. It aids researchers in exploring the mechanisms of arsenic transformation as well as release, fate and transport of arsenic in local waterways. The mass spectrometer also helps determine the depositional history and provenance of mercury and lead in the Catskill mountains.  The instrument is used to find metal tracers in fish otoliths so as to determine their spawning sites. In addition, the IC-ICP-MS is used to establish the relationship of micronutrients in Catskill soils.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The acquisition of an inductively coupled-plasma mass spectrometer at in the Chemistry Department at Vassar College has transformed environmental chemistry research as well as instruction of upper-level undergraduates in the department.  This instrument allows analysis of metals in aqueous (water-based) solutions at very low concentrations.  Some of the particular capabilities of the ICPMS that have made it so useful are (1) its ability to analyze many metals at once over a large range of concentrations; (2) its ability to determine isotopic ratios, i.e. the concentrations of different-mass atoms of one element; and (3) its ability to distinguish between differently charged states of one element.      Student and faculty have used this instrument for a number of research projects.  This report will highlight three of them, each of which required one of the instrument’s particular capabilities described above.     (1)  Mechanism of hazardous element release from shale in simulated fracking.  In this project, shale samples from the Marcellus shale were exposed to solutions that simulate solutions used in hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and the concentrations of hazardous element such as arsenic, lead, and uranium leached from the shale were analyzed by ICPMS.  68 elements were analyzed simultaneously over a very wide range of concentrations.  The mechanism of metal release was primarily dissolving carbonates in the shale, although most of the hazardous elements were found in the pyrite fraction.     (2)   Lead deposition in the Catskill Mountains.  In this project, the history of atmospheric lead deposition in the Catskill mountains was examined by acquiring peat cores from bogs and sediment cores from lakes in the mountains. The concentration of lead as a function of depth was analyzed with ICPMS, and shows how the amount of lead in the air being deposited in the mountains changed with time.  Ratios of lead isotopes (atoms of lead with different masses) are different for different sources of lead pollution, and were analyzed to determine sources of lead deposition with time. These analyses showed maximum lead concentration in the 1970s, concurrent with maximum usage of leaded gasoline.  The isotopic analysis shows that current deposition is distinct in its source from 1970s-era deposition, and is more likely from coal-fired power plants.     (3) Arsenic speciation in Union Lake  Union Lake, NJ is used for recreational activities, but also contains legacy pollution of arsenic from the Vineland Chemical Company which after ceasing production of arsenical herbicides became a superfund site.  The ability of this legacy arsenic to redissolve from the sediment into the water, potentially increasing human and ecological exposures, depends on the charge on the arsenic atoms.  In order to determine under what conditions arsenic might have a +3 charge (which is more able to dissolve from the sediment), sediment and water was incubated in the lab under different conditions. Samples were taken and immediately analyzed to determine relative quantities of arsenic +3 and +5, and a more detailed understanding of the chemical mechanism of arsenic release was developed.     The ICPMS acquired with this award also allowed new laboratory modules to be developed in the upper-level laboratory class in the Vassasr Chemistry Major.  In one of these modules, students analyze multivitamins to determine the amount of many necessary nutrients, including "minerals" such as calcium, iron, zinc, and magnesium.  These metals are analyzed by ICPMS, giving approximately 15-20 students per year hands-on experience with this instrument.  Data is often within 5% of the label value, indicating excellent accuracy and precision on the part of the students and the instrument.     Overall, this award has led to the modernization of environmental chemistry, water analysis, and metals analysis at Vassar, and will be used continuously for years to come.
