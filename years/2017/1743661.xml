<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator will evaluate diffuse correlation spectroscopy as a noninvasive optical method for monitoring real-time changes in cerebral blood flow, in order to better inform medical interventions in the event of neurological injury or disease. The proposed research will partner researchers, faculty and postdocs at the New York Medical College, the University of Colorado, the University of Pennsylvania, and the FDA. The proposal includes a well-designed mentoring plan to be implemented by the PI. The plan includes tracking progress through Individual Development Plans; informal discussions to assess satisfaction with the mentoring program' and tracking progress toward career goals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide information on the types of changes that can be interrogated using the low-resolution diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) technique. Direct comparison to a high resolution technique will provide necessary information on sensitivity and specificity for DCS. The use of stimulated changes during monitoring will provide the types of necessary detail on the populations of blood vessels that can be assessed. Cerebral blood flow can be used to inform medical interventions in cases of neurological injury or disease.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Transcranial diffuse optical techniques offer new opportunities for monitoring brain health with portable technology. The spatial resolution with which hemodynamic information can be assessed, however, is limited by the optical properties of biological tissues, which are highly scattering. This project sought to better understand the complex cerebral blood flow signals that are reported by optical techniques, and, ultimately use the findings to extract maximal information regarding brain condition without penetrating the skull. Ultimately, the ability to noninvasively "tune in" to specific vascular populations could aid in the early detection of subtle yet potentially serious brain health conditions such as concussion.  To investigate the underlying nature of the signals, we supplemented noninvasive diffuse optical measurements obtained through diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) with high-resolution flow measurements obtained from optical coherence angiography (OCA). We performed these measurements in the somatosensory cortex of the mouse brain in vivo. Combining the optical approaches with correlation analysis enabled us to achieve the project?s specific goals, which collectively aimed to attribute to specific microvascular populations the principle features of the diffuse optical signal.  One of our most significant findings was that the OCA-measured flow in small and large diameter vessel populations were, respectively, representative of the sensory-evoked hemodynamic response function?s (HRF) initial positive increase and subsequent undershoot. These findings are significant beyond optical applications given that the microvascular basis for HRF waveform components has been elusive for other clinical imaging modalities as well, such as functional MRI (fMRI).    In terms of the broader goal of increasing diversity of training settings for young scientists, the work further provided an opportunity for a postdoctoral scientist to perform research in a hybrid government/academic context.
