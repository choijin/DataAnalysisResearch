<AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, allowing the institution's faculty and administrators to design and develop a comprehensive plan for improving and expanding STEM instruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bay Mills Community College (BMCC) serves the Bay Mills Indian Community in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.  This project will determine the best use of their current infrastructure in advanced manufacturing technology to create sustainable STEM programs that can further support regional economic development and student learning.  The Principal Investigators will deliver a comprehensive roadmap for subsequent implementation of both a certification and associate level degree program offering in STEM related fields through activities that include: 1) identifying community, regional and national workforce needs in strength areas at the college; 2) assessing existing related courses and programs at other institutions; 3) completing a state analysis at BMCC; 4) conducting secondary- and high-school level workshops about STEM careers in order to gauge interest and awareness; and 5) connecting needs to BMCC's courses and programs to identify areas and necessary resources for development.</AbstractNarration>

The project was divided into a series of three informational tasks: 1) to assess the local (Eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan) employment gaps in STEM careers, 2) gauge the level of interest in STEM careers among the current BMCC student body, and 3) gauge the level of interest in STEM careers among local high school youth in acknowledgement that these individuals will be the foundation of future BMCC students. With data in hand, the research team makes recommendations for BMCC administration to consider for future additions to STEM curricula.

Among those surveyed, 19 health care employers, 19 natural resource employers, 27 engineering/manufacturing employers, and 23 agricultural employers provided complete survey responses. For each sector, our surveys indicated the number of individuals currently employed within a myriad of position descriptions, number of current or projected openings in those positions, and skills required or desired for those positions.

Institution Review Board approval was gained through BMCC (2017-1). With the approval of high school administration, four local high schools participated in the survey, offering a total of 321 student responses. BMCC students were offered a chance to participate via the online boarding system (Moodle). Student response data was factored into recommendations given to BMCC administration towards STEM curricula growth.</p> <p>Initial plans called for BMCC to host workshops at each participating high school in which students could address BMCC faculty, staff, and recruited area employers.

However, high school administrators and BMCC research team agreed that the logistical feasibility of such workshops would not allow for many students to participate. In lieu of workshops, the team created a STEM documentary video highlighting all of the topics previously mentioned. This format allows for high school administration to show the film as they see fit, likely reaching more students and involving more experts than the originally planned workshops would have.</p> <p>In all, the BMCC Pre-TI research team was able to provide recommendations to BMCC administration in areas of STEM curricula growth and reach out to local youth involving STEM content.
