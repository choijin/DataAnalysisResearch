<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on reducing the system dimension and process complexity of whole slide imaging in digital pathology.  This is important because optical examination of pathological slides is a primary approach for disease diagnosis and peer consultations. Whole slide imaging that can capture the entire slide with high optical resolutions has been proven effective to advance an understanding of genetics, proteomics, genomics, and cellomics, which has greatly improved clinical outcomes. However, the prohibitive cost and limited availability of whole slide imaging (WSI) equipment have set a huge barrier for wide adoption of this technology. This project will address the unmet market need for affordable digital pathology equipment by developing a personal WSI device that allows pathologists to acquire and share pathological slides using their smartphones or tablet computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do this, the project will translate prior research results on an adaptive liquid lenses technology using a composite elastomer-liquid zoom lens with one single actuation unit, which will reduce the system dimension and process complexity of whole slide imaging. It can change the zoom ratio with only one actuation input without compromising the optical resolution and miniaturization nature of the adaptive imaging system. It also eliminates the need for displacing or replacing solid optical elements for changing the optical magnification. The project will result in a prototype of personal whole slide imaging device with a composite elastomer-liquid zoom lens. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This personal whole slide imaging device has the following unique features: the two liquid lenses within the composite zoom lens can be actuated simultaneously and synchronously; only one actuation unit is needed for driving the composite zoom lens; and the dimension of the device is substantially smaller than the currently used imaging systems in digital pathology. These features provide the advantages of making digital pathology affordable, accessible and easy-to-operate when compared to the leading competing digital pathology systems and other whole imaging devices using solid optical elements in this market space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The use of composite elastomer-liquid zoom lens greatly simplifies the optical configuration and the overall size of the imaging system. This makes it possible to have the imaging device be portable and work smoothly with mobile personal devices (smartphones and tablets). To ensure that sufficient optical resolution can be reached, the thickness profiles of the vari-thickness elastomer membranes to be used in the liquid lenses will be investigated through iterative optomechanical simulation and experimental validation. This will generate new knowledge to advance the use of elastomer-liquid lenses for many high quality imaging applications. Besides the optical performance, the device also leverages the mobile devices' unparalleled capability of instant sharing for efficient transmission of whole slide pathological images. Given the prevalence of mobile devices, their increasing processing and transmission speeds, and the versatility of mobile apps, the personal whole slide imaging device with liquid lenses is expected to serve as a valuable solution of digital pathology for enhancing research and clinical outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, personnel involved in this project including graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students will receive innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology translation experiences through the interactions with potential customers, the co-creation workshop and the comprehensive mentoring by engineering scientists, pathologists, and business educators.</AbstractNarration>
