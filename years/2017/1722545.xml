<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for participation in the conference "Homotopy Theory in the Ecliptic: Chromatic, Equivariant, and Motivic Mathematics" held at Reed College, in Portland, Oregon on August 18-21, 2017. This activity will bring together leading researchers, postdoctoral associates, and graduate students interested in chromatic, equivariant, and motivic homotopy theory to share recent progress and ideas in these fields during a three-day research conference.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on chromatic, equivariant, and motivic homotopy theory, branches of topology that have a history of cross-pollination. The primary scientific aim of the conference is to further their co-creative interaction. There has been ongoing progress at the intersection of the three fields, and these interactions have been fruitful for both the development of theory and the advancement of computations. Among the topics of focus are the development of equivariant motivic homotopy theory, the role of equivariant methods on chromatic homotopy theory, and the influence of motivic methods on the computations of the stable homotopy groups of spheres. The invited speakers are on the forefront of the recent developments in these fields, and their work highlights the intersections.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant was used to support speakers and attendees at the conference ``Homotopy Theory in the Ecliptic: Chromatic, Equivariant, and Motivic Mathematics'' at Reed College, August 18--21, 2017.  The subject of the meeting was algebraic topology, specifically computational techniques in homotopy theory.  The scientific content focused on three main themes of contemporary research: chromatic homotopy theory, where techniques from algebraic geometry are used to organize computations, equivariant homotopy theory, where the topological objects of study carry symmetries encoded by a group action, and motivic homotopy theory, where algebraic varieties take the role of topological spaces in the homotopical framework.  The conference's purpose was to disseminate current results and to promote the continued interaction of researchers within these three inter-related areas.   The speakers were a mix of leaders in the field, well-established assistant professors, and postdoctoral scholars with developing research programs.  Recent advances presented at the conference include work on the structure of chromatic homotopy theory at multiple primes, calculations of the cohomology of stacks and their application in topology, calculations using the slice filtration in equivariant homotopy theory, motivic analogues of the Euler characteristic, interactions between motivic and equivariant calculations via topological realization, and nilpotence and periodicity in the motivic stable stems. A full list of speakers, titles and abstracts can be found in the conference website.   NSF funding supported travel and lodging for twelve speakers and twenty-nine early career researchers, including graduate students and postdocs.  This type of financial support is essential in building a multi-generational community of diverse researchers in topology.  The conference provided access to new ideas and state-of-the-art techniques for over 90 participants, from beginning graduate students to experts, as well as for topologists worldwide via youtube videos of the talks. Additionally, several Reed College undergraduate math majors attended the talks and helped manage logistical tasks for the conference; this provided them with valuable exposure to the broader mathematical world.
