<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award will support the acquisition of a 4-dimensional (4D) micro-computed tomography system with capability for fast time-resolved observation of three-dimensional (3D) internal structures at different length scales. While extensive equipment exists for morphology characterization at nano- and microscales, the University of Texas at Dallas lacks instrumentation to observe in-situ internal 3D microstructures, particularly under deformation. The proposed system will advance the institution's research capabilities by providing non-destructive time-resolved 3D structures, critical for development of new materials, and understanding the mechanical behavior under service conditions for critical load-bearing applications. The acquisition of the 4D micro-tomography system will enable a wide range of new research activities with impacts from aerospace to biomedical applications, including low-density high strength composites, bioinspired robots, and 3D printed shape memory polymers. This equipment will enhance the training of graduate and undergraduate students, including a substantial number of underrepresented minority and women students, and will support student science projects at nearby high schools. The proposed system will advance university research capabilities, leading to enhanced economic development in the fast growing Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area and the nation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The 4D computed micro-tomography system can be used on a range of materials from soft polymers, composites, metallic foams, to ceramics. The large scanning area allows a loading frame to apply high loads to a sample during in-situ scanning.  A fast computer allows control of the system, positioning of a sample, and 3D volumetric image reconstruction from radiographs.  The system provides unprecedented capability to observe internal structures with exceptionally high resolution without serial sectioning--allowing in-situ micro-tomography while a sample is deformed.  The system will enable fundamental research ranging from scalable nanomanufacturing processes for low-density and high strength composites using carbon nanotube sheets, to lighter, stronger bioinspired robots, and 3D printed polymer composites embedded with micro or nanoparticles to remotely trigger local heating and shape memory effects.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A time-resolved high-resolution X-ray micro-computed tomography system has been acquired, installed, and the system is fully operational. The system is available for use by all academic and industry users. It has already been used by both university researchers and industrial users in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, and is anticipated to be used by additional users in other regions of the US. The system allows the X-ray source to move close to a material sample to reach highest resolution. The level of X-ray energy allows the X-ray to penetrate through a thick and dense sample. A large work space allows the system to scan samples with dimensions from small size to a large size up to 12-inch diameter and 18-inch height. A built-in loading frame allows in-situ micro-tomography of a material or structural sample undergoing deformations, providing detailed internal microstructural evolution. The custom-made system provides a unique capability to load a material sample under combined axial and torsional loading, with axial force up to 45 kN, and torque up to 300 N?m. The system has provided training to graduate and undergraduate students, and has enhanced significantly the research capabilities. The system has been used for investigation of artificial muscles for soft robotics, elastomeric lattice structures suitable for damping and footwear, high pressure sealing elements, composites used in wind turbines, circuit boards for electronic packaging, and microstructures for biomechanics. The application areas are expected to grow further. The large number of users will also help to sustain the equipment to allow the system to be serviced and maintained to be ready for operation for long-term use by users.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/22/2020<br>      Modified by: Hongbing&nbsp;Lu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1726435/1726435_10522205_1608665281689_CT-Image--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1726435/1726435_10522205_1608665281689_CT-Image--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CT-System"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1726435/1726435_10522205_1608665281689_CT-Image--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CT-System"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">An X-ray micro-tomography system with an in-situ axial/torsional loading frame</div> <div class="imageCredit">Hongbing Lu</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Hongbing&nbsp;Lu</div> <div class="imageTitle">CT-System</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1726435/1726435_10522205_1608665829487_BCC-Latttice1024--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1726435/1726435_10522205_1608665829487_BCC-Latttice1024--rgov-800width.jpg" title="BCC-Lattice"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1726435/1726435_10522205_1608665829487_BCC-Latttice1024--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="BCC-Lattice"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Additively manufactured elastomeric lattice structure</div> <div class="imageCredit">Runyu Zhang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Hongbing&nbsp;Lu</div> <div class="imageTitle">BCC-Lattice</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
