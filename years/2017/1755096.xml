<AbstractNarration>Bees contribute annually to the pollination of agricultural crops, providing substantially to successful agriculture in the United States, and their visits to wildflowers provide the foundation for many native plant communities helping to sustain native habitats and wildlife. Despite their economic and ecological importance, surprisingly little is know about how bees evaluate the composition of the nectar (their source of carbohydrates) and pollen (their source of protein and fat) they collect from flowers. The nutritional value of these resources varies across plants, so bees often combine visits to several species to achieve a balanced diet. This project asks how the composition of a given plant's resources affects bees' foraging decisions and behaviors. It involves experiments on bumblebee foraging behavior, analysis of variation in nectar and pollen chemistry, and drone-based techniques to describe the nutritional landscape bees encounter as they visit wildflower communities. A natural history museum exhibit will educate school groups about the importance of nutrition for pollinators, and help visitors decide which backyard plants provide the best food for bees. Research experiences for undergraduates and science teachers-in-training will help train the next generation of scientists and help disseminate findings widely through future courses science teachers will lead. Many native bee species and populations are in decline, driven in part by changes to the nutritional resources available to them. Predicting how bees will respond to the introduction of novel foods offered by invasive, ornamental, or agricultural plants requires understanding how nutritional need guides their foraging decisions. The information this project will uncover can thus help inform efforts to conserve bee populations, whose own food security is directly linked to that of Americans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Floral rewards mediate interactions between plants and their pollinators, shaping both plant communities and the evolutionary dynamics of mutualisms. Despite their functional significance, little is known about how the nutritional complexity of floral rewards structures species interactions, because most previous research focuses on a single reward type (most commonly, nectar). This project adapts a framework from the field of nutritional ecology to explore how foraging bumblebees balance the collection of multiple resources (nectar and pollen) from flowers. It investigates the strategies plants use to manage interactions with their pollinators via reward composition, and how the success of such strategies depends upon the offerings of co-flowering competitors. It explores the interaction between bees and the plants they visit under controlled conditions, involving floral surrogates. To test these ideas in field settings, analyses of floral rewards will be combined with observations of wild bee behavior to determine whether reward composition predicts which members of Sierra Nevada wildflower communities are co-foraged, and whether reward production depends on community context. The project aims to expand nutritional ecology beyond its consumer-centric focus, by asking how floral resource composition might alter forager/pollinator behavior to benefit the plant. This effort offers insight into pollen rewards, which are understudied despite their variation in composition and critical role in pollinator nutrition. Undergraduates are involved in research throughout, and this view of flowers as nutritional resources will be shared with the public via an exhibit, 'The Floral Supermarket' and the annual public Pollinator Festival at the University of Nevada, Reno's Pollinator Garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
