<AbstractNarration>The workshop is intended for women undergraduate and masters students who are currently working in speech science and technology. It will be held at Interspeech 2017, in Stockholm, and will  feature panel discussions with senior female speech science and technology researchers, student poster presentations, and a mentoring session. The workshop is designed to foster interest in research in the field of speech science and technology in women at the undergraduate or masters level who have not yet committed to getting a PhD in speech science or technology areas but who have had some research experience in their college and universities on individual or group projects in those areas.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The motivation for the workshop is the realization on the part of many women researchers in the speech science and technology fields that there seem to be relatively few junior women researchers in the 'pipeline' to careers in speech. This issue is addressed by providing a venue where students in speech science and technology can present their work to each other and to senior women researchers, and where senior women can describe their own research and career experience to students and mentor them.  The first workshop was held in San Francisco in 2016 and was very successful and inspirational for young women students.</AbstractNarration>

The workshops was attended by faculty from various universities, and researches from industry and government agencies. Between 20-30 undergraduate and MS students attended each workshop and presented their research. Several panels comprising PhD students, faculty, and those working in industry were also held. Students were from Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Computational Linguistics and related fields. The panels and mentoring sessions provided opportunities for students to practice presenting their research and discussing it. Feedback was very positive.
