<AbstractNarration>Dr. Laurie Huning has been awarded an NSF Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship to work at the University of California, Irvine investigating snowpack droughts across mountainous terrain. Regions in the western United States such as California greatly rely on snowmelt from mountainous regions for a significant fraction of their water resources and drought in California is not uncommon. Nonetheless, the incorporation of snow information into drought monitoring frameworks remains largely unexplored. It is expected that the project will advance the knowledge of drought characteristics across snow-dominated mountainous terrain and provide insight into water availability and the probability of drought persistence that would be useful to the broader community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to develop a better understanding of snow water equivalent (SWE) as a critical drought indicator, which is important for achieving water security in regions that depend on snowmelt-derived water resources. The PI will characterize and diagnose the evolution of snow droughts across the hydrologically-significant Sierra Nevada. Physical and statistical methods, remote sensing, and reanalyses will be used to address science questions related to the spatial and temporal variability of hydrological and meteorological processes and states (e.g. SWE/snowfall, streamflow, temperature, etc.). Such efforts will move toward improved drought monitoring systems and metrics, near-term forecasts, and long-term climate analysis in mountainous regions where snow is important. This project will generate high-resolution, near-real time maps of the snowpack to characterize snowpack deficits, drought severity, and water storage that can be used for water resources management and environmental hazard mitigation. The incorporation of distributed snow information into a drought monitoring system will further the knowledge of processes related to snow hydrology, mountain meteorology, and hydrologic extremes and climatology.</AbstractNarration>

Although droughts have been monitored in a number of ways, snow water equivalent (SWE, or the amount of water stored in the snowpack) is often not considered in drought monitoring frameworks. This project aimed to characterize the seasonal snowpack and understand the relationships between hydrometeorological drivers (such as temperature) and SWE, especially in the case of a snow drought. As presented in Figure 1, the project outcomes included showing that even a 1- to 2-degree Celsius increase in the average winter temperature leads to an approximately 20 to 40% increase in the likelihood of below average 1 April SWE (i.e., a snow deficit or drought) across the Sierra Nevada. In this project, regional vulnerabilities were also identified, where the northwestern portion of the mountain range was found to show the greatest sensitivity to temperature increases (Figure 1). With warmer winters across the Sierra Nevada, the center of mass of the snowpack is forced to higher elevations (areas where fewer ground-based snow observations are collected) across the mountain range. Warmer temperatures and SWE deficits may increase the wildfire risk and have implications in water resources management, ecosystem health, and hydropower generation. The methodologies and frameworks for characterizing SWE variability and snow droughts developed in this project can be extended to other seasonally-covered regions around the world.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/27/2019<br>      Modified by: Laurie&nbsp;S&nbsp;Huning</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1725789/1725789_10495884_1572128189521_CA_snowpack_infographic--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1725789/1725789_10495884_1572128189521_CA_snowpack_infographic--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Snowpack Response Infographic"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1725789/1725789_10495884_1572128189521_CA_snowpack_infographic--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Snowpack Response Infographic"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Response of the 1 April snowpack to 1 to 2 degrees Celsius of warming in the Sierra Nevada.
