<AbstractNarration>The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Program recommends an award of  $113,098 for the purchase of the following:&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;Spare CTD Deck Unit $8,590&lt;br/&gt;OpenVDM Data Management System $10,098&lt;br/&gt;Liquid Nitrogen Generator System $37,643&lt;br/&gt;Upgrade Underway Scientific Seawater System $48,059&lt;br/&gt;Upgrade Test and Troubleshooting Equipment $8,708&lt;br/&gt;    $113,098</AbstractNarration>

The overarching mission of the R/V <em>Atlantic Explorer</em> is to provide a reliable and capable platform from which to accomplish cutting-edge ocean science, primarily funded by the National Science Foundation.</p> <p>With this award, BIOS acquired the following Oceanographic Instrumentation Equipment:</p> <p><strong>1) OpenVDM Software: $10,098</strong></p> <p>This system automatically backs up data every five minutes from our Chirp SONAR, ADCP, CTD, underway seawater system, meteorological system and our navigational systems. It makes all of the data available in near real-time over the LAN which gives scientists and marine techs better capability to monitor and process data during the cruise. This award provided data management software and has proven to be an important and reliable data manager and will continue to support the demands of many NSF funded ocean research projects in the future.</p> <p><strong>2) &nbsp;Underway Scientific Seawater System Upgrade: $48,059</strong></p> <p>Several flow-thru instruments were purchased from Seabird Scientific and installed on the R/V <em>Atlantic Explorer </em>in the spring of 2018. The new sensors included two SBE45 MicroTSGs, two C-Star Transmissometers, two WetStar Fluorometers and two SBE38 remote temperature sensors.&nbsp;Currently, the underway system is taking the same measurements, at the same resolution as the CTD, which allows scientists to make more robust and complete comparisons between underway and CTD data. This system supports the critical need for high quality physical oceanography data of the sea-surface while the ship is underway, which is used in most NSF funded research projects.</p> <p><strong>3) CTD Deck Unit: $8,590</strong></p> <p>A CTD Deck unit was purchased from Seabird Scientific, and installed as our primary deck box. Now BIOS has a full inventory one new, primary deck unit and two older units kept onboard as spares. This inventory reflects both the importance of CTD work on the R/V <em>Atlantic Explorer. </em>All cruises in 2017 and 2018 required CTD profiles as a core part of their science mission. This emphasis on CTD work means that the uptime of the equipment is paramount to the efficient usage of ship time.</p> <p><strong>4) &nbsp;Liquid Nitrogen Generator: $37,643</strong></p> <p>An ELAN2 Liquid Nitrogen generator was purchased from MMR in 2018. It was installed on the ship and has made liquid nitrogen at the rate of 6-8 liters per day, which satisfies the needs for most of our ship-users. Having this system relieves the need for shipping LN2 overseas, which is expensive and subject to unpredictable delays and usually 30% off-gassing before the shipment even arrives in Bermuda. Liquid nitrogen is used onboard the R/V <em>Atlantic Explorer </em>for cryopreservation which is used in many aspects of oceanographic research. This storage method has been used for marine cyanobacteria bacterioplankton and pigments, picophytoplankton and virioplankton. Many research programs require access to cryostorage on board the R/V <em>Atlantic Explorer</em>.</p> <p><strong>5) &nbsp;Test and Troubleshooting Equipment Upgrade: $8,708</strong></p> <p>Some of the key test equipment purchased included a FLIR Thermal Imager, Techtronix oscilloscope, Fluke insulation tester, network cable tester, Extech AC line splitter, Extech borescope inspection camera, Fluke DC clamp meter and a kit of multimeter probes. These purchases have allowed marine technicians on the R/V Atlantic Explorer to monitor DC and AC power supplies for science systems, test various type of data communication cables, identify overheating devices and keep better track of the CTD .322 EM wire.&nbsp; This investment has provided BIOS with the tools required to make key measurements of our science systems in order to facilitate proper in-house repairs.&nbsp;This is widely beneficial since the cost of sending failed components overseas is extremely high for Bermuda.</p> <p><strong>TOTAL AWARD $113,098</strong></p> <p><em><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></em></p> <p>The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared ?use instrumentation and laboratory spaces in support of their NSF ?funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).

This investment has provided BIOS with the tools required to make key measurements of our science systems in order to facilitate proper in-house repairs. This is widely beneficial since the cost of sending failed components overseas is extremely high for Bermuda.  TOTAL AWARD $113,098  Broader Impacts:  The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared ?use instrumentation and laboratory spaces in support of their NSF ?funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared? use instrumentation and laboratory infrastructure allows NSF ?funded researchers from any US university or lab access to safely and efficiently conduct their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.
