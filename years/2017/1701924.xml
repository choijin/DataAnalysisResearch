<AbstractNarration>Algebraic geometers study spaces that are (locally) defined by polynomial equations. One powerful method of studying these spaces, which has seen exciting recent developments, is the method of degenerations. Applying this method allows to reduce complicated geometric objects to configurations of simple ones replacing some geometric aspects by combinatorial ones. Such degenerations can be useful for study of geometric problems: the very rough philosophy is that one studies the combinatorics (i.e., the discrete data) of the pieces in order to deduce things about the more complicated original space. The research supported by this award will center on using modern degeneration techniques, especially those from the field of tropical geometry, to study classical spaces from algebraic geometry. The main goal of tropical geometry is transforming questions about algebraic varieties into questions  about  polyhedral complexes. A process called tropicalization attaches a polyhedral complex to an algebraic variety. The polyhedral complex, a combinatorial object, encodes some of the geometry of the original algebraic variety. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first main project involves using new techniques from tropical geometry and combinatorial topology to compute top-weight rational cohomology of the moduli space of curves, finding explicit new cohomology classes therein.  A complementary aspect of this project is to develop stack-theoretic foundations for tropical moduli spaces.  The second project studies the geometry of Brill-Noether varieties of curves, i.e. moduli spaces of linear series on curves.  The approach builds on recent advances in the moduli theory of limit linear series, and will yield a refined understanding of Brill-Noether varieties.  This project will also uncover further connections between Brill-Noether theory and the combinatorics of graphs and Young tableaux.  These connections are then amplified in the third main direction of research, which consists of several combinatorial investigations that will shed additional light on the close connection between graphs and algebraic curves.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported my research on topics in algebraic and tropical moduli spaces and Brill-Noether theory.  Broadly speaking, my research in this area has addressed fundamental questions about moduli spaces, or parameter spaces, and their shape.  In fact one of the moduli spaces of central interest in this research is the moduli space M_g of algebraic curves of genus g, which goes back to Riemann in the mid-1800s, and has deep importance in physics and geometry.  Together with collaborators Faber, Galatius, and Payne, we made fundamental advances in the study of M_g and its n-marked counterpart M_{g,n}.  And with collaborators Cavalieri, Ulirsch, and Wise, we studied the stack-theoretic structure on the tropical moduli space of curves, providing foundational theorems on a "discretized" shadow of the spaces M_g and M_{g,n}.  Another moduli space of long-standing, classical interest in geometry are the Brill-Noether varieties, which parameterize linear series of fixed degree and rank on algebraic curves.  Roughly, these are spaces that parameterize algebraic maps, fixing the numerical invariants of dimension and degree, of a curve into projective space.  Together with collaborator Pflueger, we used modern techniques (limit-linear series and the combinatorics of set-valued tableaux) to gain new insight the geometry of these important spaces.  I also supported and mentored three graduate students and one postdoc during the award, gave numerous outreach talks at the undergraduate, high school, and middle school levels, and lecture series and seminars at the graduate-and-beyond level on my most recent work and on important developments in the field.  I organized several conferences and seminars during the period of the award as well.       Last Modified: 09/08/2020       Submitted by: Melody Chan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
