<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "The 2018 Great Lakes Mathematical Physics Meeting" that will be held June 22-24, 2018 at Michigan State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the field of mathematical physics.   A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.   The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.   More information will be made available at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;https://sites.google.com/a/msu.edu/glamp2018/home&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Great Lakes Mathematical Physics meetings series is focused on supporting the broader Mathematical Physics community in the United States.  Mathematical Physics is an interdisciplinary field of research, covering various sub-fields of researchers who apply techniques of mathematics to problems from physics.  The general goal is to illuminate and clarify physical theory by identifying and studying mathematical structures that are relevant to models of the physical world.   The main goals for the GLaMP series are:  To maintain communication and collaboration among scientists working in the field of mathematical physics throughout the United States. To provide a forum for young researchers, in particular graduate students and early-career post-doctoral scholars, to present their research. To encourage participation by a diverse group of researchers, representative of the large population, in the fields of mathematics and physics.   The 2017 Great Lakes Mathematical Physics focused on recent developments in the field of Mathematical Physics. The conference had 41 participants, of whom 27 were young researchers (postdocs and graduate students). Tanya Christiansen (University of Missouri) gave a mini-course entitled Resonances and non-self-adjoint Schr&ouml;dinger operators.  In addition there were five hour-long lectures by senior researchers: Yulia Karpeshina (U Alabama, Brimingham): Quantum Transport Properties of Schr&ouml;dinger Operator with a Quasi-Periodic Potential in Dimension Two.  Antti Knowles (U de Geneve): Local law and eigenvector delocalization for supercritical Erdos-Renyi graphs  Milivoje Lukic (Rice U): Quasiperiodic Schrodinger operators and integrability of the KdV equation  Aseel Farhat (U Virginia): Geometry of Turbulent Flows and the 3D Navier-Stokes regularity problem  Anna Vershynina (U Houston): Recovery map stability for the Data Processing Inequality  More information about the conference, and the GLaMP series, is available at the GLaMP series website:  https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/glamp/.
