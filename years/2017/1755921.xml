<AbstractNarration>Error-resilient communication lies at the backbone of modern computer networks and storage systems.  Such schemes have the property of being pseudorandom in that they are explicitly constructed without randomness (which can be important, such as for efficient decoding), and yet (almost) share the error-resilience afforded by truly-random communication protocols.  The construction and analysis of such schemes often uses linear algebra, and recently it has been shown that one can improve such schemes (in particular, list-decodable codes) by constructing certain pseudorandom linear-algebraic objects.  Such linear-algebraic pseudorandom notions have turned out to be interesting independent of their coding-theoretic applications, as they mirror many well-studied notions in statistical (min-entropy) pseudorandomness, have applications to improving the time- and randomness-efficiency of linear-algebraic algorithms, and have connections to the polynomial method in mathematics.  This research will study the foundations of linear-algebraic pseudorandomness by attacking its main open problems, strengthening known connections, and discovering new connections.  This project also has a broader impact through course design, organization of workshops, and training of undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has two main focuses.  The first is on explicit constructions of linear-algebraic pseudorandom objects. In particular, this project studies rank extractors (a small collection of dimension-reducing linear maps that will preserve the dimension of a linear space on average), subspace-evasive sets (a large set which has small intersections with any small-dimensional linear space), and dimension expanders (a small collection of linear maps which increase the dimension of any small-dimensional linear space).  While rank extractors and dimension expanders now have good constructions known, they lack optimality in several parameter regimes, and this project seeks to close these gaps, for example by tightening current analyses.  In contrast, all known explicit constructions of subspace-evasive sets are far from optimal, and this project seeks new avenues of construction.  Further, the project will explore the many relationships of these objects, such as with recent work on two-source (min-entropy) extractors, and known applications of expander graphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second focus on this project is on the polynomial method, a method in mathematics which has yielded dramatic solutions to problems in combinatorics and number theory.  It turns out that the linear-algebraic tools used in the analysis of the above pseudorandom objects has a natural phrasing in the language of the polynomial method.  This project will sharpen these linear-algebraic tools to obtain new results via the polynomial method.</AbstractNarration>
