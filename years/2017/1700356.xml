<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the the "Summer Symposium in Real Analysis XLI" that will be held June 18-24, 2017, on the campus of the College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio. For additional information, see one of the following two websites: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.wooster.edu/academics/areas/mathematics/raex2017/ &lt;br/&gt;https://www.stolaf.edu/analysis/ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This annual conference, which began in 1978 and of which the 2017 meeting will be the forty-first installment, is considered to be the premier conference of its type by the members of the real analysis community. The featured speakers in the 2017 event include Bruce Hanson, Mikhail Korobkov, Assaf Naor, and Artur Nicolau. They will address topics ranging from differentiability properties of functions to the geometry of Banach spaces. The program allows ample time for junior mathematicians to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over a period of 40 years, The Summer Symposium in Real Analysis has grown from a small, informal gathering, to one of the premier conferences of its type.  The conference has developed a strong international reputation as the place to go to share ideas not only in classical real analysis, but also in Dynamical Systems, Banach Spaces, Geometric Measure Theory, and Descriptive Set Theory.   At its inception, the conference had two primary goals:  (1) to serve as a vibrant forum for the dissemination and discussion of new results within the field of real analysis; and (2) to serve as an inviting place for mathematicians in this field to network with other mathematicians so that they may build helpful collaborations that enrich the field of study.  The conference has evolved to include the following additional goals:  (3) to acknowledge how internationalization has shaped, and will continue to shape, the field of real analysis, with many new and rich contributions coming from mathematicians working together around the globe; and (4) to welcome young researchers so that people just beginning their careers may find role models, mentors, and friends who can help to shape their career paths.  All indicators point to the fact that the 2017 Summer Symposium was extremely successful, meeting all four of its intended goals.  Fifty participants from twelve different countries came to Wooster, Ohio, for the 6-day conference. Eleven people were first-time attendees. We incorporated collaborative research time into the schedule and offered participants the chance to participate in problem-solving sessions. Many lively discussions took place over meals and during the conference outing to the Cleveland Museum of Art and Botanical Garden.  Several articles have appeared in the Real Analysis Exchange as a result of the symposium. At least three collaborative projects began at the summer Symposium, and these collaborations should yield further research articles over the next year.
