<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The first Applied Space Environments Conference (ASEC) was held on May 15-19, 2017 in Huntsville, AL. The  ASEC was designed to be a forum for the space environment engineering and applied space science community to discuss the discipline's ability to support current space programs and to identify gaps in knowledge and technology needs required for future exploration goals.  Applicable environments and effects include (but are not limited to): ionizing radiation and radiation effects on hardware and crew, space plasma and spacecraft charging, atomic oxygen in the Earth and Mars environments and its effects on materials, storm time variations in the neutral atmosphere density in planetary environments and satellite drag, solar ultraviolet/extreme ultraviolet (UV/EUV) and x-ray photons, micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MOD) environments and hypervelocity impact effects on hardware, microgravity, and other environments that impact design and operation of crewed and robotic space systems in the space environment. A broad range of environments are applicable from low Earth orbit, through the Earth's magnetosphere, and into interplanetary space as well as environments of other planets, moons, and asteroids.  The week long conference saw approximately 60 contributed talks, four tutorials, and thirteen invited talks with approximately 110 conference participants from NASA, Air Force, industry, academia, and other government agencies in attendance.  Of the approximately 60 contributed talks, the break down for subdisciplines is neutral atmosphere (9 talks), contamination (1), hypervelocity (4), induced potentials (1), radiation effects (14), solar array interaction (3), space weather (20), spacecraft charging (12), and 7 other talks.  There were four tutorials given daily by experts in their respective fields.  The tutorials were overviews of atomic oxygen effects and contamination, radiation effects in electronic systems, spacecraft charging, and orbital debris.  These tutorials were open to anyone, but specifically targeting students and early career professionals.       Last Modified: 04/12/2018       Submitted by: Linda Neergaard Parker]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
