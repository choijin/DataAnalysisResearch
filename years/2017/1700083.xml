<AbstractNarration>The National Academies' Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics (CATS) is a primary interface between the research enterprise and federal agencies that rely on the statistical sciences. The Committee provides objective and authoritative advice on how best to apply the tools and perspectives of statistics to practical problems of national importance. In so doing, CATS strengthens the policy-making process; increases the visibility of, and appreciation for, the statistical sciences; and identifies growth areas for the discipline. CATS increases the visibility of the statistical sciences among agencies of the federal government and within the policy community and enables statisticians to play larger roles in science policy. It does this by involving leading statistical scientists in workshops and studies that help federal decision-makers address their technical challenges. Through its execution of this function, CATS strengthens and broadens the interface between the statistics research community and widespread users of those research results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CATS consists of pro bono experts from across the range of statistical sciences, particularly those with expertise related to data science, physical sciences, Earth sciences, engineering, biomedical research, and health care. CATS meetings provide opportunities to build the interfaces noted above and to help design and oversee CATS activities, which are funded separately. Its position as part of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine enables CATS to also strengthen links between the statistical sciences and other fields of science, engineering, and medicine by involving statisticians in multidisciplinary studies, workshops, and conferences.</AbstractNarration>
