<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project represents a change in concept and technical paradigm for Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) technology, and as such shall significantly impact research and development in both industry and academia.  As discussed in the Technical Merits below, the proposed AFM is fast, smart, and more powerful in terms of imaging and probing local mechanics.  The company has a track record of commercializing AFM controllers that are compatible with most all types of scanners, commercial and home-constructed.  Current AFM users can purchase the new scanner and/or controller to attain the enhanced performance. In addition, new AFM users are also anticipated especially in the areas of nanomaterials, devices and sensors, and multidimensional devices and materials where both high spatial and temporal resolutions are paramount.  Further, the combined high spatial resolution in conjunction with fast speed shall result in immediate advances in the fields of material development, surface coating, nanomaterial and nanodevice inspection and quality control, nanolithography, and tissue engineering.  Based on current market trends, sales are anticipated to reach $25M within the first three years.  The amount is likely higher given the forecasted growth of the global microscopy market. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project includes three cutting edge improvements to current AFM: (1) faster image acquisition speed; (2) automated and rapid feature finding and tracking; (3) 1-2 orders of magnitude of improvement in speed and efficiency in nanomechanical imaging.  The ultra-high speed will be achieved by implementing a novel reconfigurable processor optimized for AFM into a unique hybrid, low-noise controller architecture, which is highly versatile and compatible with various known configurations of AFM microscopes from many different vendors.  In addition, the automatic feature finding and tracking functions will be accomplished using artificial intelligence directly in hardware and a novel scan pattern, completely different from current ?trace-retrace? scanning trajectory in current AFM.  These new and ?smart? approaches further speed up scanning and tracking speed.  Finally, the AFM will be able to produce nanomechanical images with high speed and accuracy using multifrequency spectroscopy. This concept has been proposed, and individual aspects have been demonstrated in isolation through simulations or lab prototypes over the past five years or more.  The faster and more powerful electronic controller shall enable the test and implementation of multifrequency spectroscopy technology in its full potential.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary objective of this STTR project was to develop necessary add-on parts (including electronics and scanner additions) to enable transformation of a conventional atomic force microscope (AFM) to a smart and fast AFM.  The "smart" aspect of these new AFMs enables the users to find designated features such as a structural anomaly automatically during the scan.  The "fast" aspect of these new AFMs enables users to scan a designated area at 16x times faster speeds than conventional AFM imaging speeds, without sacrificing resolution. These new capabilities and features are of great importance for researchers in the field where high speed and high resolution are essential for applications such as monitoring surface structural changes during CVD growth, chemical reactions, modern nanodevice and nanosensor fabrications, and new materials growth and degradation.  In a 3-way collaboration led by RHK Technology in conjunction with Dr. Gang-yu Liu at the University of California Davis and Dr. Darrin Hanna at Oakland University, the following approaches have been taken to achieve this goal:  (1)   integrating a custom high-speed embedded processor into RHK?s state-of-the-art SPM control board to enable high-speed computation, fast scanning, and feature tracking and finding;  (2)   designing and implementing an intelligent system with a highly parallel architecture in a field programmable gate array (FPGA) to detect the sample anomaly in real-time during the scan; and  (3)   designing and fabricating a generic AFM sample holder insert integrable into almost all existing AFM sample holders to support high-speed scan in the plane (X-Y motion).  We completed these tasks and tested the "smart" and "fast" features using actual and known surfaces.  In addition to demonstrating the individual parts and features successfully, we have successfully integrated our development into a commercial microscope system known as the "Beetle configuration AFM".  We have developed user-friendly software for users to be able to scan features at high speeds without being AFM experts and have the capability of designing their own creative experiments using graphical experiment design tools.   Before we develop a full-fleged commencial plan in Phase II, we plan to demonstrate the concept using our beta add-on parts to various other common AFM configurations such as deflection AFM, interferometry detection configuration, and various piezo assemblies such as tube scanners and flexture scanners.  Work is also in progress to test various types of surfaces and structural evolutions.  We are confident that our add-on parts will exhibit high versatility.  Upon completing these due diligence tests, we shall be ready to apply for an NSF Phase II award.  RHK is well-known for pursuing the highest quality of products and is the only scan-probe microscopy company that is a 100% U.S. entity.  We are looking forward to commercializing this new product to customers in the U.S. and worldwide.          Last Modified: 07/17/2019       Submitted by: Adam J Kollin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
