<AbstractNarration>This project, acquiring a new high resolution microscope, aims to allow users to analyze the performance of electronic devices and systems. With a user friendly interface and the use of intuition, the instrument is expected to maximize its accessibility for on-site use and for off campus users. The platform will be used for teaching, education, and outreach. This effort is shared by six universities in Florida. The effort enables:&lt;br/&gt;- Remote access capability to reach over 500 students every year both on and off campus; &lt;br/&gt;- Material and expertise on hardware security related topics for educators to incorporate in their classroom curricula;&lt;br/&gt;- Help to bring experts into their classrooms to discuss real-world applications; and &lt;br/&gt;- Exposure of undergraduates to advanced microscopy techniques. &lt;br/&gt;This new high resolution photon emission and electro-optical microscope enables the analysis by visualizing the transistor functionality non-destructively. When analyzing performance in this fashion, maximum impact is gained from multiple features such as: &lt;br/&gt;- New high sensitive detectors that enable high resolution; &lt;br/&gt;- Laser scanning configuration that enable static and dynamic failure analysis; &lt;br/&gt;- Static laser scanning stimulation that contribute to identify the source of shorts and resistive defects; and &lt;br/&gt;- Electro-optical probing and frequency mapping that enable rapid identification of regions of interest. &lt;br/&gt;The unique capabilities of the instrument constitute a critical enabling parameter for research in hardware and system security areas. These include:&lt;br/&gt;- Counterfeit detection by providing more detailed data than general electrical tests in less expensive and non-destructive manner; &lt;br/&gt;- Semi-invasive physical attacks by enabling advanced contactless probing techniques and laser injection to measure circuit activity; &lt;br/&gt;- Trojan detection by performing trust analysis of fabricated integrated circuits for validation of security and trust; and&lt;br/&gt;- Reverse and anti-reverse engineering by complementing conventional reverse engineering and extracting the intellectual property blocks critic information.</AbstractNarration>
