<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program, Professor Chad A. Mirkin of Northwestern University is developing design rules for the synthesis of special molecules that can serve as capsules with controllable size and recognition properties for applications in detectors, molecular separations, and catalysis. The rational design and synthesis of these capsules, is a significant challenge in the field of the assembly of supramolecular structures, could lead to significant advances related to the purification of pharmaceuticals essential in clinical medicine, the conversion of low-value to high-value chemical feedstocks important to the chemical and petroleum industries, and the development of chemical sensors critical to the environmental testing and food packaging fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project focuses on the development of stimuli-responsive heterodimeric capsules, using robust and generalizable chemistry that can be implemented in a wide variety of settings. Various capsules are being synthesized and studied in the context of the Weak-Link approach, and the most promising are being characterized further using X-ray crystallography, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, mass spectrometry, and UV-vis spectroscopy. The chemical and physical properties of these novel heterodimeric capsules are being defined through collaborative efforts with core facilities, such as the Integrated Molecular Structure Education and Research Center (IMSERC), at Northwestern University. Outreach programs aimed at engaging local high school students and undergraduates from around the world have been established by Mirkin. These programs focus on mentoring students, teaching them technical aspects of laboratory research, and preparing them for the next stage of their academic careers. These young students are learning about scientific research at the forefront of the field and interacting with leading scientists, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers. This work provides a training ground for young students, including underrepresented minorities, and equips them with basic science knowledge essential for developing technologies that can significantly improve the lives of many Americans.</AbstractNarration>
