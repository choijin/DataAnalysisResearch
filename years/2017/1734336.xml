<AbstractNarration>This two day conference will launch a network of educational stakeholders from community colleges and the University of California (UC) to develop and implement a shared vision for the support and preparation of biology transfer students. The disparity in performance and career trajectories of biology transfer students compared to freshman start students is a critical problem that must be addressed, particularly in light of the high percentage of underrepresented and underserved students attending California community colleges. The proposed conference is the first of its kind in the region for educators and advisors from these institutions to meet and discuss the curriculum and expectations of their courses and programs, challenges students face, and potential solutions. This is particularly important for biology given the very large number of majors, student diversity, and the transformative and fast pace of changes in discoveries and technology with numerous interdisciplinary ties to other STEM fields. The results of this effort have the potential to impact thousands of transfer students a year and represents an initial effort to generate a scalable, collaborative, and sustainable instructional model for California and beyond. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will include 55-60 individuals with equal representation from the UC and the community colleges. UC Davis campus is an ideal central location in Northern California with over 32 community colleges within a 100-mile radius. Two to four members from each institution will be identified and invited (including faculty, advisors, transfer coordinators, administrators) to insure a multifaceted view of the issues and buy-in from all stakeholders. The specific objectives include the following: 1) to establish more effective lines of communication between the UCs and community colleges in order to develop a shared vision; 2) to gather information about misalignments between the biology curriculum and prerequisites; 3) to initiate efforts toward better supporting successful learning progression for transfer students; 4) to discuss how the rapidly changing pace of research and technology is impacting curricula and requirements; and 5) to discuss instructional interventions and new teaching methods that could break the "sink or swim" instructional model that has plagued transfer students for many years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A significant proportion of University of California (UC) students complete lower-division degree requirements at California Community Colleges (CCC). These transfer students, who have increased representation of first-generation, low-income, and underrepresented minorities, have the challenging task of acclimating to a new institution and campus community while entering upper-division courses. There are structures in place to facilitate admission of qualified students from CCCs to the UC system, such as the transfer admission guarantee (TAG) agreement, however, there is a lack of collaboration in bridging curriculum with little to no opportunities for cross-institutional partnerships that support the transition and success of transfer students. To initiate regional partnerships between stakeholders across the CCC and UC systems, this award funded a conference that brought together biology faculty and advisors to discuss transfer student challenges, instructional and advising practices, and curriculum alignment.</p> <p>The Dreamcatcher Conference was a two-day event held on January 26<sup>th</sup> &ndash; 27<sup>th</sup> on the UC Davis campus. The conference was attended by 125 participants representing 32 regional institutions (26 CCCs, 5 CSUs, and 1 UC). In attendance were 86 biology faculty, 15 academic advisors, 8 academic support staff, 4 graduate students, and 12 administrators. This event was a first step towards building a regional network bridging the UC and CCC systems to better support the preparation, transition, and academic success of biology transfer students.</p> <p>There were several featured speakers at the conference. First, a keynote presentation by Dr. Davis Jenkins from the Community College Research Center at Columbia University highlighted major barriers of transfer success and essential practices for two- and four- year universities to overcome these barriers. Second, Dr. Susan Keen, Associate Dean of the College of Biological Sciences at UC Davis, presented aggregate data on transfer student performance in the upper-division biology curriculum at UC Davis. Lastly, a presentation by Dr. Christopher Meyer, Dean of the College of Science and Math at Fresno State University, highlighted examples of instructional innovation that promoted transfer student success.</p> <p>A moderated Q &amp; A with a panel of six transfer students representing a range of stages in the transfer process provided direct insights into the personal, academic, and social challenges biology transfer students experience. A moderated Q &amp; A with a panel of six academic advisors (2 from UC Davis, 3 from regional CCCs, and 1 from CSU) provided insights into the challenges advisors encounter in their interactions with students, the limitations of academic advising, and discussions of how faculty and advisors can better partner to support students. In addition, there were four 90-minute breakout group sessions where participants engaged in small 4-8 person group discussions proceeded by a large whole group discussion. Each session was guided by question prompts and materials for recording the discussions of each group. The goals of the breakout sessions were to 1) identify, extend, and elaborate on the challenges transfer students in the biological sciences experience; 2) identify, extend, and elaborate on how we can better support transfer students; 3) build awareness of the biology curriculum, content, and assessment across two- and four- year institutions; and 4) form multi-institutional collaborations that extend efforts towards better supporting transfer student success.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Conference activities have directly resulted in the following:</p> <p>-&nbsp; Documented record of topics discussed throughout the conference that will be drafted into a meeting report for future dissemination, which includes:</p> <ul> <li>Detailed description of the challenges biology transfer students experience pre- and post-transfer</li> <li>Description of regional programs across CCC and UC systems aimed at promoting transfer success</li> <li>Action suggestions for CCC and UC faculty, advisors, and academic programs to take towards better supporting biology transfer students</li> </ul> <p>- Connected regional network of biology faculty, advisors, and administrators across 32 institutions engaged in promoting biology transfer student success.</p> <p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; UC Davis pursuing a pilot a peer mentoring program for transfer students entering the UC Davis College of Biological Sciences.</p> <p>- Initial efforts to pursue funds to support cross-institutional programs for transfer students and expansion of the regional network.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>At the end of the conference, participants completed anonymous surveys. Survey responses indicated that the event provided motivation for engaging in future intra- and inter-institutional efforts to better support transfer students as well as long-term considerations for improvement of courses, curriculum and advising (see Table 1). Participants also indicated that the conference was a valuable opportunity that enabled them to build awareness of the needs of their transfer students and network with regional faculty and advisors that they do not otherwise interact with.</p> <p>In summary, this conference presented the first regional opportunity to bridge educators from multiple institutions in exploring how to support biology transfer student success.
