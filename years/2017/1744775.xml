<AbstractNarration>1744775 (Zhang). This workshop will focus on the paradigm of Environment-Enhancing Food, Energy and Water Systems (EE-FEWS) that addresses critical problems by generating significant amounts of bioenergy and food via bio/chemo/thermo conversion and multicycle reuse of nutrients and wastewater in the biowaste stream. At the same time, EE-FEWS seeks to enhance environmental quality by capturing carbon and cleaning wastewater. The U.S. has an estimated 79 million dry tons of sustainably collectable livestock manure and food processing waste. Through the EE-FEWS approach, this biowaste stream has the potential to be amplified via multi-cycle nutrient and wastewater reuse to 240-800 million tons of mixed algal-bacteria feedstocks that can be converted into 120-400 million tons of biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), while cleaning an estimated 7.9 billion tons of wastewater. Additionally, food would be produced without the need for additional reactive fertilizer or water. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is targeted to contribute significant advancements in sharing and advancing knowledge of the following: utilizing readily available biowaste and biomass inputs; improving efficiency for biowaste/biomass conversion (including thermochemical, biochemical and biological); demonstrating that nutrients in the original biowaste can be efficiently separated in the conversion process and reused multiple times, thus amplifying biomass to produce unprecedented amounts of biocrude; and establishing that the chemicals of environmental concern in the original biowaste can be substantially removed/converted through conversion and wastewater treatment processes. The workshop will involve a broad range of education and outreach opportunities from K-12 to graduate studies, for under-represented minorities, industry and the general public. The educational goal is to educate a new generation of scientists and engineers equipped with a solid foundation and broad perspectives for addressing issues related to the nexus of Food-Enegy-Water (FEW). By recycling nutrients and extracting hydrocarbons in waste streams, producing high value foods, capturing carbon and cleaning water by growing algae, the goal is to be able to produce needed energy and food, and, at the same time, reuse water and enhance the quality of the environment. The dissemination plan is to utilize a workshop website, email lists, professional contacts, etc. to reach out and enhance the awareness of the (FEW) nexus challenge, to develop relevant technologies, and to contribute to the sustainability of society. The workshop is scheduled to be held June 13-15, 2018 in Beijing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcome Report for   Sino-US Workshop on  Environment-Enhancing Food, Energy and Water Systems  (NSF Award #1744775)   Location and Time: Jinma Hotel, Beijing; June 13-15, 2018     Outcome    This EE-FEWS workshop was built on the previous NSF funded workshops and has a new thrust with expanded audience involving interdisciplinary experts in food production, bioenergy production, and water resources.  Over 100 researchers from 28 universities and institutions, including six U.S. institutions, participated in the Workshop.  The Workshop achieved two objectives: 1) Shared the current state-of-art research and findings related to the food-energy-water system in China and U.S.; and 2) Identified critical FEW challenges and opportunities that lead to research topics &#65293;&#65293; especially for joint-effort between U.S and China.  Main outcomes for the workshop are identification of Challenges and Opportunities, and Recommendations for Future Actions.      Challenges and Opportunities  There are many high-impact Food-Energy-Water Systems that worthy of studying.   Issues related to these FEW systems &ndash;Worthy research topics including:  sustainability of intensification of production; valorization technology for waste; safety and security; cyber-physical platform and modeling capabilities; scale-up of new technology; supply chain logistics management; consumer and social acceptance; techno-economic feasibility and financial sustainability; integrated models for techno-socio-economic analysis and modeling; education and training of workforce.  Potential solutions and tools for addressing FEW challenge &ndash;government enabling policies and incentives, investment in interdisciplinary research, FEWS oriented R&amp;D projects, identifying/emerging effective leaders and teams across-discipline, technologies enabled collaboration across-discipline, and fair recognition and credit for multidisciplinary approach.   Bottlenecks limiting sustainable FEW system development &ndash; isolation among the related disciplines such as food production, energy sector and water resources; domain knowledge is prevailing rather than crossing the boundaries of food-energy-water; funding agencies are largely single disciplinary in China related to FEW issues; lack of understanding of FEWS complexity and challenge; lack of effective leaders on FEWS; and lack of appropriate performance evaluation and reward mechanism for FEWS approach.     Recommendations  Hold subsequent Workshop(s), similar to this one, to educate Chinese researchers about INFEWS concept and approach, based on that U.S. INFEWS program has already had two years of experience.  Bringing in PIs of existing INFEWS projects as case studies would be great beneficial to Chinese researchers and administrators.  Topics on the workshop could include how to evaluate the proposals, how to organize a team, and how to manage a project.  Establish an independent funding mechanism (program) such as INFEWS program initiated by NSF, is highly desirable.  Traditional funding mechanisms, especially in China, will have tremendous difficulty in pulling researchers together from different discipline to tackle complicated FEW problems.  Divisional walls among food, energy, water and system analysis sectors must be reduced/eliminated to implement an effective INFEWS program.  Therefore, there should be a truly multi-disciplinary funding directorate for INFEWS, not a single-disciplinary directorate.  Increase the INFEWS funding level, especially in China.  While the US-China INFEWS program has been kicked off, it is relatively a small program.  There is a need to increase the funding level and scope to cover a broader-range FEWS issues as a true national/international effort.  This is especially important for China as pressure is extremely high on issues of food security and safety, energy security and efficiency, water resources availability, and environmental quality.   Enhance exchange between U.S. and China on FEWS issues.  The U.S. and China are the two largest economies, largest consumers of food, energy and fresh water, and also the largest carbon emitters.  There are many complementary capacities (human and infrastructure) and common interests in FEWS domain between two countries.  U.S.-China INFEWS program should be highlighted through more effective communication and visibility.  Such enhancement could be in forms of more joint workshops and conferences, exchange of students and scholars, and joint-funded projects such as the newly initiated US-China INFEWS Program.
