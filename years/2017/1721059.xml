<AbstractNarration>Building on successful prior work, this University of Toledo project, Networking Urban Resources with Teachers and University to enRich Early Childhood Science (NURTURES): Researching the impact of teacher professional development and family engagement on PreK-3 achievement, simultaneously targets young children's teachers and families/caregivers in an effort to build both parties' capacity to promote student interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) learning. Teachers participate in a two-week summer professional development program and receive support across the school year in the form of individualized coaching and participation in professional learning communities. Families receive science inquiry packets (sent home from school) four times a year and attend community STEM events throughout the year. Inquiry packets and community events encourage science inquiry, discourse, and further exploration of key science ideas. Project participants will include 120 teachers, 2,400 PreK-3 children and over 7,200 family members in Ohio and Michigan. The project is funded by the Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12), which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of STEM by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extending the initial NURTURES project, developed with NSF Math and Science Partnership funding, this follow-up project aims to: 1) Transform early childhood science teaching based upon Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) to measurably increase student science, literacy, and math achievement, and 2) Engage families of PreK-3 students in science inquiry practices to measurably improve student science, literacy, and math achievement. A particularly important facet of this follow-up project is the research effort to parse and understand how each component (teacher professional development versus family engagement) impacts student learning. The project will use a randomized control group research design (RCT) to compare student achievement outcomes among three groups: Children whose teachers received professional development and family engagement activities, children whose teachers received only professional development, and a control group. The project will use standardized tests (the TerraNova Complete Battery) to measure impact on learning gains in science, mathematics, reading, and early literacy for children in grades K- 3. The Lens on Science assessment will measure science learning in preschool children. This project will result in an NGSS-based program for teachers and families that has been systematically tested and may ultimately be scaled up to an impact study and dissemination at a broad level.</AbstractNarration>

With a design based on the Harvard Complementary Learning Model (Harvard Family Research Project, 2019), the program aligned educational resources to provide comprehensive programming addressing the learning needs of children and emphasizing family engagement in education.     NURTURES Phase II completed two full years of programming and data collection (2018-2019 &amp; 2019-2020) followed by comprehensive data analysis.      The stated goals of the project were:  Goal 1: Transform early childhood science teaching based upon NGSS standards to measurably increase student science, literacy, and math achievement.   Goal 2: Engage families of PreK-3 students in science inquiry practices to measurably improve student science, literacy, and math achievement.     To address these goals, we explored the relative impact of teacher PD versus teacher PD plus parent involvement on student gains. We used a randomized controlled trial (RCT) research design to compare student outcomes among three groups: PD + family engagement group, PD-only group, and a control group. This research demonstrated that the NURTURES intervention statistically impacted student learning over the control group without intervention (Hedges’ g effect size of 0.34; a level considered substantively important by the US Department of Education What Works Clearinghouse guidelines). Early analyses suggested higher test scores for children in the family engagement condition.     Ultimately, our findings were inconclusive on any additive impact of the family engagement interventions on student achievement. A host of factors impacted data collection over the course of this research, including limited participant enrollment in certain grade bands, irregular distributions of study groups, and the significant impacts of COVID-19 on data collection in Spring 2019.     While findings from this phase of research are inconclusive on the quantitative impacts of the program, NURTURES Phase II emerged from NURTURES Phase I, which has a well-researched and documented lineage of significant quantitively measured impacts on student achievement both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.      Participant response was overwhelmingly positive. Participants reported a host of benefits associated with their participation including improved OTES ratings (Ohio Teacher Evaluation System) and Ohio Resident Educator evaluations when using NURTURES developed lessons, increased interest and confidence in teaching science content to students, improved family engagement and parental interest in student learning, and a greater sense of intentionality when planning and teaching science as well as other subjects.
