<AbstractNarration>Recent data breaches have exposed billions of user passwords to the dangerous threat of an offline password attacker who attempts to guess each user's password by brute force. Because an offline attacker can validate each password guess by itself using stolen password hashes from a data breach it is not possible to "lock out" an offline attacker after several incorrect guesses. The attacker is limited only by the computational resources necessary to mount a brute-force attack. To mitigate the risk of an offline attack the goal of a secure password hashing algorithm is to ensure that a brute force attack is prohibitively expensive even if the attacker has access to customized hardware such as an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) that is optimized for password cracking. Memory hard functions (MHFs), functions whose computation require a large amount of memory, are a crucial cryptographic tool to achieve this goal since memory is expensive even on an ASIC. This project advances scientific understanding of memory hard functions and will directly impact future cryptographic standards for password hashing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing improved cryptanalysis techniques to evaluate the security of an MHF resulting in a deeper understanding of currently deployed MHFs. A main goal of this work is to design practical constructions of MHFs with provably optimal memory hardness in terms of bandwidth hardness, sustained space complexity, and amortized area-time complexity. Furthermore, the project focuses on establishing a scientific basis for tuning the parameters of an MHF to ensure that brute-force attacks are prohibitively expensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Summary of Project Outcomes: The project has advanced scientific understanding of memory hard functions by (1) developing new approaches to construct side-channel resistant Memory Hard Functions, (2) identifying shortcomings of prior MHF candidates and (3) constructing a new state of the art side-channel resistant Memory Hard Function. The final result has the potential to influence future standards for password hashing.  We elaborate further on these outcomes below:  Computationally Data-Independent Memory Hard Functions: Prior to this project there were two categories of Memory Hard Functions: Data-Independent Memory Hard Functions (iMHFs) and Data-Dependent Memory Hard Functions (dMHFs). While dMHFs are potentially easier to build, iMHFs are resistant to side-channel attacks making them particularly attractive in the context of password hashing since we want to avoid leaking any information about sensitive user passwords during computation. On the downside, even the best iMHFs are inherently less memory hard than dMHFs. One outcome of the project was the introduction of Computationally Data-Independent Memory Hard Functions (ciMHFs). ciMFs are an exciting new category of MHFs which can potentially provide the best of both worlds. In particular, the project demonstrated that it is possible for a ciMHF to be maximally memory hard like a dMHF while still providing side-channel resistance like an iMHF. While current ciMHF constructions are still theoretical this opens up an exciting new direction for future MHF research. Can we find practical constructions of ciMHFs that are maximally memory hard?  Constructing Depth-Robust Graphs: The problem of constructing iMHFs is closely related to the problem of constructing  combinatorial objects called depth-robust graphs. In particular, depth-robust graphs are a necessary building block in any secure iMHF construction. Thus, designing good data-independent Memory Hard Functions requires us to find good constructions of depth-robust graphs. However, there are only a few known constructions of depth-robust graphs and all of these constructions use similar ideas. The project developed a fundamentally new approach to constructing depth-robust graphs by transforming the task to the easier problem of constructing edge depth-robust graphs. The transformation utilizes a new combinatorial object called ST-robust graphs which was also introduced in this project. ST-robust graphs have found other applications in the field of cryptography.      State of the Art iMHF Construction: There are three primary metrics that have been proposed to quantify the memory hardness of an iMHF including amortized Area-Time (aAT) costs, Sustained Space Complexity and Bandwidth Hardness. An iMHF with high amortized Area-Time costs (similarly Sustained Space Complexity or Bandwidth Hardness) will be more expensive for an attacker to compute.

The construction is also maximally bandwidth hard. The source code for the new iMHF construction is open source and available on GitHub.   Dissemination: Results from the project have been integrated into a special topics course on password authentication and have been disseminated at computer science and cryptography conferences such as CRYPTO and ITCS. The project supported several undergraduate and graduate students who have been trained to conduct research on memory hard functions and password hashing.
