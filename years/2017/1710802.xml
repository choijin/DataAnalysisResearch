<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in a three-day workshop on applications-driven geometric functional data analysis (FDA) held October 8-10, 2017 on the campus of Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida. The workshop focuses on topics in the intersections of FDA, infinite-dimensional differential geometry, and data-driven applications, and will feature both senior experts and junior researchers from these areas.  The workshop includes a half-day of tutorials providing an introduction to the workshop topics, especially aimed at junior researchers.  The remaining time will be allocated to invited talks, a poster session, and discussion sessions. The main motivation for this workshop is to initiate and facilitate discussions and future collaborations between US scientists and mathematicians with different backgrounds and expertise. The organizers will strive for breadth and diversity by targeting leading experts in the three components areas of the workshop -- geometry, FDA, and big data analysis. The poster session will be used to encourage all participants, especially the junior researchers, to present their research and interact with others. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A rapid growth of functional data in all disciplines, ranging from natural and social sciences to engineering and technology, has made FDA an important topic of research. To handle the diverse challenges facing FDA, there is a need to exploit low-dimensional patterns and structures present in functional data. Geometry provides tools to: (1) extract and analyze structures in functional data, (2) handle the infinite-dimensionality of function spaces, (3) arrive at viable statistical models and make efficient inferences; and (4) process large datasets associated with many current and future data-centric applications.  The workshop will include both: (1) theoretical topics, such as geometries of infinite-dimensional spaces, analysis under invariant metrics, and statistical models involving functional data; and (2) applications, such as computational anatomy, bioinformatics, biometrics, and neuroscience. This blend of important and complementary topics makes the workshop a unique and worthwhile event.

The lack of other workshops with this blend of important and complementary topics made this workshop a unique and indeed a necessary effort.  The workshop featured data-analysis session(s), where the participants presented their results on important datasets.  The success of this workshop can be clearly seen from:  Approximately 100 total participants in the      workshop. These came from across multiple disciplines: mathematics, statistics,      engineering, and biology. More than 50 total papers presented at the      workshop &ndash; 37 lectures and 22 posters. More than 50 young researchers participated in      the event: 35+ PhD students and 15+ postdocs and assistant professors; Significant outside funding for the workshop.       In addition to the NSF-funding we obtained funds from FSU and Johns      Hopkins to support the participation costs for senior speakers and      the workshop banquet.  The main items at the workshop included:  Tutorials: A set of       tutorials to educate the audience, especially the younger participants,       about the foundations in this multidisciplinary field.

Lecture Presentations: 37       total oral lectures included four 50-minute lectures from pre-eminent       researchers (Michael Miller, L. Mahadevan, Gerard Misiolek, and Peter       Michor), fifteen 30-minute lectures by experts and eighteen       20-minute presentations, mostly from early career researchers. Poster Session: 22 poster       presentations by junior researchers, three of those were selected for the       best poster awars. The winners received certificates and nominal prize       money for their excellent posters and presentations.   A dinner banquet with a lecture      highlighting Prof. Ulf Grenander?s life and contributions. A workshop website containing handouts,      presentations and other material of the conference. In particular the      slides of the tutorial lectures can be found at this resource. As a longer-term outcome, we expect that this      training and education of young researchers on methods of GSDA will      provide new opportunities and directions in terms of future research and      collaborations.
