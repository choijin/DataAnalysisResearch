<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project focuses on the intrinsic mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of zirconium carbide ceramics. Zirconium carbide is a candidate material for use in extreme environments such as those associated with hypersonic flight, nuclear fission, concentrated solar power, and high-speed machining. These applications involve extreme temperatures, heat fluxes, radiation levels, or other conditions that are beyond the capabilities of available materials today. Previous studies by other research groups have reported seemingly contradictory behavior for nominally identical zirconium carbide ceramics due to extrinsic effects such as carbon stoichiometry (e.g., the C:Zr ratio of the final ceramic) and the presence of impurities. Accordingly, the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties are being investigated in a systematic and controlled manner. The project is using the unique experimental facilities at the Missouri University of Science and Technology, which include capabilities for producing dense ceramics with extremely high purity and characterizing properties from room temperature up to at least 2000Â°C. These studies are needed to provide data that can then be used to design zirconium carbide ceramics for use in extreme environments and enable revolutionary gains in performance and efficiency. This project is training two graduate students in the processing, densification, characterization, and analysis of materials for extreme environments, while also preparing them for careers in the aerospace and power-generation industries. Graduate students are mentoring undergraduates who are assigned research tasks and assist with outreach activities. The project team is also reaching out to teachers and students from rural high schools that lack access to research facilities needed for class projects. Groups of high school students are invited to use campus laboratories and the intent is to hire at least one high school student from those groups to work on the project during each summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: The project is advancing the fundamental knowledge of the intrinsic properties of zirconium carbide ceramics with low (0.01 to 0.4 at%) hafnium contents and known oxygen and nitrogen impurity levels that are as low as possible. The four primary areas of emphasis are: 1) reactive synthesis of high purity zirconium carbide; 2) intrinsic properties of zirconium carbide; 3) ultra-high temperature microstructure- property relationships; and 4) effects of carbon stoichiometry, hafnium content, and other impurities on thermal transport. A focused experimental study is complemented by physics-based models to connect property measurements with fundamental electronic structure, bonding, and transport properties. The knowledge of zirconium carbide ceramics is being transformed by revealing intrinsic densification mechanisms, structure-property relationships at ultra-high temperatures, and the effects of carbon stoichiometry, oxygen content, and other impurity levels on properties. Graduate and undergraduate students working on this project are learning to design characterization methods and property tests for extreme environments that have heretofore not been explored through experimental methods, providing them with unique skills for future careers in fields such as aerospace, nuclear power, or alternative energy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported the research activities of three graduate students, one post-doctoral scholar, and three undergraduate students.   As of August 2, 2021, the project resulted in seven papers published in international scientific journals, one M.S. thesis, and two PhD dissertations. Thirteen invited presentations and five contributed presentations resulted from the research The students participated in outreach activities that brought over 300 high school students into our laboratories for demonstrations or hands-on experiments in addition to providing volunteer support for a statewide science and math competition for high school students.  In addition, the group mentored and provided laboratory assistance for one high school student who participated in a variety of math/science events including: 1) the Junior Science, Engineering, and Humanities Symposium; 2) the International Science &amp; Engineering Fair; 3) the Missouri Academy of Science competition; and 4) the International Environment, Energy, and the Environment Fair. Solid state reactions were used to directly synthesize zirconium carbide ceramics with varying Zr to C ratios by reacting zirconium hydride and carbon black.  Reactions went to completion at temperatures as low as 1300?C. The carbon vacancies in carbon-deficient zirconium carbide that had a carbon to zirconium ratio of 0.6 were found to be ordered after synthesis.  This was the first reported observation of ordered vacancies without long (i.e., hundreds of hours) annealing times at temperatures around 1000?C. The mechanical behavior of zirconium carbide ceramics was studied.  Ceramics with a mean grain size of around 3 ?m and a carbon to zirconium ratio of about 0.94 had a strength of about 360 MPa, fracture toughness of about 3 MPa?m1/2, hardness of about 17 GPa, and elastic modulus of about 400 GPa.  The strength of the ceramics was limited by the grain size of the ceramics. The initial oxidation behavior of zirconium carbide was studied at 800?C under ion irradiation.  Oxide inclusions were observed on the surface of the ceramics prior to the formation of a continuous oxide layer on the surface.   Zirconium carbide ceramics were found to be stable against radiation-induced amorphization at 800?C when exposed to 10 MeV gold ions.  Irradiation led to the formation of dislocation loops and increased the number of carbon vacancies. The Debye-Callaway model was used to calculate the lattice thermal conductivity of zirconium carbide ceramics with different carbon to zirconium ratios.  Thermal conductivity was predicted to decrease with increasing temperature and increasing numbers of carbon vacancies due to the scattering of lattice vibrations by carbon vacancies. The lattice thermal conductivities of zirconium carbide ceramics with varying amounts of Hf impurities were calculated using the Debye-Callaway model.  The presence of hafnium in the lattice was found to increase the scattering of lattice vibrations, which resulted in a decrease in lattice thermal conductivity.
